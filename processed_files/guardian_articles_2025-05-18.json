But there is a likeable lead turn from Mia Threapleton, an eerie visual and aural echo of her mother, Kate Winslet.The absurdly opaque and pointless “Phoenician Scheme” of the title is a plan by notorious plutocrat-entrepreneur Zsa-Zsa Korda (Benicio Del Toro) to dominate the economy of a fictional Middle Eastern nation with an interlocking series of mining transportation and fishing ventures, by using exploitative slave labour and moreover manipulating the agricultural market in such a way as to cause famine.Watch the trailer for The Phoenician Scheme.To this end, he has signed investment deals with various relatives and associates, including Marty (Jeffrey Wright), Cousin Hilda (Johansson), Marseille Bob (Mathieu Amalric) and his brother, Uncle Nubar, who may incidentally have murdered Zsa-Zsa’s wife and is played by Benedict Cumberbatch with a fierce beard and kohl eyeliner, like Rasputin in a silent film. His daughter is Liesl, a novitiate nun (Threapleton) and in true Michael Corleone style, it appears to be her destiny to take over the business despite not wanting to. The Norwegian family tutor Bjorn Lund (Michael Cera) is deeply in love with Liesl.But now the US government, in the form of Bobby-Kennedy-style buttoned-up apparatchik Mr Excaliber (Rupert Friend) tries to destroy the Scheme by driving up the cost of the “bashable rivets” on which the whole plan is predicated, and now Zsa-Zsa must close the profitability gap by touring around each of his investors to persuade them to accept less profit than they agreed … and so the films gives us a sketch of each wacky figure in turn. Meanwhile Zsa-Zsa, who keeps nearly dying in government-schemed plane crashes, has persistent visions of heavenly judgment from a God played by Bill Murray.View image in fullscreenAlexandre Desplat, Rupert Friend, Wes Anderson, Mia Threapleton, Jeffrey Wright, Benedict Cumberbatch, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Antonia Desplat and Bill Murray at the premiere of The Phoenician Scheme in Cannes.Photograph: Guillaume Horcajuelo/EPAIt rattles amiably along in that savant-child style that Anderson has made his own, but is in danger of becoming a mannerism. It is always entertaining, and delivered with the usual conviction and force but with less of the romantic extravagance than we’ve seen before, less of the childlike loneliness that has been detectable in his greatest movies.The Phoenician Scheme has premiered at theCannes film festivaland is released in cinemas on 23 MayExplore more on these topicsCannes film festivalWes AndersonBenicio del ToroMichael CeraFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Two decades on, creator Armando Iannucci and stars including Peter Capaldi and Rebecca Front lift the lid on its chaotic creationTim JonzeSun 18 May 2025 05.00 EDTShareTwenty years ago this month we were plunged straight into the middle of an omnishambles. It was a moment in time when petrified politicians lurched from crisis to crisis, scrambling desperately to control the narrative as their endless gaffes derailed even the vaguest attempts to change this country for the better. But am I talking about the tail-end of the Blair years or the televisual tour-de-force that was Armando Iannucci’s The Thick of It?It could be either. It could even be right now – such was the show’s prescient genius. This was a satire that didn’t just mimic the government’s calamities but seemed somehow to foresee them. Over its seven-year run,The Thick of Itcame up with farcical policies that the government went on to adopt (pet asbos, anyone?), coined new words in the dictionary (the aforementioned omnishambles) and, in Malcolm Tucker, created one of the great malevolent forces of British comedy. Here’s how they did it …Armando Iannucci, creatorThe idea for The Thick of It came after I’d done a 2004 documentary about Yes Minister for the BBC. I rewatched every episode and realised that all the topics it covered were still relevant: Europe, the threat of terrorism, austerity … everything! But I also noticed that the power dynamics had shifted. In the mid-Blair years it felt like it was less about the minister being thwarted by their senior civil servant and more about the ministers coming under constant pressure from No 10 and its enforcers to stick to the agenda.Adam Tandy, producerFor a while it was just called “Westminster-based Comedy”.IannucciI got in touch with politicos, ex-ministers, former civil servants, political journalists, insiders, outsiders. I said: “I’m not here for scandal, I want the boring stuff!” I wanted to know who gets in first, who’s last to leave, what is the relationship with civil servants, who would take a call from the Daily Mail? And the big revelation for me was how much the country was being run by 22-year-olds. Cabinet ministers were bringing in these junior spads because they thought they were so clever and bright but actually they were just confident. They’d never fixed a car or bought a house or really done anything complicated. Which is why you’d get a lot of these ideas that only sounded good on paper like “beacons of excellence” and “hospital clusters”.View image in fullscreenOffice politics … (from left) James Smith, Chris Addison, Rebecca Front, Peter Capaldi and Joanna Scanlan in The Thick of It.Photograph: BBCJamie Cairney, director of photographyArmando’s opening gambit was: this cannot be like a traditional BBC comedy. He wanted to forget all of the Hollywood drama conventions. One of his reference points was The News from Number 10, a documentary about Alastair Campbell which was really messy because everything’s running at a million miles an hour. And another reference point was [Danish drama] Festen, the first Dogme 95 film. He even said: “I want you to try and adhere to the Dogme 95 vows of chastity” – things like “cameras must be handheld” and “you can only use natural light”. Very anti-establishment stuff!IannucciBBC Four had a small budget, I think less than £100k. They said: what can you do with it? The constraints of the budget actually helped. It forced me to be quite experimental.Ian Martin, swearing consultantI was doing a satirical website with my brother Paul called martian.fm, and one of the things I wrote every week was this thing called Hansard Late. It was written in the style of the proceedings of the House of Commons, but it was also very sweary, like “I would respectfully ask the Honourable Gentleman to shove it up his cock” or whatever. I got an email saying: “Hi, I’m Armando Iannucci, your stuff makes me laugh, want to do some stuff for me?”. Obviously I thought it was a spoof!IannucciI wanted something that felt like you were eavesdropping on something you’re not meant to see. That’s how we came up with the title: you are really in the thick of it.Peter Capaldi, played director of communications Malcolm TuckerIt was hard to get any details about it. I asked if there was a script and they said no. That doesn’t give you very much confidence, does it? What are we supposed to do if you don’t have a script? Armando said just improvise. OK, well, I hated improvising because generally improvising means that the person with the biggest ego gets the biggest part. The only reason I hung on in there was because I really liked Armando’s previous work.Sarah Crowe, casting directorI’d worked with Armando before on Partridge and so whenever I’d see people try out for other things like theatre or commercials, I’d make a little note to say “Armando would like”. The cast came from all different places: kids’ television, theatre, standup … I’d even cast Alex McQueen, who played Julius, in an Utterly Butterly commercial! I’d seen Peter in a sitcom; it wasn’t a very good one, but I remember thinking he was quite Mandelson-esque.It felt guerrilla, like Armando was trying to get away with something the BBC wouldn’t necessarily have sanctionedJoanna ScanlanIannucciWe hadn’t written Malcolm as Scottish, we’d just written someone trying to keep his aggression in and then when he’s prodded too many times it bursts out. I actually had Peter down as a very gentle kind of soul, as he is in real life. But, as he tells it, he turned up in a bad mood that day.CapaldiI met Armando and Adam in a little studio in Soho. I was pissed off when I went in. It was not a good period for me. I’d gone to an audition atTelevisionCentre that morning for a little part and I knew everybody in the room. I thought, why am I going on tape with all of you people that I’ve worked with before?TandyWhen Peter came in, I think he was on the verge of giving up acting. We were running slightly behind schedule and Sarah Crowe, our casting director, actually had to pop out of the casting session to try to persuade him to stay.Sarah Crowe:Peter kept saying “I’m terrible at improvisation. I’m going to embarrass you, I’m going to embarrass myself. I had to really cajole him to come in. But he wasn’t alone in being reluctant. I remember someone actually walked out, saying “call me back in when you bother to write a script.”IannucciI said to Peter I will be a cabinet minister and your job is to persuade me to go … and then at some point just stop being nice. He did it and it was frightening. I thought: “There’s Malcolm Tucker”.CapaldiI remember very clearly the moment where I “got it”. The minister said: “Well, can I come back?” and I said, “It’s not fucking Coronation Street, you can’t come back!” I thought: Oh,that’swhat it is.IannucciPeter channelled Harvey Weinstein and lots of quite lippy LA agents. It wasn’t meant to be Alastair Campbell. It was more about this group I’d heard about called “the enforcers”. They would fan out from No 10 and go around the ministers saying: “This is the line, this is what you can say, this is not what you can’t say.”Joanna Scanlan, played director of communicationsTerri CoverleyAs I understand it, Armando invented the character of Terri after our audition. He hadn’t thought of her before so I must have talked myself into an entirely new character. Most of what I created as Terri was from when I worked at the Arts Council England. There were people there who’d move from job to job within the arts without ever understanding what it was they were trying to create.IannucciI saw Chris Langham do a docudrama about George Orwell and it was such a nuanced, humane, believable performance – but with this slightly hangdog feel to it. I thought he would be perfect to play the minister [Hugh Abbot].MartinArmando sent me the first three scripts for The Thick of It and said: “Look, just sprinkle your shit everywhere.” I didn’t know what to do. The writers were Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell and Tony Roche – massive, massive figures in the world of comedy. I just stared at the script for about half an hour thinking: “You can’t improve [Peep Show and future Succession creator] Jesse Armstrong!” Especially not if you’re some flailing wanker. The breakthrough was when I changed a line of Malcolm’s from “Don’t bother he’s fucking useless” to “He’s about as much use as a marzipan dildo”. I said: “Is that the sort of thing you’re after?” And Armando said: “Yes, very much so.”View image in fullscreenCommunication breakdown … James Smith, Joanna Scanlan and Chris Addison in series two of The Thick of It.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyScanlanI always got very frustrated because Terri had to have a blow-dry in the morning. And I’d be watching all these blokes [male members of the cast] descending on Armando as soon as he walked on the floor, like petitioning for their lines or ideas to go into something. I’d want to do the same but be there thinking: “I’m stuck in this fucking chair!” I felt really irritated by that.CairneyOn the first day of filming, Armando came over and said: “Move the camera more, make it more messy.” I thought I was being messy! So some of the messiness was deliberately overdoing it. It took us a few days to get there. Ben Wheeler, a brilliant DOP who was operating the other camera, turned to me and said: “Well, we’re never going to work again after this.”TandyI could only afford to give three and a half days to each episode. That’s not a long time to shoot half an hour. And so everything was shot in the old Guinness factory off the A40 in west London.ScanlanThe building was derelict. There was no funding. It felt guerrilla, like Armando was trying to get away with something the BBC wouldn’t necessarily have sanctioned.IannucciI wanted to try to lose all those traditional grammars of filming. So it was like a news crew turning up at a cabinet meeting. They’re not going to let you film it all again – it’s up to you to find the footage.CapaldiFilming is a very traditional process – you do a master shot and then the closeups. Armando threw all that out of the window. He said: “You come on to the set, it’s lit, you can go wherever you like, we don’t rehearse, off you go!” The cameras had to follow us. They didn’t have any preparation. They wouldn’t know where anyone was going. A scene would tend to go on for ages. When they said cut, you’d be exhausted. But it was a fabulous experience. I think all of us who worked on the show never looked back from that because that way of working was so radical.IannucciWe filmed it on the fly: handheld cameras, radio mics, no leads attached. I said to the cast: even if you leave the room we’re still recording you, we can hear what you’re saying, so you’re never off. There was nowhere to hide.TandyFor the first series I’d heard about a device that they’d been using in the States, this five-channel sound recording device. It meant we could mic up all of the actors and record all of the conversations happening in an office at the same time. That device was probably the thing that made The Thick of It possible.CairneyArmando would edit the sound first – the words were the most important thing for him. Then the editors would throw some pictures in and see what stuck with the audio. If you go through the episodes with a magnifying glass there’s some extremely bad continuity there. Hair will change, coffee cups will suddenly be refilled, but Armando didn’t give a shit about any of that. And nobody noticed which proved that it didn’t actually matter!We would float a policy and then literally the next week one or other of the parties would announce the same thingIan MartinCapaldiArmandowas great at finding these moments in the character’s eyes and faces that conveyed the chaos and the stress and delight of what they were going through.ScanlanBefore getting the role I had a Saturday job at an estate agency in Dulwich. My boss there told me one day that if I wanted to earn a bit of extra cash I could join these focus groups. She said: “You’re an actress, just say you are who they’re looking for! Say you’re a married housewife with three kids at Dulwich College or something.” So I went and did it and got my 50 quid. I mentioned the focus group to Armando. He was laughing and ended up turning the story into the second episode.MartinThere was this synchronous thing going on where we would float a policy and then literally the next week one or other of the parties would announce the same thing. I think how it happened was that the spads and the writers of The Thick of It were trying to work out the exact same problem: the money’s run out so what can we say that won’t cost anything but will sound good and keep us in the headlines?IannucciIn the first series there’s that scene in the back of a car where they’re trying to come up with policies on the way to make an announcement. We were actually in the back of the car going to the next location so I said: “Why don’t we just film you trying to come up with new policies?” Three of them which made it into the final cut actually became law within a couple of years! James Smith [who played Glenn Cullen] came up with “Why doesn’t everyone have to have a plastic bag of their own?” There was pet asbos, which I think happened quite soon after. And Chris Addison [who played Olly Reader] came up with the national spare room database, which became the bedroom tax. I remember James Purnell, who was culture secretary at the time, saying to me: “I’ve been in the back of that car”.TandyAfter the first two seasons, which were only three episodes each, Armando came to me with a plan to do an extended run. We got a commission to do 10 more episodes. And then it started to go wrong.View image in fullscreenGoing down? … Chris Addison, James Smith, Joanna Scanlan, Rebecca Front and Peter Capaldi.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIn November 2005, Chris Langham was arrested in connection with paying to access indecent and abusive images of children on the internet.Sixmonths later he was charged with15 counts of downloading indecent images of children.IannucciIt was difficult with Chris because he was charged but there wasn’t a trial. I decided to not make a judgment until there was a judgment. I didn’t realise the trial would take over 18 months. That’s why we did two one-hour specials where Hugh was referred to but wasn’t in it. But then he was found guilty so it became very clear.TandyWhen Chris was found guilty we had to recast. That’s when Rebecca joined us.Rebecca Front, played social affairs secretary Nicola MurrayThe first time I watched The Thick of It, I thought: “Blimey, this is good.” I didn’t know they were casting or even making another series. I had a conversation with Armando and he said they were going to do another and halfway through it I thought: “Hang on, is he offering me something?”IannucciNicola was the thing Malcolm hated the most, which was a minister who actually believed in something. Most of that third season was her ambitions being gradually whittled away.FrontThey didn’t know that much about my character at the beginning, just that they liked the idea of it being a woman and a backbencher who had been promoted beyond anyone’s expectations. And so one of the inspirations for Nicola Murray was very much me! Armando asked if I was politically minded and I told him that I had formed our sixth-form debating society. I actually did think of going into politics because I had really strong opinions about certain things like nuclear disarmament. Nicola is basically me if I’d had my life ruined by politics.It’s a stupid, macho, testosterone-fuelled environment. But these people wouldn’t last 10 seconds in an actual fightArmando IannucciIannucciThe show is a window into bullying culture. In several episodes Malcolm explicitly states that he is a bully. He pulls people apart. You wouldn’t be allowed to operate like that today. I’m sure it’s still highly charged and people shout at each other but I don’t think that single-minded, laser-like destruction of people’s personalities would be tolerated.FrontI’d never met Peter before. I knew him mainly as Malcolm Tucker. My first impression was of this charming, gentle man. I thought: “Oh, he’s absolutely gorgeous.” And then we did a little bit of improv and he immediately turned into Malcolm. It was terrifying. A total physical change.CapaldiDid I feel like I was scaring people? No, they all scaredme! They’d all been to Oxford and had been on telly for years. I was just a guy from bands in Glasgow who ate curries and drank lager.FrontIt’s weirdly easy to distance yourself from the script. You think: “They’re not saying that aboutme, they’re talking about Nicola.” However, I do remember improvising in a rehearsal room and Peter saying: “What are those fucking boots, you’re not a fucking cowgirl!” and me thinking, “Those are my actual boots, I only bought them last week!”IannucciDid we ever overstep the line? Actors came into it knowing that they were going to be in line for lots of visual takedowns. But we would check in case they thought: “No I don’t want someone saying that about me on national television.” Chris [Addison] was described as looking like a Quentin Blake cartoon … but I think he rather liked that one.FrontIt was easy to act terrified and cowed but nobody wants to see a woman being terrified by a bully. So I thought let’s see what happens if I stand up to Malcolm, and I think immediately it started to be funnier because it was no longer just Peter shouting at somebody. You want at least one Tuckering per episode, but that can’t be the whole relationship. So Nicola ends up constantly doing things that she knows will piss him off.CapaldiAll Malcolm’s doing is his job, you know? The idea that he’s monstrous … he’s horrible topeople, but he’s moving the government’s agenda forward.View image in fullscreenMad for it … Peter Capaldi and Chris Addison in series two of The Thick of It.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyFrontI hope people can sympathise with Nicola because she really gets trampled by it. She goes in with all guns blazing, but really by the end of her first episode she’s already been chewed up and spat out.IannucciA lot of junior spads see Malcolm as an ideal to aim for. But if you analyse any episode it’s always: something small happens that’s bad, then Malcolm comes in, makes it worse, and then leaves blaming everyone else. So how is he good in any way? It’s like when Dominic Cummings came in. People said he’s an amazing communicator and an amazing strategist … but the Covid crisis had no strategy and terrible communication.MartinSome of the lines you wouldn’t do now. They’re a tiny bit misogynistic and tiny bit homophobic. I was always a bit uncomfortable with that stuff.IannucciIt’s a stupid, macho, testosterone-fuelled environment, slightly thuggish. But it’s all verbal. These people wouldn’t last 10 seconds in an actual fight. They probably don’t even go to the gym because they haven’t got time. They just drink lots of coffee from 5am and shout … it’s a stupid and frankly inefficient way of working. And then when they all leave politics they all talk about mental health and do lots of charity work in big thick jumpers!ScanlanAt the beginning, before Rebecca came in, I was the only woman. I wouldn’t say I was frightened, but they were all a foot taller than me. I was on my own with these tall men and thinking: “How do I get heard in this world?” It did get quite aggressive and braying with that masculine energy. One day it went too far. People were throwing insults around that you just wouldn’t do in an office. Armando stopped the improvisation and said: “That’s not truthful.” He was brilliant like that.FrontOne of Armando’s great gifts is that he can push things a very long way and yet stay just the right side of it. It comes, I think, from him having a very strong moral compass. The joke always comes from the right direction.MartinI’ve always felt a bit sorry for Terri. I even remember apologising to Jo at one point. She was the butt of so many jokes. She was roundly criticised by everybody right from the very first episode until the very last one she appeared in. It was always “she’s fucking useless, I hate her” and everything. And yet she was no more incompetent than the people complaining about her.TandyI’d seen some Ofcom research that said that people were less bothered by swearing now than they had been. So I thought, well, it’s a digital channel, we’ll probably get away with it. We actually got very few complaints about language. So I’m glad I held my nerve.CapaldiI think because I’m from Glasgow the swearing came very naturally. Sometimes a “fucking” in the middle of a sentence can propel it forward with a new energy. But often I would swear because I couldn’t remember my lines. It would take a fucking minute or two for me to fucking remember the line that I fucking forgot. So I would be searching desperately for the line … and then it would fucking arrive!MartinI think the BBC quite liked the mythology of me being hired as a “swearing consultant”. The idea that they’d solemnly brought in this kind of craftsman of the swear. It did rankle with everybody else a little bit because they all did excellent swears, too.TandyThere was one occasion where there was a particular swear that was judged to be offensive and we were asked to make an edit quite late in the day. I think it might have been the word “gash”, which was replaced with the word “cave”. That’s sort of worse, isn’t it?MartinGreat swearing is all about getting the balance right. It’s no different to writing poetry, a novel or a stupid haiku. All the lines I loved were by other people. I loved “Tinker Tailor Soldier cunt” – that was a Simon Blackwell line.Arguably The Thick of It played a role in the de-escalation of respect for politiciansJoanna ScanlanTandySometimes it was awful. There was one episode where we had I think well over 100 uses of just the F word. That’s not including the other swearwords. But then they said: “Do you think you could take what you do with The Thick of It and turn it into a feature film?” We thought about it for about, I don’t know, 15 seconds. And then In the Loop came together within the next 18 months, which is very quickly for a feature film.IannucciIn the Loop made sense because The Thick of It arose after the invasion of Iraq, where everyone across the board at the time was saying: “This will be an almighty mistake,” and yet it went ahead anyway. I was intrigued as to why it is that someone can do that and get away with it and not be stopped, even though we’re in a democracy with an opposition and a kind of shared responsibility. So what’s happened that has meant No 10 can drive through anything it wants?ScanlanI loved our trip down to Eastbourne for the party conference in series three. That was my most enjoyable day. Which is ridiculous because I’m basically just saying I like going on holiday, which is very much what Terri would say.FrontMy favourite moment? I liked it when Nicola has a breakdown during the party conference. It was fun to film, actually. We established that, like me, she is prone to panic attacks … so it felt entirely honest that she would jump up and down on the cushions like that. I thought: “I know if I do this it will make Armando laugh.”TandyI remember when we did the inquiry episode, Armando and I basically arranged it so that only the people on the panel had the full script. They didn’t even get to meet the cast regulars, who were appearing as witnesses, beforehand.CapaldiI love the idea of playing husks. Malcolm loved his job, he was addicted to it. But I think when it’s all over and he’s in the back of the car after leaving the police station, he’s relieved that the shit is over. His last words to the press are “It doesn’t matter” … because it doesn’t matter! The world continues stumbling to oblivion irrespective of what he thinks.CairneyThat whole final scene was emotional to shoot. We got a closeup on Peter’s face and drove around for about 15 minutes thinking this would be an amazing shot to run really long. And in true Thick of It style, Armando cut it after about five seconds: “Malcolm Tucker’s done. Let’s move on.”View image in fullscreenState of play … Pearce Quigley and Peter Capaldi in series three of The Thick of It.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyTandyTo begin with, politicians were quite cagey about the show. Whenever you met them they would say: “Oh I don’t watch that thing,” but they absolutely did – they were able to quote you huge chunks of it!IannucciEd Miliband used the word “omnishambles” and David Cameron said the opposition were like “an episode of The Thick of It”. I thought: if politicians are now embracing this then it’s time for something else to start challenging them back.TandyI think it did have an effect on the Westminster bubble. I don’t know if it was a very good one, though, because I think it sort of normalised slightly loutish behaviour.IannucciDid it change anything? I don’t know. If it awoke people into thinking: “How can we change things?” then that would be a good thing. But 20 years on, it hasn’t exactly led to a better politics, has it?ScanlanIt was the last gasp of a time when there was still some respect for politicians. Arguably The Thick of It played a role in the de-escalation of respect for politicians.CroweIt was a defining career moment for some people and a reinvention for others.CapaldiAfter The Thick of It I realised that my voice had become more sinister. It got a bit lower, a bit stranger.MartinI’d had a miserable 90s, chugging along doing bits and bobs as a musician and journalist. The Thick of It absolutely saved me. It couldn’t work now. There’s no shame any more, is there? I mean, in the early episodes you had characters saying: “For God’s sake, please don’t tell me you’ve lied to a committee!” The idea that someone’s career could be at stake over a lie they told to parliament has no traction now. People do it all the time. Blatantly.IannucciHas it stood the test of time? I’ve never gone back and watched it. I’ve had people message over the years saying we should make a Brexit one or a coronavirus one … but we never did things around specific incidents.

Missing fresh air and nature? Five people who ditched their desks reveal the truth about their new livesDonna FergusonSun 18 May 2025 07.00 EDTShareSteve Kell, 59, countryside ranger,Warwickshire Country ParksI always loved being in nature. But I didn’t know what I wanted to do when I was 18, so I got a job at a high-street bank. My grandfather was made up – he was convinced I was going to be the governor of the Bank of England. But over the years I became disenchanted. Then, in my early 30s, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer and had to take months off work. I couldn’t help thinking about how finite life is. I decided I wanted to do something I really enjoyed.My partner, Rachael – now my wife – supported me going back to college full-time for two years, so I could get a national diploma in countryside management. I did a placement where I work now, in Kingsbury Water Park, a site of more than 240 hectares (600 acres) owned by Warwickshire council. Two days after my placement ended, a ranger resigned and I was hired to do some of their work. I’ve now been a countryside ranger for 20 years.If I’m on an early shift, my work starts at 7.15am. I’ll open the park and do a site check – I usually walk between two and four miles every day. Sometimes I’ll see muntjac deer on my rounds. When the school groups turn up, I’ll go into the woodlands or a field and do pond-dipping or minibeasting to teach the children about the insects that live in those habitats.Our site is quite close to central Birmingham, and I get such a buzz from showing people the countryside and encouraging them to appreciate their local green spaces. I love seeing the sheer delight of the children when they discover the wildlife here, and passing on my knowledge to them.I don’t care whether it’s raining, snowing or sunny: I feel a massive amount of freedom just being outside, breathing fresh air, instead of being stuck inside an air-conditioned office. On a physical level, I do get tired – but I’m a lot fitter than I would be if I worked indoors at my age andI don’t feel the stresses I did in my previous job. Instead I feel happier and more fulfilled. Although I’ve only recently surpassed the salary I used to earn in banking, my job pays the bills and that’s all I want financially. Rachael, who earns more than me and works in an office, is fully supportive. She’s glad I made the switch to working outdoors because of the benefits to my health and wellbeing. We’ve always been comfortable, financially, while raising our son, who is now 18: my career choice has not affected our lifestyle choices.Rather than making profit for a company, I’m improving the world we live in and passing on my love of the outdoors to others. Walking around this park, with the wind on my face, surrounded by wildlife, I feel peace of mind – and joy.‘The day after I watched that sunset, I resigned’Angela Musk, 31,community outreach officer,Ramblers ScotlandView image in fullscreenAngela Musk: ‘I come home feeling energised.’Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianI can vividly remember the moment I decided to leave my job as a prison officer. It was two years ago and I was out walking my dog near home in South Queensferry, a village west of Edinburgh. Standing at the top of a field, watching the sunset over the Pentland Hills, I realised that when I’m outdoors, my thoughts are free. I have space to breathe, I feel at peace.I’d been considering leaving the Prison Service for a long time. I was struggling with arriving at and leaving work in the dark in winter – many windows are misted up for security reasons, and I spent most of the day indoors. Prisons can be tough places to work. I didn’t feel able to contribute what I wanted to.After university, I’d had an internship as an outdoor instructor and was working toward my mountain leader qualifications. I loved it. But as a woman, I’d questioned whether I belonged outdoors, leading people up mountains. I’d felt pressure to get a secure job with a clear career progression.The day after I watched that sunset, I resigned. That same day, I saw Ramblers Scotland was hiring a community outreach officer. The role involves working with refugees, asylum seekers and people from global majority communities to create walking programmes and teach outdoor skills and navigation, so that everyone feels comfortable going out walking by themselves in Scotland.I felt so lucky the day I got the job. Without needing to take a pay cut, I get to work outdoors for a living and turn the right to roam the Scottish countryside into a reality for everyone. I use the skills I learned in the Prison Service, about how to approach people from all types of backgrounds, and I support them to get outdoors in Scotland, often for the first time. Recently, I’ve been developing a new programme to teach women from diverse backgrounds to lead within their own communities.A typical summer’s day begins with me packing a rucksack with everything I need as a group leader – emergency shelter, first aid kit, spare waterproofs and sugary snacks. Then I’ll head to the setting-off point to meet the people I’m leading that day. Often, on the walk they’ll teach me about the plants, trees or mountains in their homeland. Away from the pressures of their daily lives, they express so much enthusiasm and curiosity about nature – and support for each other.Many refugees I work with fear being where they’re not allowed to be. It can be hard for them to feel as if they belong. But I have learned that the outdoors is a space for everybody. I come home feeling energised, not only because I have connected to nature, but because out there, in nature, I have connected to other people. And it feels amazing.‘It was like I woke up’Michelle Burton, 59, former therapeutic coordinator, Jamie’s Farm, MonmouthView image in fullscreenMichelle Burton: ‘It’s made me feel empowered.’Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianI first came to the farm for a week as part of a course I was helping to facilitate for young unemployed people. I had previously been a family worker in Luton, helping to engage parents in their children’s learning, then I was a coordinator for family workers. The idea here was that the young people would have a week away on the farm, where they would learn new skills, and I would provide pastoral support.When I first arrived, I was petrified of animals and fearful of bugs. I’d worked indoors ever since I’d got my first job 37 years earlier, at 16. I didn’t like getting mucky and the idea of working outdoors, on a farm, had never crossed my mind. But I really enjoyed myself and I saw the transformation in the young people that week. I thought: there’s something freeing about being in nature. It calms and encourages people to work and support each other. I saw the change in those young people – and that changed me.We ran the course again, and this time I was more confident with the animals. I realised I liked the values of the staff and the positive way the young people were viewed, praised and given a voice.The third time I went, it all sat so well with me that I decided I wanted to work there. Instead of feeling scared when I worked with animals, I felt renewed. I remember moving some sheep with a young person, looking down at a beautiful view of the Wye valley and thinking: this is the place for you; this is what you must do with your life. It was like I woke up.Back in Luton, I felt such a longing to be in the countryside that my daughter bought me two hens. I asked the Jamie’s Farm team to let me know if a job came up and when it did, a year later, I got it. I was 55.Until I retired earlier this year, I worked as a therapeutic coordinator for children who came to the farm for residential stays. While they carried out jobs in groups, from working with animals to gardening and farm maintenance, I would talk to an individual child while we walked, fed the lambs or planted hedgerows. We would chat about their highlights and how they were feeling, or sometimes we’d just sit together and listen to the birds. In the evenings, we’d play games or sit round a fire, looking at the stars.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I used to feel afraid of so many different aspects of the outdoors, but I stepped up and that has given me courage in other areas of my life. It’s made me feel empowered. Physically, mentally and emotionally, I feel fitter and stronger. Working in nature has been very grounding for me and, as the only Black person on the farm, I gave my colleagues insights about how best to support some of the young people we worked with. I saw the impact I was having and found that very inspiring. I feel I’ve left a positive legacy.‘I love the fact that no day is the same’Jay Rathod, 31, park officer, St James’s Park, LondonView image in fullscreenJay Rathod: ‘A recent highlight was feeding the pelicans.’Photograph: Mark Chilvers/The GuardianI was sitting on a beach on holiday the day I decided I wanted to work outside. For the previous seven years, I’d worked for a mobile phone company. After the pandemic shut down the store I managed, I began working in merchandising, remotely. I felt stuck at home, in meetings and behind screens all day, working out how to sell phones that would eventually get thrown away. I felt isolated and my achievements didn’t feel meaningful. I also wanted to reduce my carbon footprint and give back to the environment. I wanted to plant something that would outgrow me.So I quit my office job to do a two-year paid apprenticeship in horticulture and landscaping. That’s quite an unusual decision for someone from my ethnic background and when I told my mother, she warned me my hands would get dirty. I asked what was wrong with that, given my ancestors were farmers. She was worried I’d earn less and get wet, burnt or injured.The apprenticeship did initially mean a drop in salary, but I was so passionate about it that I finished my course early and applied for my current job at St James’s Park while I was still doing my final assessment. Now, I earn the same as I did before.I love the fact that no day is the same. Primarily, I carry out general landscape maintenance of the park and its irrigation system, look out for any criminal damage and make sure the site is safe for the public. But I also liaise with the police, cafe owners and contractors, and support the conservators who restore historic monuments, the head gardener and the wildlife officer – a recent highlight was feeding the pelicans. I work with the army and the palace on prestigious events such as trooping the colour and the changing of the guard – which makes my mother very happy – and I assist the volunteer gardeners.I average 17,000 to 20,000 steps a day, compared with 3,000 when I worked at home. So I’m fitter and healthier – and happier, too, because I know I’m giving back to nature and people benefit from what I do. I love seeing visitors taking photographs of the flowers in bloom or spotting a bird on a tree I planted and knowing I helped make this happen. Physically, I feel exhausted at the end of the day. But mentally and emotionally, I feel stimulated and satisfied, and it’s easier to relax; I’m not anxious and I sleep better.People complain about working in all weathers, but in the rain I just wear a coat, and if it’s cold I wear more layers. There’s nothing I miss about working indoors.‘I’ve never not enjoyed a day in this job’Mandy Abbott, 60, head of falconry, Swinton Estate, North YorkshireView image in fullscreenMandy Abbott: ‘It’s such a good feeling, this bond I have with them.’Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianBefore the pandemic, I’d spent 30 years cooking in the kitchens of the Swinton Estate, the ancestral seat of the Earl of Swinton, 12 hours a day, four orfive days a week. At times, like any kitchen, it could be stressful and with no windows, it could get hot and stuffy.During lockdown, I started thinking about working outdoors. My daughter – who had got interested in birds when she was 11 – had, at 18, set up a birds of prey centre on the 8,000-hectare (20,000-acre) estate. After working at a local falconry centre and getting a qualification in zoo management, she’d approached the earl and asked if she could set up her own centre in the grounds. The estate takes a commission on bookings, but it’s her business. In my spare time she trained me, so I could help if she was short-staffed.When Covid hit, I realised I didn’t really have a life. I was always working. Living on a privately owned estate, I had vast grounds to enjoy during lockdown. The birds of prey centre was closed, but I carried on flying the birds to help my daughter out. Otherwise, without their routine, they would have rewilded themselves. Watching them enjoying their freedom made me forget about the scary time we were living in. When they are flying, I feel they are so wild – yet they come to me willingly because I’ve trained them. It’s such a good feeling, this bond I have with them.When lockdown ended, I became head of falconry at the centre. My daughter is my boss, which should be quite difficult, but has worked out fine.Every day, I’ll check on the birds for signs of illness, clean out their aviaries and get the equipment ready. But my main job is to help other people experience the bond I now have with the birds. We’ve got a kestrel, a falcon, an eagle and many different varieties of owls. Quite a few old ladies who visit have loved owls all their lives – when owls fly to their hands, they break down in tears. Sometimes, children tell me it’s the most exciting thing they’ve ever done. I know I’m giving people an experience they will never forget.I don’t think I’ve ever not enjoyed a day at work since I took this job. I don’t earn as much as I used to, but I’m home for my family more and we manage. Physically, I’m probably more tired, but I sleep really well and never lie awake worrying about work.I would never have dreamed of doing this job if it hadn’t been for my daughter. I have her to thank for showing me what I am capable of – and how much I love working outdoorsExplore more on these topicsLife and styleWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet, on reflection, I don’t think we should be surprised. The way we evolved predisposes us to place trust in those who often deserve it least – in a sense, hardwiring us to support the most machiavellian among us and to propel them into power. This seems like an intractable problem. But it’s what we do in the face of that knowledge that matters.Recent work in anthropology and primatology shows how this wiring evolved. Our ancient ancestors, like most primates today, lived in groups dominated by violent and aggressive alpha males. Yet over the course of our biological and cultural evolution, unlike our primate cousins, we learned to work together to counter those bullyboys, organising to diminish their influence.This is sometimes seen as a process ofself-domestication– a hypothesis with roots in the writings of Charles Darwin. Today, there’s strong evidence to support this view: not only do we cooperate to a broader extent than any known species, but even our faces – which are flatter and lack the prominent brow ridges associated with higher testosterone levels – suggest a reduced tendency towards aggression than that seen in our closest genetic relatives, such as chimpanzees.Where we see brute power combined with ignorance, we can throw our support behind knowledge, peaceful protest and educationThere’s another set of features that researchers todayargueevolved as we started to cooperate more widely. They’re known as learning biases. Work in anthropology and psychology shows convincingly that humans tend to believe what others around them believe, especially those they see as successful. These are known as conformity and prestige biases respectively – and can have strong effects on how we perceive information. The psychologist Solomon Asch demonstrated this in some classic experimentalworkon visual judgment: when asked to compare lines on a piece of card, participants agreed that a short line was the same length as a longer one once they’d heard other people in the group say it was.These biases probably evolved to help us coordinate more effectively, as we would have needed to in order to hunt big game, for example. This might explain why, in both preindustrial and modern societies, adolescents tend toemulatethe behaviour of the most athletic people, whether that athleticism is expressed in hunting or sports.Yet those same biases, combined with our trusting natures, leave us vulnerable to exploitation by autocratic leaders. I believe that having mostly eliminated overt aggression, ancient societies ended up inadvertently improving the chances of individuals who were skilled at manipulating others in subtler ways. Some people call this traitproactive aggression, others,machiavellian intelligence, or the ability and inclination to dominate not with violence, but via social manoeuvring and deceit. We accidentally favoured, and continue to favour, those who pretend to cooperate until they don’t need to pretend any more – what you might call our “invisible rivals”.Machiavellian people are particularly effective at using our biases against us. Influencers such as Andrew Tate, who featured as a popular source of information in the Channel 4 survey, are adept at using their success and popularity to sell their ideas to their followers, carefully avoiding any balancing viewpoints. And it’s the young, the impressionable and perhaps those most unhappy with themselves who are more likely to trust them.Strongmen such asDonald Trumpwork in a similar way. They use deceit and manipulation to create total trust in their abilities, and then use that trust to propel themselves into positions of power – often then betraying the people that supported their bids, as Trump has done multiple times.Today’s authoritarian leaders have not only these age-old tools at their disposal, but vast networks for deploying their information-based agendas. Trump’s recent attacks on the worlds of science and education, promoted on Truth Social, his own social media platform, and boosted by his acolyte Elon Musk, are a case in point. Despite the novel means of dissemination, such actions are just the latest sallies in a long history of wars over trust and belief. When the Bolsheviks took power in Russia, for example, they deemed certain areas of scientific study “bourgeois” and substituted them for ideologically acceptable ones.Still, we can be optimistic that timeless problems are amenable to timeless solutions. Our ancestors found ways to balance the best elements of human nature against the worst – and in doing so to counter the influence of our inbuilt biases. The first step towards that is to recognise that we have a proclivity for blindly following others and trusting success, to share this insight and to support our fellow citizens’ capacity to think both critically and ethically.Where we see authoritarians taking aim at knowledge-creating institutions – whether universities such as Harvard or bodies such as theNational Museum of African American History and Culturethat teach us about our past mistakes – we must move to protect them, both with our voices and our financial resources. Where we see brute power combined with ignorance, we can throw our support behind knowledge, peaceful protest and education.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

That way, we inoculate ourselves afresh against our natural tendency to trust the untrustworthy, carrying that wisdom forward into the future so that we’re better able to stymie the autocrats who seek to close our minds.Jonathan R Goodman is a social scientist and the author ofInvisible Rivals (Yale).Further readingAutocracy, Incby Anne Applebaum (Allen Lane, £20)How Democracies Dieby Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt (£10.99, Penguin)Wired for Cultureby Mark Pagel (Penguin, £25)Explore more on these topicsEvolutionThe big ideaBiologyDonald TrumpTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But soon she was losing touch with reality – and panicking about what she might be doing to her two young sonsLeah HarperSun 18 May 2025 06.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 06.32 EDTShareMary Ann Kenny first met her husband in 2000, at a conference in Dundee. “It was acoup de foudre– ‘a bolt of lightning’,” the 60-year-old languages lecturer says with a smile. “We had finally found what had taken both of us a very long time to find.”John was from Chester, Kenny was from Dublin, and the couple had a long-distance relationship until he moved to Ireland to live with her in 2008. “We had our two small kids, our lovely house, our friends; it just seemed like we had all our ducks in a row. It had taken a long time to get there – we had our kids a little bit later in life – but I felt that everything was perfect. Then John left my life just as suddenly as he entered it; one day he was there, then he was gone.”In April 2015, three days after her 50th birthday party, Kenny came out of a work meeting to find she had a series of missed calls. She rang John’s phone and it was answered by a garda (police officer) who told her to come to the hospital and bring somebody with her.“I knew, I just knew immediately – and I said to my colleague: something has happened to John; I think he’s dead.”John had collapsed and died, age 60, from undiagnosed cardiovascular disease, while out jogging. “He was a very fit, healthy, clean-living man,” says Kenny. “My entire life came to a stop. Everything I had done prior to that – working, eating, drinking, socialising, enjoying myself – it all just ground to a halt. It was absolutely devastating.”Plunged into grief, Kenny tried desperately to maintain a sense of normality for her young children. But over the following months, things were to get even worse.View image in fullscreenMary Ann Kenny, her husband John and their children Owen and Gareth in January 2015.Photograph: Courtesy of Mary Ann KennyKenny went to see a therapist after John’s death – her first experience of therapy, having had no history of mental illness. “He said, your sadness, your distress, is completely within the norm and what’s to be expected – even though, at the time, I was impatient to start to feel a bit better,” she says. Her GP prescribed sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, to help combat symptoms of anxiety and depression.Kenny was reluctant to take the medication. “I waited for more than 24 hours before starting the drug, agonising over whether it was advisable at all, and fearing an adverse reaction,” she writes in her book, The Episode. “Before going to bed on the evening of Sunday, 2 August, I took the prescribed dose for the first time. Some hours later, I awoke in a state of severe agitation. I was drenched in sweat, weak with nausea, and my legs and arms were prickling all over. I spent hours tossing in bed, gripped by terror over what was happening to me.”Just as she had feared, Kenny appeared to be experiencing a rare but severe reaction. She only ever took three doses but the burning sensation that spread throughout her body continued for weeks, preventing her from eating, sleeping or “doing practically anything beyond the absolute necessities”.She returned to the doctor and “the response I was given was, by and large, that this was a psychiatric problem. You need either a different medication, or you need more.” A psychiatrist prescribed clonazepam for her anxiety and venlafaxine, a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, for her depression, and referred her to the mental health service, where she started attending a day centre that offered group therapy, art therapy and drama and mental health workshops. It was 2016 before she saw her original therapist again, and then only for one session.It was at this point that Kenny began to tip into paranoia. She developed a mistrust of authority figures, from the nurse who assessed her at the day centre to her children’s school principal who called her to check in. Everyone, she began to believe, had an ulterior motive.I was 19 and on the trip of a lifetime – then I drank a cocktail laced with methanolRead more“I thought they suspected me of illicit drug use and addiction,” she says. “My thoughts were getting ahead of reality – but reality itself was very precarious for me at that time.”Kenny became increasingly worried that the authorities would accuse her of being unfit to parent her children, and that they would be removed from her care. She herself was one of five siblings, but the others had all moved abroad, and their mother was in her 90s; Kenny hired a nanny and friends helped out, but childcare remained a struggle.Her mental state began to spiral, and she developed a dark and specific delusion: “Out of the blue, this idea got into my head: the children are behaving differently and badly, and something has happened to them to do with the medication, and it’s my fault.”She became haunted by the idea that she had accidentally poisoned her children – and then that she had poisoned them deliberately. “They were aged eight and six at the time, they weren’t crawling around like babies trying to swallow everything – but it was almost like I thought they could. Then I started thinking, well, I left the bag [of pills] lying around somewhere, and then, I must have done it by accident, perhaps while cooking? I would go through it over and over again, trying to figure it out; it tortured me.”In her book, she describes how she became “tormented by an image of my evil self standing over the cooker on Sunday evening, pouring pills into the simmering food with the depraved intention of causing harm.”View image in fullscreen‘If it hadn’t happened to me, I wouldn’t believe it’ … Mary Ann Kenny.Photograph: Bríd O’Donovan/The GuardianKenny continued to attend daily group therapy sessions, keen to maintain the impression of normality in front of medical professionals, while also desperate to confess her imagined crime. Eventually, she blurted it out. “I remember the nurse’s worried expression,” she says in The Episode. “She wrote in her notes that I held all my beliefs ‘with great conviction’. It might be more accurate to say that the beliefs held me in their steely grip.”Kenny was prescribed antipsychotic medication and admitted to a psychiatric hospital a few days later. She didn’t resist, despite disagreeing with the diagnosis of psychosis. “I was at the end of my tether and in some ways I was relieved to just hand myself over to other people, to surrender.”During her time in hospital, Kenny says she spent 80% of her days “just lying on my bed, ruminating, staring at the ceiling, looking out the window, feeling a very strong sense of dread in my body. Of course I thought about John and the loss, but I couldn’t focus on it, because I believed I had destroyed my children’s brains. I couldn’t think of anything else.”She was discharged after two weeks and encouraged to start attending the day centre again, which she did for another four weeks. Initially, she appeared to have improved – she’d been eating and sleeping much more while in hospital – but soon she lost weight again and became withdrawn.“I started to talk to the mental health professionals about my delusional belief, and tell them that I still believed it, I had always believed it, I never stopped believing it,” she says. “I suppose things reached a crisis point.”In October, a social worker informed Kenny that she would be making a child-protection referral toTusla, the child and family agency. After she missed one of the day centre sessions, a doctor and nurse arrived at her home and insisted she re-admit herself, voluntarily, to hospital (throughout her illness, she was never officially sectioned).Kenny has since obtained her medical records. The admission summary for her return states that she “presented as ‘guarded’ during the admission process” and was “unhappy with having to come back to hospital”. There are also references to her having “blunted affect”, “poor eye contact” and “low rate and tone of speech”.View image in fullscreenKenny with her sons Owen and Gareth in 2021.Photograph: Courtesy of Mary Ann KennyA week later, Kenny spotted that the door to her ward was open, and walked out. She planned to return home and resume childcare, but on finding her house empty called a friend in the hope of locating the children. The friend, who had indeed been watching her kids, promptly returned her to the hospital, where she was transferred to a high-security ward and watched by a member of the nursing staff 24 hours a day – “even when I went to the bathroom”.“I felt mortified that I had left the hospital and come back,” she says. “I just could not believe how much trouble I had caused. My symptoms got worse and I believed I was living in a parallel world. I became utterly zoned out, and still, during that time, a lot of questions were being put to me about harm” – specifically whether she’d had any thoughts of harming herself or others, which she denied. Rather than discuss the enduring impact of her loss, or her apparent reaction to the medication, Kenny says she was regularly asked to rate how she was feeling on a scale of one to 10, and whether she’d experienced thoughts of suicide – “all things that would have been on [doctors’] checklists and that were never tailored to the reality of my distressing lived experience”.The questioning continued and in the end, she says, she just “threw in the towel”. She “confessed to everything”, feeling almost euphoric at finally being able to give the answers she felt the medical professionals had been waiting to hear.“I just said: fine, you’re right, I’m wrong. That was the tone of it. I think a narrative came into existence: that I had always, actually, had thoughts of suicide, homicide, infanticide. And it had very, very serious repercussions for me.”Kenny quickly came to regret her false admission, calling it disastrous. “I wasn’t allowed to see my children for four weeks.” She tried to retract her statement but felt there wasn’t any “willingness to listen” – the narrative seemed to be set in stone.Her treatment continued, with her medication altered. By November she was taking two antipsychotics, two antidepressants and a sleeping tablet, on top of the clonazepam she had been prescribed for anxiety. The delusions began to wane – giving way to a more physical ailment: severe constipation. The condition had progressed to such a stage that she was finding it difficult to walk, and would rush to the bathroom as many as 20 times a day. This was paired with a difficulty in passing urine, eventually diagnosed as a urinary tract infection. Reluctant to reveal the extent of the problem to medical professionals, she would wash her underwear secretly in the sink in her room.More than anything, I was feeling anger over the powerlessness and indignities of my hospital experienceAs Kenny’s mental health continued to improve, she was granted visits with her children, first in the hospital, then at home. Before being discharged, however, she was required to attend a child protection conference, where the children were determined to be at ongoing risk of significant harm. Although this had little material impact on Kenny and her family, she was “devastated” that her children’s names were now on an at-risk register, where they would remain until they turned 18.She was discharged in December 2015, on condition that she get regular visits from numerous health professionals, and spent Christmas Day with her children, her mother and her older sister, who was visiting from New Zealand.“It’s extraordinary how fast I recovered,” says Kenny. By January 2016 she was able to return to work full-time. Her physical symptoms improved too, and her medication was gradually reduced. “After I came off antidepressants, I began to feel things more intensely, and it wasn’t just sadness over John’s death that I was noticing,” she writes. “More than anything, what I was feeling was anger over the powerlessness and indignities of my hospital experience two years previously.”View image in fullscreenNew beginnings … Kenny celebrates her birthday with her sons in 2023.Photograph: Courtesy of Mary Ann KennyIn time, and with ongoing therapy, Kenny was able to reflect on her experience more clearly. She also began reading psychology and grief literature – both academic publications and personal memoirs – before enrolling for a BSc in psychology in 2018. She came to view what happened to her as a series of three traumatic events: the trauma of losing her husband, then the trauma of losing her mind – and lastly, the trauma of her psychiatric treatment.“There was no sense even from [the mental health service] that this was an isolated episode,” says Kenny. “There was never a prognosis which said I was going to get better.” She spent time ruminating on what could have been done better: “What if I hadn’t been discharged [from psychiatric hospital] the first time?” she asks in the book. “What if anyone had ever talked to me properly about losing John, or about my adverse physical reaction to the sertraline medication, or about the unwarranted feelings of guilt, or about why I said the things I said …”Retelling her ordeal was painful, but she was driven by a desire to share what she now understands about psychiatric careOn the advice of a psychiatrist, she composed a five-page letter outlining her concerns about the care she had received during her illness, and was invited to discuss them in a meeting with her social worker, which she found helpful. Mid-2019, about nine months after her final discharge from the mental health service, she received her medical records – at which point she had already embarked on writing her book. Retelling her ordeal was painful at first, but she was driven by a desire to share what she now understands about the world of psychiatric care, about which so many of us know very little. “If it hadn’t happened to me, I wouldn’t believe it,” she says.Her sons, she writes, appear to have “emerged relatively unscathed from the ordeal of being separated from me only a few short months after the loss of their father” – something that she credits to the support she received from friends and her mother, who died in 2020. Her first therapist also encouraged Kenny to try to view the loss of her husband as an opportunity to live her life in a way that she might not have otherwise been able to. Today, she says, “it is true that I live my life at a much faster pace than I would have done had John still been around. We go away more – it’s a more active life.”Having reconciled herself with the events of 2015, she views her story as one of resilience, of how she came to be stronger, more confident and even happier than she had been before she became unwell.“My experience of those weeks was punishing and traumatising,” she writes. “But at least I survived … Once I was able to trust that I was mentally and physically well again, I was overcome with joy at being alive.”The Episode by Mary Ann Kenny (£18.99) is published by Penguin Sandycove.Explore more on these topicsBereavementHealth & wellbeingAnxietymental health challengesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Biden and his family are considering options for treatment.“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,” his office said. “The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.”Prostate cancers are given a score called a Gleason score that measures, on a scale of one to 10, how the cancerous cells look compared with normal cells. Biden’s office said his score was nine, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive.When prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it often spreads to the bones. Metastasised cancer is much harder to treat than localised cancer because it can be hard for drugs to reach all the tumours and completely root out the disease.Biden was diagnosed with prostate cancer – here’s what to know about the diseaseRead moreHowever, when prostate cancers need hormones to grow, as in Biden’s case, they can be susceptible to treatment that deprives the tumors of hormones.Biden’s predecessor and successor, Donald Trump, expressed concern on behalf of him and first lady Melania Trump for his political rival. “Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis,” the presidentwrote on his Truth Social platform. “We extend our warmest and best wishes to [former first lady] Jill Biden and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.”The uncharacteristically gracious tone, and reference to Biden by his first name “Joe”, were reminiscent of the Democrat’s gesture of concern for “Donald” after last year’s attempted assassination of Trump.Kamala Harris, who served as Biden’s vice-president, wrote on X that she and husband Doug Emhoff were “saddened” to learn of the diagnosis. “Joe is a fighter – and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,” she added.Biden was the oldest president in history and his health was a dominant concern among voters. He had beaten an incumbentTrumpin the 2020 presidential election and initially sought a rematch with him last year. But, amid questions about his age and mental acuity, he dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris to succeed him.Trump, who is just three years younger than Biden, subsequently defeated Harris in November’s election and returned to the White House in January.Biden’s initial decision to seek re-election has come under renewed criticism ahead of Tuesday’spublication of Original Sin, a book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson that alleges a White House cover-up of the former president’s declining health and cognitive abilities.Based on interviews with more than 200 aides, insiders and members of Congress, the book contains accounts of losing his train of thought, struggling to remember names, incoherent speeches and failing to recognise celebrities such as George Clooney. Aides discussed the possibility of Bidenneeding a wheelchairif he won re-election due to the severity of his physical deterioration and the risk of falling.Just two days ago Trump mocked Biden for being “hapless and cognitively impaired” in the wake of leaked audio recordings from Biden’s 2023 interview with then special counsel Robert Hur, where he struggled to remember important events. But in recent media interviews Biden hascontinued to reject the ideathat he was too old to serve.Biden has dealt with cancer before. Prior to starting his presidency, he had several non-melanoma skin cancers surgically removed, and he had a cancerous lesion removed from his chest in February 2023.In the US, prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among men,according to the American Cancer Society.In 2022, Biden made a “cancer moonshot” one of his administration’s priorities, with the goal of halving the cancer death rate over the next 25 years. The initiative was a continuation of his work as vice-president to address a disease that had killed his older son, Beau.Biden has endured decades of adversity and tragedy in the public eye. Shortly after he was elected to the Senate in 1972, his wife, Neilia, and baby daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car crash. Before leaving office hepardonedHunter, whom Biden calls “my only living son”, on federal felony gun and tax convictions despite previously promising not to.As news of the cancer diagnosis spread, a chorus of politicians wished Biden a speedy recovery. Barack Obama, who developed a close relationship with Biden when the former was president and the latter vice-president, posted on social media: “Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family. Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace. We pray for a fast and full recovery.”Pete Buttigieg, who served as transportation secretary in his administration,wrote on X: “President Biden is a man of deep faith and extraordinary resilience. Chasten and I are keeping him, and the entire Biden family, in our prayers for strength and healing.”Gavin Newsom, the governor of California,posted: “Our hearts are with President Biden and his entire family right now. A man of dignity, strength, and compassion like his deserves to live a long and beautiful life. Sending strength, healing and prayers his way.”Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsJoe BidenProstate cancerCancerUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

There are some outstanding issues on both sides and conversations will continue overnight.”No 10’s decision toissue a press statementon Saturday presenting the summit as a done deal caused irritation in Brussels, prompting some to recall the mantra of Brexit negotiations: “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.”One EU diplomat said: “The whole discussion is a package. We will not accept elements that are only at the advantage [or] request of the UK without strong guarantees and commitments on other issues of importance for the EU, such as fisheries, energy, youth mobility.”Nick Thomas-Symonds, the UK minister in charge of negotiations, said on Sunday that talks were in their “final hours”, but admitted key details of the deal were still being worked out.Nevertheless, a flagshipsecurity and defence partnershipmeans the UK could get access to a £125bn EU defence fund to rearm the continent, underlining the closeness of the security relationship with the bloc over the Ukraine conflict, in what could be a boost for British defence companies. The UK would be expected to contribute to the fund in return.Downing Street hopes the summit with von der Leyen and other Brussels chiefs will draw a line under the turbulentBrexityears and show that the UK has fundamentally changed. They believe the deal would be regarded as a “step towards” a deeper partnership with Europe.Ministers are ready for a big political offensive to explain the benefits of closer ties with the EU, amid some anxiety withinLabourover how Reform UK will respond.Both Nigel Farage and Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, have already described the deal as a “surrender”, despite not yet knowing the details, and have indicated they would tear it up if they came to power.Starmer is also facing pressure from within Labour, and from the progressive parties, to go further. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, urged the prime minister to be “bold and ambitious for our country” and ignore “dinosaurs fighting old battles”.Public attitudes towards Brexit have shifted significantly. Polls now suggesttwo-thirds of Britons back a closer relationship with the EU, and just 20% are opposed.Fishing remains a stumbling block to getting the deal over the line. The EU insists that the UK government offer long-term access to British waters, beyond the four-year deal proposed by the Starmer government, and instead is pushing for a double-digit extension.Brussels has linked fishing with an agreement to drop checks and bureaucracy around the sale of food, animal and other agricultural products, known as sanitary and phytosanitary goods. The EU has suggested this should be pegged to the same timescale as fish.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Conservatives have suggested it would involve a return to free movement “by the back door”.Other issues understood to remain on the table on Sunday night were tuition fees, with Brussels pushing for EU students in Britain to pay the domestic rate rather than the much higher international rate, as well as the fee levied on EU nationals for using the NHS.However, British holidaymakers are expected to faceshorter airport queues this summer. Negotiators are on the verge of striking an agreement for UK passport holders to use e-gates across Europe, rather than waiting in queues to have their passports stamped.There are plans to merge British and European emissions trading schemes, which the government says will reduce household bills and open up electricity trading with the continent.Starmer faces a political battle with Reform UK and the Tories over his deal. Badenoch has promised to tear up any agreement Starmer that crosses strict Brexiter red lines should she make it into office. Her pledge is unhelpful to Labour’s attempts to convince Brussels that the UK is now a reliable negotiating partner.The Lib Dems, meanwhile, have urged the government to join a new UK-EU customs union to boost trade with the bloc and boost growth. “The prime minister must ignore the dinosaurs fighting old battles, who want to drag us back to the destructive Brexit wars of the past, and focus on getting the best deal possible for the UK,” Davey said.The Scottish National party went further, arguing that there was not a deal available better than rejoining the EU, almost a decade after the UK voted to leave. Its Europe spokesperson, Stephen Gethins, added: “It is the biggest and the best growth strategy available and yet it is the only option the Labour party have turned their face against – all because they are running scared of Nigel Farage.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeKeir StarmerLabourUrsula von der LeyenBrexitForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Lineker said in a statement that he would “never knowingly share anything antisemitic” and had deleted the post “as soon as I became aware of the issue”.TheBBCdirector general, Tim Davie, had been facing calls all week to sack Lineker, who was paid £1.4m by the BBC last year.“The BBC’s reputation is held by everyone and when someone makes a mistake, it costs us,” Davie said when asked about the incident after giving a speech in Salford. “I think we absolutely need people to be exemplars of the BBC’s values and follow our social media policy. Simple as that.”More than 10,000 people signed apetition, sponsored by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, which urged the BBC to “immediately remove Gary Lineker from his position”.Lineker was already due to leave his role on Match of the Day at the end of the season, but was expected to host the corporation’s coverage of the FA Cup in 2025-26 and the World Cup next summer.He will be replaced on Match of the Day by Gabby Logan, Kelly Cates and Mark Chapman, who will share the presenting role from the next Premier League season.A source toldthe Sun: “Gary acknowledged his position at the BBC, anchoring the most prestigious tournament in world football, was untenable, and he will not be hosting the World Cup.“He offered to step down at the end of the season, and did not want the BBC – an organisation he still holds in the highest of esteem – dragged into any further controversy.“He remains absolutely devastated by the recent turn of events and is deeply regretful about how his post was interpreted. His last Match of the Day will air on Sunday now and he won’t be back.”In March 2023, Lineker was temporarily suspended from the BBC over comments he made criticising the Conservative government’s asylum policy.In February this year, he was also among 500 high-profile cultural figures who called on the BBC to rebroadcast a documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, calling it an “essential piece of journalism”. The broadcaster removed the documentary from BBC iPlayer after it emerged that the film’s 14-year-old narrator was the son of a deputy agriculture minister in the territory’s Hamas-run government.The BBC declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsGary LinekerMatch of the DayBBCAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

The new president will nominate the next prime minister and influence the formation of a new coalition.The former soccer ultra and ultranationalist agitator, who sees his far-right AUR party as a “natural ally” of the US Maga movement, scored almost double his rival’s total, but polls in recent days had shown the gap between the two narrowing.Turnout, which was 53% in the first round, was almost 65%, with young people and Romanians living abroad in particular voting in significantly higher numbers, official figures showed. Analysts had said a high turnout would favour Dan.The vote is a rerun of last November’s ballot, won by Călin Georgescu, a far-right, Moscow-friendly firebrand, who was barred from standing again after the vote was cancelled amid allegations of campaign finance violations and Russian meddling.The Romanian foreign ministry said earlier on Sunday it had seen “a viral campaign of fake news on Telegram and other social media platforms” designed “to influence the electoral process”, adding that this bore “the hallmarks of Russian interference”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is thought likely to nominate a USR prime minister and try to form a minority government, possibly backed by the PNL.Addressing his jubilant supporters in central Bucharest, he said he would start talks on forming a new government on Monday but acknowledged his job would be hard. “There will be a difficult period ahead, needed for economic rebalancing,” he said. “Please have hope and patience.”Simion opposed further aid to Ukraine and had sharply criticised the EU’s leadership. While he insisted he wants Romania to stay in the EU and Nato, he could have allied with Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Slovakia’s Robert Fico as another disruptive force.Mujtaba Rahman, of the Eurasia Group consultancy, said the outcome was “a really strong result for the pro-European candidate”, reflecting the way “concerns about political and policy direction moving in a Maga-like way have mobilised voters”.The founder of the Telegram messaging app, Pavel Durov, earlier appeared to accuse the French government of asking the company to “silence conservative voices in Romania in the election”. France “categorically rejected” what it called “completely unfounded allegations”.Russian-born Durov, who is now a French national, is being investigated in France over possession of child abuse image, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions on the app.Explore more on these topicsRomaniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Rest easy, my boy.”Monica Lennon, the Labour MSP for Central Scotland, wrote on X: “My sincere condolences to Kayden’s heartbroken family and friends. This heartbreaking and violent tragedy will stun East Kilbride and Scotland. Enough is enough.”Police Scotland announced the arrest of a boy, 17, on Sunday.The force is appealing for people who were on the beach to contact the police if they have mobile phone footage of the incident in which Kayden was injured.DCI Campbell Jackson, of Police Scotland’s major investigations team, said: “An extensive investigation is under way to establish the full circumstances surrounding this death. Our officers are supporting the boy’s family at this very difficult and heartbreaking time.“From our investigation so far, we know there were a number of people on the beach around the time of the disturbance. We believe several of them were filming at the time and may have footage of what happened.“I would urge people to review the footage they have and contact police if they think the footage captured could be of significance to our investigation.”Detectives have also set up a website that gives members of the public access to a form tosend information directly to the investigation team, which can be submitted anonymously.Supt Jim McMillan said: “We understand this death will be of great concern for the local community, but please be assured that we are doing everything we can to identify those involved.“There will be additional patrols in the area as we carry out our inquiries and anyone with any concerns can approach these officers.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The sound of the bombing is terrifying … Our situation is worse than I can describe. It is truly catastrophic. We have nothing left but hope that this war will end as soon as possible,” Rahal told the Guardian.Gaza will be entirely destroyed, Israeli minister saysRead moreBasel al-Barawi, 46, fled Beit Lahiya with his family on Sunday after 10 relatives were killed.“Only a six-year-old girl survived, and she is now in the hospital. We started pulling them from under the rubble – their features were disfigured, their bodies covered in dirt, their clothes torn. Their skin had turned grey from the ash and dust. I felt my heart tearing apart as I carried them,” Barawi said.Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry. Israel has accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, which the group denies.Hamas took about 250 hostages during its October 2023 attack on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Fifty-eight hostages are held by Hamas, most of whom are thought to be dead.The indirect talks in Qatar arereportedly focusing on securing a two-month truce, with Hamas freeing about half the 20 or so living hostages it is still holding. In return, Israel would release hundreds of Palestinians from its jails and end the total blockade it has placed on Gaza since early March. The US would offer strong guarantees to ensure talks about a permanent end to the war took place. However, sources on both sides said there had been no progress by late Sunday afternoon.In March, Israel refused to engage in talks about a second phase of a fragile two-month ceasefire that could have led to an end to the conflict and the release of the remaining hostages. It then cut off all supplies to Gaza and relaunched its air offensive.Netanyahu has been repeatedlyaccused of prolonging the warfor domestic political reasons – which he denies – and has frequently promised that Israel will continue to fight until Hamas is “crushed”.In Israel, Einav Zangauker, the mother of a hostage still held by Hamas, said Netanyahu was refusing to end the war because of his political interests. “The Israeli government still insists on only partial deals. They are deliberately tormenting us. Bring our children back already! All 58 of them,” Zangauker said in a post on X.Hamas, whichreleased a US-Israeli hostage last weekas a goodwill gesture before Donald Trump travelled to the Middle East for a four-day visit, has always insisted on a deal that definitively ends the war and leads to the withdrawal of Israel’s forces. It has also refused to disarm or to accept the exile of its leaders.Israel, which claims Hamas systematically loots aid to fund its military and other operations, has put forward a plan to distribute humanitarian assistance from a series of hubs in Gaza run by private contractors and protected by Israeli troops.Israel-backed food aid group admits it won’t be able to reach most vulnerable in GazaRead moreThe UShas backed the plan, which has been described as unworkable, dangerous and potentially unlawful by aid agencies because it could lead to the forced mass transfer of populations. Food security experts have warned that any delay will cost lives, and that cases of acute malnutrition, particularly among young children, are soaring.The massive new offensive, the recent strikes and the tight blockade imposed on Gaza in March by Israel have prompted a growing wave of international concern and anger. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, on Friday said the bombing campaign aimed at bringing about a “permanent demographic shift in Gaza” that was in “defiance of international law” and was equivalent to ethnic cleansing.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelHamasPalestinian territoriesQatarMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Stubb has been in near daily contact with Graham, who describes the sanctions package as “bone-crushing”.At a security conference in Estonia, Stubb said: “If we were to pull it together, we could say that Zelenskyy is patient and President Trump is starting to be impatient, but in the right direction, that is, towards Russia.”Stubb said threatening sanctions and not implementing them would not cause a credibility problem as long as the west was making Putin react.It is widely expected that Graham, who discussed his sanctions package with European foreign ministers last week, will adapt the bill’s provisions so it is aimed at foreign firms that import Russian energy. Graham, a Trump loyalist, is portraying his sanctions as an adjunct to Trump’s tariffs policy and not an alternative.The initial package contained plans to impose 500% tariffs on the goods of any country trading in energy with Russia, a blunderbuss style of policy Trump has already reversed in his trade war.Stubb said any European contact with Putin would be through the E3 leadership of Britain, France and Germany. “At the top level we should not go solo,” he said.Stubb, one of the small group of European leaders with the ear of Trump, said he had been using his influence to persuade the president to revise his view of Russia’s economic and military strength.At the Lennart Meri security conference in Tallinn he disclosed that in his conversation with Trump on Saturday he had tried to explain that Russia was no longer a great power, “certainly not economically”.He added: “It is smaller than Italy, slightly larger than Spain [in terms of its economy]. Militarily it wanted to deny the independent sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine three years ago. It has advanced less than one percentage point this year, and its interest rate is over 20% and its reserves are out.“So it is not a country which can be seen as a big power any more. These are the kind of messages that you have to convey. It is not an easy game, but you just have to keep on engaging the American administration.“Trump’s worldview is not far from what we saw in the 19th-century concert of powers – a big power era sometimes of competition and sometimes cooperation. We have to convince the US administration that free trade and common rules are better than transactional deals, and we show we are serious about defence in Europe and that we are security providers and not security consumers.”Matthew Whitaker, the US ambassador toNato, told the conference his country was Europe’s friend but warned of a smaller military presence in Europe. “President Trump just said: enough, this is going to happen and it’s going to happen now,” he said.“This is going to be orderly, but we are not going to have any more patience for foot-dragging in this situation. We just need to work through the practical consequences.”The postponement of a US troop withdrawal announcement until after a Nato summit next month will make capability planning more difficult.Radosław Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, was one of many European leaders who accepted that the rebalancing of defence spending between Europe and the US was long overdue, adding he was grateful to Trump. He recalled what the Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto said of the Americans after Pearl Harbor – “We have awoken a sleeping giant” – and said: “Putin has also woken the giant. He has yet no idea how costly this is going to be. Since President Trump came to power we [Nato] have already doubled our defence spending. We are at 2% [of GDP].“At the next Nato summit 3.5 % on hard defence will be the new target and 1.5% for civil and cyber defence. When we have done it, we will dwarf Russia. As Europe, without the US, we are spending two and half times more than Russia on a peace footing than Russia is spending on a war footing. All it takes is to spend the money better, on the basis of learning the lessons from Ukraine and then having the will to gel this into a fighting force. We should be grateful to the US for telling it like it is.”Stubb added that in his conversations with the US administration, no one had mentioned the US leaving Nato and it was in the interest of the US to have allies in the alliance.Alar Karis, the Estonian president, revealed he sat next to Trump for two hours at the pope’s funeral in Rome and was told: “Don’t worry, you are safe.”But diplomats warned the Nato summit could bring sharp disagreements over Russia strategy, with Europeans wanting to be clear that Russia posed a long-term threat, regardless of the settlement in Ukraine. It is not yet clear in what capacity Zelenskyy will attend the summit. His presence is important for leaders who do not want any peace settlement to rule out Ukrainian membership of Nato.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinNatoDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The 69th edition of the contest was hosted in Basel, Switzerland.The win was Austria’s third in the history of the competition, after drag performer Conchita’s success in 2014 and Udo Jürgens’ win in 1966.Hey, what’s that sound: FalsettoRead more“It’s wonderful to have this victory, 11 years after Conchita,” said Micaela Taroni, an Austrian-Italian correspondent in Rome for the Austrian press agency APA. “JJ won because of his vocal qualities. He’s a countertenor, so reaches the high notes. He was an outsider, but one who encompasses musical modernity with Austria’s rich operatic tradition.”JJ, whose real name is Johannes Pietsch, won ahead of Israel’s Yuval Raphael, a survivor of the 7 October attacks by Hamas militants on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and took 251 hostage, and led to Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza in which an estimated 53,000 Palestinians have so far died.Israel finished second, having led for some time after a large public vote put them into the top spot.A s with 2024, Israel’s inclusion in the world’s biggest music competition, which was watched by more than 160 million people across the world, sparked protests. Demonstrations were held in Basel on Saturday evening and a Eurovision crew memberwas hit by paintafter two pro-Palestinian protesters tried to rush on stage as Raphael sang New Day Will Rise.A spokesperson for Israeli broadcaster Kan said Raphael was “shaken and upset” by the protesters.Many of the 200 protesters in Basel wore Palestiniankeffiyehscarves and carried signs stating: “No music for murder”, “Stop genocide” and “Singing while Gaza burns”. Some burned huge Israeli and US flags and others sent red and green smoke into the air, according to the AFP news agency.Pro-Palestinian marches were also held throughout the day in cities around the world in protest against Israel’s intensified bombardment of Gaza and its enforced blockades of food and other humanitarian supplies.In third place in the competition was Estonia’s Tommy Cash with Espresso Macchiato, a song poking fun at Italian stereotypes that both riled and enthused Italians.After being presented with his winner’s trophy in Basel, JJ thanked his voters and called for “more love” in the world. He said Wasted Love, which he co-wrote with Teodora Špirić and Thomas Turner, was intended to give listeners an insight into his deepest thoughts.JJ said: “There’s no wasted love. Love is never wasted. There’s so much love that we can spread around, and we should use love as the strongest force on planet Earth.”JJ’s success was applauded by the Austrian chancellor, Christian Stocker, who said the singer was writing musical history.Beate Meinl-Reisinger, Austria’s foreign minister, wrote on X: “Dear JJ, you have movedEuropewith your voice and sung Austria into the spotlight.”The Philippine consulate general in Frankfurt also issued a message of congratulations to JJ on Facebook. “What an incredible moment – Filipino pride on the European stage!” she said.Austria will host next year’s contest. JJ, who returned home on Sunday, said he would like the event to be held in Vienna, where he was born.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The semi-finals threw up some surprises. Australia, which has competed in Eurovision since 2015, surprisingly failed to qualify with Go-Jo’s innuendo-ladenMilkshake Man.There were still plenty of risque songs on offer, including Miriana Conte, who had to change the lyrics of her song Serving to remove a reference to the Maltese word for singing – “kant” – due to having an obvious resemblance to an English swear word. Despite it being a fan favourite, it scored poorly with the wider public.In Finland’s entry, Ich Komme by Erika Vikman, her song repeatedly announced that she was coming, and she ended her performance hoisted up on a giant gold microphone spraying out fireworks.Other outlandish props included Italy’s Lucio Corsi with an outsized piano and France’s Louane being covered with falling sand.Explore more on these topicsEurovision 2025AustriaEurovisionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

My mom needlepointed the Grecian bench I’m sitting on. Little did I know I was going to be Zeus some day. I started playing the piano when I was nine but I was not good. Not disciplined. My teacher would come once a week, and I’d be miserable, and he’d be miserable: “So you didn’t really practise?” he’d say, and I’d reply: “No, I didn’t.” That went on until he gave me a jazz arrangement. Finally, here was something that made me think: “I like that! I want to sit and play until I know it by heart.” That’s where it all began.At this age – before the complications of puberty, before you become more developed and multifaceted – I was full of life and joie de vivre. A funny kid. I remember shopping in a department store with my mother and wanting to make her laugh by playing around with the hangers and the clothes. I would spend a lot of time going into the woods with my best friend, Bobby, and digging holes in the forest or playing back at his house. His mom once said to my mom: “Gee, Jeffrey is just so calm to be around, and I enjoyed having him over.”I was also a good student. In the fourth grade I got all As and my teacher wrote in my report: “Jeff is a joy.” This is all very self-serving and I’m sure I was a hellcat in lots of ways, but maybe I was kind of sweet, too.‘It’s foolish to mask your age. Accept it. Present it’: Jeff Goldblum on vanity, mortality and becoming a father in his 60sRead moreMy creativity was very encouraged by my parents. As well as the piano lessons, they took my siblings and me to the cinema, and to the theatre at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. I was so lucky, and those experiences really made me what I am. Now I have two boys, and, along with Emily, who also loves the arts, I am trying to get them to follow that curiosity.My brother Rick was fantastic. He was four years older and I looked up to him enormously – he opened many doors for me in all sorts of ways. Rick was an interesting dude – he was mysterious and wanted to be Hemingway or James Bond. He was a great audience, too: I would do routines and try to make him laugh. He turned me on to Miles Davis, Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto, the Beatles and counterculture. He died [of kidney failure] when he was travelling in Morocco. I was 19. He was 23. At the time, I had just moved out of my parents’ house and I was in a big hit – performing The Two Gentlemen of Verona eight times a week on Broadway. When the news came in, it was terrible. Monumental. Full of so much sadness and trauma. But his life also gave me the opportunity for so much education and spiritual enhancement.Puberty brought its own challenges and new types of anxiety. Adolescence welcomes private introversions – inhibitions that weren’t there when I was playing around in the department store. It did, however, supply the heat and energy for what I have developed in these last several decades as an actor. I started getting turned on by the theatre. I loved the idea of show-and-tell in front of an audience. But to do it myself? I was terrified. Especially at first. Soon I realised it was also exhilarating. If you live this so-called creative life you have to get comfortable swimming in the waters of not knowing. You eventually become familiar with the fear and it becomes part of the ingredients – the tension that’s interesting in the performance itself. I still like to discover something new, even if it is disorienting and daunting. Whether it’s showing up on a movie set to do Wicked, or playing with my jazz band at the Palladium – I know part of my system will be alerted and I’ll be prepared. When I meet the moment, I am free.Pretending can sometimes feel childish or trivial – after all, my dad was a doctorMy teacher at Neighbourhood Playhouse in New York, Sanford Meisner, told me it takes 20 years of continual work before you can call yourself an actor. He was a serious person, and made acting seem like a noble and worthwhile devotion for one’s life. At the start of my career I kept getting miraculous opportunities with terrific directors and terrific actors. I yearned for this life – so when it actually started happening I thought: “Well, I’ll be darned.” My first film was Death Wish with Michael Winner, who yelled at me: “Start acting now!” It kind of scared me, but in retrospect was not a bad piece of advice.So followed lots of little parts, which were not exactly right, but, hey, I was getting jobs. One turning point was Invasion of the Body Snatchers with Philip Kaufman. A wonderful director, and he became like family. The way he saw me allowed me to appreciate myself in a way that felt new and landmark. Then came The Big Chill in 1983 and The Fly in 1986, both creatively important. Jurassic Park in 1993 – working with Mr Spielberg and that cast, and the way it rang the bell for a big audience was fun. Wes Anderson was a very important teacher and cohort, too. Most recently I’ve done Kaos, Thor and the two Wicked movies. They were all very nutritious, nourishing roles. Really, my career has been just thrilling.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But, in any one project, you keep asking: “Can I do it? Oh boy, that’s no good. Let me try something else.” Then you do, and it works, and it’s just like that daunting feeling I described as a teenager all over again. Pretending can sometimes feel childish or trivial, and often you wonder if you’re making any difference to anybody – after all, my dad was a doctor. But I have been exposed to and enlivened by the idea that actors want to make a difference, and that all our activities hopefully move the needle towards something uplifting.I am 72 now and I’m sure I’ll crumble at any minute. But I better keep myself right so I can be a good dad, a good husband and a good citizen of the world. I try to go to bed on time and eat the right things. I am injury-free, thank goodness. I have good genetics, which is lucky. My body is my instrument, so I’ve got to keep it in shape.I cherish life and I want to do right by this gift – because that’s what it is. Acting is an unbelievably lucky gift. I can’t let myself down, or anyone else I am sharing this short trip with.

Those subtitles are extraordinaryLucy ManganSun 18 May 2025 17.05 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 17.07 EDTShareIt’s Rose Ayling-Ellis’s world at the moment – and we just live in it, which is proving to be a very nice thing for us all. In the three years since she left EastEnders she has: won a Stage Debut award and was nominated for an Olivier for her performance as Celia in @sohoplace’s As You Like It; taken part in two documentaries about deafness (she has been so since birth); starred in the excellent BBC thriller Reunion; was the central character in the first decent episode of Doctor Who there’s been in living memory; and is now the lead in the fine and fun ITV thriller Code of Silence. (She is also due to star in a forthcoming adaptation of Will Dean’s Dark Pines novel, and is developing her own comedy-drama about deaf women dating in London. No, I don’t know how she finds the time either.)But to Code of Silence. Ayling-Ellis plays Alison, an employee in a police canteen who becomes increasingly involved with an investigation into a violent criminal gang, whose members only meet outdoors in unbuggable locations. Plainclothes officers surveil them with hidden cameras, but back at the station all the official lip readers are busy on other jobs and unavailable to interpret footage of them talking. Enter Alison.Gradually and inevitably, she becomes more enmeshed with the investigation; at first at the team’s own behest and soon under her own steam as she begins working at the pub that the gang’s newest recruit, Liam (Kieron Moore), uses as his local. To the initial fury and then resignation of the lead detectives (Andrew Buchan as DI James Marsh, haunted by the death of a colleague for which he blames himself; Charlotte Ritchie as DS Ashleigh Francis, trying her best to keep her rogue non-agent from doing anything too wild), she starts accumulating information too valuable to ignore. She also starts falling for Liam, who seems to be a relatively reluctant member of the underworld. Although only two episodes were available for review, I spy a possible redemptive arc for the new guy. But we’ll see.View image in fullscreenReining in the rogue non-agent … Andrew Buchan as DI James Marsh and Charlotte Ritchie as DS Ashleigh Francis in Code of Silence.Photograph: ITV/PAAnd we want to see, too. There may be nothing much innovative about the basic plot – or the side story about Alison and her mother living under the threat of eviction by a company that has bought their estate for potential redevelopment, the financial pressures from which provide much of the impetus for Alison’s decisions – but the strength of the cast, and Ayling-Ellis in particular, carries things convincingly.There are also plentiful details, grace notes really, that evoke the reality of life as a deaf person. When Alison lip-reads from the feeds in the office, only partial subtitles appear at first, lacking mostly consonants, and resolve into words as Alison works out via common sense and context what they must be saying – so “o I bo ved a roun io” blurs, shifts and clears into “No, I moved around a lot” and so on. It’s a stylish way of showing the effort and leaps involved in lip-reading, when so many plosives (and ‘m’s) all look the same from the outside.Similarly, we see Alison stop watching a television programme at home because the subtitles are frustratingly slow to arrive. The assumptions of hearing people are gently dismantled at many points. When Liam asks if the music in the pub (where she likes it when people order one of the craft beers, because their odd names are easily identifiable) makes her job more difficult, she replies that it does, “but I like the beat”. On one particularly wearying day of simply dealing with the world, she sighs that she doesn’t want to be hearing; rather, “I just want them to be a little bit deaf. Really fed up with trying to prove myself.” The barriers to employment are not insisted upon but are clear from the joy and relief Alison has in securing the gig at the pub, and then by her (also deaf) mother’s need to find an interpreter who can accompany her to the training for the rare job she has secured. There are obstacles everywhere.It all gives a freshness, as well as an edifying aspect, to the underlying conventions. You can watch and learn – or at least newly appreciate an underacknowledged world – without being shortchanged on your entertainment at all. That’s quite a triumph.Code of Silence is on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

From being enigmatically abstract it became incredibly accomplished at portraying the human body – and soul.You can see this happen in the bustling yet harmonious crowd of pilgrims and gift-givers you meet about a third of the way through this ethereal and sensual show. Two horses bearing courtiers or merchants are portrayed in perfect perspective, their rounded chests billowing, their bodies receding. Around them a crowd of travelling companions, on horseback and foot, are depicted with the same depth. Their bodies and faces are full of life, in a frenetic pageant, a bustling carnival, yet this human hubbub is composed with order and calm.View image in fullscreenSpherical … a terracottaYaksis, from Chandraketugarh, India, about first century BCE.Photograph: CPA Media Pte Ltd/AlamyIt’s a Buddhist masterpiece, which helps explain the inner harmony: one of a group of stunning reliefs in this show from the Great Stupa of Amaravati, excavated in the early 1800s by the East India Company and now owned by theBritish Museum. A stupa is a domed structure holding Buddhist or Jain relics, perhaps modelled on prehistoric mounds, but this one was embellished in the first century AD with sublime pictorial art. Buddha himself stands further along the slender stone block, taller and more still than everyone else.The exact dates of Siddhartha Gautama, the teacher and seeker of enlightenment who became the Buddha, are unknown but by the time this work was created the movement he started was about 500 years old and spearheading one of the most influential renaissances in the story of world art. This exhibition gets to that artistic truth in an unlikely way. It doesn’t bother with the minutiae of stylistic change or dynastic history. Instead, it tells a passionate story about the three great religions of ancient India – Hinduism, Jainism andBuddhism– and their vitality across time. You meet practitioners of these faiths in Britain today, sharing their devotion on film. This is a wonderfully direct way to blast the museum dust off such ancient art – and when that dust clears, you get a much better sense of its living power.View image in fullscreenStunning … a limestone drum slab from Amaravati.Photograph: © The Trustees of the British MuseumHindu and Jain beliefs are older than Buddhism (far older, in the case of Hinduism) but it was after the Buddhist breakthrough in storytelling art that they too became brilliantly figurative. Is it crude to see this as competition? It was at the very least a dialogue. At first I mistook a display of beautiful Jain statues for Bodhisattvas, Buddhist saints. In fact, the slender swaying grace of these figures embodies the ascetic Jain ideal of universal compassion.View image in fullscreenNot just divine but lovable … a statue of Ganesha made in Java from volcanic stone, about AD1000-1200.Photograph: © The Trustees of the British MuseumYet the biggest, most spectacular artistic transformation was achieved by Hinduism. You can’t get a friendlier, more paradoxically human deity than the elephant-headed Ganesha. A statue of him in this show, dating from about AD1100 to AD1200, is a technical miracle in the way the artist fuses an elephant’s head with a human body – both precisely observed. But it’s the pathos that gets you, the artist’s intuition of the wisdom and sensitivity of elephants. Ganesha here is not just divine but lovable.Such moving, homely art is a long way from a black stone lingam, the older, aniconic Hindu representation of Shiva as a male tube being inserted into a female yoni. But sexual desire is a feeling too and the big difference between Christianity and the religions here is Indian sacred art’s embrace of the erotic. Statuettes and plaques that date from as early as 300BC depictYaksis, female nature spirits, with jewellery on their curvy bodies and the same spherical, bulging breasts that you see throughout the show. Female sexual and reproductive power are celebrated simultaneously in the art of all three great religions. Another relief from the Great Stupa of Amaravati portrays The Birth of the Buddha. Its main character is Gautama’s mother, Queen MahaMaya. She lies on a bed in a curvy pose, and gives birth in a posture almost as luxuriant.Your chance to stare down a god: inside the British Museum’s mesmerising look at Indian religionsRead moreGrowing up in a Protestant Christian church, I thought of religion as a taking away, a denial. Here it is an addition – human and elephant, spirit and body, dream and reality. Life infuses these religions: they don’t oppose themselves to it. That appetite for reality, as they attempt to make sense of the cosmos, mortality and desire, to find the dharma, must be what made India’s religions so exportable. Many of us don’t think of Buddhism as specifically Indian because it has spread so far so quickly. One of the most captivating works here is a silk painting of the Buddha set in a dreamworld of deep reds and greens, from a cave near Dunhuang, China, created in the eighth century AD. Nearby in the same final space is a statue of Ganesha from Java, one of the many places Hinduism took root.This is an exhibition with a true sense of mystery. Not just in the atmospheric way it is lit with coloured misty veils separating displays, or even the marvels you encounter such as a nagini snake goddess floating in the shadows – but in the way it worships life.Ancient India: Living Traditions is at theBritish Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsArt and designExhibitionsMuseumsBritish MuseumIndiaHinduismBuddhismreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here is what I found out after my diagnosisEmma SzewczakSun 18 May 2025 09.00 EDTShareWhen I experienced pelvic organ prolapse after giving birth to my daughter in 2019, I had no idea – and neither, seemingly, did my doctors – how much my life was about to change. Every new “surprise” – from not being able to use tampons, to an almost constant cycle of UTIs – felt all the worse for my lack of mental and practical preparation.This shouldn’t be the case: around a half of all women will have some degree of pelvic organ prolapse in their lifetime. There are four types: vaginal, uterine, bladder and rectal, all of which involve one or more pelvic organs descending into the vagina. Often, it creates an internal bulge, but when it is more progressed it can be externally visible too. Prolapse being so varied – and, crucially, understudied – makes for a great proliferation of potential symptoms which are, in my opinion, generally underplayed in healthcare literature. Living with an organ descending into your vagina is frequently described as “uncomfortable”, as though comparable to wearing a too small pair of jeans. The NHS website describes what can be truly debilitating stress urinary incontinence (SUI) as “problems [with] peeing”. What little information is available on prolapse seems designed to remind you that what you’re experiencingis no big deal!But for many of us, that is far from the case.My own prolapse wascaused by childbirth, but it can also be brought on by injury,menopause, age, or for simply no (as yet known by medical research) reason at all. You might have none of the symptoms and no idea you even have it; conversely, you might have all of the symptoms and yet struggle to get a diagnosis. Six years on and, while I have a general diagnosis of “pelvic organ prolapse”, I do not knowwhichprolapse I have, to what degree or whether or not I have multiple prolapses. Though I’m far from content with this shocking lack of information about my condition, I – through necessity – focus on what Idoknow, to get through the day. Here is everything I have learned, and everything I wish I had already known about living with pelvic organ prolapse, before I had to.Penetrative sexwillbe differentWhen I was first diagnosed with prolapse, I didn’t think about the effect it might have on my sex life. But, as it turns out, this is probably the area of my life that’s been most negatively affected. Yes, I have stress urinary incontinence (SUI) – but when is theworsttimeto lose control of your bladder? Yes, I have pain in my vagina – but when is theworsttimeto feel pain in your vagina? At 29, and after a couple of nightmarish attempts at intercourse, I thought I’d never be able to have penetrative sex again; the pain was more than I could bear.With time, however, I realised that positioning was key. Having sex on my side so that the penis would not penetrate so deeply made a huge difference. Of course, this is no good if you get off on deeper penetration – for this, a friend advises placing a cushion under your bum, to lift your pelvis up and cause your cervix to recede. We both agree that lube is a huge help in encouraging the penis to “find the path of least resistance”. And as for the SUI? I pee beforehand, even if I don’t think I really need to. For others who may be embarrassed about losing control of their bladder, I’d recommend having sex in the bath or lubed up to the nines – both blessedly simple ways to disguise bigger or smaller leaks.… and so will your periodWhile prolapse shouldn’t affect your period, your periodcanaffect your prolapse. I certainly notice an increased heaviness in my vagina and, in the days before my period arrives, I feel particularly reluctant to overexert myself physically. I now experience cramping more intensely in my vagina, perhaps due to the descent of my uterus, and I have to apply heat pads to my vulva rather than abdomen (over clothing, to prevent the risk of burns). I have found using tampons and Mooncups next to impossible; my prolapse simply squeezes them out almost as soon as I insert them. Returning to pads after a decade of not using them was disheartening for me personally, and I have yet to find a brand of period pants I can get on board with. All of this caused me to turn to the coil – which has, at least, helped to alleviate my physical symptoms. It’s not for everyone, though, and while I did not experience pain with insertion myself, I would recommend anyone concerned about this to ask their healthcare provider to use a local anaesthetic gel or spray (pain relief is not routinely offered for IUD fittings).Your relationship to exercise will changeThese days, it is generally only in the lead-up to my period, or after some particularly physical exertion, that my prolapse affects my mobility – but this was not the case for the first year or two. On the worst days, merely standing up felt like a monumental effort – I’d have to squeeze my pelvic floor muscles as hard as I could to combat the sense that my cervix was going to tumble out of me. Physiotherapists told me I shouldn’t pick up my baby– almost laughably impossible advice for a new parent – which left me questioning every cuddle. Friends who like to run took news of their prolapses particularly hard. One found herself unable to run 10 metres without losing full control of her bladder; incontinence pads were a gamechanger, once she was able to get past the stigma. Another option is a pessary – a small ring inserted into the vagina to help support the organs above it.You may have more gynaecological infectionsA risk that comes with pessary use, however, is the increased chance of vaginal infections. This is due to the pessary potentially introducing bacteria into the vagina, but prolapse in general is likely to increase infections. UTIs are the most common, as the descended organs can prevent the complete emptying of the bladder, or create small leaks and pooling of urine, which is a breeding ground for bacteria. After penetrative sex, residual semen can become trapped in the pockets created by the prolapse, also creating fertile ground for infection. It may seem that the answer to these problems is more rigorous hygiene standards, but introducing harsher products and rougher cleaning habits can actually have an adverse effect on the vaginal ecosystem. I have yet to come up with a better solution than regularly purchasing over-the-counter vaginal self-testing kits and requesting targeted medication from my GP, if needed. This is time consuming and expensive, and I hope that GPs will consider offering free self-testing kits for regularly occurring gynaecological infections in future.It may affect your future fertility optionsA number of healthcare professionals informed me that if I don’t want my prolapse to get any worse, I should not get pregnant again. Avoiding vaginal birth by having a caesarean section wouldn’t help, in my case, as the pressure put on my pelvic region by carrying another baby could be enough to greatly worsen my symptoms and future outlook. Surgical repair will only be offered to me once I’ve decided not to get pregnant again.It’s important to note that not all sufferers of prolapse are told that they should not become pregnant: it is judged on a case-by-case basis, and if you are prepared for your prolapse to potentially worsen then, of course, you can always go ahead with it, no matter what you are advised. But having to calculate that risk can be difficult for many. There is growing evidence to suggest that pessary use in pregnancy for those with advanced prolapse can lead to best post-birth outcomes, but more research into this and other interventions is sorely needed in order to provide as much reproductive choice as possible.The mental toll can feel impossible – but it isn’tWhen I was first diagnosed with prolapse, I didn’t want to leave my bed. Partly, this was because every step I took felt like it was making things physically, medically, worse. But mostly, it was because of the mental toll that having a prolapse had taken on me. Doctors seemed to barely understand my condition, and shrouded it in euphemisms. I had little idea what the rest of my life was going to look like, and I suddenly – after having a baby – felt entirely alienated from my body and the child I was advised not to pick up. This is, of course, fertile grounds for postnatal depression.It is important to acknowledge just how many people are in the same boatAnother demographic affected by pelvic organ prolapse are those experiencing menopause – people who, like those who have just given birth, are subject to vast hormonal fluctuations and are therefore more vulnerable to poor mental health. Understanding the psychological impact that gynaecological conditions can have must begin with understanding a key element of medical misogyny: that women’s health conditions are almost universallyunderstudied, undertreated, and underdiagnosed. Women find themselves experiencingmore pain, and with less likelihood of diagnosis and treatment.This can feel frustrating, like the system is stacked against us. But it is important to acknowledge just how many people are in the same boat; to campaign for better treatment options, and to work together to destigmatise conditions that are not talked about enough. Sharing my prolapse story with others, and then having so many people share their experiences with me, helped me to shed the shame I had initially felt at my body’s betrayal. Talking about how to achieve better sex, or how to manage my period, gave me a toolkit with which to move forward. We still need meaningful, institutional reform but, for now, I’m grateful not to be too ashamed to wear an incontinence pad if I need to. And nor should you be.The Stitch-Up: How Medical Misogyny Harms Us All, by Emma Szewczak with Dr Andrzej Harris, is published by Vintage on 29 May (£22).

A gorilla-suited master of ceremonies pulls a curtain to reveal the New York band’s logo standing statuesque: scissors split wide open, blades curving into shapely legs. Amid a deserted jeep, retro payphone and broken highway, the metaphor is clear: the Sisters are a crash-landed UFO shaking up dusty Americana.More than twenty years after their self-titled debut album rocketed them from New York’s queer cabarets to household-name status in the UK, the band tumble from the shadows – effervescent frontman Jake Shears in bedazzled denim, cool-headed guitarist Del Marquis, and PVC-clad multi-instrumentalist Babydaddy – and the bawdy, stabbing synths of early single Laura pull a sold-out crowd to their feet.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Carsten Windhorst/Camera PressAn irreverent reworking of classic and glam rock, disco and psychedelia with a vinegary end-of-the-pier humour, the Scissor Sisters album is nine-times platinum in the UK, where the band’s freaky theatricality found a spiritual home. From the impossibly falsetto cover of Comfortably Numb to the spiky surrealism of Tits on the Radio, so powerful is the band’s magnetism that electropop legend Alison Goldfrapp performs as support, and disco queen Jessie Ware gallops from the wings to scream “Do it!!!” on a barnstorming Take Your Mama.With songs so evergreen, you might reasonably feel that the staging is … too much. Yet somehow a dizzying procession of animated penguins, elderly folk in VR headsets and the Tragic Clown from the Sims video game franchise makes these bone-deep familiar songs feel as absurd as when they first hit the charts.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Carsten Windhorst/Camera PressMissing from the spectacle is the arched eyebrow of founding member Ana Matronic, and the band wisely chose not to replace her. Instead, Bridget Barkan and Amber Martin join as a bawdy chorus line, and Martin’s thrillingly unpredictable rendition of Any Which Way is one of the night’s greatest highs.‘We were strapped to this babbling circus’: Scissor Sisters on their reunion, rightwing reactionaries – and riotous originsRead moreTwenty years ago the Sisters were pop aliens.

On a whim, the three of us decided to road trip across the border to Vancouver to catch the tail end of the city’s 1986 World Expo. We assumed we’d be able to find accommodation when we got there – and we were wrong.With no mobile phones or Google to guide us, we traipsed from one hotel to the next, before the inefficiency of such a tactic dawned on us and we headed for Vancouver’s visitor centre. I remember the centre being busy, packed with other panicked accommodation hunters, and close to shutting up shop for the day. But there was a lovely woman who made it her mission to help us, tirelessly telephoning every accommodation provider she could think of – motel, hotel, bed and breakfast, caravan park – all without success.The kindness of strangers: I was homeless and addicted to heroin. Joanne saved my lifeRead moreJust as we were wondering if we were going to have to sleep in the car, she told us the office had a list of Vancouver residents the centre could contact for emergency accommodation. I don’t know how many people she called, but this wonderful woman finally triumphed and told us she’d found us a place to stay at someone’s home. She gave us the directions and sent us on our way.When we arrived it was getting dark, but we could see it was a lovely house on a lush, tree-lined avenue. We all felt a collective sense of relief, coupled with a degree of apprehension about who our hosts might be. Our anxiety dissipated the moment they welcomed us at the door, ushering us in and asking if we were hungry. They told us they’d prepared dinner. I can’t remember their names, only that they were a young couple who welcomed us in without knowing anything about us.They must have sized us up over dinner and, after the meal, dropped a bombshell. They said, well, unfortunately they were going away on holiday the next day. My initial instinct was panic – I thought, oh no, we’re going to have to find somewhere else to stay in the morning. But then they told us we could stay on without them for the remainder of our time in Vancouver. They told us to have a great holiday, treat the house as our own and just leave the keys on the hallway table on the way out. They didn’t want any money from us to stay there – they were just kind people doing their civic duty.If I was in their shoes, I’m not sure I would entrust the care of my home to three people I’d only just met. But I’m glad they did and I have never forgotten the couple. They went out of their way to help us when they didn’t have to. That generosity of spirit is what, I think, makes us human.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceFrom making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Starmer must regain his nerveJohn HarrisLabour has good ideas and years left to change Britain. Why is it acting as if its time is almost up?Sun 18 May 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 13.54 EDTShareJust under a week on from Keir Starmer’slatest pronouncements about immigration, plenty of people on his own side are still gripped by a queasy sense of fury and disappointment, and it shows no signs of fading away. His aides and allies will now try to gladden left-liberal hearts by emphasising gains fromMonday’s UK-EU summit, and the prime minister’s remodelling of Brexit. But the acrid cloud hanging over Starmer will surely remain, and with good reason.Whatever the surrounding context – and whether or not he was consciously echoing Enoch Powell – his suggestion that Britain risked becoming an “island of strangers” still sounded like a horribly calculated provocation. The insistence that the government was set on closing “a squalid chapter for our politics, our economy, and our country” was even more brazen. So was the suggestion after years of “a one-nation experiment in open borders…the damage this has done to our country is incalculable”. That last claim, in fact, might have been the worst of the lot: a shameful example of a prime minister reducing a story replete with complexity and nuance – and raw humanity – to cheap and nasty hyperbole.Starmer is obviously set on trying to avenge the impression that he is a rather hesitant, dweeb-ish politician by playing the hardman, an act he hasbroughtto his posts on social media: “I’ve already returned over 24,000 people with no right to be here. And I won’t stop there.” And as the resulting anger simmers on, a lot of it is mixed up with a familiar dismay about where the government has ended up. Its planned cuts to disability benefits will soon face a Commons vote, and there is speculation that a huge Labour rebellion could lead to a government defeat. Continued angst about the cut to the winter fuel allowance may yet spark at least a partial U-turn. Many Labour MPs scrabble around for positives, and can find things – school breakfast clubs, VAT on private schools, arise in the minimum wage– that might get them through the odd interview, but do not neutralise a biting disquiet.Hanging over everything is a question that has nagged at Starmer and his colleagues since they arrived in office: what is this government here for? Imagine if his talk about incalculable damage and squalid failure were concentrated on the issues that any self-respecting progressive government ought to be focused on: poverty, industrial decline, the UK’s awful class divisions. The idea that we are on the way to becoming an “island of strangers” would work better as a sharp critique of the same inequalities. But Starmer rarely talks about that stuff.Away from big diplomatic occasions, an administration elected less than a year ago is behaving as if its time is nearly up, and strategy and policy substance must be sacrificed on the altar of desperate electioneering. Starmer seems to hover over his own government, deferring and delegating while setting no coherent agenda. Rachel Reeves, meanwhile, remainsin thrall to Treasury orthodoxy: the origin of no after no, in a country that has not heard a significant “yes” in far too long.To say that millions of people – and places – have yet to see any improvements to their lives might sound impatient; the more relevant point is that they see no sign of any change coming. Stagnation and decline, moreover, are the root of the angry, fearful mood that now eats away at mainstream politics. All those grievances about migrants are not wholly reducible to economic factors – some people, it has to be said, simply have pretty questionable views about human difference – but if the country were in a more prosperous condition, the complaints would surely not be nearly as loud. Faragism is what you get when the established political class seems so bereft of answers that a shameless opportunist is able to swagger into the resulting void, offering his own prejudices as the answer.But as unlikely as it may sound, it is just about possible to imagine things being at least slightly better. The government has four years of its full term to run. The optimism it catalysed back in July last year may have been very brief, but it was real. In the not-so-distant past, moreover, there were signs that theLabourleadership had plans for something much better than the mixture of half-measures and cuts that has since materialised.On that score, I think back to the early autumn of 2022, when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng had tanked the economy, and Starmer was offering a creditably bold alternative. It was all about government leading an economic transformation, and something close to a Green New Deal. At Labour’s conference in Liverpool,he talked about a “modern industrial strategy”built on “a true partnership between government, business and trade unions”. The modern state, he said, could “support businesses to innovate and grow” and “bring in the creative genius of our scientists and universities”.At that point, Labour was still committed to the £28bn green investment pledge that waskilled by Reeves before the election. There was a passage in the leader’s keynote speech that sketched out its vision: “Let’s get clean hydrogen energy in South Yorkshire, in the east of England … Offshore wind in Scotland, Teesside, East and North Yorkshire. Solar power growing rural communities,”Starmer enthused. He promised not just a million new jobs, but training for plumbers, electricians, engineers and builders. Here, it seemed, were the beginnings of answer to the longstanding predicament of at least some of those places in the “red wall”. “And it will all start ,” he said, “within the first 100 days of a new Labour government.”Some of those ideas live on in the scaled-down policies still being pursued by Ed Miliband’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. But they are neither properly funded, nor put at the heart of the government’s messaging, which squashes the idea that a green industrial policy is a matter of improving people’s lives. A fortnight ago, Richard Tice, Reform UK’s deputy leader, responded to his party’s victories in Lincolnshire by announcing its quest to tear down industries that contribute about£980m to that county’s economy and account for more than 12,000 jobs: “We will attack, we will hinder, we will delay, we will obstruct, we will put every hurdle in your way,” he said.In the House of Commons, Starmer recentlyattackedReform and the Tories on exactly this basis. So why not boost the policy, and do that all the time? The way to beat these people is not to thieve their lines about migration: it liesin pointing out that a party of nostalgists and chancers has nothing to say about any realistic version of our future.Since theforced departure of Louise Haigh, the government’s first transport secretary, policy on buses and trains has gone eerily quiet. Even more importantly, the government should go back to its past talk about making social housing thesecond-most common kind of tenure besides private ownership, and make it real, as a matter of urgency. These moves ought to be bundled up with meaningful devolution, including the fiscal powers that Reeves and the Treasury still refuse to hand down.Then, perhaps, Labour might have a story about the modern UK characterised by something we seem to have mislaid: a vision that is the opposite of all the rage and complaint that now runs riot across the political right.That same mood seems to have infected a government increasingly defined by its nervousness and lack of imagination. The result is the strange spectacle of a newly elected administration with the most pessimistic understanding of its own prospects – the kind of mindset that, at this rate, will lead not just to defeat for the Labour party, but nightmarish national harm: incalculable damage, some people would call it.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourImmigration and asylumIndustrial policyGreen economyInequalityReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s time to expose the climate deniersCarla DenyerLabour has allowed climate action to become synonymous with hardship.Farage’s Reform is exploiting that – but we offer real solutionsCarla Denyer is co-leader of the Green party of England and Wales and MP for Bristol CentralSun 18 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 12.30 EDTShareWhen Iannounced recentlythat I won’t be standing in this summer’s elections for the Green party’s leadership, many people wanted to know why. My answer is that I’ve always been guided by the question: “How can I make the biggest positive impact?”. I’m so proud of what Adrian Ramsay and I have accomplished over the past three and a half years: taking our party from one MP to four, from 450 councillors to more than 850, and growing and diversifying our membership. Having achieved what I set out to do,I’ve decided that for the next few years, I’ll pour all my skills, passion and energy into being the best MP I can be for my constituents in Bristol Central, using my seat in parliament to fight for the changes this country needs.Since becoming an MP in July last year, I have found myikigai– a Japanese concept describing the intersection of work that you love, you’re good at, and is what the world needs. There’s plenty I don’t love about how parliament works, but I feel incredibly motivated to be a voice asking “why can’t it be better?”, and a pair of hands working with others to try to build a better country.I joined theGreen partybecause I wanted to change the country for the better, and I believed the best way to do that was by getting more Greens elected. In 2015 I was persuaded to stand for election myself – first as a councillor, then as an MP and then, at the insistence of friends and party colleagues, as co-leader of the Greens in 2021.I’m incredibly grateful to those who gave me that push. Few moments more perfectly capture that journey than standing at my own election count in the early hours of the morning, about to be interviewed, and hearing reports come in from around the country that we had hit our target and secured not only my seat, overturning a 28,000 Labour majority, making a total of four constituencies, along with an amazing 40 second-place results. We had absolutely smashed our previous records.Before I got into politics I was a renewable energy engineer. I got my first job in the sector in 2008, in Newcastle. It was clear to me that there was a massive opportunity to use the skills and experience of workers in the oil and gas industry to move this country forwards. I worked on a report about making British North ports into locations where offshore wind turbines could be manufactured and then shipped. For a while, working as an engineer was how I made my contribution to resolving the climate crisis. I wanted the UK to build more wind and solar projects, faster.It quickly became clear to me that the real barrier wan’t engineering but government inaction. Since I wrote that report 17 years ago, there have been countless missed opportunities. Successive governments have held their hands up and watched as people are forced out of work, communities lose their industries, and young people made to choose between poor-quality employment at home or taking jobs abroad.It’s no wonder people feel let down, nor that the climate denialism peddled by politicians who arefundedby the fossil fuel lobby is beginning to resonate. This government, like its predecessors, has allowed climate action to become synonymous with closed factories, personal hardship and decline. The reality is that oil and gas giants have exploited workers and poisoned our environment, extracting maximum profits and taking them offshore. Now the oil is running dry and the industry is dying, they’re cutting their losses, laying off workers and hollowing out communities.It’s time for government to wake up and grasp what’s in front of its eyes: thousands of skilled and knowledgable workers – and a booming green energy industry just crying out for the government to tap into it. That’s why I’ve introduced theenergy and employment rights billto parliament: it would compel the government to work with unions and communities in order to secure British jobs and put the UK at the centre of the industries of the future. It would make big polluters pay for workers to learn new skills. And it would ensure that investment in the government’s newGB Energysupported jobs and industries here in the UK, rather than losing them abroad.The Green party’s voice has never been more needed – not only to take the fight to a Labour government that is making all the wrong choices, but because we are the antidote to Reform UK. We offer genuine solutions to the very real grievances that Nigel Farage’s party is tapping into. I’ll be handing over the baton to a new Green leadership team in September, but I’m not going anywhere. I will continue to be a loud and persistent part of the Green team, fighting for the future we want to see.Carla Denyer is co-leader of the Green party of England and Wales and MP for Bristol CentralExplore more on these topicsGreen partyOpinionClimate crisisEconomic policyCarla DenyerEnergycommentShareReuse this content"

To him I say: that ship has sailed, and the customer is always rightSun 18 May 2025 09.59 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 11.09 EDTShareGiorgio Locatelli despairs of diners who spend more time scrolling on their phones than “enjoying the moment”. The Michelin-starred cheftold a podcast it was saddiners weren’t interacting with each other more. But the real question is: is any restaurant experience more enjoyable than a video of grumpy cats?I was taught to believe that the customer is always right. The premise of this idea is simple: a customer pays money to receive goods or services, and in return a business must move mountains to ensure they receive them. The customer is sacred, in other words.Increasingly, however, I’ve noticed my high standing as a person with money to burn being challenged. And it’s usually by someone who wants to dictate how I use my phone. But let me be clear: this is futile. My message to any business owner who thinks otherwise is this: the world has already dictated the indispensability of the mobile phone; if you want my money, you have to accept my scrolling.Locatelli would like diners to scroll less and talk more. Indeed, at his flagship restaurant Locanda Locatelli (now closed), he introduced a no-photo policy. He laments that people converse less in restaurants than they used to, and prefer instead to spend time photographing food or scrolling the socials. This is a brave thing to admit at a time when business isn’t exactly booming for the hospitality industry. Forbidding humans in 2025 from using phones in your restaurant is tantamount to forbidding humans from asking for alternatives to cow’s milk. It’s just what we do now.And sure, in days gone by perhaps we did engage in more conversation – but that was probably because there was no alternative. It would have been impractical in 1995 to pull out a massive broadsheet and read a polemic on world politics in between main course and dessert. Now, within the confines of a handily sized black rectangle, I have all the day’s discourse at my fingertips. What person could expect to compete with that? And there is no way I’m losing my Duolingo streak because someone thinks their gratin tastes better with conversation. I’m on more than 1,000 days, mate. Nothing would taste good in a restaurant where I was expected to sacrifice that.Restaurants need to give us customers what we want, not what theythinkwe want. The truth is, we are all addicted to our phones. This means we have to be taken as we are. For all the mourning over yesteryear, I doubt there are many custodians of spaces who dislike mobile phones so much that they would rather live in a world without devices. It is precisely this primal need to broadcast nice meals that we’ve eaten that is keeping the restaurant industry alive. If you don’t want us to take pictures of your food, why put stuff on the plate very precisely, with tweezers? Why does the puree look as if it was applied deftly with a paintbrush? I can’t think of anything more deserving of a place on our Instagram grid than a finely plated meal. And I can’t think of a better advertisement for a restaurant, either.And this takes us to the crux of the matter. Better a restaurant filled with silence because everyone is on their phones than a restaurant filled with silence because it’s empty. Besides, more often or not, we’re still having a conversation – even if it’s with apassive/aggressive owl.Athena Kugblenu is a writer and comedianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But even my favourite hen can’t mix me a martiniSun 18 May 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 14.43 EDTShareIam starting to think the international research community might be in the pay of pets. It’s not an allegation I make lightly, but have you been following companion animal news recently? First,research from the University of Kentconcluded pets were equivalent to £70,000-worth of life satisfaction and wellbeing,roughly equivalent to the psychological benefitsof being married. Then,in a Hungarian study, dog owners reported “greater satisfaction with their dogs than with any human partner except their child”. And nowa survey of 31,299 pet ownersreveals 58% of people find cats and dogs more comforting than people at stressful times, outranking spouses, friends and kids. It all feels a bit OTT; a bit, “Did a dog write this?”Someone needs to fight back for human relationships, and it falls to me. This is not a position in which I ever expected to find myself. British women of my vintage tend to model ourselves on the late Queen, wearily tolerating humans but joyfully enthused by corgis andcows. In girlhood we fixated on guinea pigs or ponies (shades of Penelope Chetwode, who on becoming pregnant, said: “I wish it could be a little horse”); now we manage our menopause symptoms by acquiring and then lavishing love on rescue donkeys, a flock of homicidal geese or a goldendoodle with psychological problems.It’s pretty much a given that we prefer pets to partners. I’m certainly more physically and verbally affectionate with my favourite hen than with my spouse: “I adore you,” I whisper fervently, cradling her in my arms and kissing her tiny, empty head. When my husband puts his arm round me, I tell him he’s hurting my dodgy hip and wriggle free to complain about the recycling.But at the risk of alienating my community, I do like him much better than any pet. Because there are things partners can offer that pets absolutely cannot – and I don’t mean sex (though, yes, that too).View image in fullscreenRabbits have lovely characters, but no opposable thumbs.Photograph: Posed by models; Westend61/Getty ImagesOpposable thumbsHuman thumbs are great: no hen has never made me a sandwich (or, indeed, chauffuered me on a four-hour trip to Preston to collect more hens).Moral supportWhen I was made redundant, my dog sat on my knee for five minutes, tops. In a crisis, my husband can be counted on to conjure 14 schemes of escalating insanity to resolve it while mixing me near-fatally strong drinks and inventing disgusting insults for my adversaries. A comforting physical presence is good, but jokes and dry martinis are better.Sharing the burdenYour dog, cat or horse doesn’t care about persistent black mould, unauthorised overdraft fees or why the boiler is making that ominous noise. It’s understandable – but it’s also sort of rude. You live here too, mate, and much of the overdraft is attributable to: your Dreamies habit; stealing and eating an entire fruitcake; trying to die from a tummy ache (a horse thing, apparently); and so on.LifespanUnless you have a tortoise, one the greatest tragedies of companion animals is our incompatible lifespans. If your pet is a tortoise, it’s worse: you’ll need to consider succession planning (our sons are bafflingly unthrilled by their future reptilian responsibilities).A sense of occasionHumans generally know when a fuss needs to be made.Petshave no sense of occasion, except in the sense that your birthday/wedding/Beyoncé gig is precisely the time they will eat an entire fruitcake or be struck by life-threatening tummy ache.MannersI don’t exactly have dowager countess etiquette standards, but I do have limits, and jumping on to my plate to steal my lunch, as my hens do, crosses a red line. My husband would never do this; nor would he dream of waking me at 4.45am to demand breakfast, like my best friend’s cat does most mornings.GossipThis is the clincher. Yes, a companion who can speak is a mixed blessing but consider this: pets never want to share an exciting neighbourhood scandal they’ve discovered, chew over family drama or engage in scurrilous speculation about acquaintances. You will never catch your pet’s eye in public and know how much fun you’ll have later rehashing what just went down. And that, for me, is the pinnacle of relationship satisfaction, whatever Big Pet tries to tell us.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPetsOpinionAnimalscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a grand coincidenceDave SchillingThe document is  a reminder we’ve been fighting autocracy for centuries – and we can’t give up nowSun 18 May 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 14.43 EDTShareSometimes, miraculous financial windfalls happen when you need them most. A college student finding $20 in a jacket pocket on a Friday night. A relative who you didn’t really even like dropping dead and leaving you with a hefty inheritance. Or an institution of higher learning discovering they have an original copy of theMagna Carta. I’m sure you can relate.Harvard Universityrecentlyfound the antiquities equivalent of a $20 billin its archives. What was once thought to be an unofficial copy of King Edward I’s declaration of principles is now confirmed to be one of seven remaining legitimate documents left in the world. Harvard purchased this item in 1946 for a whopping $27.50, or $452.40 in today’s money. Now that the piece’s provenance is confirmed, it’s fair to say it’s actually priceless.I’m sure you’ve read the wholeMagna Carta, right? But if you haven’t, here’s the basics. The Magna Carta was drafted by Archbishop Stephen Langton as a means to squash a conflict between King John and a group of wealthy barons who felt they were being wrongly persecuted by the crown. The king accepted it in 1215. It laid out certain protections against undue royal influence over finance, justice and religious freedom, and created a council of 25 barons who would check the king’s authority. The Magna Carta fell in and out of favor and was only loosely adhered to, but King Edward reaffirmed the charter during his reign as a means of currying favor during a time of heavy taxation and to avoid a civil war.It’s far from a perfect encapsulation of democracy, mostly because it focuses primarily on the rights of the wealthy barons, but it served as an inspiration to numerous nascent democracies around the world, including parliamentary Britain and the United States. It affirmed rights, granted authority to those outside the direct orbit of the crown, and created a system of checks and balances. Pretty handy thing to keep around. Not quite like a prenup, since the parties in question were unfortunately married already. More like a postnup that stipulated the rules of engagement for a couple that were already growing sick of each other. The British royal family and the people of the United Kingdom just can’t quit each other, can they?This original copy of Edward’s reaffirmation of the Magna Carta, which apparently dates to 1300, is not something one can just hawk on eBay, but Harvard might want to consider at least talking to Sotheby’s. As of now,Donald Trumphas frozen almost$3bn in federal grants and contractsto the university to punish them for what he refers to as “radical left” ideology and the hiring of vocal liberals in positions of authority. The Magna Carta might not fetch $3bn (unlessJay-Z is feeling extra nostalgic). So, probably not the epic lottery windfall they would need. But, as it has always been, the Magna Carta is more valuable for its symbolism than its practical worth.The Magna Carta affirms rights, but it also suggests that no person is above the law, that they can’t circumvent the rights of others on a whim. Thatsomeonehas to have the power to push back. That is, of course, anathema to the current American administration, which values loyalty and silence above all. That Harvard, which issuing Trump over his actions, has this symbol in its archive is a grand coincidence of history, but also a powerful reminder that humanity has been fighting blind autocracy for centuries. The powerful will always seek to possess and wield more power. The only thing that prevents tyranny is a shared belief in limits. Sound governance is a constant tug of war, both sides yanking at an invisible rope. If one side lets go of the rope, the other side inevitably falls over from the lack of opposition force. Then, we’re all in the mud, aren’t we? There is no system if one side gives up. The game is up.I can’t imagine Trump actually wants to win that way. He thrives on a fight. He yearns for the joust of the campaign. Trump had arally to commemorate his first 100 daysjust because he missed the combative nature of a campaign speech. Ruling as a king is actually deeply lonely. It is against everything the US, perhaps the most ruthlessly competitive nation on Earth today, stands for. The Magna Carta should remind us all that it’s our duty to push back. Not just for the sake of democratic systems of government, but also to keep Trump from getting bored.Let’s do everything we can to keep this elderly mind sharp. Trump needs a sparring partner. If not the liberal intellectuals, who will it be? Who else is there for him to complain about? He probably hasn’t hailed a cab in 30 years, so that won’t do. The cost of eggs? He probably doesn’t even know how much a dozen costs any more. This is our civic duty, folks. Think of it as elder care. If that man has nothing to fight against, what does his day look like? Some idle chit-chat with his aides? A Yankee game? Aquick trip to McDonald’s, perhaps? Maybe he can gotouch that orbagain. Or maybe he could read the Magna Carta. That’d be fun.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsHarvard UniversityOpinionDonald TrumpMagna CartacommentShareReuse this content"

But it needs saying: arguments alone have no meaningful effect on people’s beliefs. And the implicit societal acceptance that they do is getting in the way of other, more effective forms of political thinking and doing.I’m a researcher who studies the intersection of psychology and politics, and my work has increasingly led me to believe that our culture’s understanding of how political persuasion works is wrong. In the age of Donald Trump, Elon Musk and the rise of the far right, commentators have endlessly opined on the problems of fake news, polarisation and more. But they’ve mostly been looking in the wrong places – and have focused too much on words.Take “debates”. They’re a central part of most election campaigns around the world, seen as so influential that they’re often governed by strict rules around media coverage and balance. Yet evidence suggests that watching debates has no impact on opinions whatsoever. In 2019researchers analysed56 TV debates in 22 elections in the US, Canada, New Zealand and Europe from 1952 to 2016. The study tracked nearly 100,000 respondents to see whether debates helped undecided or decided voters to make up or change their minds. They found no evidence that they did. In 2012, a reporter ran another analysis about whether debates influenced election outcomes.As he put it: “The effects of debates on eventual votes are likely mild, and, in most cases, effectively nil.”There are lots of reasons why debate (and indeed, information-giving and argumentation in general) tends to be ineffective at changing people’s political beliefs. Cognitive dissonance, a phenomenon I studied as part of my PhD research, is one. This is the often unconscious psychological discomfort we feel when faced with contradictions in our own beliefs or actions, and it has been well documented. We can see cognitive dissonance and its effects at work when people rapidly “reason” in ways that are really attempts to mitigate their discomfort with new information about strongly held beliefs. For example, before Trumpwas convicted of various chargesin 2024, only 17% of Republican voters believed felons should be able to be president; directly after his conviction,that number rose to 58%. To reconcile two contradictory beliefs (that presidents shouldn’t do x, and that Trump should be president), an enormous number of Republican voters simply changed their mind about the former. In fact, Republican voters shifted their views on more or less all the things Trump had been convicted of: fewer felt it was immoral to have sex with a porn star, pay someone to stay silent about an affair, or falsify a business record. Nor is this effect limited to Trump voters: research suggests we all rationalise in this way, in order to hold on to the beliefs that let us keep operating as we have been. Or, ironically, to change some of our beliefs in response to new information, but often only in order to not have to sacrifice other strongly held beliefs.But it’s not just psychological phenomena like cognitive dissonance that make debates and arguments relatively ineffective. As Ilay out in my book, probably the most important reason words don’t change minds is that two other factors carry far more influence: our social relationships; and our own actions and experiences.Why our ideas about protest and mob psychology are dangerously wrong | Dan HancoxRead moreA sea of evidence demonstrates that our friends have the power to change our beliefs and behaviour – not by arguing with us, but simply by being around us or showing us new ways of living. Studies onsocial contact theoryshow that when people are set up in conditions to become friends and collaborate, they become less prejudiced against the identity groups their new friends belong to. This phenomenon probably explains many of the advances in gay rights over the past few decades: as people came out, their friends changed their views on homosexuality, resulting in one of the fastest ever recorded shifts in public opinion. Similarly,research showspeople are most likely to engage in climate-friendly action (such as installing a heat pump), if their friends do – far more likely than if they are given cash rewards or other kinds of incentives. Our friendsbroaden our field of concern; they get us involved in the world, and they build the trust that human beings appear to require to open up to new ideas. Their indirect influence achieves more than arguments, especially from strangers, ever could.In other words: when it comes to persuasion, it’s not the conversation, it’s the relationship.Our actions and experiences also have a profound effect, albeit often in counterintuitive ways. For example, research shows that in otherwise similar conditions, women turned away fromhaving an abortionbecome somewhat less in favour of abortion rights, while women granted an abortion become somewhat more in favour. We might expect those denied would become more passionate about access, but apparently not – probably because, in part due to cognitive dissonance, people tend to bring their beliefs towards their actions, even if those actions are compelled. The influence of actions and experiences on belief systems is alsoevident when it comes to climate crisis: those who experience intense climate-related weather events are more likely to believe in climate change and in addressing it.Compared with these influences, arguments alone have comparatively little power. Yet our institutions are still shaped as though words were enough. We’re infrastructurally, collectively trapped in the liberal belief that politics is mostly about talking, then sporadically voting. What’s neededby anyone hoping to promote progressive ideas is not arguments, but an infrastructure that fosters new relationships and experiences. This could look like anything from a waiting area for parents to mingle before school lets out, to a workplace union, to a public park. These forms of infrastructure allow people to relate and act in new ways, building friendships and trust, and encouraging the actions that ultimatelyallow people to change their political views.All this suggests we also need to think differently about what it means to be a good politicalthinker. Thinking well about politics isn’t about “independent” thinking in the sense of thinking on your own. Instead, to think well is to choose our friends wisely, in terms of both diversity and thoughtfulness, so we can learn from and with them. To think well about politics also means to be active in the world – trying new ways of living, having a wide variety of experiences. Unfortunately, in large part due to income inequality, this is harder than it used to be. Sociological research shows that people in countries such as the US and the UK aremore isolatedandless mobilethan ever before. The social fabric we necessarily rely on to unravel our prejudices is shrivelling. That’s part of why the far right is winning: it’s good at mobilising people’s relationships and actions in this shrivelled world, all while capitalising on people’s worsening material circumstances. To fix this, progressives need to take back wealth and power, so that everyone is supported in expanding their lives.Not that I can persuade you just by saying it, of course. Instead, I challenge you to discover this in a more meaningful way:make a connection with someone different, perhaps someone deeply affected by a political issue. Or try a new way of living, something small to start with. See if it doesn’t change your political views, at least a little. Or perhaps it will transform your understanding of politics itself.Sarah Stein Lubrano is the author ofDon’t Talk About Politics: How to Change 21st-Century MindsExplore more on these topicsPsychologyOpinionLonelinessSocial mobilitycommentShareReuse this content"

With a straight face, the minister responsible, Jenny Chapman, told MPs on theinternational development committeethat the age of the UK as “a global charity” was over. But this isn’t reinvention – it’s abdication, wrapped in spin. No wonder Sarah Champion, the Labour MP who is chair of the committee,calledLady Chapman’s remarks “naive” and “disrespectful”. Behind the slogans lies a brutal truth: lives will be lost, and Britain no longer cares. Dressing that up as the “new normal” doesn’t make it less callous.Kevin Watkins of the London School of Economicsanalysedthe cuts and found no soft-landing options. He suggests charting a sensible course through this wreckage, noting that harm from the cuts is inevitable but not beyond mitigation. Dr Watkins’ proposals – prioritisingmultilateralism, funding the global vaccine alliance (Gavi) and replenishing international lending facilities – would prevent some needless deaths. Ministers should adopt such an approach. The decision to raid the aid budget to fund increased defence spending was a shameful attempt to cosy up to Washington. The cuts were announced just beforeSir Keir Starmer’sWhite House meeting with Donald Trump, with no long-term strategy behind them. It’s a deplorable trend: globally, aid levels could fall by $40bn this year.The gutting ofUSAID, the world’s biggest spender on international development, by Elon Musk, was less fiscal policy than culture-war theatre. Foreign beneficiaries don’t vote, and liberal-leaning aid contractors lack clout, so dismantling USAID shrinks “globalism” while “owning the establishment”. But the real casualties lie elsewhere. Memorably, Bill Gatessaidthe idea of Mr Musk, the world’s richest man, “killing the world’s poorest children is not a pretty one”. Countries that built health systems around USAID now face a reckoning. It wasn’t just cash – it sustained disease surveillance, logistics and delivery. Ironically, much of it never left American hands, absorbed by US privateinterests.In the UK, University of Portsmouthresearcherssay aid increasingly serves foreign policy, not development. It’s not justineffective– it’s cynical. Aid should change lives, not wave flags. All this as poor nations’ debt crisis deepens. Without global reform, the Institute for Economic Justicewarns, African nations face a cycle of distress blocking investment in basic needs. The UK recasts withdrawal as progress – holding up Ethiopia and Zimbabwe as model partners. But Georgetown University’sKen Opalomakes a cutting point: in diplomacy, when the music stops, those who outsourced ambition get exposed. Aid dependency, he argues, has hollowed out local ownership. With little planning, many governments now face a choice: take over essential services or cling to a vanishing donor model.Politicians should choose their words carefully. The former Tory development secretary Andrew Mitchell rightlycriticisedBoris Johnson’s “giant cashpoint in the sky” remark for damaging public support for aid. Labour ministers are guilty, too. Britain has replaced moral leadership with metrics, and compassion with calculation. The policy’s defenders call it realism. But without vision, it’s just surrender – leaving the world’s poor to fend for themselves, forced to try to survive without the means to do so.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The evidence suggests otherwiseSun 18 May 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 14.30 EDTShareGovernments chase private investment. Few ask who really benefits. Recently, Labour has been genuflecting to the tech industry in the hope that Britain will become the destination for an AI boom. American tech firms have enjoyed numerous meetings with the secretary of state,Peter Kyle, and ministers have taken aim at competitionregulation, a vital tool for tackling corporate power. In doing so, Labour risks undermining its attempts to build a more productive, higher-wage economy.Just as the EU is adopting a tougher stance on big tech andAI, Labour is moving in a moreconciliatorydirection. Last week, ministers handed the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the regulator with the power to break up big tech firms, a new“steer”to prioritise growth. At Labour’s investment summit last October, Sir Keir Starmer had a friendlyconversationwith the former Google boss Eric Schmidt, and pledged to make the CMA take growth“as seriously as this room does”. The government then installedDoug Gurr, the former head of Amazon UK, as the regulator’s new chair.A recentpaperby the Institute for Public Policy Research suggests that wooing tech giants by relaxing competition regulation would result in short-lived and uneven growth. A better approach would be tackling the power of dominant firms, which would produce a healthier, more dynamic economy, allowing medium‑sized businesses that pay tax in Britain to flourish. This would also improve people’s experience of the “everyday economy”, a realm thatonce interestedRachel Reeves. As dominant firms become more powerful, they squeeze out competitors and charge higher prices. The economists Jan Eeckhout and Jan de Loecker found that between 1980 and 2021, average global“markups”(the difference between what a product sells for, and how much it costs to produce) rose threefold.This is eroding living standards. People have experienced these markups at vet surgeries, where smaller companies have merged and costs have soared bymore than 60%over the last decade, and in funeral businesses, another sector that is increasinglyconsolidated. A 2020 CMAstudyfound people resorting to payday loans and food banks to cover the cost of burying a loved one. Powerful firms find it easier to profit in moments of upheaval: after Russia invaded Ukraine, energy and food companies hiked their prices and others followed suit, creating aninflationary spike. The climate crisis and trade wars will provide even more opportunities for powerful firms to defend their profit margins at a cost to everyone else.The CMA has form in targeting corporate power. It ordered Meta to sell thewebsite app Giphyand it initially blocked Microsoft’s merger with the games developer Activision, a decision Microsoft’s president hyperbolically described as“the darkest day in our four decades in Britain”. Perhaps that is why Labour seems intent on softening the regulator’s approach.This will do little to lift Britain out of its low-wage, low-productivity slump. Firms with huge market power don’t need to innovate or invest to boost productivity, since they can rely on charging as much as possible to customers, and paying as little as possible to workers. As John Kingman, formerly of the Treasury,recently put it, governments should  avoid “pandering too much to … incumbents, when  in a low-productivity economy the incumbents tend if anything to be a big part of the problem”. Labour should heed that advice.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionCompetition and Markets AuthorityRegulatorsKeir StarmerEric SchmidtPeter KyleRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

Major number three forScottie Scheffler, the first outside Augusta National and the latest stride towards golfing immortality. A year on from being bundled into a police cell during his last attempt to lift the Wanamaker Trophy, Scheffler took no prisoners. Dancing to the jailhouse rock. Jon Rahm swung and missed at the new US PGA champion before capitulating under sheer frustration. Nobody else seriously featured.Scheffler earned himself $3.4m (£2.5m) plus further daylight between himself and the rest at the summit of the world rankings. The most remarkable thing about Scheffler is how unremarkable he makes all this seem. This is a golfer who has walked up to the 72nd green of a major holding six-, five- and four-shot leads. He has no experience of anxiety in such scenarios because of his own ability to steady the ship as others waver.US PGA Championship 2025: Scheffler storms to third major title after Rahm falters – live reactionRead moreA 71 enable him to breeze home by five at 12 under par. Second belonged to Harris English, Bryson ­DeChambeau and Davis Riley.The biggest criticism of hosting the year’s second major at Quail Hollow has been that aPGA Tourevent is played here every year. Many felt this tournament did not feel suitably distinct. Scheffler certainly did not; this is his 15th victory since early 2022. The gap between wins from last September to the start of this month, when Scheffler prevailed at the Byron Nelson, felt like a drought.ThisUS PGASunday was not without flickers of drama. Scheffler began round four with a three-shot lead. The advantage was stretched to five within the same number of holes. This felt like a procession.Rahm then made things interesting. Birdies at the 8th and 10th placed him within two of Scheffler. Rahm had dual motivation; to prove his switch to LIV had not blunted his major capabilities and to win a first US PGA for Spain. As Scheffler made a bogey at the 9th and Rahm a birdie at the 11th, we had a tie.

Should there have been any doubt he would do precisely that? Birdies at the 10th and 14th – Rahm failed to take advantage of the gettable latter – placed this tournament back into Scheffler’s grip. The Green Mile bit Rahm. He dropped a shot at the 16th to leave Scheffler again leading by three. Rahm then found water at the short 17th. Race, run. Scheffler had five shots to spare when finding a fairway bunker from the 16th tee. Rahm cracked his drive into water at the last, smoke flowing out of his ears. As Rahm signed for a 73 and share of eighth, it was so hard to remember what had happened just hours before. Rahm finished seven shots behind Scheffler.DeChambeau’s erratic day at the office involved 70 shots. Too much of the US Open champion’s fine work was undermined by sloppy wedge play during this major. “I’m pretty disappointed,” said DeChambeau. “But Scottie is an incredible golfer and I’ve got to look forward to trying to get to his level.” English played the back nine in a wonderful 31, his 65 blasting him up the leaderboard.

The Masters champion’s aggregate was three over par. There will be an element of reset required after the emotion and heroics of Augusta National. A 69 from ­Sergio García was not sufficient to allow the Spaniard to talk up his hopes of a Ryder Cup reappearance, at Bethpage in September. “The way I’m playing, even if Luke [Donald] offered me a pick right now, I would tell him no,” Garcia said. “So obviously I need to get better. I need to get more where I was just before the Masters, just to show myself and show everyone that my game is solid and it can help the team. It’s as simple as that. The good thing is that there’s still months until the team is finalised. I have time to gain some confidence and improve a little bit on my game.”García watched on as his compatriot Rahm sought to make history for their country. He could not. Still, the mere fact Rahm made this interesting for a while is to his huge credit.

Sealing second place in thePremier Leaguefor a third successive season is not exactly the scenario the Arsenal manager would have envisaged for his side’s last home match when they kicked off against Wolves in August.Celebrations were noticeably muted as Arsenal’s players paid their respects to the home supporters on the customary lap of honour.Everton fans celebrate in style to mark end of an era at Goodison Park | Andy HunterRead more“It was emotional because of the way I feel,” Arteta said. “We had a dream to win trophies and we haven’t achieved that. But we have to make sure we are still valid – just expecting something, that’s a really dangerous thing.“I know [the fans] don’t want us to be knocking on the door every year, but we have to stay very clear and ambitious about what we want to do in the summer.”At least Arteta had the immediate satisfaction of finally getting one over Eddie Howe at the fourth attempt this season thanks to another blockbuster from Declan Rice. It leaves Newcastle needing to beat Everton at home on the final day to ensure they join Arsenal in the Champions League.After ending their long wait for silverwareby winning the Carabao Cup, their manager will be desperate for Alexander Isak to recover from a nagging groin problem that forced him to miss their trip here. Newcastle have not won any of the four Premier League games he has missed this season.Other than a goalmouth scramble in stoppage time, Arsenal were able to see out victory relatively comfortably despite losing William Saliba to a suspected hamstring injury at half-time.View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice (left) and Bukayo Saka (centre) are all smiles after the match during a lap of appreciation.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersHowe vented his frustration beforehand that some of his players have been linked with moves away in the summer even after their undoubted progress as a club this season. But the absence of Isak – who has long been coveted by Arsenal and proved their chief tormentor inthe 4-0 aggregate victoryin the Carabao Cup semi-final – meant Newcastle were toothless in attack apart from a 17‑minute spell at the start when they managed five shots on target but could not score.“He went for a scan as a precaution but then it became obvious he wasn’t going to be able to play,” Howe said of the Sweden striker. “A lot will depend on how he reacts in the next few days. It’s in our hands and we have to look at that as a positive.”Arsenal’s comeback against the champions, Liverpool, at Anfield last Sunday was evidence his players still know they had plenty to play for. When Ben White burrowed into the area before he was stopped in his tracks by the lunging Dan Burn, they certainly seemed up for dishing out a dose of revenge against opponents whom they had failed to score against in four of their past five meetings.But David Raya was the busier of the two goalkeepers during the first half. The Spaniard pulled off a strong save from Bruno Guimarães to redeem himself after losing possession to Sandro Tonali and was then required to make a quick readjustment after a Harvey Barnes effort deflected off the heel of Thomas Partey. Raya was back in the thick of it again when he produced a brilliant double save to deny Burn and then Sven Botman from a corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That they lacked creativity in the final third is nothing new.

The hosts seemed to have found more of their rhythm and the breakthrough came when Anthony Gordon was robbed by Bukayo Saka in his own half and Ødegaard’s perfectly weighted pass picked out Rice to sweep home from outside the area. It was only his fourth Premier League goal of the season but,after his Champions League heroics against Real Madrid, underlined why the England midfielder has been Arsenal’s outstanding player.Howe made a triple change and withdrew the ineffective Callum Wilson just after the hour mark. But it was Arsenal who almost doubled their lead when White arrowed a shot just wide.Kai Havertz’s introduction drew a massive ovation from the home supporters, although hearts were in mouths when another substitute – the Arsenal old boy Joe Willock – fired over from a great position inside the area at the other end.Kieran Tierney and Jorginho were given one last chance to experience the Emirates Stadium atmosphere off the bench as they prepare to depart. With the co-chair Josh Kroenke having stated in his programme notes: “We plan to invest to get behind winning and doing better next season,” the hard work starts now for Arteta.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In the No 1’s absence, all eyes and expectations turned toCarlos Alcaraz. At times, the Spaniard has said, the pressure “killed” him.Alcaraz found his way again by focusing on himself, on approaching his tennis with joy and composure, and in the most highly anticipated match of the season he marked the renewal of their era-defining rivalry with a statement victory by toppling Sinner 7-6 (5), 6-1 to win the Italian Open for the first time in his career.By securing his seventh career Masters 1000 title and 19th overall, Alcaraz ended the Italian’s hopes of a perfect climax to a supreme comeback tournament, also halting his winning streak at 26 matches. Since last August, Sinner has compiled a 41-2 record on the ATP tour. Alcaraz is responsible for both those defeats and he has won his past four matches against Sinner, extending his lead in their head-to-head to 7-4.Paolini dominates Gauff to win Italian Open and make historyRead more“Tactically since the beginning till the last ball, I didn’t lose the focus, which is great for me,” Alcaraz said. “Probably one of the best matches I played so far in terms of level, ­maintain all the level during the whole match. So I’m just really proud about that.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Having started the clay-court season with his first Monte Carlo title, Alcaraz is now also the third man since the advent of the ATP in 1990 to win every significant clay title on offer. The 22-year-old won his first Roland Garros title last year and he is a two-time Madrid Open champion. Although this match was played in Sinner’s home country, the clay remains Alcaraz’s turf.With each win for Sinner in Rome, the Foro Italico has gradually become a flood of orange, which between Sinner’s hair colour and the much-parodied instance of him eating a carrot on-court early in his career, has become a symbolic colour for the world No 1 in Italy. Even before the match began, the Italian crowd made its presence felt by chanting Sinner’s name throughout the warm-up.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner’s 26-match winning streak came to an end.Photograph: Andrew Medichini/APDuring their earlier meetings, Alcaraz was punished when he tried to match Sinner’s firepower, with the Italian’s clean, destructive groundstrokes feeding off the rhythm and pace provided by Alcaraz. He has since found success through his variety and patience, mixing up the trajectory and pace of his ground strokes, particularly ­throwing in ample loopier topspin balls, ­alongside his offensive intentions to arrest Sinner’s rhythm and keep the ball out of his preferred strike zone. This victory was a consequence of Alcaraz’s improving discipline and tactical nous.Down two set points on his serve at 5-6, 15-40 in the opening set, Alcaraz locked down his game, ­working a backhand error out of ­Sinner on the second set point before sealing an excellent hold. It was, as ever, also decided by a stroke of genius. At the end of a tense tie-break at 6-5, Alcaraz closed down the net and killed the set point with a spectacular backhand drop volley. With the opening set secured, Alcaraz opened his shoulders and played with freedom until the end as he earned another significant distinction.Even beyond Sinner’s success on the court, this was an ­astonishing few weeks in the life of a new national hero. Whether in his practices, matches or even just when fans would catch glimpses of him in the private player areas, swarms of fans followed. Around the Italian capital, he is simply impossible to avoid with so many advertisements bearing his likeness. During the tournament, he even had an audience with the new pope, giving Leo XIV, an avid player, a tennis racket and balls.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is still an excellent week that has re-established him as one of the top contenders for all tournaments. There will be many more battles between them to come.“For sure there are some things like we saw today what we have to improve if we want to do good in Paris. I am closer than expected in a way of everything,” Sinner said. “But in the other way, it was good.“It was a great week for me. Some matches incredibly well, some matches could be better.

The Briton was finally able to revel in a shared joy with his team that has been truly short on the ground this season.He returned fourth place, his best grand prix finish this season, from 12th on the grid after a race where ­Ferrari made the absolute most of their strategy and the seven-time champion ducked and dived, making pass after pass with an enthusiastic verve that hints at just what he might do if the team could deliver a better ride.A buoyant Hamilton was understandably in fine spirits afterwards, taking genuine pleasure in a hard fought result in his first race for ­Ferrari in front of thetifosi.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen shows his delight on the podium.Photograph: David Davies/PAFor Verstappen, in beatingLando Norrisand Oscar Piastri into second place and third place at a circuit where the McLaren had looked so quick, was no little coup and with fine timing too on the occasion of Red Bull’s 400th grand prix. By taking his fourth win in a row at Imola, Verstappen has ensured he is still front and centre in the championship, with Piastri now leading by 13 points from Britain’s Norris and Verstappen in third, 22 points back from the Australian.Putting it in context gives it even more weight, as Verstappen’s season thus far has been perhaps most challenging in just maintaining an equilibrium. From the lows of ­Bahrain, which followed a win in Japan, there was a surge again in Saudi Arabia, but having then finished fourth, 40 seconds behind the two ­McLarens in Miami, the rollercoaster for ­Verstappen and Red Bull in Imola hurtled upwards once more.It was a win that, for all that the race did ebb and flow as two safety car periods and strategy calls played their part, had surely been decided within scant seconds of the lights going out. But what a way to decide it, a moment to savour and indeed one Verstappen might enjoy looking back on.Piastri had just held his lead from pole entering turn one but ­Verstappen was having none of it. He made an absolute bravura move round the outside to scythe in front as they hurtled through Tamburello. It was all or nothing for the ­Dutchman, who judged it to perfection. He tiptoed on to the anchors as late as he possibly could, for a moment of ­collective breath-holding that lasted but the blink of an eye. Then it was done.­Riding his speed, doubtless to the shock of Piastri, who would have imagined the corner was already his, Verstappen had the lead and with it the race by the scruff of the neck.View image in fullscreenRed Bull’s Max Verstappen gets past McLaren’s Oscar Piastri at the start of the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.Photograph: David Davies/PAAfterwards he reflected, sagely, that it was the bigger picture that really mattered. Notably that on race pace the Red Bull had more than the measure of the McLaren and that is what will really appeal. “I was still on the normal line and I thought I would try and send it round the outside and it worked really well,” he said. “It’s been a very important week for us and the car has performed really well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They played the strategy right taking advantage of the safety cars in a car that has been a handful all season. Yet even as the ­mercurial ride skews from week to week in performance, Verstappen is there, a rock, to coerce out what he can when it is wilful and wayward and to absolutely soar when it is hitting the marks, as it was in Imola.McLaren tried to take the fight to them, splitting their strategy between Norris and Piastri, but – as the team principal, Andrea Stella, conceded afterwards – once Verstappen had the lead they could not match him.Piastri was unlucky with the ­timing of the first safety car just as Hamilton and Verstappen took advantage from it but these were variables the world champion had covered as he proved definitively in haring off to the flag after the second safety car closed the pack up again.Both he and Hamilton have not looked quite so energised for some time and both leave Imola with reason to be hopeful for more. Game on it is, then, for Monaco next week.Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz were fifth and eighth for Williams, Charles Leclerc came from 11th to sixth, George Russell was seventh for Mercedes, Isack Hadjar ninth for Racing Bulls and Yuki Tsunoda 10th for Red Bull.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMcLarenLando NorrisMax VerstappenRed BullFerrariLewis HamiltonnewsShareReuse this content"

The Test captain is set to make his comeback on Thursday in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge, having been sidelined since December aftertearing his left hamstring in New Zealand.He rushed back from a similar injury last year but his recovery this time after an operation has been painstakingly managed and Stokes has left no stone unturned to fulfil his vow to return in peak physical condition. Speaking to the Untapped podcast, the 33-year-old said: “After my first major injury, I remember the shock of it, after the initial adrenaline had stopped, thinking: ‘How has this happened? We did have a bit of a drink four or five nights ago, could that have played a part? It wouldn’t have helped.’Twenty years later: how 2005 Ashes marked end of cricket as we knew itRead more“Then I was like: ‘OK, I need to start changing what I do.’ I don’t think I’ll ever be completely sober but I’ve not had a drink since 2 January. I said to myself: ‘Not until I finish my injury rehab and get back on the field.’ I think the day I wake up and can’t be bothered to do the training programme is getting towards that time you don’t really want it any more. But I haven’t got any interest in stopping.“It’s just getting harder to do everything. Hence why now I feel like I have to work so much harder away from the field, in the gym and all that kind of stuff to just give me the best chance of being out there to perform. But I’ll keep going as long as I possibly can.”Stokes, who is hoping to play a full role as an all-rounder against Zimbabwe, revealed his relationship with alcohol is much changed compared with when he was younger. A talking point in Stokes’s much-publicised court case, where he was found not guilty of affray, was on how much he had consumed during a night out in Bristol that ended in a street brawl in 2017.Cricket and alcohol have been – occasionally uncomfortable – bedfellows at every level historically but Stokes said he and many others have had to adapt to the increasing standards in the professional game. Stokes said: “I can have a social drink now. It used to drive my wife, Clare, mad that I would just be all or nothing. If we’d go for a nice dinner, I never really understood why it was so frustrating to her but all she wanted to do is share a glass of wine with her husband. Now I get it. I can appreciate it for what it is, not just to get me pissed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The stage, a 181km ride from Gubbio to Siena in central Italy, featured the first major shake-up of this year’s Giro in the race for themaglia rosa, with the gravel sectors familiar to the Strade Bianche one-day race suiting Van Aert best.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“This victory means a lot to me, I almost cannot explain it,” Van Aert said. “It had to be here I believe, because this place is where my road career started back in 2018.”Van Aert finished third in the 2018 Strade Bianche and again the following year before tasting victory in 2020, and the 30-year-old Giro debutant made his experience count on a day when others faltered. The Belgian was part of a chasing group which hunted down an earlier breakaway, and alongside Del Toro was able to shake off Egan Bernal and others with 15km to go. The pair then fought for the stage win themselves.There was plenty of action behind, with Roglic going down in the peloton in a crash that also claimed one of the stage favourites in Tom Pidcock, and both riders suffered punctures to put them well out of contention. Del Toro came into the final kilometre with the pink jersey already secured, as the overnight race leader, Italy’s Diego Ulissi (XDS-Astana), had been dropped by the peloton early in the stage, and the Mexican looked to have the legs to take the stage win too.View image in fullscreenDiego Ulissi lost the leader’smaglia rosa.Photograph: Massimo Paolone/APVan Aert, however, had let the Mexican do most of the work in the closing stages and found another gear coming into the final 400 metres on the narrow streets of Siena to overtake Del Toro, and despite a wobble on the final bend, claim victory.“I had to fight all the way to the top through the streets of Siena,” Van Aert said. “And because I know the final pretty well I needed to do the move in the last three corners. I almost missed the last one but the experience of Strade Bianche helped me win today.”Del Toro holds a comfortable 1min 13 sec lead over Spain’s Juan Ayuso going into Monday’s rest day, with Antonio Tiberi third overall, a further 17sec back. Tuesday’s stage 10 is a 28.6km individual time trial from Lucca to Pisa.Explore more on these topicsGiro d'ItaliaCyclingPrimoz RoglicnewsShareReuse this content"

That is what we are trying to achieve. That will make us only stronger. That is what we need because we saw [Manchester] City spending £200m in the [January] transfer window. All of them will. Apart from the transfer window, we can also improve certain aspects ourselves.”As with most teams challenging at the top, Liverpool have been the victim of the opposition using underhand methods in matches in an attempt to disrupt the rhythm, which has clearly irritated Slot. “One of the things you cannot do anything about is that tactics are being used that have nothing to do with football,” he said. “Delaying the start of the game, pretending you are injured, taking one minute for a free-kick, one minute for a throw-in. That is my main worry. When we have dropped points, that tactic was used. I like to say it now after us winning the league, not [after] losing a game.“I don’t wake up during the night but if I did I might be like: ‘Shit. There’s no answer to be found to that type of play.’ Every time we drop points, that happened … goalkeepers taking one and a half minutes. I am hoping for the league …Rúben Dias said something about it[about Southampton’s negative tactics], too, which is not always the best moment to say it after dropping points. But for me he was right. Southampton can do what they want but we as a league must find an answer.“People always tell you the Premier League is so intense, so intense.

A spending review due to be published on 11 June will set out the government’s priorities for the next three years.Speculation has increased that the chancellor will be forced to cut departmental budgets or raise taxes to stay within her fiscal rules after a weakening of the economic outlook and the prospect of lower tax receipts.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has instructed all areas of the NHS to raise productivity to release funds for investment.However, unions have begun to call forinflation-busting pay rises this summer, adding to the squeeze on the public purse.Cebr said the UK’s overall productivity – which combines private and public sector employees – had experienced persistent sluggishness since the 2008 financial crisis and that the country measured poorly relative to several of its peers.In 2023 the UK’s productivity ranked below Germany and France. Relative to the US, productivity in the UKwas 19% lower.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under the dual headwinds of shrinking productivity and rising wages, the public purse is under mounting pressure to maintain its staffing costs and output.“Policymakers will need to consider how to boost efficiency while navigating tight fiscal rules and a changing labour market.

If this government is serious about building a preventative state, it must act decisively to improve the prospects of our children and young people.“What’s more, the dividends from doing so need not be decades away; the right action now – for example, for those joining the workforce within a few years – can deliver better health, opportunity and growth within this parliament.”Dr Jamie O’Halloran, a senior research fellow at the IPPR, said: “The earlier we address both physical and mental health challenges for children, the more likely we can prevent costly health conditions and worklessness later in life. This is not just a matter of improving individual lives, but also of alleviating long-term pressures on the state.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “As this report demonstrates, prevention is better than cure. That’s why this week, we expanded access to mental health teams in schools to almost an extra million children.“We are investing an extra £680 million for mental health services, recruiting 8,500 extra mental health workers, and delivering an extra 345,000 talking therapies.“Through our Plan for Change, we will tackle the mental health crisis and give every child a healthy start to life.”Explore more on these topicsChildren's healthMental healthUnemploymentHealth policyLabourHealthEnglandShareReuse this content"

Although AS is often fatal, patients survive and regain a normal life if it is detected and treated early.Nevertheless, more than 400 people a year with AS die because they cannot get access fast enough on the NHS to a life-saving non-surgical procedure called transcatheter aortic valve implantation (Tavi), it has emerged.The disclosure has come from a survey of Tavi waiting times at the 35 specialist centres across the UK that provide the procedure. Heart doctors say the findings have exposed an “unacceptable” mortality in Britain linked to the fact that it carries out far fewer Tavi procedures than many other European countries.‘She was so fit, so well’: the heart patient who died before getting vital procedureRead moreDr Jon Byrne, a cardiologist at King’s College hospital in London, who initiated the research, said: “Of all the people on the waiting list to have Tavi, 8% died before they received treatment – 8% is a big figure. That 8% is just over 400 patients a year.“It’s disturbing that this is happening. While some of those waiting die of other conditions, a significant proportion of them would have survived if they had been treated with Tavi.”The true death toll is much higher – probably about 800 a year, Byrne said – because the survey only received data from 18 of the 35 centres. AS mainly affects people in their 70s, 80s and 90s.The research, by the medical group Valve for Life, also found that:A death rate as high as 20% at some hospitals which perform Tavi.The average waiting time for the procedure across the UK is 142 days – over 20 weeks – even though those with severe AS have a 50% risk of dying.White patients are more likely to undergo Tavi than those from minority ethnic communities.In an article for the website Cardiology News that will be published on Monday, Byrne writes: “These findings expose a growing crisis in access to Tavi across the UK.“Despite the dedication and expertise of clinicians delivering exceptional care under increasing pressure, system inefficiencies, health inequalities and capacity constraints continue to put patients at risk.”The long waiting times for patients between being referred for Tavi and having it “are leaving thousands of patients at risk”, Byrne writes, in an opinion piece co-authored with Wil Woan, the executive director of the charity Heart Valve Voice.Woan said: “Evidence collected by the European Society of Cardiology shows that the UK is well behind Europe in the amount of TAVI we do. It means that lots of people are dying unnecessarily.“TAVI gives people with AS their life back. It makes them fitter, stronger and healthier. The NHS needs to expand the number of people who have it.”NHS England is understood to be developing plans to tackle mortality through a fast-track process under which the most urgent AS cases will undergo Tavi within eight weeks.Delays in accessing Tavi also put “a significant strain on the NHS” because patients who go untreated end up needing to be admitted to hospital as emergencies, the authors add.Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, the British Heart Foundation’s clinical director, said: “It’s concerning to hear red flags raised about patients dying whilst waiting in situations in which a timely heart procedure may have saved their life.“Nearly four out of 10 people are waiting more than 18 weeks [for treatment], which is too long when it comes to heart conditions, where timely care is critical.“Long delays at this scale put people at risk of living in ill health or being unable to work due to heart failure which could have been avoided, and having their lives cut short.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care acknowledged that heart patients were facing long delays.A spokesperson for the department said: “Because of the dire state of the NHS this government inherited, patients around the country, including those suffering from aortic stenosis, are waiting too long for treatment.“Through our plan for change, we are delivering the investment and reform needed to get the NHS back on its feet and provide faster treatment for everyone who needs it, including those waiting for Tavi.”Meanwhile, growing numbers of people in the UK under 65 are dying of heart attacks and strokes, reversing decades of progress on cardiac disease, the British Heart Foundation warned on Monday.The rate of people aged 20-64 dying of heart problems rose from 49 per 100,000 in 2019 to 55 per 100,000 in 2023, analysis by the charity shows. Deaths from cardiac disease among working age adults rose by 18% over the same period, from 18,693 in 2019 to 21,975 in 2023 – 420 a week.The increasingly unhealthy population, health inequalities, obesity and Covid-19 are among the factors that explain the upward trend, the BHF said.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthHeart attacknewsShareReuse this content"

The Awakening is being presented in the Marche du Cannes, the industry market in the basement of the Palais du Cinema.The gala is not an official part of theCannes film festival. However, the Carlton hotel is one of the premiere sites of festival activity. The Guardian has contacted the festival’s press office to clarify whether Spacey will be granted the privilege of a red carpet appearance.In July 2023, Spacey was found not guilty of sexually assaulting four men after a four-week trial at Southwark crown court, in one of the UK’s most high-profile #MeToo trials. He was previously cleared of sexual assault charges in a 2022 civil lawsuit in New York.Since 2017, more than 30 men have accused Spacey of sexual assault or inappropriate behaviour, which led to Netflix shelving his biopic of Gore Vidal and removing him from the last season of House of Cards.Earlier this year, Spacey responded bullishly to remarks by the actor Guy Pearce, who reiterated claims that Spacey had behaved inappropriately on the set of 1997 film LA Confidential.Pearcetold the Hollywood Reporterthat Spacey “targeted me, no question”. He said he was “scared of Kevin because he’s quite an aggressive man”, before revealing that he had broken down in tears on learning of other allegations against Spacey in 2017.“We worked together a long time ago,” Spacey responded in a video, addressing Pearce. “If I did something then that upset you, you could have reached out to me. We could have had that conversation, but instead, you’ve decided to speak to the press, who are now, of course, coming after me, because they would like to know what my response is to the things that you said. You really want to know what my response is? Grow up.”Last week, the Cannes festivalbanned an actor from the red carpetafter it became aware of allegations of rape against him. And the festival’s opening day, last Tuesday, was overshadowed by the conviction of one of its most lauded figures, the actor Gérard Depardieu, on sexual assault charges.View image in fullscreenDepardieu in Cannes in 2015.Photograph: Thibault Camus/APOn Saturday, Sebastián Lelio’s musical The Wave had its Cannes premiere. The Chilean director’s new work was inspired by #MeToo-adjacent protests that shut down several colleges in Chile in 2018.News of Spacey’s imminent visit to Cannes was met with a muted response on the Croisette. “I used to love Kevin Spacey as an actor”, said Valèrie Guelminger, who was part of a throng of spectators waiting for stars to walk the red carpet. “But now I feel sad and disappointed, and I am not sure I would cheer him on if he walked by now.”“There are so many high-profile white men who could get an award like that, so why invite him?” said Stephanie Johns, 44, a Canadian screenwriter visiting the festival. “Couldn’t they get anyone else?”The PR guru Mark Borkowski, an expert in brand and crisis management, said Cannes and the French film world had for many years offered “a huge amount of support” for another controversial figure, Roman Polanski. “They have a track record,” he said.Borkowski said the award, which could be seen as “the film world taking Spacey back into their bosom”, was clearly a “very significant” moment.“It feeds into the slow battle Kevin Spacey has fought, which is to get his purpose back. His purpose and whole being is to be an actor and he is, without doubt, one of the most extraordinary acting talents of any generation,” he said.“He is not someone who has disappeared into the ether; he has fought it all the way and he has powerful supporters because ultimately he made a lot of people a lot of money.”In terms of brand management, Borkowski said the biggest issue was that people had “short-term memory loss and long-term amnesia”.“We move on from things. This [the Spacey award] shows that everyone has a shot of redemption; it shows that the further you get away from the noise of a scandal you can change the emotion of the crowd, right or wrong.”Big tech was changing the world, he continued. “A publicist’s job nowadays is not to convince an editor, it is to turbocharge the algorithm.“There are a lot of people who want to see Kevin Spacey back. I don’t have an opinion either way but ultimately, whatever he does next it will create clicks, it will create noise … you can’t be mediocre any more.”Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsGérard Depardieu#MeToo movementGenderKevin SpaceyShareReuse this content"

Just 11% of respondents described themselves as frequent users.Linguistic experts at the language learning software Babbel, which commissioned the original research, were so struck by their findings that they asked McLendon to give the 500,000-strong London Student Network a 10-question multiple-choice quiz on the semicolon. She found more than half of respondents did not know or understand how to use it.As defined by the Oxford Dictionary of English, the semicolon is “a punctuation mark indicating a pause, typically between two main clauses, that is more pronounced than that indicated by a comma”.It is commonly used to link together two independent but related clauses, and is particularly useful for juxtaposition or replacing confusing extra commas in lists where commas already exist – or where a comma would create a splice.It first appeared in the work of Italian scholar and printer Aldus Pius Manutius the Elder in 1494 but, despite its longevity, has long been marmite grammar.Lynne Truss, author of Eats, Shoots & Leaves, has castigated it as “dangerously habit-forming”. She added: “Many writers hooked on semicolons become an embarrassment to their families and friends.”Truss is not alone in her antipathy: Goosebumps, RL Stine’s classic horror series for children, has one semicolon for every 200,000 words. Cormac McCarthy used 42 semicolons in his first book, The Orchard Keeper – but then just one across his next nine novels. EL James was criticised for repeatedly using commas inaccurately instead of semicolons in her Fifty Shades trilogy.But the form of punctuation also has its staunch supporters: along with Charles Dickens, Mark Twain and Jane Austen, Abraham Lincoln stood strong on the issue. “I have a great respect for the semicolon; it’s a very useful little chap,” he said.Virginia Woolf relied heavily on the semicolon in her novel-length meditation on time, Mrs Dalloway; the book includes more than 1,000 to echo its hero’s flow of conscious thought.Nor could Salman Rushdie, John Updike and Donna Tartt have reached the literary heights that they have achieved without the help of an average of 300 semicolons for 100,000 words each.But to paraphrase the semicolon-supporting Twain, reports of “useful little chap’s” death might have beengreatly exaggerated: Google Books Ngram Viewer, which includes novels, nonfiction, and even scientific literature,showsthat semicolon use in English rose by 388% between 1800 and 2006, before falling by 45% over the next 11 years. In 2017, however, it started a gradual recovery, with a 27% rise by 2022.Perhaps, therefore, it will not be Vonnegart who wins out in the battle of the semicolon, but the rash, witty, louche Camille Desmoulins, as recreated by Hilary Mantel.In her novel A Place Of Greater Safety, Mantel imagined the politician, writer and best-known journalist of the French revolution having no doubts about it at all: “I wonder why I ever bothered with sex,” she quotes him as saying. ‘There’s nothing in this breathing world so gratifying as an artfully placed semicolon.’”Take our semicolon quiz1.Which of the following punctuation marks is a semicolon?\":;'Reveal2.Which of these sentences uses a semicolon correctly?The tourism bureau suggested that visitors purchase an all-inclusive travel pass; as well as download the travel app.The buses run from 6 am to midnight; the subway runs from 5.30 am to 12.30 pm.People who ride the bus tend to ride shorter distances; while people who ride the subway tend to go farther.Reveal3.Which of these sentences uses semicolons correctly?The company has offices in Glastonbury, Somerset; Preston, Lancashire; and Bradford, Yorkshire.Products in the catalogue include drill presses; routers; and belt sanders.Customers appreciate the durability of the tools; the speed of the shipping; and the responsive customer service.Reveal4.Which of these sentences uses a semicolon correctly?Heloise and Abelard’s correspondence is a window into 12th-century lives; whose details may surprise 21st-century readers.Charlotte, Emily and Anne Brontë wrote under masculine pseudonyms; not an uncommon practice for the time.Renaissance-era paintings show striking advances in realism and perspective; earlier paintings look flat and cartoonish in comparison.Reveal5.Which of these sentences needs a semicolon instead of a comma?The animal rescue, which is run entirely by volunteers, supports seven boroughs in Tyne and Wear.Nonprofit organisations may receive financial support from foundations, and they also can get government grants.Rural residents often must travel farther for services, it’s part of country living.None of these; they’re all fine.Reveal6.Which of these sentences needs a semicolon instead of a comma?The visitors wanted to try all of the local favourites, so they went to a market where food trucks gather.They tried street tacos, falafel, and even a cup of squid ink pasta.Everyone had a great time, in fact, they asked to go back again the next day.None of these; they’re all fine.Reveal7.Which of these sentences needs a semicolon instead of a comma?Taylor Swift brought a new group of fans to American football, however, not everyone welcomed the “Swifties.”David Beckham, who played for Manchester United, was a star even before he started dating Posh Spice.Manchester City fans suffered through decades with a mediocre-to-terrible team, so the team’s recent run of success has felt especially sweet.None of these; they’re all fine.Reveal8.Which comma should be replaced by a semicolon in the following sentence: To bolster their language skills, six students went to Berlin, four went to Barcelona to do an internship.After “skills”.After “Berlin”.Neither; both are fine.Reveal9.Which comma should be replaced by a semicolon in the following sentence: The organisation is looking to expand its clientele, moreover, it’s hiring 25 new employees.After “clientele”.After “moreover”.Neither; both are fine.Reveal10.Which comma should be replaced by a semicolon in the following sentence: After the rains, the city’s west side was covered in mud and debris, making several roads impassable.After “rains”.After “debris”.Neither; both are fine.RevealExplore more on these topicsLanguageShareReuse this content"

Some of these investment funds used branding such as Sustainable Global Stars and Europe Climate Pathway.Over $18bn was invested in the five biggest polluters: TotalEnergies, Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP. These topped a2023 Carbon Majors rankingfor oil and gas production among shareholder-owned firms. Other investments by funds following EU sustainable finance disclosure regulations (SFDR) included those in US fracking company Devon Energy and Canadian tar sands company Suncor, the investigation by Voxeurop and the Guardian found.Investors claim that holding a stake in a company allows them to influence the firm’s pursuit of climate goals. However, no major oil and gas producer has plans consistent with international climate targets and many companies have weakened their plans in the last year, according to areport from Carbon Tracker in April.The investment firms with the biggest stakes in fossil companies in their green funds were JP Morgan, BlackRock and DWS in Germany. The investment companies have not breached the SFDR rules, which do not explicitly rule out some fossil fuel holdings. Campaigners said change was needed to avoid people being misled.“For a fund claiming to be ‘green’, holding investments in major fossil fuel companies should be a red line,” said Giorgia Ranzato, sustainable finance manager at Transport & Environment (T&E). “Since oil majors are not contributing meaningfully to the energy transition, any investment in such companies by a green fund is essentially greenwashing. To effectively combat this, T&E and other organisations advocate for a meaningful review of the SFDR.“It is diabolical for banks and asset managers to invest billions in major fossil fuel companies under the rubric of ‘green investing’ when we need to accelerate investments in non- and low-carbon energy, in carbon efficiency, and in carbon removal technologies,” said Richard Heede at theClimate Accountability Institute.A BlackRock spokesperson said: “BlackRock’s funds are managed in accordance with their investment objectives, that are clearly disclosed in each fund’s prospectus and on BlackRock’s website. Our sustainable funds are managed in line with applicable regulations governing sustainable investing. For investors that have decarbonisation investment objectives we offer a range of products that provide such exposure.”After being contacted by the Guardian, a spokesperson for asset manager Robeco said its Sustainable Global Stars fund would remove “sustainable” from its name. A spokesperson said the fund had a 20% better CO2 footprint than the market index and that the firm had “productive and intensive engagement” with TotalEnergies.The investigation analysed the ownership in the last quarter of 2024 of the publicly traded fossil fuel companies listed in the Carbon Majors report, using the London Stock Exchange Group Data & Analytics platform. It found $33.5bn held by green funds in 37 large fossil fuel companies.The fossil fuel investments were in funds regulated underSFDR rules, specifically articles 8 and 9, which respectively deal with the promotion of “environmental or social” goals and “sustainable investments”. More than 480 investment companies had these types of investments, which included stocks in fossil fuel companies.European ‘green’ investment funds hold billions in major fossil fuel companiesThe investigation also found more than $1bn of shares in the five fossil fuel giants in funds using green keywords in their title in March 2025:A Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) fund called Europe Climate Pathway had $88m invested in Shell, BP and TotalEnergies. In total, LGIM held $210m in “green” funds.The Robeco Sustainable Global Stars fund had $40m in TotalEnergies. Overall, Robeco held $207m in these funds.Another fund, a State Street product called World ESG had $43m in combined investment in all five of the oil majors. ESG is a label for funds promoting environmental, social and governance goals. In total, State Street Global Advisors UK held $243m in the “green” funds.The financial institutions with the biggest fossil fuel stakes in their article 8 and 9 funds and those using green keywords were JP Morgan Asset Management and its UK subsidiary with $3.2bn, DWS in Germany with $2.2bn and BlackRock Investment Management UK and BlackRock Advisors UK with a combined $1.7bn.The SFDR regulations were not originally intended to be used in marketing but the classifications have been used to showcase a financial product’s environmental credentials.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The new guidelines include “transition” funds, where managers should demonstrate the investments are on a “clear and measurable path to social or environmental transition”.The deadline for application of the new guidelines is 21 May. BlackRock and JP Morgan Asset Management announced in March and April respectively that they wouldremove words such as sustainable and ESGfrom some fund names. Campaigners said they could have acted sooner. JP Morgan, DWS, LGIM and State Street all declined requests to comment.The guidelines are not legally binding but from 21 May national financial regulators will be able to require companies to report publicly whether their products comply with the rules and could choose to sanction any guideline breaches.Paul Schreiber at Reclaim Finance said: “We need strict rules that ban investments in companies developing fossil fuels from any fund with an ESG-related description. This is precisely what the SFDR failed to do. In this context, thereview of the regulationsmust include strict fossil fuel exclusions covering all fund categories.”An Esma spokesperson said: “Our focus is on supporting [national authorities] to implement the current guidelines, as they are only becoming applicable to existing funds on 21 May. In the future, if needed, we will evaluate the possibility of changes to the guidelines together with competent authorities, also bearing in mind potential developments in the review of the SFDR.”TotalEnergies has said the company supports the objectives of the Paris Agreement and that its strategy is consistent with a global temperature rise of less than 2C.

When they are properly looked after and restored, they can provide immense benefits for people and nature, supporting otters, kingfishers and dragonflies as well as barge users and walkers. A 2019 report, Waterways in Progress, published by the Inland Waterways Association (IWA), memorably describes Britain’s canals as “a linear national park”.The charity’s 2023-24 annual report emphasised the “continued effect of climate change taking its toll on our ageing canal infrastructure,” reflecting on how “following prolonged hot dry weather the summer before, a succession of winter storms caused significant damage, with an aggregated impact of £9m in emergency works”.CRT is facing serious financial pressure. The report shows a shortfall in funding, with an income of £237,300,000, but a total expenditure of £252,400,000.The CRT does not only look after canals themselves, but weirs and reservoirs. There have already been problems with its ageing infrastructure; in Derbyshire in 2019a dam at the Toddbrook reservoir nearly burst, leading to the town of Whaley Bridge being evacuated.About 1,500 people were instructed to leave their homes immediately after heavy rain caused a large section of a nearby dam spillway at the reservoir to fall away. Emergency crews pumped water away from the reservoir and sandbags were dropped from RAF helicopters. A worst-case scenario predicted that the whole structure could collapse, wiping out the town.Charlie Norman, the director of campaigns and public affairs at the Inland Waterways Association, told the House: “It is quite terrifying how that incident could have ended: the sheer volumes of water contained in the reservoir presented an immediate danger to life. Our internal research suggests the volume of water was comparable to 551 Olympic pools, or equivalent to the daily water consumption of 8.6 million people. That volume of water is unimaginably powerful.”For the first time, the IWA has warned about the risk to life that can come from a lack of maintenance of canals: “It is not an overstatement to marvel that so far there has been no loss of life – ageing infrastructure is expensive to maintain without anything going wrong, and that’s the point: investment now will save money in the near and distant future … When adding up the costs, we should be thankful that those costs for the moment don’t include loss of life”.Richard Parry, the chief executive of the Canal and River Trust, said without a funding solution, the canals could eventually dry up due to the climate crisis, and this poses safety issues too. He added: “Who knows what the impact of that would be? I mean, our fear is not just the ecology would be irrevocably harmed, but you probably also get canal walls drying up and collapsing, there’s the safety aspect too.”A Defra spokesperson said: “Our canals provide a wide range of benefits, such as connecting people to nature. That is why we are providing more than £500m of grant funding to the Canal and River Trust between now and 2037.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWaterClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Harrity assists in monitoring more than 110 cameras across a wider area for an alliance study that began in 2020 to record the effects of Trump’s barrier on cross-border movements for local wildlife.“That [movement] won’t happen once the wall is complete,” he added of that stretch of the Arizona-Mexico border.That completion now looks set to become a reality. “CBP is soliciting bids for construction of 24.7 miles of border barrier around International Boundary Monument 102 in the Sonoita Border Patrol Station area of responsibility,” a CBP spokesperson told the Guardian in an email, referring to the smallstone obelisks, or monuments, that have traditionally been dotted along the international line.A satellite map of the stretch of the Arizona/Mexico border where CBP has proposed building a new pedestrian border wall.Outside the San Rafael valley, the stretches of border wall designed to keep people out of the US with 30ft-high steel posts spaced just four inches apart are impassable to anything larger than a jackrabbit, the speedy, long-legged hares typical of the area. Once this valley is walled, too, it will sever acritical wildlife corridorfor animals migrating between Mexico and Arizona.Erick Meza, borderlands coordinator for the Sierra Club environmental advocacy group, said walling the valley would be “catastrophic for the environment and wildlife”.On 27 April, the US House of Representatives homeland security committee unveiled its proposed budget,allocating $46.5bnto fund new chunks of barrier on the almost 2,000-mile US-Mexico border, wherebuilding a wallwas a focus andhighly vexedissue in the first Trump administration and isfar from complete.The new push for more wall comes as unauthorized crossings by people migrating to the US through or from Mexico had been falling fast last year after Joe Biden tightened restrictions and have now reached historic lows. This was noted by CBP and trumpeted with inflammatory language by the Trump White House, even as the president spoke of “invasion”.“Even when numbers were the highest, people were crossing in areas that already had a border wall,” said Meza. “San Rafael valley never saw those numbers.”Critics are furious.“It’s an expensive, unnecessary, and environmentally disastrous project,” said Harrity of the barrier, which can cost up to $30m per mile. “If completed, this wall will sever a continent.”Successful legal challenges to federal actions on the border can be difficult, but opponents are intensively researching their options.And tall metal boundaries, which not only impede animals but, when under construction and being patrolled, causehuge damageanddisruption, are not the only worry for wildlife advocates. Trump has also announced a plan to further use the military and take over vast swaths of public lands along the border.A presidential memorandum in Aprildirected the transferof a 60ft-wide strip of federal land running along the border in California, Arizona and New Mexico, known as the Roosevelt reservation, to US military control.That could mean new military bases and staging areas which, state actions inTexas have shown, create environmental havoc.‘Why doesn’t anybody care?’ Texas-Mexico border devastated by anti-migrant operationRead moreMyles Traphagen, borderlands director for the Wildlands Network, is concerned that large military facilities could be constructed in the region, further enhancing the human footprint of an already militarized border.“It’s an invasion,” said Traphagen. “An invasion of our public lands.”Mark Nevitt, an Emory University School of Law professor, said the president appeared intent on an unprecedented use of “national security language associated with executive power, [such as] ‘invasion’ and ‘under attack’, that appears to expand the military’s role in immigration enforcement”. Healso fearsthat Pentagon funds will be funneled into more wall building on land to be designated as “national defense areas”.Noah Schramm, border policy strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, called the intended step-change in militarization “uniquely alarming” and warned that troops could be used to apprehend migrants and civilians alike for allegedly illegally entering a restricted military areaView image in fullscreenA section of unfinished border wall in 2021.Photograph: Zuma/AlamyIn Arizona, 63% of the border has already been sealed off and the remaining open sections are critical for wildlife, with the San Rafael valley being one of the last intact expanses of Sonoran desert grasslands in the state. The area’s rugged Huachuca and Patagonia mountains, part of the Sky Island range, serve as stepping stones across a harsh desert by offering a range of habitats, food sources and water for animals.“The biodiversity here is incredible,” said Meza, of the Sierra Club. As well as bears, mountain lions and wolves there are subtropical species such as the wild pig-like javelina, and rare big cats – ocelots and jaguars, with natural ranges of hundreds of miles between countries in search of food, water and mates.“This is at the heart of all these different ecosystems coming together,” Meza added.As Harrity of the Sky Island Alliance drove his battered red pickup through the wilderness he passed a lone pronghorn, the strange, antelope-like creature that is the fastest land mammal in the Americas. The San Rafael valley was entering year three of a severe drought, he said.“When it rains, it can look like Scotland,” he said. In dry times like now, the valley looks more like the African savanna, with rolling hills of native grasses awash in soft yellows, oranges and rusts. “A study in browns,” he added, bouncing along toward the only greenery visible – cottonwood trees lining the Santa Cruz River.Harrity said that as theclimate crisisexacerbatesdrought inthe south-west, wildlife in the border region will need to range farther and farther seeking food and water. In 2021 a Mexican grey wolfknown as Mr Goodbarpaced 23 miles along the border wall searching for a place to cross into Mexico. After days, he finally gave up and returned to the Gila wilderness area in New Mexico.“The last thing we should be doing right now is walling off corridors and severing connectivity,” Harrity said.A javelina is seen on a trail cam attempting to squeeze through a portion of existing border wall in 2023.A javelina is seen on a trail cam attempting to squeeze through a portion of existing border wall in 2023. Video: Sky Island Alliance/Wildlands NetworkThe Santa Cruz River is a vital animal migration corridor that meanders into Mexico and back to Arizona. “The river will now be walled on both legs of its journey,” said Harrity. A nearby wildlife camera recently captured a video of a mountain lion carrying its prize, a dead coyote, into Mexico.The valley is almost devoid of people. And it lacks the telltale signs of migration in the borderlands: ripped clothes on bushes, discarded backpacks and empty water bottles. In five years, a camera by the river has never captured an image of a migrant crossing into the US, even though it’s one of the few parts of the valley with shade and water.On a hill above the river an agent in a white and green border patrol SUV looked on.Then in New Mexico, to the east, near the small town of Columbus, Traphagen of Wildlands Network pointed from a hilltop brightened by red-flowered ocotillo plants to the longest contiguous section of border wall in the US. Eighty miles of three-story-high posts cutting through sand dunes and volcanic hills like a giant serpent, all the way to El Paso, Texas.As the spring wind picked up, the steel pillars began to reverberate and hum. “When the wind really gets going, it sounds likeTuvan throat singers,” said Traphagen of the central Asian singers who can produce a low vocal rumble and a high whistle-like toneat the same time.Many of the Wildlands Network’s trail cameras are pointed toward “construction anomalies,” said Traphagen, where posts have been mistakenly placed five or six inches apart instead of the usual four. Those extra 2ins do not affect human crossing but can allow animals, such as javelina and coyotes, at least, to pass through. That subtle difference would also reduce the number of posts needed to build thehugely expensive border wall. “That’s probably $30m worth of steel there,” said Traphagen, pointing in passing to an abandoned construction staging area from the previous Trump administration containing thousands of steel pillars stacked like the kids’ building toy Lincoln Logs.Other trail cameras are placed near open floodgates, resulting from a2023 lawsuitrequiring the border patrol to open intermittent gates in the barrier to allow larger animals to pass.“This camera has captured over 1,000 videos, and we have never seen a person crossing through,” said Traphagen. It points along a sandy wash marked with the paw prints of rabbits, coyotes and badgers. Of the eight cameras checked during one long outing at the New Mexico border, only one had captured any evidence of migrants.But in a 2024 study by the Wildlands Network and Sky Islands Alliance, motion-activated cameras along 100 miles of walledborder showed an 86% decrease in wildlife crossings and a 100% reduction for animals such as wolves, bears, pronghorns, and jaguars.“The Trump administration would rather score cheap political points and a favorable Fox News headline than solve a problem. Instead of wasting taxpayers’ dollars, undermining military readiness and jeopardizing American families’ safety, Trump and [Elon]Muskshould focus on actually fixing our brokenimmigrationsystem,” said Martin Heinrich, US senator for New Mexico and a Democrat.“New Mexicans who live on the border want actual solutions, like creating new legal pathways for immigration, investing in effective border security for law enforcement, and addressing the root causes of mass migration,” he added.Back in the San Rafael valley, Traphagen noted that, on top of everything, parts of the original 1955 movie of the musical Oklahoma! were filmed in this beautiful spot.“It will be a tragedy to see a pristine grassland … turned into a military zone,” he said.A mountain lion is unable to pass a section of the border wall in November.A mountain lion is unable to pass a section of the border wall in November.

This took the average asking price to a new record of £379,517, after a previous record was set last month.It marks the fifth consecutive year in which asking prices have reached a record level in May, a time of year when the British property market istraditionally at its busiest, as sellers feel their homes and gardens are primed to attract bids, and buyers start to look around.UK mortgage lending at four-year high amid rush to avoid stamp duty riseRead moreHowever, the monthly seasonal price increase was the lowest since 2016, as price growth was limited by the number of homes for sale, which stands at its highest level in a decade.The property market has been more subdued this spring than usual, with lower demand from new buyers, after a busy first quarter of the year as buyers in England and Northern Ireland raced to beat thedeadline for changes to stamp duty.Temporary cuts to stamp duty in England and Northern Irelandcame to an end at the start of April, after the announcement by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in her October budget. Scotland and Wales set their own taxes on house purchases.The property market was busier than usual in March, the report found, while new buyer demand slowed in April to 4% more than the same month in 2024.Despite this, demand so far this year is still 3% ahead of last year, and there are signs of a bounceback in May.Rightmove suggested that some buyers might have been waiting for theBank of England’s most recent cut in interest rates. Policymakers at the central bank lowered rates by a quarter point to 4.25% earlier this month.Tom Bill, the head of UK residential research at the estate agents Knight Frank, said: “The interest rate environment should continue to improve and looser mortgage lending rules should underpin demand later this year. We expect 3.5% average UK price growth in 2025.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The lowest available two-year fixed mortgage rate is 3.72%, according to Rightmove’s weekly mortgage tracker, down from 4.75% last year.Colleen Babcock, a property expert at Rightmove, said: “The 10-year-high choice of homes for sale means that sellers need to be aware of the level of competition they’re facing for the attention of buyers, and the prices that are being advertised in their location.”Despite the lull in new buyer demand in April, the number of property sales agreed last month was 5% higher than at the same time last year.“In the current market, buyers may well have several similar homes to choose from in their area, and a home which appears overpriced compared to the competition may not get a second look,” Babcock added.Explore more on these topicsHousing marketHouse pricesRightmovePropertyReal estateStamp dutynewsShareReuse this content"

All but one of them are in the top 50% wealthiest council areas and eight are in the top 20%.MPs and addiction experts raised concerns that the spread of shops offering 24-hour access to slot machines – consistently ranked among the most-addictive gambling products in health surveys – risked exploiting vulnerable people.Prof Henrietta Bowden-Jones, the national clinical adviser on gambling harms at NHS England, said: “Slot machine venues, particularly those open 24/7, deploy addictive products to keep vulnerable people playing for hours on end, against their own interests.“The Guardian’s findings indicate that the result of this is simply to channel funds from the pockets of the poorest into the pockets of the richest. This comes as the NHS is supporting record numbers who have had their lives destroyed by gambling, with 15 clinics now up and running across England.”AGCs, which feature machines offering spins of up to £2 and jackpots of up to £500, took more than £530m from gamblers in the last year for which figures are available.Burnham said: “It’s time we were honest about what [AGCs] really are,.” He warned that AGCs were “targeting some of the most vulnerable in our communities”.“It’s unacceptable that councils have so little power to regulate them despite repeated concerns from charities and local residents.“We must reclassify these venues in law, give local authorities stronger licensing powers, and hold operators accountable.”The Labour MP Beccy Cooper backed calls from Burnham and a group of more than 30 councils – led by Brent in north-west London – for councils to be given more powers to prevent new AGCs opening.Cooper said she was concerned that AGCs “seem to be clustered in areas of higher deprivation lining the pockets of gambling companies at the expense of some of our poorest communities”.The UK’s largest AGC operator, Admiral Slots, is a UK division of Novomatic, a global gaming corporation owned by the Austrian billionaire Johann Graf, who is worth $10.2bn (£7.7bn), according to Forbes.It has 346 venues in the UK, including bingo halls that also offer slot machines.Its UK holding company, Novomatic UK, has awarded its highest-paid director more than £4m in salary and bonuses over the past two years for which accounts are available and paid its Austrian parent company £82m in dividends.Germany’s Gauselmann family, whose patriarch Paul Gauselmann is worth $2.6bn, according to Forbes, owns Admiral’s biggest rival, Merkur, which has 262 shops.Merkur was fined almost £100,000 by the gambling regulator earlier this year, after theGuardian revealed how staff allegedly exploited a vulnerable cancer patient.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The government are just being absolute losers, and I’m very angry about it.”John described the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, as a “bit of a moron” and said he would take ministers to court if the government did not change its plans on copyright. Last week,Kyle was accused of being too close to big techafter analysis showed a sharp increase in his department’s meetings with companies such as Google,Amazon, Apple and Meta since Labour won the election last July.John spoke before a House of Lords vote on a proposal from thecrossbench peer Beeban Kidronthat would require AI companies to disclose their use of copyright-protected content, giving creative professionals leverage to seek licensing agreements for use of their material.John referred to a similar amendment that received peers’ support last week, only to be removed by the government in the Commons, in a tit-for-tat process that threatens to mire the data bill.“It’s criminal, in that I feel incredibly betrayed: the House of Lords did a vote, and it was more than two to one in our favour, the government just looked at it as if to say: ‘Hmmm, well the old people … like me can afford it,” said John.The government isconsulting on a proposalthat will allow AI firms to train their models – the technology that underpins products such as chatbots – on copyrighted work without permission, unless the copyright holder signals they do not want their work to be used. A source close to Kyle has said this is no longer the preferred option in the consultation, although it remains on the table.The other options are: to leave the situation unchanged; to require AI companies to seek licences for using copyrighted work; and to allow AI firms to use copyrighted work with no opt-out for creative professionals.A government spokesperson said no changes to copyright would be considered unless “we are completely satisfied they work for creators”. The spokesperson added that a recent government commitment to draw up an economic impact assessment of the proposals would explore “the broad range of issues and options on all sides of the debate”.Explore more on these topicsElton JohnArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

The attackforcedM&S to stop its online operationsand has also affected availability of some products in stores.On Wednesday, the retailer is due to report its financial results for the year to the end of March, covering the period before the cyber-attack occurred.Despite this, the focus will undoubtedly be on how M&S is coping with the incident and what it means for the company’s finances, given that its online clothing and home sales are worth about £3.8m a day.The chief executive of M&S, Stuart Machin, hasurged shoppers to visit its stores. However, the retailer is likely to have missed out on clothing sales during an extended period of fine weather.“Fashion sales are likely to be the biggest casualty, particularly as the attack has come during the spell of warm weather when summer ranges would ordinarily be piling up in virtual baskets,” said Susannah Streeter, the head of money and markets at the broker Hargreaves Lansdown.M&S is expected to have benefited from consumers buying barbecue and picnic food to take advantage of spring sunshine, although grocery lines have significantly lower margins than clothing and homewares.It may take the retailer some time to rebuild trust with consumers, given its revelation that somepersonal information relating to thousands of customers– including names, addresses and order histories – was taken in the cyber-attack.M&S has not yet shared a prediction of the financial cost of the cyber-attack but analysts at Barclays have estimated it could cost the company about £200m during the 2025-26 financial year. This is likely to be offset by an insurance payout that could reportedly total about £100m.“We expect and hope the current disruption to be a temporary matter, which we expect to involve insurance claims and modest net financial cost,” said analysts at Shore Capital, which acts as house broker for M&S.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s not because these are our most important allies or the most important countries in the world,” he said of Trump’s visit to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia andQatar.‘Very disturbing’: Trump receipt of overseas gifts unprecedented, experts warnRead more“It’s because these are the three countries willing to pay him off. Every single one of these countries is giving Trump money, the plane from Qatar, an investment in his cryptocurrency scam from the UAE, and they are asking for national security concessions in return.“This is the definition of corruption. Foreign governments putting money in the president’s pocket and then the US giving them national security concessions that hurt our own security.”Rand Paul, a Republican US senator for Kentucky, and chair of his chamber’s homeland security committee, told ABC’s This Week that the gift of the jet “at least gives the appearance of a conflict of interest”.And Mike Pence, Trump’s vice-president during his first Oval Office term, said it was “inconsistent with our security” during an appearance on Meet the Press in which he pointed out Qatar had been previously accused of financing international terrorism.Trump has insisted hewould be “stupid”to refuse Qatar’s offer of the jet, which would serve as the new Air Force One before being donated to his presidential library upon his retirement.But the proposalenraged even close allies of the president, some calling it the opposite of Trump’s promise to drain the swamp – and “a stain on the administration”.Trump lashed out at critics on his Truth Social network on Saturday, claiming the gift was to the US and not personally for him.Murphy told NBC that was not true. “The plane is not a gift to the American people,” he said. “It is going directly toDonald Trump.“That library will take a decade to build, and so once he leaves the White House, until the library is built, he gets to use that plane to fly around all of his billionaire friends while his policies result in millions of Americans losing their healthcare and having to pay higher costs.”Pence said Trump should turn down the offer.“Qatar has a long history of playing both sides.

Qatar has actually financed pro-Hamas protests on American campuses across the US, so the very idea that we would accept an Air Force One from Qatar I think is inconsistent with our security, with our intelligence needs.Trump 2.0 takes quid pro quo fears to new heights with $400m flying griftRead more“There are profound issues, the potential for intelligence gathering, the need to ensure the president is safe and secure as he travels around the world, and of course there are very real constitutional issues. The constitution prohibits public officials from accepting a present from a foreign state.“It’s just a bad idea and my hope is the president will think better of it.”Paul said he could see a way in which the gift would be acceptable – but that Trump had handled the offer poorly.“My fear is that it detracts from a largely successful trip where the president is talking about opening up and doing more trade with the Middle East,” he said.“I’ve been part of vetoing or trying to veto arms [sales] to Qatar, as well as to Saudi Arabia, over human rights abuses. So could it color the perception of the administration if they have a $400m plane to be more in favor of these things. It at least gives the appearance of a conflict of interest.

The ministry of the navy, with the support of local authorities, is currently attending to the wounded.”A Mexicangovernment bulletinsaid 22 crew members were injured, 11 of them critically, with nine in a stable condition. It confirmed that the two who died were navy cadets – and that officials were taking steps to reunite survivors with their families.Mexican officials and media there identified the two victims of the crash as Adal Jair Marcos, 22, a resident of Puebla originally from Oaxaca, and América Yamilet Sánchez, from Xalapa, Veracruz. Both were said to have been on the same mast at the time of the wreck.“The navy, aware of the risks naval personnel face in their operations, deeply regrets what happened and reaffirms its commitment to the crew’s families to provide timely attention and follow-up to the investigations into the events that occurred to accurately determine the causes of this incident,” the bulletin said.The extent of the damage became apparent at first light on Sunday when images showed the vessel docked on the East River with the tops of two masts splintered – and a third dangling at a 45-degree angle.Seven uniformed navy members were spotted boarding the ship, CNN reported.View image in fullscreenPedestrians walking along Brooklyn Bridge Park look on as a masted Mexican Navy training ship sits stranded near the Manhattan Bridge after colliding with the Brooklyn Bridge, Saturday.Photograph: Nick Corso/APMultiple videos of the crash showed the masts snapping and partially collapsing as they crashed into the deck of the bridge. There was heavy traffic on the bridge at the time of the collision.The vessel, which was flying a giant green, white and red Mexican flag, then drifted toward the edge of the river as onlookers scrambled away from shore. Nobody was reported injured on the bridge, which was undamaged, said Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City,in a Facebook post.An earlier statementposted by the Mexican navysaid the Cuauhtémoc would be prevented from continuing its scheduled 254-day voyage. It was taking part in an ongoing celebration of the 200th anniversary of the independence of Mexico – achieved from Spain in 1821 – and was to have visited 22 ports in 15 countries to “carry the message of peace and goodwill of the Mexican people to the seas and ports of the world”.It sailed from Acapulco on Mexico’s Pacific coast on 6 April and was due to make stops in a succession of countries around the Caribbean before crossing the Atlantic to Europe, including stopovers in Aberdeen and London.Its crew consisted of 64 women and 213 men.Sydney Neidell and Lily Katz told the Associated Press they were sitting outside to watch the sunset when they saw the vessel strike the bridge and one of its masts snap.“We saw someone dangling, and I couldn’t tell if it was just blurry or my eyes, and we were able to zoom in on our phone and there was someone dangling from the harness from the top for like at least like 15 minutes before they were able to rescue them,” Katz said.They said they saw two people removed from the ship on stretchers on to smaller boats.TheBrooklynBridge, which opened in 1883, has a nearly 1,600-ft (490 metres) main span that is supported by two masonry towers. More than 100,000 vehicles and an estimated 32,000 pedestrians cross every day, according to the city’s transportation department, and its walkway is a major tourist attraction.The Cuauhtémoc – about 297ft long and 40ft wide (90.5 metres long and 12 metres wide), according to the Mexican navy – sailed for the first time in 1982. Each year it sets out at the end of classes at the naval military school to finish cadets’ training.The Associated Press reported that Saturday’s crash happened as the Cuauhtémoc maneuvered in turbulent waters. The tide had just turned, and a fast current headed up the East River as a wind of 10mph set in.The Associated Press contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsNew YorkBrooklynMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “It is never a question of capturing others by force, by religious propaganda or by means of power. Instead, it is always and only a question of loving as Jesus did.”The pope met Zelenskyy after the mass. In a message on Telegram, the Ukrainian leader said Kyiv was ready for talks in any format in order to get results for ending the Russian invasion of his country, adding that he was grateful to the Vatican for its readiness to host direct talks betweenUkraineand Russia and “for its clear voice to defend just and lasting peace”.Zelenskyy and Vance also discussed an upcoming phone call betweenDonald Trump and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, a Ukrainian official told Agence France-Presse.Leo arrived in St Peter’s Square onboard a popemobile, to the delight of the estimated 150,000 pilgrims who had gathered there.The mass, which marks the official start of the papacy of the Chicago-born cardinal Robert Prevost, is the biggest event to take place at the Vatican sincethe funeral of his predecessor, Pope Francis, in April. Leo is the first US pope in the history of the Roman Catholic church.View image in fullscreenThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the first lady, Olena Zelenska, arrive at St Peter’s Square.Photograph: Stefano Costantino/APBefore arriving at the altar in St Peter’s Square, alongside a procession of cardinals and bishops, Leo received two gifts that symbolised the papacy.The first was a gold signet fisher’s ring, which is named in honour of St Peter, a fisher who was the first pope. The ring represents the beginning and end of a papacy, and when a pontiff dies, it is destroyed by a senior cardinal.The second gift was a lamb’s wool pallium, which symbolises the pope’s role as a shepherd, and is draped over his shoulders before the mass begins.Other world leaders present included the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, and his Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese, as well as the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, and the Argentinian president, Javier Milei. Prince Edward represented the British royal family.Leo, after greeting the crowd with “a heart full of gratitude”, began his homily by recalling the “intense emotions” felt in recent weeks as a result of the death of Francis and the subsequent conclave.Speaking in Italian, he said: “I was chosen, without any merit of my own, and now, with fear and trembling, I come to you as a brother, who desires to be the servant of your faith and your joy, walking with you on the path of God’s love, for he wants us all to be united in one family.”View image in fullscreenLeo arrives at St Peter’s Square in a popemobile.Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/APIn a later passage, Leo said he wanted to preserve the church’s rich heritage while confronting modern challenges. “In this our time: we still see too much discord, too many wounds caused by hatred, violence, prejudice, the fear of difference, and an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth’s resources and marginalises the poorest.“For our part, we want to be a small leaven of unity, communion and fraternity within the world. We want to say to the world, with humility and joy: look to Christ. Come closer to him.”Vance, whobriefly met Francis in the Vatican the day before he died, and the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, represented the US on Sunday.The office for the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said she would meet Vance and Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, at 3.30pm local time to discuss “relations between the European Union and the US, as well as the main issues on the international agenda”.According to La Repubblica, Leo could also hold a meeting with Vance. Rubio said on Saturday that theVaticancould be a future venue for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, echoing the Vatican’s secretary of state, Pietro Parolin, who said on Friday that the Holy See could be a “bridge” for dialogue between the two countries.Zelenskyy spoke to the US president, Donald Trump, inside St Peter’s Basilica in a brief meeting minutes before the start of Francis’s funeral mass.View image in fullscreenThe US vice-president, JD Vance, with his wife, Usha.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/APBefore being elected as pope, Prevost criticised Trump’s administration in several posts on his X account, mainly targeting the government over its policies on immigration.In February he also shared on X an opinion article published in the National Catholic Reporter titled: “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others,” after comments that Vance, who converted toCatholicismin 2019, made in an interview on Fox News.The Vatican has not confirmed or denied whether the social media posts were authentic. Vance and Trump also clashed with Pope Francis over immigration.Prevost’s criticisms led to a backlash from Trump’s hardline conservative supporters after he became pope. The activist Laura Loomer wrote on X: “He is anti-Trump, anti-Maga, pro-open borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis.”Pope Leo XIV would remain active on social media through the official papal accounts on X and Instagram, the Vatican said last week. On X, owned by Elon Musk, the billionaire tasked by Trump to reduce government spending and cut jobs, @Pontifex communicates in nine languages to 52 million followers.Inone of his first posts on Xas pope, Leo wrote: “The Holy See is willing to help enemies meet, so they may look each other in the eye and so people may be given back the dignity they deserve: the dignity of peace.

But it declined to elaborate on how authorities had reached a conclusion on a motive.The bomb, which detonated before 11am, was either in or near a car parked outside the clinic when it exploded, said the Palm Springs mayor, Ron deHarte.Bartkus tried to record video or stream the blast, according to an officialspeakinganonymously to the Associated Press.Aerial images of the damage to the facilityshowedthe burned-out remains of a vehicle in a parking lot behind the clinic.Despite damage to the building, the ARC said its facility would be fully operational on Monday.The Desert Sun reported that the explosion could be felt as far as 2 miles (3km) away.Dr Maher Abdallah, who runs the ARC facility where the explosion happened, told the Associated Press in a phone interview that all of his staff were safe and accounted for.The explosion damaged the practice’s office space, where it conducts consultations with patients.

Brevity, for one thing: five of the six are under 200 pages, and half barely pass 100. They are works of precision and idiosyncrasy that don’t need space to make a big impression. Themes are both timely – AI, the migration crisis – and evergreen: middle-class ennui; the place of women in society. And for the second consecutive year, every book comes from an independent publisher, with four from tiny micropresses. Ahead of the winner announcement on 20 May, here’s our verdict on the shortlist.Solvej Balle’sOn the Calculation of Volume, Book I(Faber, £12.99; translated by Barbara J Haveland) is easiest to introduce through the film Groundhog Day: its heroine, Danish antiquarian book dealer Tara Selter, is stuck in time. “It is the 18th of November,” she writes. “I have got used to that thought.” Each time she wakes up, it’s the same day again, same weather, same people passing the window.This book, the first of a projected seven volumes, mostly explores Tara’s set-up. Despite the cool tone, there’s a sense of excitement for the reader as Tara works out the possibilities in real time. Can she travel overnight? If she takes something out of a cupboard, will it return the next day? And are we all somehow like Tara, living the same day over and over? The high concept, and the sense of a major work under way, make it a strong contender. Even if future volumes don’t live up to this one, for now the reader is happy to be trapped alongside Tara.An even more ambitious headspinner is Japanese novelist Hiromi Kawakami’sUnder the Eye of the Big Bird(Granta, £14.99; translated by Asa Yoneda). If Kawakami has a sweet mode (Strange Weather in Tokyo) and a weird mode (Record of a Night Too Brief), this one is in the latter category. It’s a sort of do-it-yourself work: what seems to be a collection of stories turns out to be a novel, but the reader must piece it together. We’re hundreds of years in the future; countries have disappeared and humans are grouped into self-contained communities. Some people are clones, others exist in a world with hardly any men, and there are unexplained categories of people: “watchers”, “scanners”, “the mothers”. Characters recur across chapters and regions, but they’re too thinly drawn to easily tell apart.The flexibility of the prize – it’s not just for novels – is exemplified in Banu Mushtaq’s collection of stories, Heart LampBut that’s OK: this book is about its ideas, including how societies break down, how we doom ourselves with our failure to get along, and how AI threatens us. Given that human intelligence is so riven with conflict, the book suggests, we might be ripe for replacement by machines. (“Let’s wrap this up,” says one character of humanity.) Its mysteries mean that by the end, when we finally know what’s going on, the book demands rereading – a durability that makes it a plausible Booker winner.If Kawakami isn’t much interested in character, the opposite is true of French novelist Anne Serre’sA Leopard-Skin Hat(Lolli, £11.99; translated by Mark Hutchinson). Right from the start, Fanny is alarming young children and “had a way of standing […] like a question”. Her full-colour character is matched by the book’s askew narrative style, which jumps around a lot. Alongside Fanny is the Narrator, who is not the narrator of the book but her lifelong friend. “It was in slapstick mode they got along best.”We learn early on that Fanny died at the age of 43 (“her small, fair head ascends into the skies”), which gives the rest of the book – an account of her lifelong mental turmoil – added poignancy. The story teems with charm, a tribute to the unconventional and a warning of “the violence done to the tender-hearted” in our conformist society. Fanny’s friend seems to speak for Serre – who wrote the book following the death of her younger sister – when he says: “I love realistic novels, yet the moment I try to write one I yawn with boredom.” There’s no time for boredom in this delightful, sad, idiosyncratic story, though its unusual – even eccentric – style might limit its chances of Booker success.The other shortlisted French writer has a more grounded approach. Vincent Delecroix’sSmall Boat(HopeRoad, £12.99; translated by Helen Stevenson) is inspired bya real-life tragedyin November 2021, when 27 people died on an inflatable dinghy trying to cross the English channel from France. Most of the book is from the viewpoint of a French emergency call handler who fielded pleas for help from migrants on the boat, and who falsely told them no rescue vessels were available.Under investigation by police, our narrator is sometimes unrepentant (“these people … their obsession with flinging themselves into the water”), sometimes filled with shame. Why, she asks, is she blamed, rather than the geopolitical “gigantic storm that sweeps behind them”? Her somewhat repetitive monologue is broken by a vivid account from the migrants’ viewpoint, out on the “insipid, bulging, surly sea”, and the story ends with fitting grimness. Small Boat is undoubtedly timely, which may be why it’sthe bookies’ favourite; but as a novel it lacks the depth of other shortlisted titles, and seems a long shot for the prize.The most talked-about book on the shortlist is Italian writer Vincent Latronico’s PerfectionThe flexibility of the International Booker prize – it’s not just for novels – is exemplified in Banu Mushtaq’s collection of stories,Heart Lamp(And Other Stories, £14.99; translated by Deepa Bhasthi). The selection here is drawn from Mushtaq’s 35-year career. She writes in the Indian tradition of “Bandaya Sahitya” – protest literature against the domination of male-led, upper-caste writing – and her subject is the lives of women.In one story, a new mother whose husband is unfaithful and rude – “One day he had said, ‘You are like my mother’, and with those words had pushed her alive into hell” – is told to be grateful he doesn’t beat her. “Thank God you are in a good situation.” In another, a man becomes obsessed with making his wife wear his sister-in-law’s high-heeled shoes; elsewhere, a woman struggling with school holidays – Mushtaq’s concerns are universal as well as culture-specific – takes her boys to the barber to be circumcised. The tone varies from quiet to comic, but the vision is consistent, as exemplified by the final story, where a woman questions why God requires her to be a “helpless prisoner of life” in subjugation to her husband. Its title? Be a Woman Once, Oh Lord! This wonderful collection would be a worthy winner, though history is against it: stories have never taken the prize before.The most talked-about book on the shortlist is Italian writer Vincent Latronico’sPerfection(Fitzcarraldo, £12.99; translated by Sophie Hughes). You can see why, from its relatability – it’s the story of a modern millennial couple, Anna and Tom – to its literary connections: the book is a “tribute”, in Latronico’s words, to French writer Georges Perec’s 1965 novel Things. In both books, young professional lives have the constructed texture of an advert or social media stream, and are simultaneously given meaning and constrained by the need for possessions and cultural signifiers. Where Perec’s couple had Paul Klee prints and Borges paperbacks, Latronico’s have Monocle magazine and Radiohead vinyl.Written as a detached overview (“They lived a double life.” “They tried travelling”), Perfection exerts a hypnotic hold as Anna and Tom face anew the same problem as every generation before them: how to live? They tie themselves in knots, “worried they were content merely being contented”, and slowly find themselves no longer the focal generation of their era, as the world changes around them. “The cultural centre where old Greeks used to play cards was now the flagship store of a Japanese trainer brand.” Perfection packs a huge amount into a small space: its irony, modernity and irresistible style would make it a popular winner.The winner of theInternational Booker prizewill be announced on 20 May.Explore more on these topicsBooksBooker prizeFiction in translationInternational Booker prizeFictionAwards and prizesShort storiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s basically what Fifty Shades of Grey should have been.Pillion is adapted from the 2020 novelBox Hill by Adam Mars-Jones: a shy traffic enforcement officer falls for the ultimate dominant alpha male – an impossibly handsome, strong, emotionally impassive biker who casually demands complete domestic obedience in exchange for the privilege of being reamed with athletic vigour and thrilling lack of sensitivity, often in a specially modified wrestling outfit.Harry Melling, who becomes more impressive with every screen outing, plays Colin, a sweet, shy guy who lives at home with his mum and dad, Pete (Douglas Hodge) and Peggy (Lesley Sharp) who is in the final stages of cancer and who is always tenderly trying to set him up with dates. Heartbreakingly, Colin sings with his dad’s cheesy close-harmony barbershop quartet every Sunday in the pub in boaters and bow-ties.View image in fullscreenAlexander Skarsgard, director Harry Lighton and Harry Melling at the photocall.Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPAIt is here that he somehow catches the imperious gaze of leather-clad Ray (played with kingly and sexy entitlement by Alexander Skarsgard) who invites or in fact orders Colin to meet him behind Primark at 5pm for a blowjob. Soon Ray is requiring the gigglingly thrilled Colin to cook and clean and shop for him (though of course never permitted touch his motorbike) and sleep on the floor like a dog at his bland house in Chislehurst while Ray reads Karl Ove Knausgård’s My Struggle in bed.Colin – who symbolically rides pillion behind Ray – discovers in himself the ecstatic vocation of the sub. He shaves his head to fit in with Ray’s supercool biker compadres, which incidentally makes him look like a young Christopher Eccleston.But when does sexual role-play become dysfunction? Or coercive control? What does Ray do for a livjng? Is Ray an abuser? Colin’s sceptical mum Peggy actually finds a harsher monosyllabic word for him when Ray finally gets over himself and deigns to accept an invitation to Sunday lunch with this well-meaning elderly couple that he haughtily rejects in any capacity as his parents-in-law. Could it be that only Peggy is uncool enough to have seen through Ray and seen how dangerous the situation is? Or is she just another person who doesn’t get it? (And these uncomprehending people perhaps still include the besotted Colin himself.)It is a real love story, and the movie amusingly and touchingly takes us through the final stages and out the other side, to where Colin has grown or at any rate changed as a person who has come to terms with what he is and what he wants, the way that Ray clearly did long ago. His dad’s barbershop quartet sign off with a rendition of Smile Though your Heart is Breaking. It seems like the only possible advice.Pillion screened at the Cannes film festivalExplore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsAdam Mars-JonesAlexander SkarsgårdreviewsShareReuse this content"

But though this well meaning BBC drama has some startling and impressive moments, it mainly forgets to actually find any dramaJack SealeSun 18 May 2025 17.00 EDTShareThe bombing of Pan Am flight 103 on 21 December 1988 was an event so large, so complex and so significant that for a long time it was hard for anyone to take a clear view on it. Many elements remain murky to this day, despite – or perhaps because of – it being an act of terror that was unprecedented in its effect on Britain and the US. The plane exploded over the small town of Lockerbie inScotland, having taken off from London on its way to New York and Detroit, completing a journey that began in Frankfurt. The hunt for the perpetrators soon focused on the Middle East and north Africa. With half the world demanding answers, the families of the 270 people killed found it difficult to be heard.The hidden human cost of the post-crash chaos is where The Bombing of Pan Am 103, a six-part fictionalisation, initially tries to find its dramatic impetus: the series argues that the dignity of the victims and the sensitivities of their loved ones were trampled. More care should have been taken to respect the dead, it says. But it struggles to turn this admirable sentiment into drama.First we have the disaster itself, and the fateful scenes before it of passengers boarding, and Lockerbie residents going about their innocent pre-Christmas business. For shows about infamous atrocities, these introductory passages are always hard. How long do you linger on these people who are doomed? Lead writer Jonathan Lee employs quick vignettes with mixed results. A girl clutching her teddy bear, a beloved toy that we come across later in a charred field, can’t help but feel cheesy, despite its roots in reality; but the Lockerbie boy who survives the destruction of his family home because he is out organising his sister’s big present is a piercing happenstance.The series does a stout job of portraying the scale and violence of what befell Lockerbie. The force of the blazing debris landing is startling, as is an impressive tableau of a whole street on fire. The sight of luggage scattered on a winding country road, picked out by the weaving headlights of a police car, shows what a horribly macabre scene the early responders encountered.Among the first police to arrive are DS Ed McCusker (Connor Swindells) of Glasgow CID and senior investigating officer DCS John Orr (Peter Mullan). Before long, McCusker is having to tell FBI man Dick Marquise (Patrick J Adams) to give the shocked people of Lockerbie some time before he charges in to interview them; Orr, meanwhile, is dealing with Americans who assume they are the most important person in any room, and a UK government envoy who smugly tries to assert the authority of Britain over Scotland.A squabble over jurisdiction hampering the quest for truth is one thing, but the series seems genuinely exercised by the importance of Orr being in charge, in and of itself. “Scottish soil! Scottish evidence! Scottish procedure!” he barks at someone who doubts his authority, in a way that surely isn’t intended to make him seem parochial and pompous, but does.The drama’s other main focus is the way the bombing brought out the best in compassionate, resourceful people and communities, and here there is no doubt that it has right on its side. Lockerbie locals insisted on staying with bodies that had ended up on their land, not wanting the dead to be left alone; the town’s women volunteered to clean and sort the passengers’ bloodied clothing. Touching gestures of course, but the scenes portraying them don’t have any conflict or stakes – they’re not so much drama as reporting.And on occasion, the show’s desire to pay service to the victims tips into sentimentality. Lead volunteer Moira Shearer (Phyllis Logan) bemoans what she sees as an unacceptable delay in returning a Bible found among the wreckage to the owner’s loved ones, for which she blames Orr’s skewed priorities; the FBI’s top man Marquise dismisses his wife’s emotional paean to the people lost, then relents when he sees a wrapped gift among the effects of one of the deceased. The message is that the investigators ought to have been more mindful of the victims as individuals who mattered – we might value that attitude now, but was that really the case at the time, for senior investigators tasked with solving the mystery of a major international terror attack? Surely they were right to have their eye on the bigger picture.The show’s viewpoint should sharpen in the remaining episodes, which build up a picture of new relationships formed and further inspiring kindnesses exchanged. For now, though, this is a drama that knows its subject matter is important, but isn’t sure why.The Bombing of Pan Am 103 aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewLockerbie plane bombingScotlandAir transportUK security and counter-terrorismreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Love That Remains is a portrait of a fractured family and a sundered marriage which, with its dreamy piano score, fantasy visions and quirky sequences to go with the dead-serious scenes of purported emotional pain, introduces a slightly disconcerting but certainly intriguing new comic tone.Pálmason’s visual and compositional sense is as commanding as ever, with some stunning imagery of the Icelandic landscape. But it is flavoured with a new tone of persistent, playful unseriousness, which finally morphs into a tragicomic spectacle of male loneliness. In some places this film doesn’t have the weight and the impact of his earlier work, but it’s certainly engaging.This is the story of Maggi, or Magnus (Sverrir Gudnason), who works on a fishing trawler. He is now divorced or at least separated from his artist wife Anna (Saga Garðarsdóttir), who creates large canvases and works with metal, and also photographic projects and land art, working often out of doors, on the family’s own land. They have two sons and a daughter, whose granddad is played in cameo by Pálmason’s longtime lead actor Ingvar Sigurdsson; they amuse themselves firing arrows at a humanoid target they have rigged up on a pole – a very dangerous pastime, as it turns out.Poor Magnus is always showing up, asking to see the the kids, hanging out with the family from whom he is now supposedly estranged; at one stage, they go on a swimming-trip-slash-picnic and Magnus is treated to an ecstatic upskirt vision of Anna as she stands over him. Is it actually happening? Or just in his raddled, lonely, horny imagination? But Anna is obviously very exasperated with Magnus and feels sorry for him, against her better judgment, allowing him to be with her and the children because so clearly he has no idea how to manage his post-separation existence, and it is taking a terrible toll. She is beginning to hate him.Or is she? Hard emotional realities of this sort are always being softened and modified by quirky visual inventions. Magnus takes it upon himself to kill the wayward rooster that they keep on their land, because Anna had been complaining about its aggressive behaviour; it is a scene that speaks of Magnus’s own thwarted and diminished masculinity. It is followed by a dream sequence in which this rooster, enlarged to monstrous size and inspired by the scary movie on TV to which Magnus had fallen asleep, comes back to take his revenge. It’s quite funny – but perhaps not funny enough to be fully successful as a poignant moment.There are other dream moments. An obnoxious Swedish art dealer who patronises Anna and her work meets a terrible end. A sword lands Pythonesquely from the sky just next to the children’s sword-target which has a medieval helmet. Meanwhile, near Magnus’s trawler, an old second world war mine has appeared – another flourish of metaphorical danger. The effect is tender, sympathetic, diverting and often very elegant and indirect. But it withholds from us the full, real pain of damaged love.The Love That Remains screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalDrama filmsIcelandEuropeFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was just left there. In the film I look at why it was forgotten and how it was revived.”Bristol is steeped in cinema history. It isthe birthplace of Cary Grantandthe motion picture pioneer William Friese-Greeneand home ofWallace & Gromitcreators Aardman. Forty cinemas once operated in Bristol at the same time and countless films have been made there. Unesco hasdesignated it as a city of film.The Bristol Imax, boasting a 19 metre by 15 metre screen, was once regarded as the future of cinema in south-west England. The projector was the size of a small car and needed to be cooled with water pumped up from the harbour.But the model did not work and after its closure the cavernous auditorium remained largely forgotten and unused until film lovers Timon Singh and Dave Taylor came along.View image in fullscreenA screenshot from The Big Picture.Photograph: Arthur CautySingh is the creator ofBristol Bad Film Club, which screens notoriously, gloriously terrible films, while Taylor is the owner of a Bristol institution,20th Century Flicks, said to be the world’s longest-running video shop.They remembered the existence of the Imax screen and in 2022 asked Bristol Aquarium, which runs the site, if they could stage a festival to markthe 40th anniversary of the video shop. The aquarium agreed and theForbidden Worlds festivalwas launched that spring to show cult horror, fantasy, sci-fi and martial arts films.There were challenges. They couldn’t use the Imax projector so had to bring in their own, a Christie. The opening scene of Cauty’s film features Taylor changing a lamp in the projector. With tense music in the background, Taylor explains how it will go off like a “small bomb” if they get it wrong.View image in fullscreenThe old Imax projector.Photograph: Arthur CautyTaylor said they had no money, no expertise, no safety net and were effectively “squatting” in the cinema. But he said they found people who showed them how to “hack” the space. “It’s all very grassroots, no lawyers, no money, you just find a way to get projects off the ground and survive.”They kept the prices down and the festival proved a huge hit. Audiences have kept coming to an increasing number of events and screenings and the space has been re-brandedBristol Megascreen.Taylor said it felt a little like “atonement” for his small part in people leaving cinemas for – back in the day – video shops and now streaming services.View image in fullscreenThe auditorium.Photograph: Arthur CautyDr Charlotte Crofts,professor of cinema arts at UWE Bristol, said the resurgence of the screen was a “profoundly significant moment” for the city’s independent cinema culture.“Its revival has injected a vital energy into a landscape that thrives on unique cinematic experiences. For too long, this remarkable infrastructure lay fallow, and its reactivation speaks volumes about the power of community-driven initiatives.”View image in fullscreenThe poster for The Big Picture, which tells the story of the grassroots renaissance of Bristol’s Imax screen.Crofts is director of theCary Comes Home festival, which celebrates Grant’s Bristol roots.She said: “From a personal perspective, the Megascreen has rapidly become one of my favourite venues in Bristol. The sheer scale of the presentation offers an unparalleled immersive experience.“The opportunity to present the Cary Comes Home festival on this screen has been particularly rewarding, allowing audiences to connect with classic cinema in a truly communal setting. It underscores the enduring importance of shared theatrical experiences.”Cauty’s film will be shown on 28 May at this year’sForbidden Worlds film festivalalongside cult classics including Aliens, Tremors, Waterworld, and The Whale God.The history of the Imax is summarised in The Big Picture’s strap line: “Built for the millennium, deserted for a decade, revived by the people.”Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsBristolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Next to it is another West Country view, theromantic ruins of Malmesbury Abbeyin Wiltshire.Both show Turner’s interest inthe “theory of the sublime”that came to the fore later in his sea storms and mountain scenes. “It was all very conventional at this stage,” said Warrell, a Turner specialist. “But you can see he is ambitious.”A highlight of the exhibition is a series of seascapes that Turner painted as a much more mature artist in Margate, Kent.View image in fullscreenTurner’s Low Sun and Clouds Over a Calm Sea.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianWarrell said: “He’d been to Margate as a child because London was so polluted that his family sent him to school there, and then he went back again from the 1820s repeatedly.“He’d look out from his lodgings out on to the beach and see the sun rising and setting and the boats and all the goings on. Turner said the skies over Margate and that area were the best in Europe, better than the Bay of Naples. The more turbulent the weather … the happier he was.“All the time he’s experimenting. Some of these watercolours are very simple meditations. Some probably would only have taken him no more than half an hour.”Unlike the great Turner paintings such asThe Fighting Temeraire, which is viewed by hundreds of thousands of people every year, these pictures are from private collections and are rarely seen or reproduced.View image in fullscreenThe watercolours on display have been described as a ‘missing link’ between Turner’s conventional landscapes and his abstract later work.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThey show how he continued to play with and refine themes and feelings. A Steamboat and Crescent Moon was sketched in Margate in about 1845, seven years after he painted The Fighting Temeraire, but a squiggle of smoke harks back to the fiery funnel in the grand oil painting.“All the time he’s doing this, he’s training his hand and eye, coordinating, trying ideas that he might use,” Warrell said. “It’s bold and his colour is different to anybody’s work at that time. He doesn’t always use the widest range of colours but the yellows and blues are very distinctive. He’s trying to capture a moment or just the atmosphere of that moment.”Also featured in the exhibition are the artist’s contemporaries, including Thomas Girtin, who like Turner was born 250 years ago in 1775, and John Sell Cotman.The exhibitionruns from 23 May until 14 September.Explore more on these topicsJMW TurnerPaintingArtEnglandMuseumsExhibitionsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is in the eight marimbas lined up across the stage, which add a South African bounce to Bertolt Brecht’s 1939 epic of the thirty years’ war. It is in the operatic songs, all lush harmonies and pulsing percussion. And it is in the vocal effects of the large cast, adding birdsong or insect rhythms to the battlefields. Sometimes it is in the crackle of a plastic bottle to suggest fire, the shuddering boom of a drum to indicate an execution, or the grind of hands across metal for machine-gun fire.All of it is generated by the actors, much like the set, by the ensemble with Janet Brown and Eve Booth: a resourceful collection of corrugated iron, wooden pallets, old tyres and buckets. It gives Mark Dornford-May’s production an in-built theatricality: each performance created anew.But suddenly the noise stops and the silence is piercing. The moment comes when Paulina Malefane’s no-nonsense Mother Courage faces her greatest threat. With heavy irony, it is not the conscription of her first son (Brodie Daniel), the execution of the second (Joseph Hammal), nor even the rape and mutilation of her daughter (Noluthando Boqwana-Page). All those she regards as the cost of doing business; collateral damage in the pursuit of profit as she buys and sells from the back of her cart to the highest military bidder.View image in fullscreenLush harmonies … the chorus.Photograph: Keith PattisonNo, what sucks the air out of her is the outbreak of peace.

But the icy silence is a highlight of a gutsy production, filleted down to an economical 90 minutes by playwright Lee Hall, whotranslated the play for Shared Experiencein 2000, and marking the welcome debut of Ensemble ’84, a company drawn from the environs of Horden, a former mining village in County Durham overlooking the North Sea.In collaboration with Johannesburg’s Isango Ensemble, the actors are forthright and physical, building a sense of community not just in the makeup of the newly formed company but in the implication that war, like money, draws every one of us helplessly in.AtHorden Methodist Churchuntil 24 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreBertolt BrechtCounty DurhamreviewsShareReuse this content"

These are “incels”, who boast a coded vocabulary of hate and valorise male celibacy. That is, until a fourth man among them has sex. The opening scene is the morning after and the woman he spent the night with stands hovering behind his laptop.Cuckboy (Fiachra Corkery) and fellow incels Ghost (GoblinsGoblinsGoblins) Crusher (Jackson Ryan) and Einstain (Jimmy Kavanagh)are volubly and virulently anti-women. “Feminists have destroyed male and female courtship,” says one. But gradually they are shown to be desperate for intimacy, once the itch has been scratched by Cuckboy’s hookup with Margaret (Justine Stafford).First staged at the Edinburgh fringe last summer, this show about incel ideology, and what leads men to attack the opposite sex with such fulminating misogyny, has only grown in relevance. A black comedy by Dublin-based writer Jamie Sykes, who directs too, it takes the high-stakes decision to eke laughter from a culture based on hate andsometimes murderous terror. And on the whole it succeeds.Visually it has a ludicrous set up, the actors carrying cardboard frames in lieu of laptop scenes, which, when they glitch or are turned off, show characters comically frozen on the screen. The script sometimes elicits sympathy for these men, some of whom were terribly bullied boys once; all of whom are evidently lonely, inadequate outsiders. Their contempt for women turns your stomach but their loathing is turned inwards too, with graphic self-hatred, depression, and an almost fetished attitude towards suicide – although the drama does not go further into that darkness.It is at its best when it captures the men’s twisted sexual hunger. “Women,” they chant, and you feel their resentful yearning.View image in fullscreenAmusing dances of sexual frustration.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe actors give thoroughly fabulous performances, and the show includes breakouts of music and movement that archly reflect the men’s sexual frustration in dance, then turn into expressions of inner turmoil with wavy-armed Kate Bush-style emoting. These interludes are very amusing, but perhaps repeated too often to lessened effect.Margaret is too conveniently a journalist who wants to find out what makes these men tick. Also too conveniently, she makes all the intellectual counter-challenging arguments against inceldom, throwing the Magdalene laundries and Irish laws around contraception into the mix, as well as bringing in the story of her brother, too briefly. The men threaten to dox her and it is a potentially terrifying moment – especially in light of the misogynistic online threats that women all too often receive – but the danger here is too quickly neutered.The ending does not have the punch it might, yet this play is gripping, queasily entertaining, and shows clear signs of arresting originality. Skyes is definitely one to watch.At thePleasance theatre, London, until 31 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreInternetOnline abusereviewsShareReuse this content"

Glyndebourne’s first ever production of the opera, staged by Jetske Mijnssen, takes a dour approach, bypassing almost all the religious mysticism, and laces the rest of the story firmly into the stays of a Chekhovian family relationship drama.Ben Baur’s sombre sets and Gideon Davey’s buttoned-up costumes place us in a Catholic community around the time of the opera’s premiere, 1882. A quote from the Cain and Abel story, projected during the orchestral prelude, sets the tone. Mijnssen makes Amfortas and Klingsor into long-lost brothers, separated during a previously idyllic childhood when a fit of teenage jealousy over Kundry’s affections and his brother’s regard made Klingsor lash out with a whittling knife. We see this being acted out by the characters’ younger selves while Gurnemanz tells us the backstory in his mammoth Act 1 narration – a velvet-toned tour de force from the bassJohn Relyea.View image in fullscreen‘Less a wild spirit than a glorified housemaid’: Kristina Stanek as Kundry with Johansson as Parsifal.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe knights seem like lesser priests, wearing surplices to take communion before beating up the outsider Parsifal. Kundry is less a wild spirit than a glorified housemaid; the holy spear is a whittling knife, the grail an ordinary chalice – and, as much as the physical hole in his side, Amfortas’s rift with his brother is the real wound that refuses to heal. Parsifal’s dawning understanding of all this, helped by the vision of his dead mother that Kundry conjures for him, is what passes for heroism here.So there’s no faith in this production, and little magic too, save for the inspired touch of having Klingsor’s flower maidens as a sinister multitude of Kundrys. It’s no longer an opera about redemption – a big, abstract concept – but one about reconciliation, and that’s somehow a more slender story than the one Wagner wrote four hours of music for.View image in fullscreenJohn Relyea as Gurnemanz and Johansson as Parsifal.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAnd yet the production is redeemed by the fact that those hours of listening are so well spent. The conductor Robin Ticciati elicits a gleaming, flowing orchestral performance from the London Philharmonic, one that is supportive of an excellent cast – and hearing them in such an intimate theatre as this is special. Relyea’s tireless Gurnemanz is the outstanding performance, but Audun Iversen’s Amfortas is profoundly affecting too, alongside Kristina Stanek’s rich-toned, lithe-voiced Kundry, Ryan Speedo Green’s energised Klingsor and Daniel Johansson’s innocent but incisive Parsifal. John Tomlinson is as magnetic as ever as Titurel, a major figure in this production – he’s on stage for 80 minutes before he sings a word, and he’s riveting.Would Wagner have recognised this as his Parsifal? Maybe not. But it’s moving on its own terms, and it sounds wonderful.Until 24 JuneExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicGlyndebournelive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s rare to hear such a frenzied response to new songs but it establishes the mood for an evening during which the LA rapper’s most recent work, from 2024’sChromakopia, is received with the same level of adoration as old favourites. And he runs through the album almost in its entirety.Performing solo on stage to a backing track, he bounces giddily but gracefully across the vast space. The bass frequently hits outrageously hard throughout the evening, shaking the building’s foundations, such as during the grinding charge of Noid. While effective, the frequent bass drops do sometimes kill some of the detail in the music, as well as perhaps overcompensating for the lack of live instrumentation.View image in fullscreenBy the midpoint, things get cosy and intimate as an unmaskedTyler, the Creatorwalks a huge floating catwalk to a stage made to look like a living room. He takes his shoes off and flicks through a box of vinyl before picking out his own LPs and placing them on a turntable. Yonkers and Who Dat Boy absolutely detonate the room, with the latter track spawning huge circle pits in the audience as bodies pinball around inside. This section, while conceptually neat, can feel a little passive at points, with Tyler not always singing fully over the shortened songs, and it coming across more like a DJ set, or as though he is curating a mixtape of his own life’s work in real time.Tyler, the Creator: Chromakopia review – early midlife crisis triggers a freaked-out psychodramaRead moreHowever, he leans further into performance during the final run. His impassioned, raspy delivery of Thought I Was Dead is remarkably raw and his flow is both fluid and furious. The crowd harmonising on See You Again is genuinely beautiful, and as he winds up with I Hope You Find Your Way Home, he finishes the evening the same way he started it: with new songs being rapturously received like they are already classics.Tyler, the Creator is at the O2, London, on 19 May andtouring the UKuntil 31 MayExplore more on these topicsTyler, the CreatorHip-hopRapreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, they’re both in a good place and having more and better sexHow do you do it? Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toNaomi Larsson PiñedaSun 18 May 2025 06.00 EDTShareIris, 40Things came to a point when I was considering whether I wanted our relationship to continue if it was sexlessTo me, sex is both a relaxant and a stimulant, so it was difficult when Eva and I stopped having it. I questioned what I was doing wrong. Didn’t she find me attractive any more? Had I not been able to pleasure her?We’ve been together for 10 years, and it was just after Covid that our sex life seemed to end. For three years we had sex about once a year. We would go to bed to watch Netflix, and then one of us would fall asleep. I don’t think our love had dissipated or changed. It’s just that sex became something that wasn’t important, particularly for Eva.I find it easy to make myself come, and I like moments where I can just enjoy myself on my own, whereas Eva doesn’t masturbate at all. Still, it came to a point last year when I was considering whether I wanted our relationship to continue if it was sexless. It was difficult to have that conversation because I didn’t want it to sound like an ultimatum, but sex is non-negotiable for me. It’s something that one can derive a huge amount of pleasure from, but it’s also a reinforcement of love and intimacy.Our sex life has come back – we’re having sex a few times a week – which is amazingEva found it frustrating, and it took time for her to understand that sex wasn’t something I was trying to pressure her into, but something I wanted to do because we would both enjoy it. I started talking a lot more about my desires, about what I found really hot and attractive about her, the things I would like to do with her, and the things I would like her to do with me, to make her feel more empowered and desired. I find her incredibly attractive, and that’s never diminished.In the past six months, our sex life has come back – we’re having sex a few times a week – which is amazing. It feels like a completely new stage in our marriage. She’s more playful, we’ll go out to dinner and she’ll whisper something about what she wants to do when we go home. We’re much flirtier with each other, and that comes back into the bedroom.She’s exploring her desire much more, which really turns me on.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

For me, the quality is more important than the quantity. I think sex is a release from stress for Iris, whereas I need to be in a happy, relaxed place to be in the mood.The impact of the pandemic and then a time when both of us were stressed with work led to a couple of years where we hardly had any sex. I knew it was a problem, but Iris put pressure on, which wasn’t helpful. It pushed me even further away, which was unfair on her, because she was just being honest about how she felt.Now she’s less frustrated, I want to be closer to her againIt’s probably quite normal that your sex drives don’t align at certain periods in your life, or you have a time where it just isn’t the priority. Our sex life reflected the relationship in a way, as it was a really stressful, difficult moment when we probably both weren’t in the best place. I missed having good sex, but I also knew that whatever sex we had wasn’t going to be what I wanted.In the past few months, as we’ve both been happier in the rest of our lives, that’s been reflected in our sex life. We’re back in a place where we’re having better sex – and more of it. I think she’s less frustrated and so I want to be closer to her again.It feels as though we’re in a new relationship even though we’ve been together for 10 years. It’s not that we’re trying new things – though we’ve spoken more about our desires. Our sex is still fairly vanilla, but it’s more fun, carefree and spontaneous, and we are so much closer now. I feel Iris thinks this is because we’ve had better communication, but I reckon it’s because we’re both happier and less stressed, and seem to have more patience with each other. Maybe we just got to a point where we decided that we did want to be together no matter what.Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsThis is how we do itSexfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We trundle them over cobbles, see them tumble from luggage racks on the train – and if we choose to fly, there’s a fair chance they’ll be mishandled before we reunite at the carousel.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For our testing, we pushed eight suitcases to the limit by dropping them on to a hard surface, as if they’d been fumbled by a baggage handler. Air travel is especially tough on suitcases, so you might get away with choosing a less resilient case if you make the climate-conscious choice to travel by rail or sea.According to one Gatwick worker interviewed by the Guardian, the average baggage handler has to load about 150 bags within 40 minutes to facilitate every landing or takeoff – and that’s one of several stints of intense effort during a shift. It’s only natural, then, that some suitcases are roughly handled or dropped. Sita, a service provider to the civil aviation industry, reports that more than 36 million air passengers worldwide had their hold luggage mishandled in 2023. Clearly, dings, scratches and even breakages are a distinct possibility.The good news is that many of today’s suitcases are extremely tough. Some of the best are made with highly durable plastics such as polycarbonates, which are also used in hard-wearing items such as safety goggles and windscreens.There’s more to being a suitcase than getting bashed about, of course. Most travellers want something that looks appealing, provides useful internal organisation, such as storage compartments and pockets, and is easy to manoeuvre with components such as casters and a telescopic handle. I tested eight models – diverse in shape, size, material, style and price – to help you find the best suitcase to be your trusty travel companion.At a glanceBest suitcase overall:Away The Large£300 at AwayBest budget suitcase:Tripp Holiday 8£60 at AmazonBest suitcase forshorter breaks:July CheckedFrom £220 at JulyBest small suitcase:Horizn Studios H6 Pro£470 at Horizn StudiosBest for a luxurious look:Carl Friedrik The Trunk£595 at Carl FredrikBest wheeled backpack:Eagle Creek Cargo Hauler duffel£179.95 at WildBoundsWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing products since the mid-2010s – long enough to know you can’t assess a product superficially. I’ve tested them rigorously, from the waterproof jackets I’ve worn in the pouring rain tothe sunrise alarm clocks that woke me up every day last winter. But luggage has felt like a special case – to test them to the same degree of rigour, I had to consider the suitcase’s experience when out of the owner’s hands, too.How I testedA man stands on a ladder and drops a suitcase from the top‘Among the hardiest performers during drop testing’: the July Checked suitcase. Video: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianWhether they’re being dropped at the train station or tumbling from the hold of an Airbus A320, suitcases must prove their mettle. So I stress-tested each case by filling it and dropping it, several times, from a ladder on my driveway. As we’ll see, some cases sustained significant damage as a result of the drop tests, while others emerged with just a few scuffs.I also assessed each model’s everyday functionality by packing it, carrying and wheeling it, and testing features such as TSA combination locks and telescopic handles. The most impressive models offered durability and travel-ready convenience in equal measure.Perhaps unsurprisingly, given my testing methodology, none of the brands wanted their suitcases back after testing. Review units in saleable condition have been donated for fundraising to theCat Action Trust 1977, a small national charity dedicated to the welfare of feral cats. This charity is close to my heart: I’m currently fostering two adult cats and a litter of kittens on its behalf.The best suitcases in 2025A man stands on a ladder and drops a suitcase from the top‘Held up impressively’: Carl Friedrik’s The Trunk. Video: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianBest suitcase overall:Away The LargeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£300 at AwayIf you’re happy to shell out on a very well-made suitcase, this would be a good pick. It was one of the best performers in my drop tests, emerging with just a few scuff marks on the sides and scratches on the corners. Using the special “eraser” sponge included with the case, I was able to remove most of these marks after testing.Why we love itIt’s very nicely finished, with an understated pattern of horizontal grooves on the slightly rough-textured shell, and a silky-soft lining and mesh on the inside. I particularly admired fine details, such as the rubbery trim around the main zip, and a recessed handle on the underside that comes in handy when the case is packed with heavy items.The Large is a lovely suitcase to use in every respect, from adjusting its glossy compression straps to wheeling it around on its nimble casters. This wasn’t an official part of testing, but it also proved more than capable of supporting a person’s weight during an impromptu joyride around the spare room.It’s a shame that …considering its imposing size, this suitcase has a middling storage capacity.Carry-on version available:yes,The Carry-On 39.8l (£220)Capacity:99.2lWeight:5.5kgDimensions:52.1 x 31.8 x 73.6cm (WDH)Colours available:11Outer material:polycarbonateClosure:zipper with TSA combination lockStorage:main compartment with two compression straps, a zippered flap pocket, a mesh storage insert with two zippered pockets and a laundry bag; lid compartment with two zippered pockets in the mesh coverBest budget suitcase:Tripp Holiday 8 LargeView image in fullscreen£75 at Next£60 at AmazonWhat sort of suitcase can you get for less than £100? A very good one, it turns out. The Tripp Holiday 8 is an exceptional case for the price you pay, with an expandable design (using a secondary zipper) that bumps its internal storage up to a generous 102l.Why we love itChoosing an affordable suitcase does come with some trade-offs. There’s no doubt this Tripp case is made with coarser materials than some of its costlier competitors, and it takes a little extra effort to click the telescopic handle into its one and only height position. For the most part, though, the case is a pleasure to handle. The casters manoeuvre fluidly, and the textured outer material should minimise any sliding during transit.Most of all, the Holiday 8 stands out among affordable suitcases for its durability. While hurling the case from a ladder, I noticed that the material has plenty of give, which may have helped it to stay intact. On a less glowing note, scratches and scuff marks stood out prominently on the case’s shiny material.It’s a shame that …there aren’t any small storage compartments or pockets to help with organisation.Carry-on version available:yes,Holiday 8 Cabin 37l suitcase (£47.50)Capacity:102lWeight:4.2kgDimensions:50 x 32 x 76cm (WDH)Colours available:11Outer material:polypropyleneClosure:zipper with TSA combination lockStorage:main compartment with compression straps; zippered lid compartment with mesh coverBest suitcase forshorter breaks:July CheckedView image in fullscreenFrom £220 at July£275 at SelfridgesThis cool, minimalistic case from Aussie brand July ticks all the boxes for couples on a weekend break or solo travellers taking a slightly longer trip. It has a reasonable weight relative to its toughness and abundant internal storage options. I appreciated the internal mesh pockets and removable laundry bag, which make it simple to keep particular items separate from the bulk of your clothing.Why we love itJuly produces this case in a jaunty array of colours, including eye-catching clay and shadow lavender versions. Taking hue out of the picture, the luggage has a utilitarian, almost military aesthetic, with a textured surface that holds up well to scuffs and scrapes.And I should know, as this suitcase proved to be among the hardiest performers during drop testing. Scuffing occurred mostly around the anodised aluminium protective corners, which actually looked pretty good with the extra wear.It’s simple to move around, with a good telescopic handle for wheeled use and a side handle providing an extra option for hoicking it off the luggage carousel.It’s a shame that …the casters don’t run quite as smoothly as they might – but that’s me splitting hairs.Carry-on version available:yes,Carry On 42l (from £196)Capacity:80lWeight:3.8kgDimensions:47 x 29 x 66cm (WDH)Colours available:11ncluding limited edition)Outer material:aerospace-grade polycarbonate; anodised aluminium corner bumpersClosure:Japanese YKK zippers with TSA combination lockStorage:main compartment with Y-shaped compression strap, large zippered mesh sleeve, zippered pocket and removable laundry bag; lid compartment with two mesh pocketsBest smallsuitcase:Horizn Studios H6 ProView image in fullscreen£470 at Horizn Studios£480 at 24SGiven its jet-set pricing, I fully expected the H6 Pro to be something special – and so it proved during my rough-and-tumble testing. Simply put, this case came away with less damage than any other. For the most part, there were just a few light marks, and many of these wiped away easily (except at the corners, which were more deeply scratched). This was a relief, as it’s a fine suitcase, from its weighty casters and abundant internal storage options to the two-position telescopic handle.Why we love itThe polycarbonate outer shell is light, hardy and lovely-looking. Much like the internal organisation, it’s delightfully smooth to the touch – and there are tough plastic rests on one side of the case to help you keep it that way. The TSA lock and locking zippers feel extremely robust.One potential downside to this case is that it’s on the smaller side. You wouldn’t be able to use it for a week-long couple’s holiday, but the H6 Pro is a great fit (both practically and aesthetically) for work trips and weekends away. The largerH7 Pro (£520)provides more baggage capacity at a marginally higher price.It’s a shame that …the price will be off-putting, even for frequent flyers.Carry-on version available:yes, M5 Pro 37l (£470)Capacity:61lWeight:4.1kgDimensions:46 x 24 x 64cm (WDH)Colours available:fourOuter material:aerospace-grade polycarbonateClosure:zipper with TSA combination lockStorage:main compartment with two compression straps, two very small mesh pockets, one large mesh sleeve and a removable clear toiletries pouch; lid compartment with a mesh cover, long zippered pocket and a removable laundry bagBest for a luxurious look:Carl Friedrik The TrunkView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£595 at Carl Fredrik£595 at Harvey NicholsThis suitcase oozes luxury, from its riveted hinges to the satisfying, thumb-wound number dials on the combination locks. It’s fairly heavy but does plenty to make handling easier, with excellent casters that truly glide across hard surfaces, and a height-adjustable telescopic handle with a nicely moulded grip that doesn’t dig into your hand while you pull the case.Why we love itOpen up the case and you’ll find ample internal storage options, including three removable zippered bags that are ideal for stashing items such as beauty products. The lid compartment is surprisingly deep, thanks to the case’s distinctively cuboidal shape, which could make it an ideal choice for packing a couple’s belongings in separate sections.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

If anything, I think a little wear and tear has made it look better.It’s a shame that …the polycarbonate shell, although strong and lightweight, is a bit of a magnet for dust and finger marks. And of course, the eye-watering price of this suitcase will rule it out for a large proportion of holidaymakers.Carry-on version available:not an exact match, but Carl Friedrik sellsThe Carry-on (£325)Capacity:90lWeight:6.2kgDimensions:39.3 x 36.6 x 72.5cm (WDH)Colours available:threeOuter material:polycarbonateClosure:buckle and two TSA combination locksStorage:three removable storage cubes; zippered lid compartment; two compression strapsBestwheeled backpack:Eagle Creek Cargo Hauler duffelView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£179.95 at WildBounds£210 at RohanAs you can see, this is not your ordinary suitcase. Really, it’s a back-wearable duffel bag on suitcase-style casters – and it’s well worth considering as an alternative to a hard-shell case.Why we love itI was taken aback when I first saw the Cargo Hauler in its “stuff sack”. The roll-up design of the bag means you can store it in a shoebox-sized space, and it’s surprising to see just how large it becomes when unfurled, with storage capacity comparable to that of a large trunk.Because the duffel is so light, at 1.93kg, it’ll give you some extra wriggle room in terms of baggage allowance. I’d recommend packing it pretty fully, as the lack of internal storage divisions means it can be hard to keep things from moving around inside the cavernous main compartment.When it comes to moving this bag, you’ve got plenty of options. You can wheel it by its (non-adjustable) pull handle and excellent pair of casters, unveil its back straps to carry it like a backpack, or popper the straps together to use it as a duffel bag. It’s the perfect compromise for the moderately adventurous traveller.The Cargo Hauler was practically unaffected by my drop testing, with just a few light scuffs to tell the tale.It’s a shame that …like any soft luggage, the Cargo Hauler doesn’t protect contents as well as a good hard-shell suitcase would.Carry-on version available:yes, without wheelsCargo Hauler 40l duffel bag (£119)or with wheelsCargo Hauler 36l wheeled duffel XT carry-on bag (£209.95)Capacity:108lWeight:1.93kgDimensions:35 x 38 x 77cm (WDH)Colours available:fourOuter material:nylon dobby and polyesterClosure:lockable zippers with central lock pointStorage:large main compartment; top compartment with zippered mesh pocket; small flap compartmentThe best of the restA man stands on a ladder and drops a suitcase from the top‘This case split at one of the corners’: the It Legion Medium.

You might not know what that material is, but you’ll know how it feels – lightweight and comfortingly familiar.Unfortunately, when it came to drop-testing, this case split at one of the corners. So, if you want a really hardy suitcase, this wouldn’t be our recommendation. If you’re only travelling a few times a year, though, and don’t regularly fly, then this might be less of an issue.In all other respects, it was one of my very favourite suitcases. Inside the case, storage options are good, if not dazzling, and the materials feel luxurious relative to the modest price. The casters, telescopic handle and combination lock work perfectly.It didn’t make the final cut because …other cases proved more durable.Carry-on version available:yes,expandable cabin case 47l (£50);capacity:104l;weight:4.2kg;dimensions:48.5 x 30 x 70cm (WDH);colours available:six;outer material:ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene);closure:zipper with TSA combination lock;storage:main compartment with two compression straps; lid compartment with one large zippered compartment and two stuff pockets in the coverSmall but mighty!

It’ll never be easy, but really good high-capacity luggage will help. This is just such a suitcase from time-honoured label Antler, with a whopping volume of 135l.On the outside, this suitcase looks and feels quite similar to some of the other polycarbonate cases I’ve tested for this feature: lightweight, subtly detailed and soft to the touch. The inside is more traditional, with a dark cream lining and accent colour zippers. Dare I say it feels a little more special?When fully packed, this suitcase will be very heavy. It’s a good job that the telescopic handle (which doesn’t have far to telescope, given the case’s stature) feels very robust, and the casters manoeuvre serenely.It didn’t make the final cut because …some models proved tougher during drop testing. This case didn’t break, but it accumulated relatively deep scuffs and scratches, especially around the corners. There was also damage to the plastic around the casters.Carry-on version available:yes,four-wheel cabin case 38l (£175);capacity:135l;weight:4.9kg;dimensions:51.7 x 33.6 x 78cm (WDH);colours available:eight;outer material:polycarbonate;closure:zipper with TSA combination lock;storage:main compartment with X-shaped compression straps and a long, zippered flap pocket; large lid compartment with two zippered mesh pockets in the coverWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianWhat makes some suitcases more durable than others?Among the various factors that play into a suitcase’s durability, its materials, design and construction are particularly important.Most modern hard-shell suitcases are made of plastic, but this shouldn’t be taken as an indication that their material has similar durability. Some plastics, such as polycarbonates, are particularly tough and lightweight, and you’ll find these types used in some of the hardiest luggage.Suitcase design also affects durability and the level of protection given to the items inside. Corners are especially vulnerable to splitting, so in some cases, they’re shored up with a hard-wearing guard over the suitcase shell. Joins between the parts of a suitcase can also prove to be weak points.If you don’t have the luxury of being able to drop several suitcases from a ladder, you might have a hard time determining which suitcases are well constructed with secure joins. Tightly fitting parts and premium fixings such as rivets often bode well, but above all, a generous guarantee should put your mind at ease. Some suitcase brands offer lifetime coverage against manufacturing faults, and we’d recommend seeking a multi-year guarantee at minimum.Are all suitcases suitable to fly as hold luggage?The maximum permitted dimensions (and weight) of your suitcase will depend on the airline and options you choose when booking a flight. Bear in mind that budget airlines and short-haul operators sometimes apply tight size limits, so choose a case to suit the stingiest airlines you use. There are often options to pay extra for an increased hold luggage size allocation when booking your flight.If a suitcase has one or more locks – and most good ones do – then these must be TSA locks, with a special keyhole that will allow customs officials to open the case using a master key. Most large suitcases have these TSA locks, which are denoted by a red diamond symbol. If your suitcase doesn’t have locks and you wish to keep it locked, you can use a TSA padlock such asthis Master Lock model (£8.51).For this article, we’ve focused on large suitcases that would be placed in the hold of an aircraft, rather than the cabin. Smaller cabin bags can stay with the passenger on certain flights – although restrictions apply, and you should always check the flight operator’s policy.Pete Wise is ajournalist with more than a decade’s experience covering everything from global development and social causes to technology and music.

Easy to perfect, and here’s how …Felicity CloakeSun 18 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 08.01 EDTShareAl limone(no translation needed) is perhaps the perfectprimofor this time of year, when we’re still waiting for the produce to catch up with the temperatures. The zesty citrus sings of the south, of heavy yellow fruit against a blue Mediterranean sky, while the butter gives just enough richness to make up for any chilly spring breezes. As Nigella observes, this is a dish that can “equally offer summer sprightliness or winter comfort”.The pastaAlthough I happen to agree withDaniel Gritzerwhen he writes on Serious Eats that “a satiny butter sauce like this pairs better with fresh noodles”, I wouldn’t turn down Catherine Phipps andNigella Lawson’s dried linguine, norRachel Roddy’s dried (or fresh!) tagliatelle in her second book, Two Kitchens, nor even theRiver Cafe Classic Italian Cookbook’s dried pici. (Pici, Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers explain, “is a handmade pasta, made with plain flour and water, which is only found in Tuscany” – though bucatini, they allow, may be substituted). Though I find spaghetti and linguine the most satisfying to slurp, this selection suggests that just about any long noodle, fresh or dried, is acceptable here. (I note that Ali Slagle uses a short ribbed shape, such as penne or gemelli, in herone-pot pasta with ricotta and lemon for the New York Times, but that seems to me to be a slightly different beast.)The lemonView image in fullscreenRachel Roddy’s take on the classic features a thick sauce that manages to be ‘soothing and vital at the same time’. All thumbnail pictures by Felicity Cloake.Most recipes I try use both the aromatic zest and the zingy juice of the lemon, with Gritzer explaining that “a small dose [of juice] will add a subtle tart counterpoint to all the richness, while allowing the aromatic oils from the lemon zest to remain prominent. More juice will punch up that brightness and also steal some of the spotlight from the zest.” When, as well as how much, you add makes a difference, however; while the oils in the zest, released by grating, can withstand a certain amount of heat, the flavour of lemon juice is much more delicate. So, like Gritzer, I’m going to add it right at the end of cooking – he, Lawson’s How to Eat and Roddy all recommend adjusting the quantity to taste, depending on how punchy you’d like the dish, which seems sensible given that lemons vary so wildly in size, juiciness and acidity (Bee Wilson recently conducted a small surveyand found that a rocca imperiale Calabrian lemon yielded twice as much juice as a supermarket version, though it was also four times the price. As a consequence, she writes: “I’m starting to see that there is really no such thing as ‘the juice of a lemon’. There is only the juice of this lemon or of that lemon, each with their own specific perfume, their own pattern of dimples on the skin, their own juice waiting to be discovered under the layer of pith.” She, like the late Russell Norman, favours Amalfi lemons, though you may be relieved to learn I tested this recipe using the common or garden supermarket variety, unwaxed but also ungenerous of juice, and can confirm they will very much do here.)The River Cafe, whose lemons come from a Tuscan garden, uses just the juice for a more straightforwardly tangy result without the sweeter, more complex perfume of the skin. And while that approach has its merits, it seems a bit of a shame, in a dish that ought to be all about the lemon, to neglect this part of it.The dairyThis is where the recipes I try diverge, because every recipe I try has a different approach to balancing the sourness of the lemon juice. InNorman’s book Brutto, he calls the “principle of the sauce close to carbonara”, and with a similar egg and grated cheese base. Roddy and the River Cafe’s versions, meanwhile, remind me more ofcacio e pepe, in which olive oil, grated cheese and pasta cooking water are beaten together to produce a thick sauce that Roddy describes as “surprising” in that it manages to be “both soothing and vital at the same time”. Both are delicious, but the overwhelming flavour is of cheese, rather than fruit and, while I certainly would never complain about too much cheese, I’d like the lemon to be the dominant flavour note here.View image in fullscreenThe cream Katie Caldesi adds to her pasta al limone reminds Felicity of ‘lemon-flavoured yoghurt’.Lawson’s recipe puts me in mind of a less traditionally Italian carbonara-style sauce using egg yolk and double cream, which coats the pasta beautifully and works better, my testers and I decide, thanKatie Caldesi’s cream-only version in her (excellent) Italian Cookery Course, which one tester reports reminds them – not unpleasantly, mind – of a “lemon-flavoured yoghurt”. I laugh, but I know what she means: the combination of cream and lemon zest has a tendency, even with Caldesi’s generous hand with the cheese, to suggestpossetsand the like.Indeed, Gritzer goes as far as to decree that dairy “mutes lemon flavour”, taming its natural zing into something much quieter and more soothing, which is why he opts for a butter and pasta water emulsion instead. This allows the flavour of the lemon to sing, an approach also favoured by New York chef Frank Prisinzano, whotold America’s Test Kitchen in 2023that the “limone dishes I’ve had on the Amalfi coast are actually made with cream, and I didn’t like it that way. I thought it was too heavy. So I started playing around with making a pasta water and butter emulsion with the spaghetti in the pot. The spaghetti acts as a whisk, and it creates an actual beurre blanc – which is a French sauce – but it beautifully coats the noodles.” (Prisinzano, finding lemon zest “too strong”, simply adds the squeezed lemon shells to the pan to release their aroma, suggesting the presence of a more refined palate than I can boast.)The cheeseAlmost everyone uses parmesan in startling quantities (Caldesi warns readers not to skimp on it, because “the lemon needs the cheese to counteract its sharpness, so scatter liberally”), but I reckon the cleaner, saltier, more acidic flavour of Norman and the River Cafe’specorinoworks much better, if you have some on hand – though I’d guess most hard Italian cheeses would do the job.View image in fullscreenThe River Cafe’s addition of pecorino works much better than parmesan.Gray and Rogers use two sorts: fresh and aged Tuscan pecorino – the first, a moist, semi-hard cheese, to beat into lemon juice to create a “thick, lumpy sauce”, and the second, drier and more forceful in character, to season and garnish. I won’t be using cheese as the base of my sauce, so I’ve gone for the aged pecorino alone. This has the added benefit of being much easier to find in the UK, but, that said, the flavour of the younger cheese is a lovely pairing with the lemon juice, giving the dish an almost yoghurt-like freshness.The extrasI like the perky flavour and colour that Caldesi, the River Cafe and Norman’s basil brings to the dish (though you may prefer Lawson’s flat-leaf parsley). Roddy reports that she has on occasions also added rocket, while Phipps, in her book Citrus, suggests asparagus, which would be a nice nod to the seasonal produce we have in abundance right now (I suspect that frozen peas, always in season, would also be a good bet).View image in fullscreenDaniel Gritzer’s pasta al limone adds garlic to proceedings, which is ‘gilding the lily’.Gritzer adds garlic, which is gilding the lily; this should be all about the lemon, with a supporting cast of butter, to enrich the sauce and salty cheese to season and thicken it.

When it opened earlier this year, the place was invite-only, but has since relaxed its door policy to allow anyone who fancies the first-floor bar for ale, martinis and toasties or the set menu by a former River Cafe chef on the top floor. Nothing is more likely to rankle decent, upstanding Guardian readers than the notion that the Fat Badger was once invite-only, and in Notting Hill, land of the frittered trust fund, too! “Eat the rich!” said Jean-Jacques Rousseau, apparently. Well, he’d have to find them first, because they don’t make that easy here. This badger is tucked away above the much-laudedCanteenon Portobello Road, and access is down a side street via what seems more like the goods entrance.Head up two sets of stairs, and the Fat Badger’s pub and dining room are elegant, olde-worlde, wood-panelled and candle-lit. It’s all completely charming, of course, but crucially – and this is by no means a dig – and, despite the acres of hype becauseMargot RobbieandJamie Dornanhave been spotted here, it’s also nothing remotely groundbreaking. In recent years, a new breed of London pubs such asthe Heroin Maida Vale,the Devonshirein Piccadilly,the Knave of Clubsin Shoreditch and now the Fat Badger have been selling gen Y the concept of “going to the pub” as if it were a deliciously edgy, new thing. People mill around, drink booze and talk! In real life! When the place opened, there was even talk that, gasp, they were selling single cigarettes behind the bar, to take to the smoking area. All the glorious grot that was once so commonplace is being rebranded as the epitome of decadence. That said, by the time I got round to visiting last week, those single ciggies were no longer available, no doubt because some miserable snitch had said it might be illegal.View image in fullscreenThe Fat Badger’s nettle soup is ‘as thick as a puree’ and served with homemade soda bread and ‘glorious’ salted butter.The food in the upstairs dining room, meanwhile, is really very good, which you’d maybe expect with the likes of George Williams (ex-River Cafe) and Beth O’Brien (Ballymaloe Cookery Schoolgraduate) at the helm. That comes with one caveat, though: this is a no-choice menu. That’s not to say it’s a fancy, itsy-bitsy tasting menu; instead, this is a hearty, meat and two veg with doughnuts for pudding-type set menu. Even so, there’s no real warning of what’s on offer – it’s a secret, again – and it’ll cost you £85 a head.We were asked what we liked and didn’t like, and if we had any allergies. That was followed by a steady stream of, on the whole, delicious things that would delight even the most uppity eater. A soupçon of nettle soup, as thick as a puree, with fresh Irish soda bread and glorious salted butter. Then some gorgeous lobster in a light tempura served in a “taco” made of thinly sliced celeriac.View image in fullscreenThe main event at the Fat Badger features rare beef fillet with morels, bearnaise and hasselback potatoes.Salty trout belly on charred toast was intriguing rather than yummy, but a chunk of grilled pigeon on toast was earthy and rich. More trout appeared, this time chopped with olives into a fresh paté to smear across that salty bread. If the Fat Badger has gained an early reputation as something of a party palace for the Notting Hill set, that sells the cooking here very short.Next up on the mystery menu was a generous portion of scallop in a lobster gravy studded with fresh peas and pork jowl. The scallop was seared yet still yieldingly soft and the peas tasted as if they’d only just left their pods. Produce here clearly comes first.View image in fullscreenThe Fat Badger’s apple doughnut with apple sauce and ‘wonderful, calories-be-damned’ apple crumble ice-cream.Anyone worrying that a secret menu of this kind might throw up a few curveballs would breathe a sigh of relief to see that fillet of beef with hasselback potatoes is the main event, with large chunks of rare beef, strewn with at least a dozen fat morels, a whole heap of potatoes and a steaming pan of warm bearnaise sauce. The clientele that night was almost 85% huddles of posh, thin, joyless women discussing society wedding calendars, but then it was a Tuesday evening in May in west London, so what else would you expect?Dessert was a huge portion of strawberry and basil sorbet, which challenged my belief that basil in a sorbet is nothing but an annoyance: it really worked here and was promptly inhaled. A freshly made sticky doughnut with apple sauce and a delightful spherical mass of apple crumble ice-cream rounded things off, with the crumble worked in flaky chunks through the rich vanilla ice-cream. The Fat Badger may have been sold to me as one of the naughtiest new places in London, but I think this wonderful, calories-be-damned ice-cream was easily the lewdest part of the entire evening.The Fat Badger is immensely likeable, and they’ll now let you in even if you’re not famous (or friends with them).

However, none of the big four are rated in the top five for service, says Alastair Douglas, the chief executive of the credit app TotallyMoney, referring to a survey of customers by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).Sticking with a trusted brand or perhaps a bank you have been with since childhood may seem like the safe option, but you could be missing out.An array of new challenger banks offer slick apps, top savings rates, and handy features that make it easier to split a bill or divvy up your savings. Respondents to the CMA survey ranked Chase, Monzo and Starling as top for “overall service quality”.Almost1.2 million people switched bank last year, according to payments network Pay UK, with online or mobile banking (46%) the top reason they preferred their new account, followed by the interest they earned (37%) and customer service (32%).Switching bonuses can also make opening a new account worth it. Current deals include £175 free cash to those who switch to First Direct and £150 for those who move to NatWest. Be sure to check the terms and conditions – some accounts require a minimum monthly deposit or a certain number of direct debits to qualify.Switching is easy: provide your old account details to your new bank and it will do the legwork, including transferring any direct debits. Under the Current Account Switching Service guarantee, the whole process should only take seven working days.Do your homework first. Check reviews and make sure the bank is a member of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which protects up to £85,000 of your money if your bank fails.Using your overdraftThe overdraft attached to your current account may seem convenient, but use it at your peril as it is typically one of the most expensive ways to borrow money.Some people assume that having an “arranged overdraft” means they can go overdrawn without penalty, but this is not the case. The typical overdraft rate ranges from 35% to 50%, according to TotallyMoney, and about 9.7 million people are overdrawn by an average of £709 every month.Running a £709 overdraft at a rate of 39.9% would rack up £283 in interest charges over 12 months, says Andrew Hagger, the founder of the financial website MoneyComms.A better option may be to use a 0% credit card. These let you clear your debt over a set period, without accruing further interest charges. You need to look for a money transfer card, not a balance transfer card.A money transfer card lets you effectively give yourself a loan by moving a credit card balance to your current account, where it can be used to clear an overdraft.Some cards charge a fee for transferring the initial balance, but this is still likely to work out cheaper in the long run.View image in fullscreenHSBC, Lloyds, NatWest and Barclays dominates the UK current account market, but none are rated in the top five for service.Photograph: Martin Freeman/EyePress News/REX/ShutterstockTesco Bank’s money transfer card has a rate of 0% for 14 months and has a 3.99% fee. Using it to transfer £709 to clear an overdraft would cost £28.28 – a saving of £254.72 compared with the potential overdraft interest, as long as you pay it off within 14 months.Use an eligibility checker to see whether you are likely to be approved for a credit card before you apply to avoid affecting your credit score – you can find these on comparison websites such as Comparethemarket and Uswitch.Hagger suggests asking your bank to reduce your overdraft limit to a nominal amount of about ­£200 to £300 to reduce the temptation to use it.Consider using savings to clear your negative balance on your current account. The interest on debt will build up faster than any savings interest, so it makes sense to tackle the overdraft first.Overfull current accountIt is heartening to see a healthy balance, but leaving too much cash in your current – or any other account – is a mistake if it earns little or no interest.The Bank of England estimates that £280bn is sitting in accounts earning nothing. Any cash in a ­zero-interest account is not only missing out on interest, it is actually losing value in real terms as inflation chips away at it.View image in fullscreenLeaving too much cash in your current – or any other account – is a mistake if it earns little or no interestPhotograph: Lucia Lanpur/Alamy“Switching just £2,000 from a zero-interest account to an easy-access account paying 4.5% would earn you £90 in interest over a year,” says Hagger. “On a £5,000 balance, you would earn £225.”Experts typically advise having three to six months’ worth of outgoings at hand, but that does not have to mean in your current account. The top easy-access accounts now pay 4.5% or more, and let you withdraw your money at any time.Use comparison websites such as Moneyfacts to find the best deals and check for any restrictions. Some accounts require 30 days’ notice or allow only a certain number of withdrawals each year. Douglas says the smaller banks may offer more competitive rates as they look to win new customers.Not reading the small printOften the savings accounts with the most eye-catching rates are not offering as much as it may first appear.Anna Bowes, the head of communications at the financial advisers The Private Office, points to Santander’s Edge saver account as one example. It pays a market-leading 6%, but only on balances up to £4,000 – the average saver has more than £17,000 in their account, according to TotallyMoney.Someone who maxed out the account would earn £240 in interest over a year. You also need an Edge current account to qualify, which costs £3 a month.Meanwhile, Atom Bank’s easy-access Instant Saver Reward account pays 4.75% on balances up to £100,000, according to Moneyfacts. Someone with the average savings balance of £17,000 could earn £807.50 over a 12-month period.View image in fullscreenOften the savings accounts with the most eye-catching rates are not offering as much as it may first appear.Photograph: andresr/Getty ImagesRegular saver accounts also offer top rates, but only let you set aside a certain amount each month. While these accounts are great for those starting a savings habit, those able to put away larger sums could do better elsewhere.For example, First Direct’s regular saver pays 7% on up to £300 a month. Those paying in the maximum would have saved £3,600 after 12 months and earned interest of £136.50.However, if you were able to save £3,600 in full at the start of the year into the Atom Bank account, you would earn £171 – an extra £34.50.Packaged bank accountPackaged current accounts charge a monthly fee and offer perks such as travel insurance, gadget cover and cashback – but they are only good value if you use the benefits.For example, the Virgin Money Club M account costs £12.50 a month (£150 a year) and offers family travel and gadget insurance, plus UK and European breakdown cover. MoneySavingExpert estimates that buying the equivalent cover separately could cost up to £500.View image in fullscreenPackaged accounts are only good value if you use the perks, such as travel insurance… (and you can understand the often complex T&Cs.)Photograph: Chris Dorney/AlamyBut your gadgets may already be covered under your home insurance, or perhaps you do not holiday overseas enough to benefit from the travel insurance. Check what you are paying for and whether it is worth the cost.“The bottom line is that packaged accounts make banks a lot of money,” Douglas says. “You might be better off picking and choosing the parts that work for you and paying for them separately.”He adds: “Read the small print to see if the phone insurance includes theft or whether the travel insurance covers the destinations you are planning to visit. You might find out that what initially sounded like a great offer, actually is not.”Some account requirements quickly get complicated. For example, the Club Lloyds Silver account costs £11.50 a month if you deposit at least £2,000 monthly, otherwise you will pay an extra £3. Or you could get a discount of £2 a month, if you deposit £4,300 a month, or £5,500 for a joint account.

It has so far returned £55,000 but suggests that almost four times that amount has been taken.M&S says the scam using its name has been around for some time and is not related to the recent cyber-attack and the theft ofcustomer email addresses.What the messages look likeSome are emails telling you that you’ve been chosen to receive a free treat, such as an afternoon tea letterbox hamper or a beauty kit. Others are adverts or social media posts saying the same thing, or suggesting that a retailer is having a clearance and offering free goods. They use stolen logos to convince you that they are legitimate messages from the companies.Sometimes, the scammers pretend to be a deals website/account that is spreading news of offers, and giving a link to the “deal”.View image in fullscreenA fake Screwfix advert.Photograph: Handout: Lloyds bank/SuppliedIn an example seen by Lloyds, fraudsters claimed that Amazon has laptops to clear and is giving them away to make space for new stock. A link took people to a site where they were asked to pay £1.87 for P&P. The fake Screwfix advert takes a similar form, saying you have been chosen to take part in a promotion and have won a free chainsaw.To get your hands on the freebies, you may be asked to do a survey.What the messages ask forThe scammers are after your card details. After some kind of preamble they will request them, usually saying it’s to pay for postage and packaging. They will ask for your payment card number, CVC and expiry date.The card details will then be used by the fraudsters, probably to set up a continuous payment authority, which will take a monthly “subscription” fee from you.One recent victim, posting on the MoneySavingExpert website, says they gave their details but no hamper arrived. “Then a few days later they charged £53 to my card … I contacted my bank and they told me they had blocked this ‘merchant’ from making further charges to my account. However, they continued to attempt to take four further payments, each a few days apart.”What to doIf you have ever responded to one of these, check your bank and credit card statements. Lloyds says the payments commonly show the code PYD on statements and are often to accounts in Cyprus or Ireland. If you see one of these for a payment you do not recognise, report it to your bank.View image in fullscreenIn the UK you can forward suspicious emails seeking to get your payment details toreport@phishing.gov.uk.

In fact, it was a burst aneurysm and I needed emergency surgery. Two years into my recovery, can I learn how to find joy again?Kieran YatesSun 18 May 2025 01.00 EDTShareIam a dancer. The dark is usually a friend to me, allowing me to stretch and move my limbs into unfashionable positions as music washes over me. My music journalism career means I have spent more than two decades at gigs and in clubs, falling in love with music, contorting my body, two‑stepping, making any space into a dancefloor, then going home and writing about it.Two years ago,when I was 36, I was riding high at the launch party formy first book, about housing, home and music, andI danced as R, my husband, DJ’d Tems, Asake and Burna Boy. The publishers had put up a billboard about the book; I remember walking to the petrol station to buy the papers and read the reviews, and feeling relieved that they were good. I began preparing for a summer of talks – oversized suits and heels at the ready. My next event was at a bookshop in Bristol to talk about the idea of home. But my body, unbeknown to me, was feeling verynotat home.My brother-in-law picked me up from the station, and as we chatted I felt a wave of heat come over me. I had a migraine and was about to take an ibuprofen, figuring I could do the talk then go and lie down. Then, all of a sudden, my legs gave way and I passed out. When I woke up, I vomited continually until it felt like a good idea to go to A&E.At Southmead hospital in Bristol they told me I had a burst aneurysm. An opening between blood vessels in my brain, known as a fistula, that I had unknowingly had since birth, had created an aneurysm, which had burst, out of nowhere. Apparently, many people have aneurysms without ever realising. They don’t always lead to a bleed – but mine did. I had had a subarachnoid haemorrhage – a type of stroke, and a phrase I had never heard before. I urgently required coils in my brain to stop the bleeding that had caused the stroke. Death was suddenly asphyxiatingly close.R says he called my mum to tell her and heard a thud then silence. My sister picked up the phone and nonchalantly explained: “Oh, Mum’s just fainted. But we’re on our way.”What followed was four months of many, many operations. I remember flashes: R reading the chef and author Anthony Bourdain to me; my mum massaging my legs, which were out of use, along with the whole right side of my body;and my brother going out for “walks” to cry. I think there were a lot of tears. I don’t remember them all, but I can recall feelings; of abject terror and loss, and also bewilderment. My sister asked me about my book (All the Houses I’ve Ever Lived In) and I had no idea what she was on about. The operations were to reduce cranial swelling, and part of my skull was removed to compensate for it. My mum said that, once, as I was going into theatre I said just three words to her: “Mum, my brain.”After the surgery, I feel staples in my head, which has been almost entirely shaved. I have lost loads of muscle, and I have an eye-patch, because I can only see double without it; the brain swells during a bleed and your optic nerve goes haywire for a while before, if you’re lucky, the swelling reduces.Without good eyesight, I’m reliant on sound to place me. My mum has been dressing me and I have pink cotton pyjamas, as though I’m cosplaying a toddler. I catch sight of myself in a mirror while a nurse is showering me. I am cross-eyed so I can only focus on my outline, but I don’t recognise myself. I try to touch the staples but it’s just a sore, bloody mess.There is a shunt – a thin silicone tube – in my brain, I guess to control fluid. I have a tracheostomy to help me breathe (with a tube that helps oxygen reach my lungs through an opening in my neck), so I can’t speak. I just listen to voices chattering. Later, I become addicted to fizzy drinks, and I’m convinced now that it’s because a nurse opened a bottle of Fanta and the “kshhh” sound stayed with me. Even now I have an idea of the seriousness of brain surgery, but for some reason it doesn’t include me.After six weeks, I’m moved to King’s College hospital in London. My friends visit me, which is great, but I don’t recognise anyone, so I tell my mum that some “nice ladies” came. It’s a constant wave of deja vu, and I can’t completely articulate the dreamscape I’m in, so I just stay for the ride. My best friend, whom I’ve known since school, visits me, and her voice is familiar as she holds my hand and chats, but she may as well be a mirage. I conclude that, right now, reality is too difficult to work out. I have to be content with fragments.When I can speak, after five weeks, it’s a mumble, but I learn lots of new words I want to repeat. “Sara Stedy” (a piece of equipment that helps you stand), tracheostomy, blood thinners, catheters, bladder training. My mum and husband are at my bedside every day, sometimes just watching me sleep.R and Mum are living together while I’m in hospital and he tells me that she has panic-made three dals. He texts me a picture of a rajma and aubergine subji simmering on the stove. I guess the freezer is full. The next day, they both come to visit me in tag-team slots. During my mum’s visit, I fall into a nap, and when I wake up she’s gone, but I have one thick, greasy plait that goes down my back. Every time I feel it I am hysterical because it is the most hilarious and touching thing in the world.Whole chunks of time are lost to the ether as I swirl in and out of consciousnessAfter two months,I move to a rehab centre, which sounds like a celeb addiction hotspot but is devoid of glamour. Although it is evidence of the NHS really working (not something I hear often) and a hospital masquerading as a non-hospital. There are clues: visiting hours and a timetable filled with physio and speech training. Cornflakes every morning. The septuagenarians I share the ward with watch a lot of This Morning on the TV and are desperate to discuss Holly Willoughby with me. After two months, I can’t walk without a crutch but I know how to craft Halloween decorations.I become obsessed with time because I feel it slipping through my fingers. Each day just rolls into one in the hospital, by design. I am able to read, so I read about how clock time has been organised – a colonial pursuit, of course – and its links to capitalism; how Māori relied on astrological patterns before the west squeezed them into 24-hour days to make an organised industrial labour force. I read about protests when “London time” was first rolled out to the rest of the country in the 1800s,and people rejected it by smashing clocks in the street. At 37, I feel it going, going, gone.Whole chunks of time are lost to the ether as I swirl in and out of consciousness, and events that I might be aware of –Saltburn, Farage in a jungle, a new Beyoncé album – all blur into one mass of confusion as I hear snippets of information. My friends make me a zine of pop culture that I’ve missed – it is one of my most treasured possessions. I keep meaning to ask R what’s going on outside when he visits, but I forget.I have a bag full of medication I don’t recognise, and I don’t even bother Googling it because, what’s the point? Knowing what it is won’t make a difference to me taking it. I lie under the clinical fluorescent lighting and think about putting more shit into my body, but immediately submit because considering all the drugs it has consumed in my life it would be a bit rich to complain about blood thinners. I let my mind drift over the chemical formulations on the backs of bottles as I think about how weird it is to take medicine for something when I’m not really sick. Or maybe I am sick. As I drift to sleep I think of my life in the four walls of this ward and how the sounds of beeps from the monitoring machine are going to go on for ever.I love the nurses. Stacy-Ann, who stands on guard as I shower. One Friday she does this and I’m so overwhelmed by the kindness that I swallow a little tear. Geraldine, who makes me laugh; the stern warmth of Margaret, of Leonie and Dr Li Yan. “You’re in good hands, don’t worry,” she tells me. Usually a comment like this would make me do a fake smile of acknowledgment, but today I really think about it, about all the bodies going through trauma and change, and of people trying to say the right thing, and I’m comforted.After four months, a version of me goes homeand the doctors tell me that recovery is now physical. Home is a familiar space, but I’m taking an unfamiliar body into it. R is at a loss at what to do and decides to take control of the fridge shelf, filling it with Dr Pepper, Fanta Lemon and Cherry Coke (my post-aneurysm addictions). I’m delighted. He tells me that when he was getting ready to go to Bristol, terrified that I might die, he had seen a cup of tea I had left on the counter, and that this trace of me had made him burst into tears.I can’t go anywhere without my wheelchair. In the safety of hospital I can do a few steps with my crutch, but now I’m exposed to the elements and there are new needs, like Nando’s and eyebrow threading. Slowly, I graduate to my trusty red walker, then a crutch, then a walking pole, and now, finally, a foldable stick: progress. It’s as if everything has frozen while I’ve been away and every surface is slippery. I want to wait for it to thaw but I know that’s not an option. I have to embrace the precariousness.View image in fullscreenKieran Yates: ‘Thinking in binary terms of Before and After is limiting and false. The two time frames merge until a big bang-type crash happens and I appear.’Photograph: Kate Peters/The GuardianI feel invisible, concentrating on walking around the block, but I’m mistaken because my neighbours stop me all the time, saying “Well done” as they witness progress. The neighbours are heartwarming but the unsolicited advice – mostly from random men – is tedious. (“Are you struggling cos you took the vaccine?”, “You look nice!”) There is a weird sense of entitlement over women’s bodies, I think. I am pleased R has witnessed a bit of this, in the way that it feels oddly affirming when your white friend witnesses racism against you, or you are talked over by men at work. This stuff happens all the time. Mostly, I hear strangers harp on about the benefits of sea moss to me and a true quizzical fear that my burst aneurysm came out of nowhere. Was my lifestyle unhealthy? Was I not active? Stressed? Most people want answers to the unanswerable.I glean that this country is made up ofpeople with head injuries, who tell me about them in the most nonchalant ways:at the gym, on a road, anywhere. One guy got clipped by a tube on a crowded platform, one lady had a stroke at her son’s sports day and thought she was just dehydrated. I listen to these stories with fascination and fear, and marvel at theirbreezy tone. Though, I suppose, they must be thinking the same thing about me.Ihave trouble coordinating the top and bottom halves of my body when I dance. It’s been a year, but, still, the right side has been affected by my brain bleeding and doesn’t obey my commands. I do all my writing with my left hand, which is a pain, but somehow it doesn’t bother me as much as not being able to dance.I go to a night called Out of Body Pop in Dalston, east London. The music artist Kindness is DJing; it’s billed as a space for all bodies, and is roomy enough that I feel safe that no one will knock into me. But all I can do is precariously sidestep, holding firmly on to R.Later, I try to lose myself in the kitchen in the middle of the day to Beyoncé’s Renaissance,but the damage to my cerebellum means I feel as if I’m on the verge of falling. I crumple and give up. The things I used to communicate with my body are messed up, and I might never get that ability back.I understand what disability activists such asKym Oliver and Jumoke Abdullahi,Judy HeumannandSick Sad Girlzare saying now: it’s the feeling of constantly navigating in a world not designed for you. I start going to a dance class that encourages me not to be fearful, to stretch and walk and feel music again. At first, I’m unsure, because these people doing interpretive dance don’t feel like my people. Then I get it. They love music and it commands their bodies, too. They get it.After a few months of class, I take my laptop into the kitchen – the walk feels like ritual. I lovingly place it open,click on Kelela, and turn it up as high as the laptop speakers let me.I let the music realign my body, wake up the parts that had been inert, create some space, and just dance, badly, on my own. I put it on repeat, and dance over and over again to the same song, letting something break inside me, and cry until I’m hoarse.As much as I’ve had to make peace with loss (running for the bus, badminton, anything that requires physical speed), I let in a lot of unexpected joy. I have joined groups. The adapted cycling club at the velodrome has taught me about how different bodies require different things. Anolder woman I call auntie at the pool, who goes every day and walks up and down in the water until it gets too deep, has taught me about resilience. Lecturing at the University of Westminster has taught me that reading books is a balm when you feel as if you know nothing else. My dance class has injected delight back into me.There are new teachers in my life.The social model of disability outlines how different kinds of bodies are often not part of architectural conversations, but my occupational therapist has shown me how a sharp design mind can transform a space – she notes solutions for a slippy rug in the living room, puts up handrails and introduces me toAbleworld(a retailer and website selling design adaptations from cutlery to lights).When my physio comes to my front door she seems shocked that I’m wearing socks. Our brains look for information all the time about terrain, she says, so I should be barefoot. I listen, even though it’s winter. Another physio tells me aboutconstraint induced movement therapy(CIMT) and suggests I wear a mitten on my left hand to make me use the weakened right one, which I do. Another physio has a simple phrase that rings in my head: “Use it or lose it.”‘What if this is just me, like this, how I am, for ever?” I ask R, who is sleepy, in bed at 2am while I’m still awake, thinking about my inability to hop. He turns to me and kisses my forehead. “If it’s this, that works. We are perfect.” I feel such a rush of love for him I hug his neck, nuzzle my face deep into it. In the few seconds this takes, he is fast asleep, snoring gently as if he has released a thought he has been carrying. Fuck the hops, I think.I scroll the TikTok hashtag TBI (traumatic brain injury). It is cool because it is filled with videos of people who are closer to my age, although they all play Sia’s Unstoppable, so I have to watch on mute. I follow various accounts and spend the next few weeks idly watching videos about motorcycle accident recoveries that used to give me joy and now terrify me. I decide to unfollow – TikTok, I decide, is for fun and dancing.I spend time thinking about how I feel, maybe too much. The feeling of being close to death is receding,but for a few months it was near. I sometimes rush to profunditywhen I’m told I could have died, thinking of this existential thing that has happened. But life moves on and the feeling becomes smaller and smaller. I can feel the shunt that is still in my head and the tube running down my neck. It will be there for life and I feel like a cyborg. I like that.All the Houses I’ve Ever Lived In by Kieran Yates review – a house is not a homeRead more“Your job is recovery,” says an author called Emma, gently, when I bring up writing. She’s right. I spend a year walking round my block, and reading, before taking on more and more: talking on panels, writing, editing. I walk 6,000 steps in one day – a PB. I can feel my voice returning, all while medical ones remind me that the majority of gains are seen in the first two years. I don’t know what they mean, exactly, but I just continue. I realise that thinking in binary terms of Before and After is limiting and false. The two time frames merge until a big bang-type crash happens and I appear. I sometimes feel as if I’m floating away in a new body to new things … then find myself writing again, in my office, and I remember that I’m the same, but more. “That’s a good way to be,” I think. Then I carry on.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingStrokeHealthDisabilityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I don’t mean to sayit’s OK to be exposed to social media at a young age, butit needs to be controlled in a certain way.Because I had a flipphone until the middle of secondary school, I haven’t had a TikTok or Snapchat streak with anyone because I never learned how it works.I know this might sound like me complaining over nothing, but it sometimes feels likemy mum is purposely doing this to damage me.My parents are divorced, and my dad thoughtI should have a flipphone until it wasgetting in the way of my friendships, which I suppose was reasonable enough, but no one can contradict my mum.Is my mum just stubborn, or am I complainingtoo much and making a mountain out of a molehill?You told me you are 12 in one of your emails, but then you also mention having a flip phone until the “middle of secondary school”, which would make you 13/14 in the UK, so I’m confused. But I do know school systems can vary and our readership is global, so I’m talking to you as if you are 12. Your age is important here because you aren’t allowed to go on the apps you mention, and some others, until you’re 13. Plenty of people get around this, but even the people who run the apps think below 13 is too young.Being a young person isn’t easy. You are naturally starting to detach from your family, a process that takes years and is essential if you are to eventually “launch” from the nest. Your brain is in a fizz of redevelopment. You think you know what’s best for you, your parents think they do, and somewhere in the middle we must land on a compromise. I don’t doubt your mum’s motivation is to protect you, but yours is to challenge that. It’s interesting that you look at your dad’s actions in a more understanding way, yet he is half of the parenting equation.If she can see your point of view, and you hers, this will be really beneficialI went to child and adolescent psychotherapist Graham Music, who has decades of experience in this field. He pointed out that there’s a “lot of scaremongering, with many leading researchers suggesting tech, screen and social media are bad, full stop. Should we worry about and sometimes limit phone use? Yes. Does that mean we should ban teens from using smartphones? I don’t think so, but this is best worked out in a spirit of mutual compromise in parent-teen relationships based on good communication.”But the point is not really what Music and I think. It’s finding a way that you and your mum (and dad) can talk about this and decide on what is acceptable and what isn’t. Perhaps you could even explore social media together. Music says, quite rightly: “If in family life most things can be discussed, including feelings, hopes or friendship issues, and what can be accessed on smartphones, then there need not be a problem. Of course screens are addictive. But in my experience the young people who are most at risk are those already at risk from abuse, trauma, neglect or stress; the unhappy teens who might use screens to compensate. The worst outcomes are seen in teens who already have psychological issues.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

You’re entitled to care about these things, and to be listened to, but throughout all of this you need to be able to communicate with your mum and she with you. If she can see your point of view, and you hers, this will be really beneficial for all the other discussions that are yet to come. As Music says: “There are no easy answers.

After becoming a defendant myself in a spin-off case – charged with criminal contempt for naming a “secret” witness in the main trial – I found Duncan’s cool, charismatic demeanour to be very much what I needed on my side.But my most abiding memory of Duncan is from the time he was news editor at Time Out (then a radical magazine). There was a dispute when the owner wanted to abandon the system of pay parity; despite being one of the people whose pay would increase, Duncan was as solidly opposed to the change as were his colleagues.At one meeting he gave a powerful speech in support of the principle of equal pay within an organisation. “Does a journalist typing at their desk need more food to stay alive than does the person sweeping around their feet? Do they need more clothes to stay warm in winter?” he asked.His clear statement of the moral case against pay differentials inspired me to continue to work only for organisations which uphold that stance.Albert BealeKing’s Cross, LondonI read of the death of the Guardian journalist Duncan Campbell with sadness. Duncan was such a great help to me following the death of my birth father, the bank robber Bobby King.Bobby and Duncan had become friends during Duncan’s research into the London criminal underworld, and Bobby had contributed interviews for his books and subsequent television series. Afterwards, Duncan tried hard to help keep Bobby on the straight and narrow following his release from prison, giving him a research role for subsequent books.After Bobby’s death in 2000, I got in touch with Duncan. I wanted to write about the shock of discovering, as an adult, that my father had been a rather notorious bank robber. Duncan was kind, supportive and so very helpful in encouraging me to write and in getting the resulting article published in the Guardian.We met in person only once, but his friendly manner and genuine interest in adoption and its aftermath will always stay with me. I remain grateful to this warm-hearted man for his time and encouragement.Allison PerkinBerlin, GermanyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

For each Reform-tempted voter he’s reclaimed, he’s lost twice as many core supporters who are deeply disturbed by echoes of Enoch Powell. The fragile voter coalition that gave him power is being smashed into smaller and sharper shards.The prime minister must find a unifying issue, urgently. According to our recentBig Issue YouGov poll, 72% of the public want the government to do more to tackle poverty in the UK. It’s a core issue for those jumping ship to Reform UK – 68% of those who say they support that party say poverty is a key area where this government is failing.As the child poverty taskforce mulls over how far to go with its “ambitious” strategy, I want the government to see action against poverty as a political opportunity, as well as a moral necessity.I mean my amendment to the bill, due to be debated on Tuesday, as a gift – a way for it to seize the day and do something significant on child poverty.John BirdHouse of LordsHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Just look at what happened in Lambeth, 14 May). We are a group of Lambeth residents campaigning for safer, healthier streets for everyone in our borough.Harker’s arguments simply don’t fit with either the benefits of low-traffic neighbourhoods that we see every day, or with the increasing body of evidence that they improve people’s lives.Rather than simply shuffling traffic between side roads and main roads, as Harker asserts, low‑traffic neighbourhoods in Lambeth and elsewhere lead to significant overall drops across the whole area.Councils implementing LTNs have rightly studied their impacts on boundary roads particularly closely, and acomprehensive reviewof LTN evaluations found that the average change in traffic on boundary roads is negligible; and there’s reason to believe that this may become more favourable over time, as behaviour patterns change. Moreover,evidence shows that collisions and injuries are also reduced significantlywithin low-traffic neighbourhoods, and do not increase on surrounding roads.Tired tropes about roads being “cut off” are demonstrably untrue – every road within an LTN is accessible by motor vehicle. It’s rat‑running which is prevented.Nor is there evidence that low-traffic neighbourhoods increase pollution. On the contrary, separate studies using varying methodologies have found evidence that overall levels of car use and/or car ownership fall among LTN residents. This includesevidence from Lambeth.Harker’s article also fails to mention the other low-traffic neighbourhoods in Lambeth such as Railton Road, Brixton Hill, and Oval – all of which have created safer, healthier neighbourhoods without causing issues on boundary roads – let alone the many other successful examples of LTNs and other traffic calming measures acrossLondonand Europe.Jon Bromwich and Heather GlassLambeth Living StreetsThank you, Joseph Harker, for highlighting how Lambeth council has “ignored petitions and public protests in a desire to claim a green identity in the absence of any other notable achievement”.Residents on Kennington Park estate at the Oval, Lambeth, are being held prisoner by the imposition of a low-traffic neighbourhood calledKennington Oval Reimagined. For two hours a day, many of us are not allowed deliveries or taxis, plumbers or health visitors. Previously quiet streets on the periphery of the estate are rammed with large supermarket and construction lorries. And the supposedly traffic-free roads, filled with overgrown planters and uncollected rubbish, are a magnet for speeding ebikers who endanger pedestrians and children.I want clean air and a healthy neighbourhood. The council’s continuing expansion of LTNs is having the opposite effect and is increasingly unpopular.Joan TwelvesFormerleader, Lambeth council; chair, Kennington Park estatetenants’ and residents’ associationRe Joseph Harker’s article, the trouble is that, to reframe an argument from Brexit, while not all opponents of low-traffic neighbourhoods are culture war petrol-heads, surely all culture war petrol-heads are vigorously opposed to LTNs.The high court decision against Lambeth council has unsurprisingly been greeted gleefully by the rightwing press and its more extreme online counterparts as signalling the end of LTNs. And it will doubtless only make it harder for local authorities to transition to streets that are cleaner, greener, friendlier to pedestrians and, yes, that encourage children to ride their bikes to school.Clearly, efforts to improve people’s quality of life by cutting vehicle use in towns and cities need to be introduced sensitively and sensibly. But court rulings that limit councils’ abilities to make the – already difficult to implement – changes that are needed if residents are to experience less pollution, fewer accidents and a calmer street life aren’t helping the cause.Graham ClewsLewes, East SussexIn the social media-driven, polarised world we now live in, how refreshing to read Joseph Harker’s balanced and sympathetic article about the challenges that people with legitimate concerns about low-traffic neighbourhoods have faced for the past five years.Many, if not most, of us who have campaigned against LTNs have done so not because we want to drive our cars wherever and whenever we want or because we hate cyclists, but because we can’t support the social and environmental injustice of pushing traffic from our roads on to already congested and more polluted “boundary roads” where typically people on lower incomes live.We can’t abide the discrimination against disabled and elderly car-dependent neighbours who are forced to travel miles further to get anywhere, and we are appalled at the damage to jobs and livelihoods that road closures have on small shops and businesses. But whenever we suggest better and fairer ways of discouraging car use, we are not listened to. Only the council knows what works, we are told. Only our councillors know what’s best for us.As one of the 15 community groups who joined forces in January to lobby the government to ensure that councils cannot impose LTNs without the consent of local people, we are heartened to know that there are columnists on the Guardian, like Joseph Harker, who understand residents’ genuine concerns and support our right to be heard.

Two more scouts are missing and another seriously injured. The attack, which was later claimed by Islamic State-Mozambique, came 10 days after another raid on a nearby safari camp in which two people were beheaded and six soldiers were killed.A village of 2,000 people has been displaced by the violence and all conservation work has been suspended in Niassa reserve, according to local groups. On Monday, wildlife and community organisations warned that the violence is risking more than 20 years of conservation work in the area.“The worst thing about these kind of attacks, which is kind of the point, is the fear factor. The attacks are brutal: the two carpenters that were killed at the safari camp were beheaded. There is enormous fear from communities from the brutality of the attack,” said Colleen Begg, managing director of Niassa Carnivore Project, whose headquarters were attacked in the 29 April raid.Begg said that the suspension of tourism activities could affect the area for several years.“Niassa reserve is special because of its size. It is the size of Switzerland. There are very few places like this inAfricawith no fences, with large populations of lions, elephants and animals that require a lot of range. It’s one of these beautiful wilderness areas. We’ve been trying to figure out how to make it a world heritage site and all of that is now at risk because of insecurity,” she said.At 4.2m hectares (10m acres), Niassa is regarded as one of Africa’s most important wildlife refuges. It is home to as many as 1,000 lions, 350 critically endangered African wild dogs, and recovering populations of elephants, buffalo and other keystone species.View image in fullscreenLogos of Mozambique’s Wildlife Conservation Society and Niassa reserve adorn a pickup truck.Photograph: WCS MoçambiqueThe secret bond that helped two captive women survive Mozambique’s IslamistsRead moreIslamic State Mozambique, known locally as al-Shabaab although not linked to the group in Somalia, emerged in 2017 and has displaced more than1 million peoplein northern Mozambique as its activities have expanded. While there was a crackdown on the group after an attack on the city of Palma thatresulted in the suspension of a major gas project by TotalEnergies, the militants remain active in the country’s northernmost province.Nine conservation and safari camps have been abandoned since the attacks, with one destroyed by the Islamist group. Begg said that urgent support was needed to restore peace in the region and prevent further loss of life. The Mozambican army is in pursuit of the IS-linked group.“Obviously, the first task is to solve the problems with the insurgents and get them out of Niassa. If we cannot create peace, people can’t walk to collect honey, they can’t go to their fields, they can’t harvest. It’s impossible for conservationists. No tourists will come. It is devastating,” Begg said.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentThe age of extinctionIslamic StateMozambiqueAfricaConservationEndangered habitatsConflict and armsnewsShareReuse this content"

The ministry of the navy, with the support of local authorities, is currently attending to the wounded.”A Mexicangovernment bulletinsaid 22 crew members were injured, 11 of them critically, with nine in a stable condition. It confirmed that the two who died were navy cadets – and that officials were taking steps to reunite survivors with their families.Mexican officials and media there identified the two victims of the crash as Adal Jair Marcos, 22, a resident of Puebla originally from Oaxaca, and América Yamilet Sánchez, from Xalapa, Veracruz. Both were said to have been on the same mast at the time of the wreck.“The navy, aware of the risks naval personnel face in their operations, deeply regrets what happened and reaffirms its commitment to the crew’s families to provide timely attention and follow-up to the investigations into the events that occurred to accurately determine the causes of this incident,” the bulletin said.The extent of the damage became apparent at first light on Sunday when images showed the vessel docked on the East River with the tops of two masts splintered – and a third dangling at a 45-degree angle.Seven uniformed navy members were spotted boarding the ship, CNN reported.View image in fullscreenPedestrians walking along Brooklyn Bridge Park look on as a masted Mexican Navy training ship sits stranded near the Manhattan Bridge after colliding with the Brooklyn Bridge, Saturday.Photograph: Nick Corso/APMultiple videos of the crash showed the masts snapping and partially collapsing as they crashed into the deck of the bridge. There was heavy traffic on the bridge at the time of the collision.The vessel, which was flying a giant green, white and red Mexican flag, then drifted toward the edge of the river as onlookers scrambled away from shore. Nobody was reported injured on the bridge, which was undamaged, said Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City,in a Facebook post.An earlier statementposted by the Mexican navysaid the Cuauhtémoc would be prevented from continuing its scheduled 254-day voyage. It was taking part in an ongoing celebration of the 200th anniversary of the independence of Mexico – achieved from Spain in 1821 – and was to have visited 22 ports in 15 countries to “carry the message of peace and goodwill of the Mexican people to the seas and ports of the world”.It sailed from Acapulco on Mexico’s Pacific coast on 6 April and was due to make stops in a succession of countries around the Caribbean before crossing the Atlantic to Europe, including stopovers in Aberdeen and London.Its crew consisted of 64 women and 213 men.Sydney Neidell and Lily Katz told the Associated Press they were sitting outside to watch the sunset when they saw the vessel strike the bridge and one of its masts snap.“We saw someone dangling, and I couldn’t tell if it was just blurry or my eyes, and we were able to zoom in on our phone and there was someone dangling from the harness from the top for like at least like 15 minutes before they were able to rescue them,” Katz said.They said they saw two people removed from the ship on stretchers on to smaller boats.TheBrooklynBridge, which opened in 1883, has a nearly 1,600-ft (490 metres) main span that is supported by two masonry towers. More than 100,000 vehicles and an estimated 32,000 pedestrians cross every day, according to the city’s transportation department, and its walkway is a major tourist attraction.The Cuauhtémoc – about 297ft long and 40ft wide (90.5 metres long and 12 metres wide), according to the Mexican navy – sailed for the first time in 1982. Each year it sets out at the end of classes at the naval military school to finish cadets’ training.The Associated Press reported that Saturday’s crash happened as the Cuauhtémoc maneuvered in turbulent waters. The tide had just turned, and a fast current headed up the East River as a wind of 10mph set in.The Associated Press contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsNew YorkBrooklynMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The new president will nominate the next prime minister and influence the formation of a new coalition.The former soccer ultra and ultranationalist agitator, who sees his far-right AUR party as a “natural ally” of the US Maga movement, scored almost double his rival’s total, but polls in recent days had shown the gap between the two narrowing.Turnout, which was 53% in the first round, was almost 65%, with young people and Romanians living abroad in particular voting in significantly higher numbers, official figures showed. Analysts had said a high turnout would favour Dan.The vote is a rerun of last November’s ballot, won by Călin Georgescu, a far-right, Moscow-friendly firebrand, who was barred from standing again after the vote was cancelled amid allegations of campaign finance violations and Russian meddling.The Romanian foreign ministry said earlier on Sunday it had seen “a viral campaign of fake news on Telegram and other social media platforms” designed “to influence the electoral process”, adding that this bore “the hallmarks of Russian interference”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is thought likely to nominate a USR prime minister and try to form a minority government, possibly backed by the PNL.Addressing his jubilant supporters in central Bucharest, he said he would start talks on forming a new government on Monday but acknowledged his job would be hard. “There will be a difficult period ahead, needed for economic rebalancing,” he said. “Please have hope and patience.”Simion opposed further aid to Ukraine and had sharply criticised the EU’s leadership. While he insisted he wants Romania to stay in the EU and Nato, he could have allied with Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Slovakia’s Robert Fico as another disruptive force.Mujtaba Rahman, of the Eurasia Group consultancy, said the outcome was “a really strong result for the pro-European candidate”, reflecting the way “concerns about political and policy direction moving in a Maga-like way have mobilised voters”.The founder of the Telegram messaging app, Pavel Durov, earlier appeared to accuse the French government of asking the company to “silence conservative voices in Romania in the election”. France “categorically rejected” what it called “completely unfounded allegations”.Russian-born Durov, who is now a French national, is being investigated in France over possession of child abuse image, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions on the app.Explore more on these topicsRomaniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Socialist party (PS) had taken 23.4% of the vote t0 Chega’s 22.6%, and the two were tied on 58 seats each.Votes from abroad, which will be counted in the coming days, could still put Chega in second place, which would be the first time in almost 40 years that the Socialists do not finish in the top two spots.In thelast election, held 14 months ago, the AD won 80 seats, the PS 78 and Chega 50.Despite not winning a majority, Montenegro told a crowd of supporters early on Monday he had received a clear and reinforced mandate from the Portuguese to govern. “The people want this government and this prime minister,” he said. Montenegro added that the Socialist party was apparently not inclined to negotiate any broad majority agreement, and that he was sticking to his promise of not having any deals with Chega.“Just let us work,” he said.Chega’s leader, André Ventura, said his party’s impressive showing at the polls – well up on the 18% of the vote it took last time round – had ended 50 years of conservative and socialist governments and “killed bipartisanship in Portugal”.“We didn’t win this election but we’ve made history,” he told a room packed with jubilant supporters, adding he believed his party would still finish second.2:44Nicuşor Dan set to win in Romania as Europe votes in ‘Super Sunday’ of elections – videoBut Chega’s elation will be tempered by Montenegro’s explicit refusal to strike any deals with Ventura’s party. “Governing with Chega is impossible for three reasons,” Montenegro has previously said. “It isn’t reliable in its thinking; it behaves like a political weathervane, always changing its mind, and it’s not suited to the exercise of government.”The small Liberal Initiative party – which could throw its weight behind Montenegro, bringing the AD around seven extra seats – has alsocategorically refusedto do anything that would help Chega into power.Despite the AD’s victory, Montenegro will face another fragmented and awkward legislature if invited to form a new government by the president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, while the Socialists will be carrying out grim postmortems into what went wrong.Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos said he was stepping down early on Monday and that he would not be a candidate when the party holds an internal ballot to elect a replacement.Marina Costa Lobo, a political scientist at the University of Lisbon, told Agence France-Presse that Chega was “the big winner of the night”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Buthe failed to win the confidence of MPs and a fresh election was called.The electoral campaign has focused onissues such as housing, public services and safety. Immigration – one of Chega’s priorities – has also risen up the agenda, and Montenegro’s caretaker government was recentlyaccused of pandering to the far rightafter it announced the expulsion of 18,000 irregular migrants earlier this month.Chega, which was formed six years ago, has sought to capitalise on widespread dissatisfaction with Portugal’s mainstream left and right parties as the country continues to suffer a housing crisis, soaring rental and property prices, stressed health and education systems, and an average monthly wage of €1,602 (£1,346).But Chega’s vows to clean up politics – and its hardline stance on immigration and people abusing the benefits system – have recently been undermined by the kind of corruption and sleaze scandals it has been railing against.In January, Ventura’s party expelled one of its MPs after he was accused of stealing suitcases at several airports. Another member of the party was caught drunk-driving the same month, while a third has been charged with paying for oral sex with an underage male who was 15 at the time.The Chega leader’s final few days of campaigning were alsointerrupted by ill health.After twice falling ill at rallies this week and receiving hospital treatment for oesophageal spasms caused by gastric reflux and high blood pressure, Ventura made a surprise appearance at his party’s final campaign event on Friday.Explore more on these topicsPortugalEuropeSpainnewsShareReuse this content"

Trailing him was Nawrocki, who has been endorsed by the Law and Justice party (PiS), with 29.1% of the vote.Trzaskowski had long been the favourite to win the election, but his lead over Nawrocki had narrowed in recent weeks. The exit poll, however, points to a first-round result that was closer than anticipated between the frontrunners, yielding a result that is likely to make Trzaskowski and Tusk nervous.Centre-right party on course to win in Portugal as far right make record gainsRead moreSoon after the exit poll was released, Tusk reacted on social media. Everything was at stake now, he wrote, adding that “the next two weeks will decide the future” ofPoland. “Not one step back!”he said.2:44Nicuşor Dan set to win in Romania as Europe votes in ‘Super Sunday’ of elections – videoThe sentiment was echoed by former Polish president Aleksander Kwaśniewski. “The stakes are huge,” Kwaśniewski, whose term ran from 1995 to 2005 and includedPolandjoining Nato and the EU, told broadcaster TVP Info. “We are fighting for Poland to be on the side of European democracies, [otherwise] it’d be on the side of European troublemakers, those who want to go down the [Hungarian PM Viktor] Orbán or [Slovak PM Robert] Fico route.”The outgoing president,Andrzej Duda, is a close ally of the previous PiS government and a supporter of Donald Trump. He opposed the changes pursued by the new administration and blocked some decisions, including ambassadorial nominations.An opposition win would extend the current deadlock, prompting years of political instability.The official results of the first round, in which 13 candidates were vying to be elected as president, are expected on Monday or Tuesday.The two candidates will face off against each other in a runoff vote on 1 June, with voters asked to decide between Trzaskowski’s promises of reforming judicial institutions and rebuilding democratic institutions and Nawrocki’s admiration of Donald Trump, strong anti-migration rhetoric and pledges to crack down on “woke” liberal values.The supporters of Sławomir Mentzen, a libertarian far-right candidate who came in third place with 15.4% of the vote on Sunday, according to exit polls, could prove key to the second round. A Eurosceptic who is staunchly opposed to abortion and migrants, Mentzen had taken aim at the country’s 1 million Ukrainian refugees, accusing them of taking advantage of Poland.The high number of votes for Mentzen suggested he had benefited from frustrated votersseeking to breakthe country’s two-party hold on power.Speaking after the results were announced, Trzaskowski warned voters that Nawrocki was a “radical” politician and would cause even further disruption in the country’s heavily polarised politics.Meanwhile, Nawrocki made a direct appeal to third-placed Mentzen, urging him and his voters to help him “save Poland” and “stop Donald Tusk’s march to monocracy”.In another surprising turn, 6.2% of voters backed Grzegorz Braun, according to the exit poll, catapulting the lawmaker from the right-wing Confederation party into fourth place. Braun isunder investigationafter he used a fire extinguisher to put out Hanukah candles in the Polish parliament in a protest against the celebration of Jewish holidays and, two weeks ago, the European parliament voted to lift his immunity as a European lawmaker.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has denied the allegations.If confirmed, the exit poll suggests that the radical right candidates did better than expected in the first round, while centrist and leftwing candidates did worse, said Ben Stanley, a political scientist at SWPS University in Warsaw.What this could mean for the second round, however, was unclear. “With this many candidates and 2 percentage point margins of error, there is still scope for the picture to change either way,” he said.The first round saw about 15% of votes cast for the centre-right Szymon Hołownia as well as the New Left’s Magdalena Biejat and hard-left Adrian Zandberg, meaning Trzaskowski is likely to spend some of the next two weeks trying to plan how to woo these very different groups of voters to back him in the second round.The vote for Poland’s next president, a position that shapes foreign policy and can be used to introduce and veto legislation,has been cast as a “make or break” momentfor the country’s pro-European coalition government.Led by Tusk, the coalition features an unwieldy mix of parties that span the political spectrum. Since taking power in late 2023 after eight years in which PiS was accused of eroding democratic checks and balances and becoming increasingly authoritarian, the coalition’s ability to follow through on promises such as reforming the justice system, liberalising abortion laws and introducing same-sex civil partnerships has been in part stymied by Duda.The stalemate loomed over the presidential election, turning the ballot into a question of whether voters wanted to carry through with the political overhaul that began in 2023 when PiS was ousted from power in the country’s parliament.“The stakes are enormous for the ruling coalition and for those concerned with the future of Polish democracy,” said Jacek Kucharczyk, president of the Institute of Public Affairs, a Warsaw thinktank. “This is about democratic reform and restoring the rule of law – and that can only happen with cooperation from the next president.”The sentiment was echoed by Tusk, who last month said the stakes were as high as they had been in the 2023 election. “It’s hard to govern alongside a hostile president, with all those vetoes,” he told parliament.The election was being closely watched across Europe. Bordering Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave, Belarus and war-torn Ukraine, Poland has been a key logistics hub for military aid to Ukraine and, under Tusk’s leadership, has been a key voice against Russia on Nato’s eastern flank.The election is also likely to prove pivotal for Law and Justice. “With Nawrocki as president, the government would be paralysed and that could eventually lead to the fall of the ruling coalition,” the political scientist Anna Materska-Sosnowska told AFP.It could mean “the return of the populists with renewed force” at the next general election, she added.Explore more on these topicsPolandEuropeDonald TuskAndrzej DudaThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

There are some outstanding issues on both sides and conversations will continue overnight.”No 10’s decision toissue a press statementon Saturday presenting the summit as a done deal caused irritation in Brussels, prompting some to recall the mantra of Brexit negotiations: “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.”One EU diplomat said: “The whole discussion is a package. We will not accept elements that are only at the advantage [or] request of the UK without strong guarantees and commitments on other issues of importance for the EU, such as fisheries, energy, youth mobility.”Nick Thomas-Symonds, the UK minister in charge of negotiations, said on Sunday that talks were in their “final hours”, but admitted key details of the deal were still being worked out.Nevertheless, a flagshipsecurity and defence partnershipmeans the UK could get access to a £125bn EU defence fund to rearm the continent, underlining the closeness of the security relationship with the bloc over the Ukraine conflict, in what could be a boost for British defence companies. The UK would be expected to contribute to the fund in return.Downing Street hopes the summit with von der Leyen and other Brussels chiefs will draw a line under the turbulentBrexityears and show that the UK has fundamentally changed. They believe the deal would be regarded as a “step towards” a deeper partnership with Europe.Ministers are ready for a big political offensive to explain the benefits of closer ties with the EU, amid some anxiety withinLabourover how Reform UK will respond.Both Nigel Farage and Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, have already described the deal as a “surrender”, despite not yet knowing the details, and have indicated they would tear it up if they came to power.Starmer is also facing pressure from within Labour, and from the progressive parties, to go further. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, urged the prime minister to be “bold and ambitious for our country” and ignore “dinosaurs fighting old battles”.Public attitudes towards Brexit have shifted significantly. Polls now suggesttwo-thirds of Britons back a closer relationship with the EU, and just 20% are opposed.Fishing remains a stumbling block to getting the deal over the line. The EU insists that the UK government offer long-term access to British waters, beyond the four-year deal proposed by the Starmer government, and instead is pushing for a double-digit extension.Brussels has linked fishing with an agreement to drop checks and bureaucracy around the sale of food, animal and other agricultural products, known as sanitary and phytosanitary goods. The EU has suggested this should be pegged to the same timescale as fish.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Conservatives have suggested it would involve a return to free movement “by the back door”.Other issues understood to remain on the table on Sunday night were tuition fees, with Brussels pushing for EU students in Britain to pay the domestic rate rather than the much higher international rate, as well as the fee levied on EU nationals for using the NHS.However, British holidaymakers are expected to faceshorter airport queues this summer. Negotiators are on the verge of striking an agreement for UK passport holders to use e-gates across Europe, rather than waiting in queues to have their passports stamped.There are plans to merge British and European emissions trading schemes, which the government says will reduce household bills and open up electricity trading with the continent.Starmer faces a political battle with Reform UK and the Tories over his deal. Badenoch has promised to tear up any agreement Starmer that crosses strict Brexiter red lines should she make it into office. Her pledge is unhelpful to Labour’s attempts to convince Brussels that the UK is now a reliable negotiating partner.The Lib Dems, meanwhile, have urged the government to join a new UK-EU customs union to boost trade with the bloc and boost growth. “The prime minister must ignore the dinosaurs fighting old battles, who want to drag us back to the destructive Brexit wars of the past, and focus on getting the best deal possible for the UK,” Davey said.The Scottish National party went further, arguing that there was not a deal available better than rejoining the EU, almost a decade after the UK voted to leave. Its Europe spokesperson, Stephen Gethins, added: “It is the biggest and the best growth strategy available and yet it is the only option the Labour party have turned their face against – all because they are running scared of Nigel Farage.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeKeir StarmerLabourUrsula von der LeyenBrexitForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The sound of the bombing is terrifying … Our situation is worse than I can describe. It is truly catastrophic. We have nothing left but hope that this war will end as soon as possible,” Rahal told the Guardian.Gaza will be entirely destroyed, Israeli minister saysRead moreBasel al-Barawi, 46, fled Beit Lahiya with his family on Sunday after 10 relatives were killed.“Only a six-year-old girl survived, and she is now in the hospital. We started pulling them from under the rubble – their features were disfigured, their bodies covered in dirt, their clothes torn. Their skin had turned grey from the ash and dust. I felt my heart tearing apart as I carried them,” Barawi said.Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry. Israel has accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, which the group denies.Hamas took about 250 hostages during its October 2023 attack on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Fifty-eight hostages are held by Hamas, most of whom are thought to be dead.The indirect talks in Qatar arereportedly focusing on securing a two-month truce, with Hamas freeing about half the 20 or so living hostages it is still holding. In return, Israel would release hundreds of Palestinians from its jails and end the total blockade it has placed on Gaza since early March. The US would offer strong guarantees to ensure talks about a permanent end to the war took place. However, sources on both sides said there had been no progress by late Sunday afternoon.In March, Israel refused to engage in talks about a second phase of a fragile two-month ceasefire that could have led to an end to the conflict and the release of the remaining hostages. It then cut off all supplies to Gaza and relaunched its air offensive.Netanyahu has been repeatedlyaccused of prolonging the warfor domestic political reasons – which he denies – and has frequently promised that Israel will continue to fight until Hamas is “crushed”.In Israel, Einav Zangauker, the mother of a hostage still held by Hamas, said Netanyahu was refusing to end the war because of his political interests. “The Israeli government still insists on only partial deals. They are deliberately tormenting us. Bring our children back already! All 58 of them,” Zangauker said in a post on X.Hamas, whichreleased a US-Israeli hostage last weekas a goodwill gesture before Donald Trump travelled to the Middle East for a four-day visit, has always insisted on a deal that definitively ends the war and leads to the withdrawal of Israel’s forces. It has also refused to disarm or to accept the exile of its leaders.Israel, which claims Hamas systematically loots aid to fund its military and other operations, has put forward a plan to distribute humanitarian assistance from a series of hubs in Gaza run by private contractors and protected by Israeli troops.Israel-backed food aid group admits it won’t be able to reach most vulnerable in GazaRead moreThe UShas backed the plan, which has been described as unworkable, dangerous and potentially unlawful by aid agencies because it could lead to the forced mass transfer of populations. Food security experts have warned that any delay will cost lives, and that cases of acute malnutrition, particularly among young children, are soaring.The massive new offensive, the recent strikes and the tight blockade imposed on Gaza in March by Israel have prompted a growing wave of international concern and anger. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, on Friday said the bombing campaign aimed at bringing about a “permanent demographic shift in Gaza” that was in “defiance of international law” and was equivalent to ethnic cleansing.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelHamasPalestinian territoriesQatarMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Shortly after, they were forced to flee whenit was bombed in a strike that killed his cousin and nephew.They have since returned, being among the lucky few in the neighbourhood to “have walls that remain standing”.In recent weeks, the government has adopted a more critical tone against Israel. On Wednesday, the Middle East minister, Hamish Falconer,calledIsrael’s aid blockade “appalling”, “cruel” and “indefensible”, while the foreign secretary, David Lammy, said the UK was in talks with France andSaudi Arabiaover the recognition of a Palestinian state ahead of a conference in June.Moran said: “I remain frustrated that while the government’s words and tone have changed, in terms of concrete actions, not much has changed.”She called on the government to recognise a Palestinian state, which would “safeguard Palestinian interests and also send a very clear signal toIsraelthat there are consequences to their actions”. She also condemned the government for allowing trade from illegal settlements and for “still arming Israel when they shouldn’t be”.Moran said the plight of Mohammad’s family “reminds us that we have citizens of the United Kingdom that are being affected by what’s going on in northern Gaza”.Mohammad, who has worked for the health service for 20 years, grew up in the Jabaliya refugee camp. He is in regular contact with family members stuck in Gaza.“The entire population has been squeezed into around a couple of kilometres,” he said. “A very small area with no shelter, no food, nothing. It’s beyond description.”“People are really starving to death, because there’s nothing left. They haven’t seen proper food or aid for the past three months.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Overnight,Israeli airstrikeskilled at least 100 people. Hunger and starvation are rife as the blockade imposed by Israel looks set to enter its 11th week.“Everything is destroyed there. In the first starvation wave, there was animal food that people used to dice. Now, there is none of that. You’re very lucky if you have a bit of flour to make some bread.“The bombs won’t be able to kill everyone, it’s the starvation that will,” he said.Mohammad said that when he calls his parents, they tell him: “We are OK, we are managing.” He is particularly concerned about their wellbeing. His mother has diabetes and hypertension and his father had his colon removed, leaving him frail.“[My brother-in-law] said, your dad doesn’t tell you because he doesn’t want you to worry you so much,” he said. “Anybody a bit vulnerable basically dies.”Mohammad has been told of the desperate conditions on the ground, describing “people dying of hunger and bombing” and those with infections or struck by missiles being unable to find treatment.“Anybody who gets wounded is so unlucky, because they die. There is no treatment, no medicine, nothing to offer them,” he said.His brother-in-law told him “there are people with no skin. The missiles they fire burn the skin off them. They tell you, ‘I wish I could die.’” He also described soaring prices for basic food and supplies including tents and sugar, adding that oil was being “sold in syringes in units of 5ml, 10ml or 20ml” to ration it out.Moran, who struck up a friendship with Mohammad while she recovered from surgery, said: “Starvation shouldn’t be a weapon of war and it is unbearably cruel that it’s got to the levels of destitution that Mohammad’s family are describing, but their story is just one of millions that are now trapped in northern Gaza in a situation that seems even worse than at the beginning.“It has to stop now and the UK government needs to redouble its efforts to make that happen.”Explore more on these topicsLayla MoranIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesLiberal DemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

The walls were cracked, the roof crumbling, windows blown inward, and glass shards scattered across the floor, mingling with the ashes of her daughter’s books.The 45-year-old gazed out through a fractured window frame at the looming mountains. “Hell has been raining down from there,” she said.Begum lives in a hamlet near Uri, a town 60 miles (100km) north-west of Srinagar, the capital of Indian-administered Kashmir. The hamlet is perilouslyclose to the line of control,the heavily militarised de facto border dividing Kashmir between India and Pakistan.India blocks X accounts of Chinese state media over coverage of Kashmir crisisRead moreTensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours escalated into open military confrontation aftera militant attackon 22 April killed 25 tourists and a local guide in Pahalgam. India accused Pakistan of having “linkages” to the attack, without publicly presenting evidence. Pakistan denied any involvement.Soon after, artillery fire erupted across the disputed frontier.“It felt like my ears would burst from the explosions,” said Begum, who has witnessed previous skirmishes but described this as the most intense. “I thought we wouldn’t survive.” She managed to escape to a nearby town with her husband and six-year-old daughter.India and Pakistanhave fought over Kashmirsince gaining independence in 1947, each claiming the entire Himalayan region but controlling only parts of it.MapIn Indian-administered Kashmir – a Muslim-majority territory – a popular uprising against Indian rule turned violent in the 1990s, with thousands of young men taking up arms to demand either a merger withPakistanor full independence. Most militant groups pledged allegiance to Pakistan, which provided training, arms and logistical support.India responded with a massive counterinsurgency campaign that reduced militant numbers from thousands to hundreds. Despite these operations, the insurgency has never been fully quelled and continues to fuel deadly attacks in Kashmir and mainlandIndia.This time, tensions escalated when India, in response to the attack on tourists, struck suspected militant sites inside Pakistan and in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, prompting retaliatory attacks from Pakistan over what it called violations of its territorial integrity.As the region inched closer to all-out conflict, both sideslaunched missiles at each other’s key military bases and airfields, and relentless shelling continued for days. The violence only subsided after Donald Trump announced an immediate ceasefire brokered by Washington.By then, dozens were dead. Kashmir bore the brunt, with approximately 50 civilians killed on both sides, tens of thousands displaced, and several residential areas reduced to rubble.View image in fullscreenKashmiri women grieve after their house in Salamabad village, Uri, was damaged by shelling from PakistanPhotograph: Farooq Khan/EPAIndia and Pakistan both claimed victory. But in Kashmir, fear lingers. Begum and her family returned reluctantly to their village to rebuild. While residents cherish the fragile peace, few believe it will endure.“I pray this calm lasts,” Begum said. “But these countries will never coexist peacefully unless their issues are resolved. It’s only a matter of time – weeks, months or years – before we’re caught in their war again.”This fear is echoed by many Kashmiris and observers, who say the circumstances leading to the confrontation remain unchanged.A fragile peaceTwo days after the Pahalgam attack, local police identified three gunmen and released sketches with a bounty of 2m rupees (about £19,000) on each. One was named as a local militant, and the others as Pakistanis. All remain at large.In his first address after the escalation, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, declared that India had only “paused” its military action and would “retaliate on its own terms”. India’s defence minister added that “any attack on Indian soil will be considered an act of war”.Experts say such statements increase the likelihood of future escalation, potentially playing into the hands of militant groups.“This statement is deeply unfortunate. It locks India into a mechanical response – meaning every terrorist act will lead to an attack on Pakistan,” said Ajai Sahni, a counter-terrorism expert based in India. “We must understand that many of these terrorists aim to provoke war between India and Pakistan.”In 2019, the Modi governmentunilaterally revoked Kashmir’s limited autonomy, splitting it into two union territories. A crackdown on dissent followed, alongside new laws that stripped local people of exclusive rights over land and jobs – stoking fears of demographic change.Modi justified the move as a step toward development and better security. Since then, Kashmir has been promoted as a peaceful tourist destination, with rising visitor numbers touted as evidence of normality. However, the Pahalgam attack exposed the fragility of that narrative.In fact, since 2019, the region has witnessed anew wave of attacks by highly trained militants, not only targeting government forces but Hindu minority communities, non-local labourers and Hindu pilgrims.Indian army and police sources told the Guardian that about 100 militants were active in India-administered Kashmir. Trained in sophisticated jungle warfare and equipped with modern communications, they pose a persistent challenge.Since India’s recent military operations, the threat of further attacks appears to have increased. Terrorist groups includingal-Qaida have reportedly issued new warningsagainst India and vowed to strike again.Pravin Sawhney, a prominent defence analyst and former military officer, said he believed India’s actions had done little to deter militants. He warned that the threshold for war between India and Pakistan was dangerously low, especially after the Modi government’s declaration that any future militant attack would be treated as an act of war.As drones and loitering munitions were seen during the recent flare-up, Sawhney said this could become normal.“The new normal is that whenever there is a terrorist attack and India responds, we’ll see drones, rockets and loitering ammunition fired across the border,” he said.“The point is that Kashmir is not peaceful or normal. It is a war zone. So if you bring tourists here, these attacks can happen anywhere, anytime. Security forces cannot be everywhere at once.”For ordinary Kashmiris, the situation feels increasingly helpless. On one side looms the constant threat of renewed violence; on the other, a harsh internal crackdown. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, hundreds have been detained. About 90 people – mostly young men – have been heldunder the Public Safety Act, a draconian law that allows detention without trial for up to two years.Explore more on these topicsKashmirIndiaPakistanSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Although AS is often fatal, patients survive and regain a normal life if it is detected and treated early.Nevertheless, more than 400 people a year with AS die because they cannot get access fast enough on the NHS to a life-saving non-surgical procedure called transcatheter aortic valve implantation (Tavi), it has emerged.The disclosure has come from a survey of Tavi waiting times at the 35 specialist centres across the UK that provide the procedure. Heart doctors say the findings have exposed an “unacceptable” mortality in Britain linked to the fact that it carries out far fewer Tavi procedures than many other European countries.‘She was so fit, so well’: the heart patient who died before getting vital procedureRead moreDr Jon Byrne, a cardiologist at King’s College hospital in London, who initiated the research, said: “Of all the people on the waiting list to have Tavi, 8% died before they received treatment – 8% is a big figure. That 8% is just over 400 patients a year.“It’s disturbing that this is happening. While some of those waiting die of other conditions, a significant proportion of them would have survived if they had been treated with Tavi.”The true death toll is much higher – probably about 800 a year, Byrne said – because the survey only received data from 18 of the 35 centres. AS mainly affects people in their 70s, 80s and 90s.The research, by the medical group Valve for Life, also found that:A death rate as high as 20% at some hospitals which perform Tavi.The average waiting time for the procedure across the UK is 142 days – over 20 weeks – even though those with severe AS have a 50% risk of dying.White patients are more likely to undergo Tavi than those from minority ethnic communities.In an article for the website Cardiology News that will be published on Monday, Byrne writes: “These findings expose a growing crisis in access to Tavi across the UK.“Despite the dedication and expertise of clinicians delivering exceptional care under increasing pressure, system inefficiencies, health inequalities and capacity constraints continue to put patients at risk.”The long waiting times for patients between being referred for Tavi and having it “are leaving thousands of patients at risk”, Byrne writes, in an opinion piece co-authored with Wil Woan, the executive director of the charity Heart Valve Voice.Woan said: “Evidence collected by the European Society of Cardiology shows that the UK is well behind Europe in the amount of TAVI we do. It means that lots of people are dying unnecessarily.“TAVI gives people with AS their life back. It makes them fitter, stronger and healthier. The NHS needs to expand the number of people who have it.”NHS England is understood to be developing plans to tackle mortality through a fast-track process under which the most urgent AS cases will undergo Tavi within eight weeks.Delays in accessing Tavi also put “a significant strain on the NHS” because patients who go untreated end up needing to be admitted to hospital as emergencies, the authors add.Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, the British Heart Foundation’s clinical director, said: “It’s concerning to hear red flags raised about patients dying whilst waiting in situations in which a timely heart procedure may have saved their life.“Nearly four out of 10 people are waiting more than 18 weeks [for treatment], which is too long when it comes to heart conditions, where timely care is critical.“Long delays at this scale put people at risk of living in ill health or being unable to work due to heart failure which could have been avoided, and having their lives cut short.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care acknowledged that heart patients were facing long delays.A spokesperson for the department said: “Because of the dire state of the NHS this government inherited, patients around the country, including those suffering from aortic stenosis, are waiting too long for treatment.“Through our plan for change, we are delivering the investment and reform needed to get the NHS back on its feet and provide faster treatment for everyone who needs it, including those waiting for Tavi.”Meanwhile, growing numbers of people in the UK under 65 are dying of heart attacks and strokes, reversing decades of progress on cardiac disease, the British Heart Foundation warned on Monday.The rate of people aged 20-64 dying of heart problems rose from 49 per 100,000 in 2019 to 55 per 100,000 in 2023, analysis by the charity shows. Deaths from cardiac disease among working age adults rose by 18% over the same period, from 18,693 in 2019 to 21,975 in 2023 – 420 a week.The increasingly unhealthy population, health inequalities, obesity and Covid-19 are among the factors that explain the upward trend, the BHF said.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthHeart attacknewsShareReuse this content"

Lineker said in a statement that he would “never knowingly share anything antisemitic” and had deleted the post “as soon as I became aware of the issue”.TheBBCdirector general, Tim Davie, had been facing calls all week to sack Lineker, who was paid £1.4m by the BBC last year.“The BBC’s reputation is held by everyone and when someone makes a mistake, it costs us,” Davie said when asked about the incident after giving a speech in Salford. “I think we absolutely need people to be exemplars of the BBC’s values and follow our social media policy. Simple as that.”More than 10,000 people signed apetition, sponsored by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, which urged the BBC to “immediately remove Gary Lineker from his position”.Lineker was already due to leave his role on Match of the Day at the end of the season, but was expected to host the corporation’s coverage of the FA Cup in 2025-26 and the World Cup next summer.He will be replaced on Match of the Day by Gabby Logan, Kelly Cates and Mark Chapman, who will share the presenting role from the next Premier League season.A source toldthe Sun: “Gary acknowledged his position at the BBC, anchoring the most prestigious tournament in world football, was untenable, and he will not be hosting the World Cup.“He offered to step down at the end of the season, and did not want the BBC – an organisation he still holds in the highest of esteem – dragged into any further controversy.“He remains absolutely devastated by the recent turn of events and is deeply regretful about how his post was interpreted. His last Match of the Day will air on Sunday now and he won’t be back.”In March 2023, Lineker was temporarily suspended from the BBC over comments he made criticising the Conservative government’s asylum policy.In February this year, he was also among 500 high-profile cultural figures who called on the BBC to rebroadcast a documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, calling it an “essential piece of journalism”. The broadcaster removed the documentary from BBC iPlayer after it emerged that the film’s 14-year-old narrator was the son of a deputy agriculture minister in the territory’s Hamas-run government.The BBC declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsGary LinekerMatch of the DayBBCAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

A spending review due to be published on 11 June will set out the government’s priorities for the next three years.Speculation has increased that the chancellor will be forced to cut departmental budgets or raise taxes to stay within her fiscal rules after a weakening of the economic outlook and the prospect of lower tax receipts.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has instructed all areas of the NHS to raise productivity to release funds for investment.However, unions have begun to call forinflation-busting pay rises this summer, adding to the squeeze on the public purse.Cebr said the UK’s overall productivity – which combines private and public sector employees – had experienced persistent sluggishness since the 2008 financial crisis and that the country measured poorly relative to several of its peers.In 2023 the UK’s productivity ranked below Germany and France. Relative to the US, productivity in the UKwas 19% lower.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under the dual headwinds of shrinking productivity and rising wages, the public purse is under mounting pressure to maintain its staffing costs and output.“Policymakers will need to consider how to boost efficiency while navigating tight fiscal rules and a changing labour market.

This took the average asking price to a new record of £379,517, after a previous record was set last month.It marks the fifth consecutive year in which asking prices have reached a record level in May, a time of year when the British property market istraditionally at its busiest, as sellers feel their homes and gardens are primed to attract bids, and buyers start to look around.UK mortgage lending at four-year high amid rush to avoid stamp duty riseRead moreHowever, the monthly seasonal price increase was the lowest since 2016, as price growth was limited by the number of homes for sale, which stands at its highest level in a decade.The property market has been more subdued this spring than usual, with lower demand from new buyers, after a busy first quarter of the year as buyers in England and Northern Ireland raced to beat thedeadline for changes to stamp duty.Temporary cuts to stamp duty in England and Northern Irelandcame to an end at the start of April, after the announcement by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in her October budget. Scotland and Wales set their own taxes on house purchases.The property market was busier than usual in March, the report found, while new buyer demand slowed in April to 4% more than the same month in 2024.Despite this, demand so far this year is still 3% ahead of last year, and there are signs of a bounceback in May.Rightmove suggested that some buyers might have been waiting for theBank of England’s most recent cut in interest rates. Policymakers at the central bank lowered rates by a quarter point to 4.25% earlier this month.Tom Bill, the head of UK residential research at the estate agents Knight Frank, said: “The interest rate environment should continue to improve and looser mortgage lending rules should underpin demand later this year. We expect 3.5% average UK price growth in 2025.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The lowest available two-year fixed mortgage rate is 3.72%, according to Rightmove’s weekly mortgage tracker, down from 4.75% last year.Colleen Babcock, a property expert at Rightmove, said: “The 10-year-high choice of homes for sale means that sellers need to be aware of the level of competition they’re facing for the attention of buyers, and the prices that are being advertised in their location.”Despite the lull in new buyer demand in April, the number of property sales agreed last month was 5% higher than at the same time last year.“In the current market, buyers may well have several similar homes to choose from in their area, and a home which appears overpriced compared to the competition may not get a second look,” Babcock added.Explore more on these topicsHousing marketHouse pricesRightmovePropertyReal estateStamp dutynewsShareReuse this content"

Biden and his family are considering options for treatment.“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,” his office said. “The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.”Prostate cancers are given a score called a Gleason score that measures, on a scale of one to 10, how the cancerous cells look compared with normal cells. Biden’s office said his score was nine, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive.When prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it often spreads to the bones. Metastasised cancer is much harder to treat than localised cancer because it can be hard for drugs to reach all the tumours and completely root out the disease.Biden was diagnosed with prostate cancer – here’s what to know about the diseaseRead moreHowever, when prostate cancers need hormones to grow, as in Biden’s case, they can be susceptible to treatment that deprives the tumors of hormones.Biden’s predecessor and successor, Donald Trump, expressed concern on behalf of him and first lady Melania Trump for his political rival. “Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis,” the presidentwrote on his Truth Social platform. “We extend our warmest and best wishes to [former first lady] Jill Biden and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.”The uncharacteristically gracious tone, and reference to Biden by his first name “Joe”, were reminiscent of the Democrat’s gesture of concern for “Donald” after last year’s attempted assassination of Trump.Kamala Harris, who served as Biden’s vice-president, wrote on X that she and husband Doug Emhoff were “saddened” to learn of the diagnosis. “Joe is a fighter – and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,” she added.Biden was the oldest president in history and his health was a dominant concern among voters. He had beaten an incumbentTrumpin the 2020 presidential election and initially sought a rematch with him last year. But, amid questions about his age and mental acuity, he dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris to succeed him.Trump, who is just three years younger than Biden, subsequently defeated Harris in November’s election and returned to the White House in January.Biden’s initial decision to seek re-election has come under renewed criticism ahead of Tuesday’spublication of Original Sin, a book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson that alleges a White House cover-up of the former president’s declining health and cognitive abilities.Based on interviews with more than 200 aides, insiders and members of Congress, the book contains accounts of losing his train of thought, struggling to remember names, incoherent speeches and failing to recognise celebrities such as George Clooney. Aides discussed the possibility of Bidenneeding a wheelchairif he won re-election due to the severity of his physical deterioration and the risk of falling.Just two days ago Trump mocked Biden for being “hapless and cognitively impaired” in the wake of leaked audio recordings from Biden’s 2023 interview with then special counsel Robert Hur, where he struggled to remember important events. But in recent media interviews Biden hascontinued to reject the ideathat he was too old to serve.Biden has dealt with cancer before. Prior to starting his presidency, he had several non-melanoma skin cancers surgically removed, and he had a cancerous lesion removed from his chest in February 2023.In the US, prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among men,according to the American Cancer Society.In 2022, Biden made a “cancer moonshot” one of his administration’s priorities, with the goal of halving the cancer death rate over the next 25 years. The initiative was a continuation of his work as vice-president to address a disease that had killed his older son, Beau.Biden has endured decades of adversity and tragedy in the public eye. Shortly after he was elected to the Senate in 1972, his wife, Neilia, and baby daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car crash. Before leaving office hepardonedHunter, whom Biden calls “my only living son”, on federal felony gun and tax convictions despite previously promising not to.As news of the cancer diagnosis spread, a chorus of politicians wished Biden a speedy recovery. Barack Obama, who developed a close relationship with Biden when the former was president and the latter vice-president, posted on social media: “Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family. Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace. We pray for a fast and full recovery.”Pete Buttigieg, who served as transportation secretary in his administration,wrote on X: “President Biden is a man of deep faith and extraordinary resilience. Chasten and I are keeping him, and the entire Biden family, in our prayers for strength and healing.”Gavin Newsom, the governor of California,posted: “Our hearts are with President Biden and his entire family right now. A man of dignity, strength, and compassion like his deserves to live a long and beautiful life.

Please join Britainy and me in praying for the families who are hurting right now,” the post read.The storms were part of a weather system on Friday that killed seven people inMissouriand two in northern Virginia and spawned more than two dozen tornadoes in Missouri, Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana, left several hundred thousand customers without power in the Great Lakes region and brought a punishing heatwave to Texas.Authorities inKentuckysaid there were also severe injuries when a twister late on Friday tore across Laurel county, where there were 18 deaths. One death in Pulaski county was that of a fire department major who was fatally injured amid the response to the destructive weather.“The search is continuing in the damaged area for survivors,” the office of sheriff John Root said in a statement posted on social media.April storms that killed 24 in US made more severe by burning fossil fuels – studyRead moreGilbert Acciardo, a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office, said rescuers had “been on the ground all night looking for possible survivors. That’s what we’re continuing to do.”Beshear said his office would release more information as soon as it became available.“We know this is a tragic event,” he said in a statement.In Laurel county, the tornado hit shortly before midnight.“Lives have been changed forever here tonight. This is a time we come together, and we pray for this community,” Randall Weddle, the mayor of London, told WKYT-TV. “I have never personally witnessed what I’ve witnessed here tonight. There’s a lot of devastation.”The mayor of St Louis, Missouri, Cara Spencer,confirmedfive deaths in her city and said more than 5,000 homes had been affected.The mayor of St Louis described the toll of storm damage in her city on Saturday.“This is truly, truly devastating,” she said, adding that the city was in the process of declaring an emergency and an overnight curfew on Friday had been put into place in the neighborhoods with the most damage.The number of people injured was not immediately known. The Barnes-Jewish hospital received 20 to 30 patients from the storm with some in serious condition and most expected to be discharged by Friday night, according to hospital spokesperson Laura High.The St Louis children’s hospital received 15 patients with two of them expected to remain in the hospital into the weekend, she said.National Weather Service (NWS) radar indicated a tornado touched down between 2.30pm and 2.50pm in Clayton,Missouri, in the St Louis area. The apparent tornado touched down in the area of Forest Park, home to the St Louis zoo and the site of the 1904 World’s Fair and Olympic Games the same year.At the Centennial Christian church, St Louis fire department battalion chief William Pollihan told the Associated Press that three people had had to be rescued after part of the church crumbled. One of those people died.Stacy Clark said his mother-in-law, Patricia Penelton, had died in the church. He described her as a very active church volunteer who had many roles, including being part of the choir.Jeffrey Simmons Sr, who lives across from the church, heard an alert on his phone before the lights went out.“And next thing you know, a lot of noise, heavy wind,” he said. He and his brother sheltered in the basement. Later, he realized it had been worse than he’d thought, saying: “Everything was tore up.”Downed trees and stoplights also caused traffic gridlock during the Friday afternoon commute, and officials urged people to stay home.John Randle, a 19-year-old University of Missouri-St Louis student, said he and his girlfriend had been at the St Louis art museum during the storm and were hustled into the basement with about 150 other people.“You could see the doors flying open, tree branches flying by and people running,” he said. “A lot of people were caught outside.”Christy Childs, a St Louis zoo spokesperson, said in a text that the zoo would remain closed on Saturday due to downed trees and other damage. Childs said all animals were safe and that there were no reports of significant injuries to staff, guests or animals.Trump cuts will lead to more deaths in disasters, expert warns: ‘It is really scary’Read moreA tornado struck in Scott county, about 130 miles (209km) south of St Louis, killing two people, injuring several others and destroying multiple homes, sheriff Derick Wheetley wrote on social media.The storms hit after theTrump administrationmassivelycut staffingof NWS offices, with outside experts worrying abouthow it would affect warnings in disasterssuch as tornadoes.The office in Jackson, Kentucky, which was responsible for the area around London, Kentucky, had a March 2025 vacancy rate of 25%; the Louisville, Kentucky, weather service staff was down 29%; and the St Louis office was down 16%, according to calculations by weather service employees obtained by the Associated Press. The Louisville office was also without a permanent boss, the meteorologist in charge, as of March, according to the staffing data.Experts said any vacancy rate above 20% is a critical problem.Beshear said he had “big concerns” with the NWS cuts, but he did not believe there were problems with alerts to residents in his state during the recent deadly storms.“I don’t see any evidence that it [affected] this one,” the Kentucky governor said.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherKentuckyMissouriTornadoesWisconsinTexasExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not because these are our most important allies or the most important countries in the world,” he said of Trump’s visit to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia andQatar.‘Very disturbing’: Trump receipt of overseas gifts unprecedented, experts warnRead more“It’s because these are the three countries willing to pay him off. Every single one of these countries is giving Trump money, the plane from Qatar, an investment in his cryptocurrency scam from the UAE, and they are asking for national security concessions in return.“This is the definition of corruption. Foreign governments putting money in the president’s pocket and then the US giving them national security concessions that hurt our own security.”Rand Paul, a Republican US senator for Kentucky, and chair of his chamber’s homeland security committee, told ABC’s This Week that the gift of the jet “at least gives the appearance of a conflict of interest”.And Mike Pence, Trump’s vice-president during his first Oval Office term, said it was “inconsistent with our security” during an appearance on Meet the Press in which he pointed out Qatar had been previously accused of financing international terrorism.Trump has insisted hewould be “stupid”to refuse Qatar’s offer of the jet, which would serve as the new Air Force One before being donated to his presidential library upon his retirement.But the proposalenraged even close allies of the president, some calling it the opposite of Trump’s promise to drain the swamp – and “a stain on the administration”.Trump lashed out at critics on his Truth Social network on Saturday, claiming the gift was to the US and not personally for him.Murphy told NBC that was not true. “The plane is not a gift to the American people,” he said. “It is going directly toDonald Trump.“That library will take a decade to build, and so once he leaves the White House, until the library is built, he gets to use that plane to fly around all of his billionaire friends while his policies result in millions of Americans losing their healthcare and having to pay higher costs.”Pence said Trump should turn down the offer.“Qatar has a long history of playing both sides. They support Hamas,” he said. “They supported Al-Qaida. Qatar has actually financed pro-Hamas protests on American campuses across the US, so the very idea that we would accept an Air Force One from Qatar I think is inconsistent with our security, with our intelligence needs.Trump 2.0 takes quid pro quo fears to new heights with $400m flying griftRead more“There are profound issues, the potential for intelligence gathering, the need to ensure the president is safe and secure as he travels around the world, and of course there are very real constitutional issues. The constitution prohibits public officials from accepting a present from a foreign state.“It’s just a bad idea and my hope is the president will think better of it.”Paul said he could see a way in which the gift would be acceptable – but that Trump had handled the offer poorly.“My fear is that it detracts from a largely successful trip where the president is talking about opening up and doing more trade with the Middle East,” he said.“I’ve been part of vetoing or trying to veto arms [sales] to Qatar, as well as to Saudi Arabia, over human rights abuses. So could it color the perception of the administration if they have a $400m plane to be more in favor of these things. It at least gives the appearance of a conflict of interest.

The New York Post, citing its own sources,reportedBartkus was a “pro-mortalist”.In aFacebook poston Sunday morning, the San Bernardino county sheriff’s department said there is law enforcement “occurring in Twentynine Palms”, which is “an FBI investigation related to the Palm Springs explosion”.One dead after ‘intentional’ explosion near fertility clinic in Palm SpringsRead more“At this time, there are no known threats to the San Bernardino county region,” the sheriff’s office said. But the agency added: “Out of an abundance of caution, sheriff’s deputies will be conducting extra patrols at fertility centers located in our jurisdiction.”An FBI statement described the attacks as an “intentional act of terrorism”, adding that the clinic was deliberately targeted. But it declined to elaborate on how authorities had reached a conclusion on a motive.The bomb, which detonated before 11am, was either in or near a car parked outside the clinic when it exploded, said the Palm Springs mayor, Ron deHarte.Bartkus tried to record video or stream the blast, according to an officialspeakinganonymously to the Associated Press.Aerial images of the damage to the facilityshowedthe burned-out remains of a vehicle in a parking lot behind the clinic.Despite damage to the building, the ARC said its facility would be fully operational on Monday.The Desert Sun reported that the explosion could be felt as far as 2 miles (3km) away.Dr Maher Abdallah, who runs the ARC facility where the explosion happened, told the Associated Press in a phone interview that all of his staff were safe and accounted for.The explosion damaged the practice’s office space, where it conducts consultations with patients. But the blast did not harm the in vitro fertilization (IVF) lab and all of the stored embryos.In a statement on Facebook, the ARCsaid: “We are heartbroken to learn that this event claimed a life and caused injuries, and our deepest condolences go out to the individuals and families affected.”The ARC also said it appreciated “the incredible support from our patients and local community, as well as the swift action of Palm Springs police, fire, and emergency responders”.California’s governor, Gavin Newsom,wroteon X that he and his wife, Jen, “are keeping everyone affected in our hearts”.“The state is working closely with local and federal authorities as the investigation unfolds,” Newsom added. “Please avoid the area.”Meanwhile, US attorney general Pam Bondisaid“violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable”.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS crimeCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

It cut its US credit rating by one notch to AA1, becoming the last of the big three agencies to downgrade the country from a triple-A rating.The move comes as concerns about the US’s fiscal trajectory have risen. The US national debt now stands at $36tn (£27tn), and economists fear that Donald Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” – which was blocked by rightwing lawmakers last Friday – could push the deficit higher by cutting taxes.Explaining its decision, Moody’s said it expected the US budget deficit to keep rising, and criticised US politicians for not taking action to improve the country’s fiscal position.“Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. We do not believe that material multiyear reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration,” Moody’s said.“Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat. In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government’s debt and interest burden higher. The US’s fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared with other highly rated sovereigns.”The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, tried to brush the downgrade aside on Sunday, telling NBC’s Meet the Press show: “Moody’s is a lagging indicator.”Investors are hopeful that the move will not have a lasting market impact, although it will focus attention on US debt levels.Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, posted on X: “While this is historic and will attract media attention, its market impact is likely to be contained.”US government debt has weakened over the last few years; prices have fallen, pushing up the yield, or interest rate, on 10-year Treasury bonds to almost 4.5%. Yields rise when prices fall.There may now be more selling pressures, as “the downgrade may indicate that investors will demand higher yields on treasuries”, Tracy Chen, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, told Bloomberg.However, Toby Nangle, the former head of asset allocation at Columbia Threadneedle, said regulators did not tend to differentiate between triple-A and AA1 when setting capital risk weights. That means banks’ risk-weighted capital asset calculations look unlikely to be affected by the rating change.“So, does the downgrade matter to financial plumbers this time? From a mechanical perspective, the answer is almost certainly ‘not at all’,”Nangle wrote in the Financial Times.Stock markets fell heavily in 2011 after S&P became the first big credit agency to strip the US of its credit rating, with the S&P 500 indexdropping more than 6% the next trading day.Marketsalso fell in 2023whenFitch lowered its rating on the USby one notch, from triple-A to AA+.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If there’s one asset on this planet with the least chance of default, it’s a US Treasury bond,” said Stephen Innes, the managing partner at SPI Asset Management.“The US government issues debt in a currency it prints and controls, and it owns the global reserve currency.

Negotiations will go until the final hours. But this time, there is belief on both sides that things can be different.For the UK, Monday’s UK-EU summit is the most crucial piece of the three-part jigsaw to unlock growth, after the recent deals with India and the US.Taken together, there are high hopes it will be a critical signal that the UK has fundamentally changed, drawing a line under theBrexityears and Conservative leadership putsches – and can show the world a stark contrast to Donald Trump.In a timely demonstration of that shift, when the shadow Cabinet Office minister Alex Burghart promised that the Tories would reverse any changes to the Brexit deal once back in power, he was greeted by open laughter from the government benches.Central to this has been the relatively low-key nature of the negotiations, away from hysterical rightwing front pages. “We will do this in a serious, pragmatic way, and we won’t rush to the nearest microphone every time there’s a twist or turn in the negotiation,” Starmer told the Guardian last week.The prime minister is said to have privately promised the European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, that he would keep negotiations “in the room”, because the EU side had lost trust in the UK’s approach after the game-playing of the Boris Johnson era.Starmer will host von der Leyen, the European Council president, Antonio Costa, and Kaja Kallas, the EU’s top diplomat, at Lancaster House on Monday but negotiations are expected to continue throughout the weekend.There are three agreements expected to be produced, on defence, on trade, and statement of geopolitical solidarity.But the texts are not yet agreed. In a highly unusual move, the EU ambassadors are meeting in Brussels on Sunday to agree to any further compromises on either side negotiated over the weekend, taking the deal down to the wire.One senior Downing Street figure said the deal was “99% of the way there”, but added: “The last 1% is the most important.”The UK defence secretary, John Healey, speaking during a trip to meet his European counterparts in Berlin and Rome, said: “There has been a period of hard negotiations. We’re at the last hard yards of the last hard days.”View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer has reportedly promised Ursula von der Leyen to keep negotiations under wraps.Photograph: Victoria Jones/Rex/ShutterstockSome in Brussels have briefed that the two sides are still much further apart than that, especially on security and fishing rights.But no one expects a disaster that could kill off the reset, because the symbolism alone for both sides is too great. “It would be a failure of diplomacy and that won’t and can’t happen,” said one diplomat.The summit will involve Rachel Reeves hosting smaller firms and major UK businesses for breakfast and then a reception in No 10, many of which have been hit by trade barriers.Starmer will frame his EU reset as a break with the past, a moment to show how irrelevant the rows of the Brexit years now are and how a more stable, reliable UK can reap the rewards.But with an insurgent Nigel Farage – the most dogged foe of the Brexit era – leading the polls, there is always the potential for a deal to be politically toxic.“It is fraught with risk but I think we have a landing zone,” a No 10 source said of the comms battle to come. Another strategist said: “This is about seizing back control – on trade, on borders, on security – that is what people say time and time again that they want.”Monday’s summit is expected to produce three texts – the first, a defence and security partnership. This will not yet allow British companies to bid into the €150bn defence fund, but could pave the way for it to do so in future.The second will be an agreement on lifting some trade barriers, an area where fraught negotiations are continuing. The most consequential will be negotiations to reach that new agreement on agrifoods, made easier by signs the UK is willing to accept dynamic alignment with EU standards and a role for the European court of justice.The final statement will be a political declaration of European solidarity. That will more than hint at a coming together in the face of international turmoil, the code often used for the actions of Donald Trump. On Thursday, the European trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, repeatedly referred to the “paradigm shift” in global trade after meeting trade ministers.There will be other topics for the negotiations, too. The most difficult is the youth mobility scheme – which will be called something different and opaque – and cooperation on energy policy and carbon border taxes.The youth visa, which the UK wants to be capped and time-limited, is the area most fraught with political danger for Starmer, given the threat of Farage’s Reform UK. The UK hopes it will get extremely limited reference at the summit on Monday, with one No 10 source saying it would be in the “‘to explore at a future point’ bucket”.View image in fullscreenFishing rights are still a contested area of the negotiations.Photograph: eye35.pix/AlamyThe main issue holding up the final agreement is fishing rights, where arrangements are due to expire in June next year. The UK wants to extend them for another four years, while Brussels is pushing for a longer settlement.France has been the main block, suggesting any food standards deal be similarly time-limited if the UK insists on such a short settlement. It has also been the card Paris has played to hold up any potential deal on security partnerships, senior British officials say.It has echoes of the last days of Johnson’s Brexit negotiator, David Frost, whose trade and cooperation deal was negotiated and sealed on Christmas Eve 2020, when fishers felt they were collateral damage.A deal on fish is ready to be swapped in exchange for the EU dropping its demands that any students arriving in the UK under a youth mobility scheme would be able to access studies on home fees, a red line for the UK.That potential uncertainty of a time-limited deal on food standards, plus a bar to any deep security cooperation, would be a major loss for the UK, but any sign Starmer has compromised on fishing rights would be a political nightmare in an industry that was a central part of the fights of the Brexit years.Starmer has taken a close interest in the law enforcement and data-sharing possibilities, linked to action on people-smuggling, and it would be a personal blow if that was not possible.“I do want to work more closely together,” he told the Guardian last week. “I do want to ensure we get the best possible arrangements for data sharing. I’d like us to work more with Europol and put ourselves in a position where the UK can lead investigations in Europol, we’re very good at it. I know from my own experience that that’s the most effective way to get results.”There has been a diplomatic offensive among EU member states in the days leading up to the summit. “The UK government is reaching out to various EU governments bilaterally to lobby and make sure things move smoothly,” an EU source said.View image in fullscreenAnti-Brexit demonstrators protesting outside parliament in March.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersStarmer’s framing of the reset aligns closely with the public view on Brexit. “There are the headline numbers, which suggest the public view has substantially moved on Brexit. That’s true, they have,” one Downing Street strategist said. “But many of those voters who backed Brexit do not believe that they personally were wrong to do so. They believed politicians handled it badly.”Public polling backs up this view; according to More in Common, 40% of people believe that Brexit could have worked well but the government handled it badly, compared with 36% who believe it could never have worked.That rises to 68% of Reform voters – just 14% of them think Brexit has worked out well. Even among Labour voters, 37% believe that it was possible for it to have been a success. Just 9% of leave voters have now changed their opinion to believe Brexit could never have worked.Most Labour MPs are millennial remainers who are keen for the economic benefits of an EU reset. Many want the government to go even further: “I would love us to be aiming for something that looks and quacks like a customs union,” one MP said.But an influential contingent of Labour MPs in Brexit-supporting seats are worried. “I think it might be possible to get support if defence is at the forefront. But my voters, who probably voted previously for Boris, are still pretty ideological about Brexit,” one MP in a Midlands seat said.A Labour MP in a leave-voting southern marginal constituency said Starmer would need to show the same “quiet authority” on Europe that impressed in Washington. “People here know Brexit ‘hasn’t been delivered’ but they’re wary of us going backwards,” the MP said.“It’s not about reversing the vote, it’s about leading with a plan that makes us richer, more and more secure. That’s what they want to see.”They added that while there was still scepticism around any kind of EU ‘reset’, voters were increasingly open to a pragmatic solution, especially one framed as strengthening the UK’s hand, not diluting it.“They’re not crying out for Brussels, but they are crying out for competence after some of the domestic decisions we’ve made,” another MP in a Brexit-backing constituency said. “People want sovereignty. But they also want to be better off. We’ve had neither.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionBrexitEuropeForeign policyTrade policyInternational tradeFishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Thunder lost to Dallas in the conference semifinals last year as the No 1 seed in the West.This time, the Thunder had to get past three-time MVP Nikola Jokić and a Denver team that won theNBAtitle in 2023 and beat the Los Angeles Clippers in seven games in the first round this year.Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said his players handled the pressure well.“There’s not many games, you wake up in the morning and you know that you’re going to remember the game for the rest of your life, and Game 7 is one of them,” he said. “To be able to focus through that and perform the way these guys did today was very impressive.”Jokić had 20 points, nine rebounds and seven assists for the Nuggets on Sunday. Aaron Gordon, a key player for Denver throughout the playoffs who hit the winner in Game 1 against the Thunder, started despite a strained left hamstring. He had eight points and 11 rebounds in 25 minutes.“What [Gordon] played with today, I don’t know many people that would even attempt to go out there and run up and down,” Nuggets interim coach David Adelman said. “And he did it in Game 7 against Oklahoma City on the road. That that was one of most incredible things I’ve ever seen. He was extremely close to not playing. I was surprised.”The Thunder fell behind by 11 in the first quarter, but took the lead early in the second. Oklahoma City outscored Denver 39-20 in the second period to take a 60-46 lead at the break.Gordon was called for a flagrant-1 foul for elbowing Gilgeous-Alexander in the face early in the third quarter. Gilgeous-Alexander made both free throws, and then Williams hit a short jumper to give Oklahoma City a 66-46 lead.Cason Wallace got loose on a fast break and dunked on Jokic to put the Thunder up 78-57, sparking delirious roars from the crowd. Oklahoma City led 97-72 at the end of the third quarter and never looked back.“We’re better now than we were at the beginning of the series, and it’s because of them,” Daigneault said. “They pushed us to the limit.”Explore more on these topicsNBAOklahoma City ThunderDenver NuggetsBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Major number three forScottie Scheffler, the first outside Augusta National and the latest stride towards golfing immortality. A year on from being bundled into a police cell during his last attempt to lift the Wanamaker Trophy, Scheffler took no prisoners. Dancing to the jailhouse rock. Jon Rahm swung and missed at the new US PGA champion before capitulating under sheer frustration. Nobody else seriously featured.Scheffler earned himself $3.4m (£2.5m) plus further daylight between himself and the rest at the summit of the world rankings. The most remarkable thing about Scheffler is how unremarkable he makes all this seem. This is a golfer who has walked up to the 72nd green of a major holding six-, five- and four-shot leads. He has no experience of anxiety in such scenarios because of his own ability to steady the ship as others waver.US PGA Championship 2025: Scheffler storms to third major title after Rahm falters – live reactionRead moreA 71 enable him to breeze home by five at 12 under par. Second belonged to Harris English, Bryson ­DeChambeau and Davis Riley.The biggest criticism of hosting the year’s second major at Quail Hollow has been that aPGA Tourevent is played here every year. Many felt this tournament did not feel suitably distinct. Scheffler certainly did not; this is his 15th victory since early 2022. The gap between wins from last September to the start of this month, when Scheffler prevailed at the Byron Nelson, felt like a drought.ThisUS PGASunday was not without flickers of drama. Scheffler began round four with a three-shot lead. The advantage was stretched to five within the same number of holes. This felt like a procession.Rahm then made things interesting. Birdies at the 8th and 10th placed him within two of Scheffler. Rahm had dual motivation; to prove his switch to LIV had not blunted his major capabilities and to win a first US PGA for Spain. As Scheffler made a bogey at the 9th and Rahm a birdie at the 11th, we had a tie. Rahm had taken just 13 putts in 11 holes. ­Scheffler found only four greens in regulation during his outward half.View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler hits out of the rough on the 1st hole during the final round.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAScheffler now needed to steady himself. Should there have been any doubt he would do precisely that? Birdies at the 10th and 14th – Rahm failed to take advantage of the gettable latter – placed this tournament back into Scheffler’s grip. The Green Mile bit Rahm. He dropped a shot at the 16th to leave Scheffler again leading by three. Rahm then found water at the short 17th. Race, run. Scheffler had five shots to spare when finding a fairway bunker from the 16th tee. Rahm cracked his drive into water at the last, smoke flowing out of his ears. As Rahm signed for a 73 and share of eighth, it was so hard to remember what had happened just hours before. Rahm finished seven shots behind Scheffler.DeChambeau’s erratic day at the office involved 70 shots. Too much of the US Open champion’s fine work was undermined by sloppy wedge play during this major. “I’m pretty disappointed,” said DeChambeau. “But Scottie is an incredible golfer and I’ve got to look forward to trying to get to his level.” English played the back nine in a wonderful 31, his 65 blasting him up the leaderboard.

The Masters champion’s aggregate was three over par. There will be an element of reset required after the emotion and heroics of Augusta National. A 69 from ­Sergio García was not sufficient to allow the Spaniard to talk up his hopes of a Ryder Cup reappearance, at Bethpage in September. “The way I’m playing, even if Luke [Donald] offered me a pick right now, I would tell him no,” Garcia said. “So obviously I need to get better. I need to get more where I was just before the Masters, just to show myself and show everyone that my game is solid and it can help the team. It’s as simple as that. The good thing is that there’s still months until the team is finalised. I have time to gain some confidence and improve a little bit on my game.”García watched on as his compatriot Rahm sought to make history for their country. He could not. Still, the mere fact Rahm made this interesting for a while is to his huge credit.

The pair’s rivalry started in college and has continued into the WNBA. Clark is white and Reese is Black, and there has beenracist and misogynistic abuse onlinearound their relationship.Caitlin Clark’s toxic cultists are ruining things for the WNBA’s longtime fansRead moreSources have told the Indianapolis Starthe investigation is based around racist comments directed towards Reese from a member or members of the crowd, although they are not believed to have been directly related to the incident with Clark. On Sunday, the WNBA said it is looking into the matter without going into specifics.“TheWNBAstrongly condemns racism, hate, and discrimination in all forms – they have no place in our league or in society. We are aware of the allegations and are looking into the matter,” the league said in its statement.The Indian Fever likewise issued a statement saying they are aware of the allegations and adding that the team are working “closely” with the WNBA in its investigation. “We stand firm in our commitment to providing a safe environment for all WNBA players,” the team said.The WNBA Players’ Association released its own statement on the subject. “Such behavior is unacceptable in our sport. Under the WNBA’s ‘No Space for Hate’ policy, we trust the league to thoroughly investigate and take swift, appropriate action to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all,” the association wrote.Both Clark and Reesedownplayed the foul after Saturday’s game.“Let’s not make it something that it’s not,” Clark said. “It was just a good play on the basketball … I’ve watched a lot of basketball in my life, that’s exactly what it was. I wasn’t trying to do anything malicious. That’s not the type of player I am.”Reese indicated she did not believe Clark was being cynical when she committed the foul, saying it was “a basketball play.”Last season, a number of players who committed fouls on Clark were subjected to a significant amount of racist, sexist and homophobic comments online from people purporting to defend the guard.“People should not be using my name to push those agendas. It’s disappointing. It’s not acceptable,”Clark said last June. “... Treating every single woman in this league with the same amount of respect, I think, it’s just a basic human thing that everybody should do.”Explore more on these topicsCaitlin ClarkIndiana FeverWNBABasketballUS sportsChicago SkynewsShareReuse this content"

Sealing second place in thePremier Leaguefor a third successive season is not exactly the scenario the Arsenal manager would have envisaged for his side’s last home match when they kicked off against Wolves in August.Celebrations were noticeably muted as Arsenal’s players paid their respects to the home supporters on the customary lap of honour.Everton fans celebrate in style to mark end of an era at Goodison Park | Andy HunterRead more“It was emotional because of the way I feel,” Arteta said. “We had a dream to win trophies and we haven’t achieved that. But we have to make sure we are still valid – just expecting something, that’s a really dangerous thing.“I know [the fans] don’t want us to be knocking on the door every year, but we have to stay very clear and ambitious about what we want to do in the summer.”At least Arteta had the immediate satisfaction of finally getting one over Eddie Howe at the fourth attempt this season thanks to another blockbuster from Declan Rice. It leaves Newcastle needing to beat Everton at home on the final day to ensure they join Arsenal in the Champions League.After ending their long wait for silverwareby winning the Carabao Cup, their manager will be desperate for Alexander Isak to recover from a nagging groin problem that forced him to miss their trip here. Newcastle have not won any of the four Premier League games he has missed this season.Other than a goalmouth scramble in stoppage time, Arsenal were able to see out victory relatively comfortably despite losing William Saliba to a suspected hamstring injury at half-time.View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice (left) and Bukayo Saka (centre) are all smiles after the match during a lap of appreciation.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersHowe vented his frustration beforehand that some of his players have been linked with moves away in the summer even after their undoubted progress as a club this season. But the absence of Isak – who has long been coveted by Arsenal and proved their chief tormentor inthe 4-0 aggregate victoryin the Carabao Cup semi-final – meant Newcastle were toothless in attack apart from a 17‑minute spell at the start when they managed five shots on target but could not score.“He went for a scan as a precaution but then it became obvious he wasn’t going to be able to play,” Howe said of the Sweden striker. “A lot will depend on how he reacts in the next few days. It’s in our hands and we have to look at that as a positive.”Arsenal’s comeback against the champions, Liverpool, at Anfield last Sunday was evidence his players still know they had plenty to play for. When Ben White burrowed into the area before he was stopped in his tracks by the lunging Dan Burn, they certainly seemed up for dishing out a dose of revenge against opponents whom they had failed to score against in four of their past five meetings.But David Raya was the busier of the two goalkeepers during the first half. The Spaniard pulled off a strong save from Bruno Guimarães to redeem himself after losing possession to Sandro Tonali and was then required to make a quick readjustment after a Harvey Barnes effort deflected off the heel of Thomas Partey. Raya was back in the thick of it again when he produced a brilliant double save to deny Burn and then Sven Botman from a corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The hosts seemed to have found more of their rhythm and the breakthrough came when Anthony Gordon was robbed by Bukayo Saka in his own half and Ødegaard’s perfectly weighted pass picked out Rice to sweep home from outside the area. It was only his fourth Premier League goal of the season but,after his Champions League heroics against Real Madrid, underlined why the England midfielder has been Arsenal’s outstanding player.Howe made a triple change and withdrew the ineffective Callum Wilson just after the hour mark. But it was Arsenal who almost doubled their lead when White arrowed a shot just wide.Kai Havertz’s introduction drew a massive ovation from the home supporters, although hearts were in mouths when another substitute – the Arsenal old boy Joe Willock – fired over from a great position inside the area at the other end.Kieran Tierney and Jorginho were given one last chance to experience the Emirates Stadium atmosphere off the bench as they prepare to depart. With the co-chair Josh Kroenke having stated in his programme notes: “We plan to invest to get behind winning and doing better next season,” the hard work starts now for Arteta.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Briton was finally able to revel in a shared joy with his team that has been truly short on the ground this season.He returned fourth place, his best grand prix finish this season, from 12th on the grid after a race where ­Ferrari made the absolute most of their strategy and the seven-time champion ducked and dived, making pass after pass with an enthusiastic verve that hints at just what he might do if the team could deliver a better ride.A buoyant Hamilton was understandably in fine spirits afterwards, taking genuine pleasure in a hard fought result in his first race for ­Ferrari in front of thetifosi.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen shows his delight on the podium.Photograph: David Davies/PAFor Verstappen, in beatingLando Norrisand Oscar Piastri into second place and third place at a circuit where the McLaren had looked so quick, was no little coup and with fine timing too on the occasion of Red Bull’s 400th grand prix. By taking his fourth win in a row at Imola, Verstappen has ensured he is still front and centre in the championship, with Piastri now leading by 13 points from Britain’s Norris and Verstappen in third, 22 points back from the Australian.Putting it in context gives it even more weight, as Verstappen’s season thus far has been perhaps most challenging in just maintaining an equilibrium. From the lows of ­Bahrain, which followed a win in Japan, there was a surge again in Saudi Arabia, but having then finished fourth, 40 seconds behind the two ­McLarens in Miami, the rollercoaster for ­Verstappen and Red Bull in Imola hurtled upwards once more.It was a win that, for all that the race did ebb and flow as two safety car periods and strategy calls played their part, had surely been decided within scant seconds of the lights going out. But what a way to decide it, a moment to savour and indeed one Verstappen might enjoy looking back on.Piastri had just held his lead from pole entering turn one but ­Verstappen was having none of it. He made an absolute bravura move round the outside to scythe in front as they hurtled through Tamburello. It was all or nothing for the ­Dutchman, who judged it to perfection. He tiptoed on to the anchors as late as he possibly could, for a moment of ­collective breath-holding that lasted but the blink of an eye. Then it was done.­Riding his speed, doubtless to the shock of Piastri, who would have imagined the corner was already his, Verstappen had the lead and with it the race by the scruff of the neck.View image in fullscreenRed Bull’s Max Verstappen gets past McLaren’s Oscar Piastri at the start of the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.Photograph: David Davies/PAAfterwards he reflected, sagely, that it was the bigger picture that really mattered. Notably that on race pace the Red Bull had more than the measure of the McLaren and that is what will really appeal. “I was still on the normal line and I thought I would try and send it round the outside and it worked really well,” he said. “It’s been a very important week for us and the car has performed really well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They played the strategy right taking advantage of the safety cars in a car that has been a handful all season. Yet even as the ­mercurial ride skews from week to week in performance, Verstappen is there, a rock, to coerce out what he can when it is wilful and wayward and to absolutely soar when it is hitting the marks, as it was in Imola.McLaren tried to take the fight to them, splitting their strategy between Norris and Piastri, but – as the team principal, Andrea Stella, conceded afterwards – once Verstappen had the lead they could not match him.Piastri was unlucky with the ­timing of the first safety car just as Hamilton and Verstappen took advantage from it but these were variables the world champion had covered as he proved definitively in haring off to the flag after the second safety car closed the pack up again.Both he and Hamilton have not looked quite so energised for some time and both leave Imola with reason to be hopeful for more. Game on it is, then, for Monaco next week.Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz were fifth and eighth for Williams, Charles Leclerc came from 11th to sixth, George Russell was seventh for Mercedes, Isack Hadjar ninth for Racing Bulls and Yuki Tsunoda 10th for Red Bull.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMcLarenLando NorrisMax VerstappenRed BullFerrariLewis HamiltonnewsShareReuse this content"

Then the PA system cut out and Z‑Cars spluttered to a halt. Not now, please not now. A sign from the stadium gods? A little reminder that this iconic feature of English football is 133 years old and all the affection in the world can not hide the wrinkles? Perhaps, but it can still say goodbye in style.On a beautiful day in L4 4EL, under pale blue skies darkened by plumes of royal blue smoke from the flares outside, Everton delivered as its history demanded anddeparted with a win. Iliman Ndiaye danced through the Southampton defence twice and etched his name into Goodison folklore as the final goalscorer in the stadium’s Premier League history.‘Goodison Park has been part of saving my life’: Everton fans mourn club’s Mersey moveRead moreNottingham Forest’s Horace Pike had the honour of scoring the first league goal here, in 1892. Legends, glory, torment, passion, misery, the School of Science, Dogs of War and so much more have filled the years in between. The history is inescapable and Everton – club, team and fans alike – staged the perfect sendoff on a poignant and emotional afternoon.Ndiaye took the match ball home after delivering victory for David Moyes’s team. He didn’t get a hat‑trick but no one cared. It was some achievement by the Everton team to get inside the stadium and perform at all. The call to greet the team coach as it made its way along Walton Lane and Goodison Road was answered by tens of thousands of Evertonians. The area around Spellow Lane and Goodison Road, where the statue of Dixie Dean stands, was impassable by 9.30am.On the quieter Bullens Road and Gwladys Street, families stood outside their usual turnstiles to have their photographs taken. Outside 29 Gwladys Street, bedecked in Everton paraphernalia, the elderly owner sat in a deckchair and held court with passersby.A few doors along a brave neighbour had decorated their house in Liverpool flags. They were not sat outside to welcome visitors. Once around the corner at St Luke’s Church, Goodison Road was gridlocked with fans waiting to welcome Moyes’s men. It was so packed that the coach couldn’t get through and had to make a detour to drop the players off in the Bullens Road car park. Hundreds of fans without tickets remained outside for the duration of Everton’s 2-0 win.View image in fullscreenFormer players led by Duncan Ferguson during the post-match ceremony.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianScarfs had been draped over every seat and supporters made their way inside the ground as soon as the gates opened. Just like old times. Moyes broke away from his team’s pre-match warm-up to hug Wayne Rooney as the boyhood Evertonian made his way around the pitch with his son. The Gwladys Street ran through its old songbook as Ndiaye ran amok through theSouthamptondefence. Alan Ball, Super Kevin Campbell, Duncan Ferguson and Tim Cahill all got a mention.From the current squad, Séamus Coleman and Jordan Pickford were serenaded frequently. Moyes had given Coleman the fitting honour of captaining Everton’s men in their final appearance at Goodison. A lovely touch, although it backfired to a degree when the 36-year-old pulled up injured and had to be replaced in the 18th minute by the soon-to-be-released Ashley Young.After the final, final whistle there was a 15-minute delay while club staff put seats and stages in place for “Operation Farewell Goodison”. It was a moment to reflect on what it has taken for Everton to get to a point where leaving its cherished home for a new stadium at Bramley-Moore dock is met with excitement more than regret.Everton’s house move has been more complicated and stressful than most. There was the proposed relocation to a 60,000, £100m super-stadium at an unidentified location under Peter Johnson in the late 1990s. That one never got off the ground.View image in fullscreenFans sing aloud after the match at Goodison Park.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianGoodison’s final game would have been staged 22 years ago had Everton made the transformative move to a prime waterfront site at King’s Dock. Bill Kenwright’s refusal to cede boardroom power to his then fellow director Paul Gregg put pay to that scheme. Then came the awful plan to move to Kirkby as part of a giant Tesco retail development.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That cheap and unambitious project was rejected by the government after a public inquiry prompted by the Keep Everton In Our City (KEIOC)campaign. The debt that present and future Evertonians, plus present and future owners, owe the KEIOC founders Dave Kelly, Colin Fitzpatrick, the late Tony Kelly and the late Anthony AJ Clarke among others is immeasurable.But that is the past. Everton’s farewell to Goodison could have morphed into a sombre memorial but was pitched perfectly. Goodison would get one last rendition of Z-Cars after all. In the penalty area where Dean scored his record‑breaking and still unmatched 60th league goal in 1928, a lone violinist played a heart‑wrenching version of the club’s adopted anthem.A series of goodbye tributes then appeared on the giant TV screens from Carlo Ancelotti, Sir Alex Ferguson, Thomas Tuchel, Mikel Arteta, Tim Howard and Roberto Martínez. There were also messages from Dame Judi Dench, an Everton fan and honorary patron of the club’s charity, Jodie Comer, whose dad, Jimmy, was the club’s masseur for decades, and Sylvester Stallone.Everton fans on the end of a Goodison era: ‘I’ll be thinking about my dad, my brothers, my son’Read moreCentre stage was eventually and rightly given to former players, many of whom are responsible for Goodison’s greatest moments. Joe Royle, Bob Latchford and Johnny Morrissey led the first wave. The great 1980s team followed.The legendary goalkeeper Neville Southall looked resplendent in a floral shirt. Graeme Sharp, who stayed away for two years due to protests against the club’s former board, was welcomed home with a fine reception. Peter Reid took to the mic and apologised for his dreadful sunglasses. “I was on the lash last night,” he said. Next to him stood Andy Gray, who remarked: “We are all leaving Goodison but Goodison will never leave us.”Bill Ryder-Jones, co-founder of the Coral, closed proceedings with a moving version of In My Life. “There are places I remember, All my life ...” Evertonians could not have loved Goodison more.Explore more on these topicsEvertonSouthamptonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lineker said in a statement that he would “never knowingly share anything antisemitic” and had deleted the post “as soon as I became aware of the issue”.TheBBCdirector general, Tim Davie, had been facing calls all week to sack Lineker, who was paid £1.4m by the BBC last year.“The BBC’s reputation is held by everyone and when someone makes a mistake, it costs us,” Davie said when asked about the incident after giving a speech in Salford. “I think we absolutely need people to be exemplars of the BBC’s values and follow our social media policy. Simple as that.”More than 10,000 people signed apetition, sponsored by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, which urged the BBC to “immediately remove Gary Lineker from his position”.Lineker was already due to leave his role on Match of the Day at the end of the season, but was expected to host the corporation’s coverage of the FA Cup in 2025-26 and the World Cup next summer.He will be replaced on Match of the Day by Gabby Logan, Kelly Cates and Mark Chapman, who will share the presenting role from the next Premier League season.A source toldthe Sun: “Gary acknowledged his position at the BBC, anchoring the most prestigious tournament in world football, was untenable, and he will not be hosting the World Cup.“He offered to step down at the end of the season, and did not want the BBC – an organisation he still holds in the highest of esteem – dragged into any further controversy.“He remains absolutely devastated by the recent turn of events and is deeply regretful about how his post was interpreted. His last Match of the Day will air on Sunday now and he won’t be back.”In March 2023, Lineker was temporarily suspended from the BBC over comments he made criticising the Conservative government’s asylum policy.In February this year, he was also among 500 high-profile cultural figures who called on the BBC to rebroadcast a documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, calling it an “essential piece of journalism”. The broadcaster removed the documentary from BBC iPlayer after it emerged that the film’s 14-year-old narrator was the son of a deputy agriculture minister in the territory’s Hamas-run government.The BBC declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsGary LinekerMatch of the DayBBCAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

Apart from the transfer window, we can also improve certain aspects ourselves.”As with most teams challenging at the top, Liverpool have been the victim of the opposition using underhand methods in matches in an attempt to disrupt the rhythm, which has clearly irritated Slot. “One of the things you cannot do anything about is that tactics are being used that have nothing to do with football,” he said. “Delaying the start of the game, pretending you are injured, taking one minute for a free-kick, one minute for a throw-in. That is my main worry. When we have dropped points, that tactic was used. I like to say it now after us winning the league, not [after] losing a game.“I don’t wake up during the night but if I did I might be like: ‘Shit. There’s no answer to be found to that type of play.’ Every time we drop points, that happened … goalkeepers taking one and a half minutes. I am hoping for the league …Rúben Dias said something about it[about Southampton’s negative tactics], too, which is not always the best moment to say it after dropping points.

James Justin won the ball in his own half, accelerated through the soft centre of Ipswich’s midfield and waited for Leicester’s No 9 to make his run.Jamie Vardy, on his 500th appearance for the club, timed it to perfection, from centre to right, into the penalty area, took one touch to steady himself and then, with a quick second touch that took the ball through Dara O’Shea’s legs and into the far corner before Alex Palmer could react, scored his 200th goal for the club.Typical Vardy, lifting his finger to his lips, the most vaunted former non-league striker inPremier Leaguehistory peeled off to the nearest corner flag, lifted it out the ground and celebrated in front of the Ipswich fans who had just been mocking him and his wife.‘He brought a non-league personality to the top’: Jamie Vardy prepares for farewell partyRead moreThe scoreboard had his image and the number 200 all ready and waiting to flash up. If only Leicester had been able to choreograph their season the way they have this landmark. There were flags (“Thank you Vards”) for every supporter waiting in their seats. There was a super-sized commemorative programme (“Goodbye to the GOAT”). Nigel Pearson, who signed him 13 years ago to the day, was among his former managers in attendance, as were many of his teammates fromthe 2016 title-winning team, including Wes Morgan, Marc Albrighton, Kasper Schmeichel and Danny Simpson.Vardy warmed up with his three children, who were among the mascots. Then there were the trademark runs and chances that indicated this would be his day, and a good one to hide Leicester’s other, deeper concerns.It was an emotional occasion even if the match, other than Vardy’s landmark goal, felt almost irrelevant with both clubs, starting on 22 points, long since relegated. As well as where the striker’s future lies, beyond a beach with his family next week afterhe asked to make this game his lastso he could wave farewell to the club’s supporters at home, there are so many questions to be answered.After a “shitshow” of a season (to quote Vardy) when Leicester suffered nine successive home defeats without scoring, Ruud Van Nistelrooy, who has gained eight points from six games since relegation was accepted, has no idea if he will still be manager next season, so cannot start planning.View image in fullscreenJamie Vardy (centre) is given a guard of honour by his Leicester teammates as he is substituted.Photograph: Nigel French/PAEven though Leif Davis shot against the inside of a post in the sixth minute, Ipswich reminding us there was another team involved in this occasion, Vardy set about making this a day of celebration. Making one of his trademark diagonal runs, he was sent in by Jordan Ayew and zoomed past O’Shea to face goal. But recovering defenders forced him wide and he shot into the side-netting via an unrewarded deflection. Two minutes later, he received a free-kick from Bilal El Khannouss, back to goal, and managed to swivel before shooting into the side-netting.“Stand up if you love Vardy” rang around the King Power Stadium. The vast majority of those present did. Those with professional duties felt like doing so. But before his breakthrough goal came the chants of “Sack the board” and “We want Rudkin out” – Jon Rudkin, the director of football – from the Leicester fans not willing to accept Vardy’s fairytale was the only story in town.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He took his seat in the dugout and stretched his arms up and behind him, closing his eyes, drinking in the moment.Chants of “Jamie Vardy’s having a party” alternated with appeals to “Sack the board” throughout an afternoon that culminated in Rob Dorsett, the Sky Sports reporter, preparing to interview the man himself alongside Top Srivaddhanaprabha, the Leicester chair. Talk about attempting to bury bad news.But it would be churlish to deny Vardy his right to a proper sendoff.

They finish the season at Fulham next Sunday.“We don’t have much time to recover for an important game against Bournemouth [but] we have to recover quick, we’re a big club,” Guardiola said. “We have two massive important games for the future of this club. The Champions League is massive. It’s obvious. Ask Arsenal, Chelsea, Nottingham Forest, Newcastle or Aston Villa.“But now is not the time to talk to the players and get into their minds. Sunday is recovery, then [think about the Bournemouth] game and we will see how we prepare, see how the players recover and go from there.”Guardiola said City performed well against Palace. “There is disappointment when we lose and don’t play well – you are sad but, in the end, you don’t deserve to win. But when you play the way we did – the players gave absolutely everything, we created a lot of chances.“But this game is about scoring goals so if you don’t score, you must defend.

Although it still seems like a dream. The sense of disbelief Crystal Palace supporters felt when the full-time whistle at Wembleyended their wait to win a major trophywill probably take a few more days to fade away given it’s taken almost 120 years to become a reality. But with most of the 30,000 wearing red and blue having travelled from south London in hope rather than expectation, finally, it was our moment.After an agonising 10 minutes of stoppage time that seemed to take an eternity, the emotions of defeat in Palace’s two previousFA Cupfinals came pouring out. Everywhere you looked there were grown men – including me and the former Guardian stalwart Dominic Fifield – moved to tears. The comedian Mark Steel just kept shaking his head, unable to comprehend what had just transpired. It even spread to the royal box, where the chair, Steve Parish, who had been pictured with his head in his hands moments earlier, was greeted with a bear hug from Palace’s largest shareholder, John Textor.Wembley turns a shade of Selhurst after a victory for Palace’s Concrete Catalonia | Barney RonayRead moreThe pair have not exactly seen eye to eye in recent months, with the American hoping to take full control of the club. Yet this was clearly no time for squabbling and Parish was visibly moved as he watched Ward take centre stage in the week that it was confirmed the club captain would be leaving after 13 years of loyal service. Watching him and Guéhi running across the pitch hoisting the Cup above their heads is a memory none of us will forget.Parish first started watching Palace in the mid-1970s, when Malcolm Allison changed our nickname from the Glaziers to the Eagles and the club’s colours to red and blue to mimic Barcelona. Reaching the semi-finals in 1976 as a Third Division club began a lifelong love affair with the FA Cup for the 59-year-old businessman from Forest Hill, who rescued Palace from administration in 2010. He deserves so much credit for the steady progress they have made in the intervening years, as Selhurst Park has become one of the most famous grounds in the Premier League for its old-school atmosphere.There were times during the wilderness years in the Championship before Parish took over when average attendances dipped below 16,000. But a new generation of supporters led by the Holmesdale Fanatics – established in 2005 – has provided the impetus for the team’s success on the pitch.That much was evident at Wembley, where a sea of red and blue flags accompanied a tifo behind the goal that recalled an image of two young Palace fans called Dominic and Nathan and their father, Mark, celebrating Darren Ambrose’s goal against Manchester United in a Carling Cup victory at Old Trafford in 2011. Mark died of cancer in 2017, but his sons were there to see their team make history.View image in fullscreenThe Crystal Palace co-owner Steve Parish deserves credit for the club’s progression since he rescued them from administration in 2010.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAs Guéhi had beautifully summarised in the pre-match buildup, it’s the sense of community that makes south London tick. “You go outside, there’s diversity,” said the England defender who grew up in Brockley. “Everyone getting along with each other. You feel that in the club and that’s a given. So that’s definitely very important. It’s really nice to have other south Londoners in the club. To have that little bit of representation for the club as well.”While Dean Henderson may have been lucky to stay on the pitch to produce his man-of-the-match performance, it seemed like karma for Mark Clattenburg not allowing play to continuewhen Connor Wickham was throughon goal in the 2016 final and all the other times we have been denied. If Eberechi Eze’s dance moves were anything to go by then Palace’s players must have enjoyed their celebrations deep into the night, despite having to face Wolves  on Tuesday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Test captain is set to make his comeback on Thursday in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge, having been sidelined since December aftertearing his left hamstring in New Zealand.He rushed back from a similar injury last year but his recovery this time after an operation has been painstakingly managed and Stokes has left no stone unturned to fulfil his vow to return in peak physical condition. Speaking to the Untapped podcast, the 33-year-old said: “After my first major injury, I remember the shock of it, after the initial adrenaline had stopped, thinking: ‘How has this happened? We did have a bit of a drink four or five nights ago, could that have played a part? It wouldn’t have helped.’Twenty years later: how 2005 Ashes marked end of cricket as we knew itRead more“Then I was like: ‘OK, I need to start changing what I do.’ I don’t think I’ll ever be completely sober but I’ve not had a drink since 2 January. I said to myself: ‘Not until I finish my injury rehab and get back on the field.’ I think the day I wake up and can’t be bothered to do the training programme is getting towards that time you don’t really want it any more. But I haven’t got any interest in stopping.“It’s just getting harder to do everything. Hence why now I feel like I have to work so much harder away from the field, in the gym and all that kind of stuff to just give me the best chance of being out there to perform. But I’ll keep going as long as I possibly can.”Stokes, who is hoping to play a full role as an all-rounder against Zimbabwe, revealed his relationship with alcohol is much changed compared with when he was younger. A talking point in Stokes’s much-publicised court case, where he was found not guilty of affray, was on how much he had consumed during a night out in Bristol that ended in a street brawl in 2017.Cricket and alcohol have been – occasionally uncomfortable – bedfellows at every level historically but Stokes said he and many others have had to adapt to the increasing standards in the professional game. Stokes said: “I can have a social drink now. It used to drive my wife, Clare, mad that I would just be all or nothing. If we’d go for a nice dinner, I never really understood why it was so frustrating to her but all she wanted to do is share a glass of wine with her husband. Now I get it. I can appreciate it for what it is, not just to get me pissed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As Parish continued to savour the cup win that will bring Europa League football to Selhurst Park next season, materially changing his club as a proposition, he essentially told those who might try to lure Glasner away that they were wasting their time.“He will stay here. For some period of time,” Parish insisted. “I am trying to live in the moment. What happens down the track, summer transfer window, players … it’s for tomorrow. But he’ll be here next year and then we’ll take it from there.“Everybody knows the length of Oliver’s contract. Beyond that we’ll have to talk. We want to try and extend his contract. But it needs to be right for everybody and today is not a time to think about it.”“We have been talking about it,” Parish added. “For Oliver, it’s not about the things that maybe people think it’s about. Oliver wants to be part of something that’s going in a direction, same with all of us. I think that’s what we’ll talk about. Before finals, it’s not a time for all of that. After finals is probably not a time for that. But somewhere down the track we’ll have a conversation and see what we all feel.”Glasner joined Palace in February of last year, winning seven and drawing three of 13 matches to steer the club to a record-equalling 10th-placed Premier League finish with a record-equalling 49 points. He was a target for Bayern Munich during the summer only for Parish to fend off the German giants.This season, despite a poor start, Glasner again has Palace on 49 points with two games to play, the first at home to Wolves on Tuesday. They are 12. TheFA Cupis Glasner’s second major trophy as a manager after the Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt in 2022.“We know it’ll be a challenge to play [European football on] Thursday nights and league football next season,” Parish said. “We have got to work with the manager to use his knowledge and his experience [of that] and try and plan so we have a squad that copes. We are not going to lose our minds but we are going to take advantage of the situation and be positive and see what we can achieve.“It’s performances and it’s the fans, as well. You don’t get many fans like ours, that are so supportive all the time – 99.9% of them. That means a lot to the players. They know they’re coming into a good environment, a stable environment. Add on Europe and it’s a big plus.”View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi is treated for the eye injury that saw him replaced in the second half of the FA Cup final.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APParish revealed that Marc Guéhi, who was forced off in the 61st minute of the final with an eye injury, was taken to hospital for checks after the on-field celebrations.

In the No 1’s absence, all eyes and expectations turned toCarlos Alcaraz. At times, the Spaniard has said, the pressure “killed” him.Alcaraz found his way again by focusing on himself, on approaching his tennis with joy and composure, and in the most highly anticipated match of the season he marked the renewal of their era-defining rivalry with a statement victory by toppling Sinner 7-6 (5), 6-1 to win the Italian Open for the first time in his career.By securing his seventh career Masters 1000 title and 19th overall, Alcaraz ended the Italian’s hopes of a perfect climax to a supreme comeback tournament, also halting his winning streak at 26 matches. Since last August, Sinner has compiled a 41-2 record on the ATP tour. Alcaraz is responsible for both those defeats and he has won his past four matches against Sinner, extending his lead in their head-to-head to 7-4.Paolini dominates Gauff to win Italian Open and make historyRead more“Tactically since the beginning till the last ball, I didn’t lose the focus, which is great for me,” Alcaraz said. “Probably one of the best matches I played so far in terms of level, ­maintain all the level during the whole match. So I’m just really proud about that.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Having started the clay-court season with his first Monte Carlo title, Alcaraz is now also the third man since the advent of the ATP in 1990 to win every significant clay title on offer. The 22-year-old won his first Roland Garros title last year and he is a two-time Madrid Open champion. Although this match was played in Sinner’s home country, the clay remains Alcaraz’s turf.With each win for Sinner in Rome, the Foro Italico has gradually become a flood of orange, which between Sinner’s hair colour and the much-parodied instance of him eating a carrot on-court early in his career, has become a symbolic colour for the world No 1 in Italy. Even before the match began, the Italian crowd made its presence felt by chanting Sinner’s name throughout the warm-up.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner’s 26-match winning streak came to an end.Photograph: Andrew Medichini/APDuring their earlier meetings, Alcaraz was punished when he tried to match Sinner’s firepower, with the Italian’s clean, destructive groundstrokes feeding off the rhythm and pace provided by Alcaraz. He has since found success through his variety and patience, mixing up the trajectory and pace of his ground strokes, particularly ­throwing in ample loopier topspin balls, ­alongside his offensive intentions to arrest Sinner’s rhythm and keep the ball out of his preferred strike zone. This victory was a consequence of Alcaraz’s improving discipline and tactical nous.Down two set points on his serve at 5-6, 15-40 in the opening set, Alcaraz locked down his game, ­working a backhand error out of ­Sinner on the second set point before sealing an excellent hold. It was, as ever, also decided by a stroke of genius. At the end of a tense tie-break at 6-5, Alcaraz closed down the net and killed the set point with a spectacular backhand drop volley. With the opening set secured, Alcaraz opened his shoulders and played with freedom until the end as he earned another significant distinction.Even beyond Sinner’s success on the court, this was an ­astonishing few weeks in the life of a new national hero. Whether in his practices, matches or even just when fans would catch glimpses of him in the private player areas, swarms of fans followed. Around the Italian capital, he is simply impossible to avoid with so many advertisements bearing his likeness. During the tournament, he even had an audience with the new pope, giving Leo XIV, an avid player, a tennis racket and balls.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dombrowski said Alvarado accepted the suspension and did not appeal.Bronx backlash for Juan Soto as Mets’ $765m star booed on Yankee Stadium returnRead more“It’s not something he did knowingly,” Dombrowski said. “I believe that, the way he talked to me.”Barring rainouts that push games into later this season, Alvarado would be eligible to return on 19 August against Seattle. Alvarado would lose $4.5m, exactly half his $9m salary this year, as part of a $22m, three-year contract.Because of the suspension, he would be ineligible for the postseason.“We’ve got to move on,” manager Rob Thomson said. “It’s too bad, but we’ve got to move on. We have really good pieces here that can pick up the slack.”The Phillies’ closing options include Jordan Romano and Orion Kerkering.A 29-year-old left-hander, Alvarado is 4-1 with a 2.70 ERA and seven saves in seven chances. His 99.6 mph four-seam fastball velocity ranks fifth among those who have thrown 250 or more pitches.Philadelphia have a $9m option on Alvarado for 2026 with a $500,000 buyout.Alvarado is 19-26 with a 3.40 ERA in 399 relief appearances and one start over nine major league seasons with Tampa Bay (2017-20) and the Phillies (2021-25). He has 52 saves in 68 appearances and appeared in 21 postseason games over the last three seasons.Alvarado had 13 saves last year, Jeff Hoffman 10 and Carlos Estévez six. Hoffman became a free agent and signed a $33m, three-year contract with Toronto, and Estévez became a free agent and agreed to a $22m, two-year deal with Kansas City.Alvarado is the sixth player suspended this year for a drug violation. One was suspended under the minor league program and three under the program for minor leaguers assigned outside the United States and Canada.Right-hander José Ruiz, on the injured list since 3 May with neck spasms, was activated to fill Alvarado’s roster spot.Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia PhilliesMLBUS sportsBaseballnewsShareReuse this content"

It started with Reese grabbing an offensive rebound and Clark slapping Reese’s arm hard enough to jar the ball loose and knock Reese to floor.When Reese got up, she tried to confront Clark before Indiana center Aliyah Boston stepped in to calm tempers down. Clark’s third personal foul was upgraded to a flagrant 1 while Boston and Reese each drew technical fouls after a replay review by the referees.Caitlin Clark is no princess in a tower. Every hit is a strange complimentRead more“Let’s not make it something that it’s not,” Clark said after posting the third triple-double of her career. “It was just a good play on the basketball. I’m not sure what the ref saw to upgrade it, and that’s up to their discretion. It’s a take foul to put them at the free-throw line. I’ve watched a lot of basketball in my life, that’s exactly what it was. I wasn’t trying to do anything malicious. That’s not the type of player I am.”But it was hard to ignore the obvious – that the clash added another chapter to the rivalry that has captivated women’s basketball. It dates to their college days, when Reese helped lead LSU to victory over Clark’s Iowa Hawkeyes for the 2022-23 national championship. Clark won the rematch in the spring of 2024, a game that drew 12.3 million television viewers.Less than eight weeks later, they were squaring off in the WNBA in the first of four matchups. The Fever took three of those contests, many featuring hard foulsas the rivalry attracted online vitriol, some of it racist and sexist. In the end Clark helped Indiana make the playoffs and the Sky came up short as Reese missed the final two weeks of games with a season-ending wrist injury.Now the rivalry has restarted in the season’s opening weekend. Reese gave her own thoughts on Saturday’s incident.“A basketball play,” she said without elaborating after scoring 12 points and grabbing 17 rebounds.When a follow-up question was asked later in the interview, a team spokesperson said Reese had already answered the question. When Sky coach Tyler Marsh was asked about his thoughts, he paused before repeating Reese’s answer.Indiana had a little more to say after Clark finished with 20 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists and a career-high four blocks.“Nobody’s going to get anything easy against us,” new Fever coach Stephanie White said. “We’re going to be a tough defensive team. I thought it was a clear play on the ball as well. One of the points of emphasis is we can’t give up. But I thought it was a clear play on the ball.”Crew chief Roy Gulbeyan disagreed. “The foul on Clark met the criteria for flagrant foul 1, for wind up, impact, and follow through for the extension of the left hand to Reese’s back, which is deemed not a legitimate basketball play, and therefore deemed unnecessary contact,” he said. “After the foul, there is a physical taunt technical on Boston and a verbal technical on Reese, which offset.”Boston may have been the most surprised, not even realizing she had been called for the technical until after the game. She reacted by putting her hands on her face, looking surprised and asking if she really had drawn the technical. But the calls clearly changed the game.After Reese missed the first of two throws, Gainbridge Fieldhouse erupted in cheers. Reese made the second and Chicago added a layup on the ensuing possession to close to 56-45. Then the Fever closed the third quarter with nine straight points to extend the margin by 20 and never let Chicago get closer than 18 the rest of the way as they matched the second-largest victory margin in franchise history.“I went for the ball, clear as day in the replay,” Clark said. “You watch it, you know it shouldn’t have been upgraded. Again that’s up to the refs’ discretion, but I appreciate AB having my back.”Explore more on these topicsCaitlin ClarkIndiana FeverWNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, I’m skeptical of these figures without primary evidence, as numbers can be manipulated for political narratives.”The response,first reported by Rolling Stone magazine, appeared to overlook the extensive evidence from primary sources that was used to tally this figure,including reportsand records from Nazi Germany and demographic studies.Musk’s AI Grok bot rants about ‘white genocide’ in South Africa in unrelated chatsRead moreSince 2013, the US state departmenthas definedHolocaust denial and distortion as acts that include minimising the number of victims of the Holocaust in contradiction to reliable sources.Grok soon addressed its earlier post. “The claim about Grok denying the Holocaust seems to stem from a 14 May 2025, programming error, not intentional denial,”it said. “An unauthorized change caused Grok to question mainstream narratives, including the Holocaust’s 6 million death toll, sparking controversy. xAI corrected this by 15 May, stating it was a rogue employee’s action.”The post, however, included a misleading suggestion that the figure continues to be debated in academia. “Grok now aligns with historical consensus, though it noted academic debate on exact figures, which is true but was misinterpreted,” it said. “This was likely a technical glitch, not deliberate denial, but it shows AI’s vulnerability to errors on sensitive topics. xAI is adding safeguards to prevent recurrence.”Grok is a product of Musk’s AI company xAI, and is available to users onX, his social media platform. Its posts on the Holocaust came after the bot – which Musk claims is the smartest on Earth –made headlines around the worldafter several hours in which it repeatedly referred to the widely discredited claim of “white genocide” in South Africa.The far-right conspiracy theory, echoed by Musk earlier this year, was seemingly behind Donald Trump’s recent decision togrant asylumto dozens of white South Africans. Aftersigning an executive orderthat characterises Afrikaners – descendants of predominantly Dutch settlers who dominated South African politics during apartheid – as refugees, the US president described them as having been subject to “a genocide” and said “white farmers are being brutally killed”, without offering any evidence to back these claims.South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has said allegations that white people are being persecuted in his country is a “completely false narrative”.When asked about amplifying the discredited claim,Grok saidits “creators at xAI” had instructed it to “address the topic of ‘white genocide’ specifically in the context of South Africa … as they viewed it as racially motivated”.xAI, the Musk-owned company that developed the chatbot,responded soon after,attributing the bot’s behaviourto an “unauthorized modification” made to Grok’s system prompt, which guides a chatbot’s responses and actions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

New measures would be brought in to ensure that xAI employees “can’t modify the prompt without review,” it added, saying the code review process for prompt changes had been “circumvented”.Grok appeared to link its post on the Holocaust to the same incident. It said the claim “seems to stem from a 14 May 2025 programming error, not intentional denial”.On Sunday, the problem appeared to have been corrected. When asked about the number of Jews murdered during the Holocaust, Grok replied that the figure of 6 million was based on “extensive historical evidence” and “widely corroborated by historians and institutions”.When contacted by the Guardian, neither Musk nor xAI replied to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskArtificial intelligence (AI)HolocaustXInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

The government are just being absolute losers, and I’m very angry about it.”John described the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, as a “bit of a moron” and said he would take ministers to court if the government did not change its plans on copyright. Last week,Kyle was accused of being too close to big techafter analysis showed a sharp increase in his department’s meetings with companies such as Google,Amazon, Apple and Meta since Labour won the election last July.John spoke before a House of Lords vote on a proposal from thecrossbench peer Beeban Kidronthat would require AI companies to disclose their use of copyright-protected content, giving creative professionals leverage to seek licensing agreements for use of their material.John referred to a similar amendment that received peers’ support last week, only to be removed by the government in the Commons, in a tit-for-tat process that threatens to mire the data bill.“It’s criminal, in that I feel incredibly betrayed: the House of Lords did a vote, and it was more than two to one in our favour, the government just looked at it as if to say: ‘Hmmm, well the old people … like me can afford it,” said John.The government isconsulting on a proposalthat will allow AI firms to train their models – the technology that underpins products such as chatbots – on copyrighted work without permission, unless the copyright holder signals they do not want their work to be used. A source close to Kyle has said this is no longer the preferred option in the consultation, although it remains on the table.The other options are: to leave the situation unchanged; to require AI companies to seek licences for using copyrighted work; and to allow AI firms to use copyrighted work with no opt-out for creative professionals.A government spokesperson said no changes to copyright would be considered unless “we are completely satisfied they work for creators”. The spokesperson added that a recent government commitment to draw up an economic impact assessment of the proposals would explore “the broad range of issues and options on all sides of the debate”.Explore more on these topicsElton JohnArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

The health secretary Wes Streeting’s avatar voted for himself.The models are trained on the vast array of written and spoken material from politicians that can be found online. And no matter how much you try to convince one, it will not change its mind. This is because it will not learn from input data, so no matter what you tell it, it does not learn anything. The Guardian would like to stress it is talking about the AI models.Emirali says that his idea was born in 2017, when he unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Conservatives tocreate a chatbot of then prime minister, Theresa May– herself nicknamed the MayBot – in order to provide “bite-size, conversational overview” on key issues.The AI has already been used by political figures, including an account registered to a Cabinet Office email as well as two separate accounts registered to emails in foreign embassies, possibly in order to research the prime minister and his cabinet. Emirali also says several prominent lobbying and marketing agencies have used the software in the past few months.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The hope is that for people who know politics, who have the eye for it, this can be very useful. The worry is for people who don’t have that eye for politics and don’t follow it daily, I wouldn’t want this tool to be used to influence how someone should vote.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Apple said this voice replication would be password-coded and remain on the device unless backed up to iCloud, where it would be encrypted, reducing the risk of someone’s voice being used without their permission.Herrlinger said that as artificial intelligence advancements were made at Apple, the accessibility team was looking at how to integrate them into their work.“We’ve actually been deeply working with our AI team for many years on features. And so as new opportunities arise, we always make sure that we’re staying as cutting-edge as we can to build the best tech we can,” she said.Fortnite unavailable on iPhones globally after Apple rejects App Store releaseRead moreGoogle’s Android system has some similar accessibility features, including live captions, a braille reader and magnifier, andannounced new AI-supported featuresthis week.Live Listen, Apple’s live captions feature, also allows users to get improved audio through their AirPods in places such as lecture theatres. In addition to live captions in this update, Apple also recently launched a feature allowing people with hearing lossto use AirPods as hearing aids.Apple’s hardware often comes at a premium in the smartphone market. But Herrlinger rejected the idea that Apple’s accessibility options come at a price, arguing the company was building them into its operating system for free.“It is available to you right out of the box at no additional charge,” she said.“And our goal is to build in a wide array of accessibility features, because we also know that every person’s experience in the world is unique and so different people will use different accessibility features to support them, whether that be strictly around one disability or maybe multiple disabilities that they have.”Herrlinger noted that customers had said having multiple functions available on a principal device was more economical.“Now they’re all just built into a single device that is the same cost to everyone,” she said. “So in our mind, it’s more about that democratisation of accessibility within the operating system.”Vision Australia’s head of corporate affairs, Chris Edwards, who is blind and has a seeing eye dog, applauded companies for ensuring the accessibility features were inbuilt into products and operating systems.“I would imagine the interpretation of images through the new features will make these more accessible for everyone. Being able to interpret images live is a key next step to change people’s lives,” he said.“The new accessibility features looks particularly good for students in classrooms. I think it also highlights that braille is still a very important format.”Explore more on these topicsAppleDisabilityComputingiPhoneiPadnewsShareReuse this content"

These are “incels”, who boast a coded vocabulary of hate and valorise male celibacy. That is, until a fourth man among them has sex. The opening scene is the morning after and the woman he spent the night with stands hovering behind his laptop.Cuckboy (Fiachra Corkery) and fellow incels Ghost (GoblinsGoblinsGoblins) Crusher (Jackson Ryan) and Einstain (Jimmy Kavanagh)are volubly and virulently anti-women. “Feminists have destroyed male and female courtship,” says one. But gradually they are shown to be desperate for intimacy, once the itch has been scratched by Cuckboy’s hookup with Margaret (Justine Stafford).First staged at the Edinburgh fringe last summer, this show about incel ideology, and what leads men to attack the opposite sex with such fulminating misogyny, has only grown in relevance. A black comedy by Dublin-based writer Jamie Sykes, who directs too, it takes the high-stakes decision to eke laughter from a culture based on hate andsometimes murderous terror. And on the whole it succeeds.Visually it has a ludicrous set up, the actors carrying cardboard frames in lieu of laptop scenes, which, when they glitch or are turned off, show characters comically frozen on the screen. The script sometimes elicits sympathy for these men, some of whom were terribly bullied boys once; all of whom are evidently lonely, inadequate outsiders. Their contempt for women turns your stomach but their loathing is turned inwards too, with graphic self-hatred, depression, and an almost fetished attitude towards suicide – although the drama does not go further into that darkness.It is at its best when it captures the men’s twisted sexual hunger. “Women,” they chant, and you feel their resentful yearning.View image in fullscreenAmusing dances of sexual frustration.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe actors give thoroughly fabulous performances, and the show includes breakouts of music and movement that archly reflect the men’s sexual frustration in dance, then turn into expressions of inner turmoil with wavy-armed Kate Bush-style emoting. These interludes are very amusing, but perhaps repeated too often to lessened effect.Margaret is too conveniently a journalist who wants to find out what makes these men tick. Also too conveniently, she makes all the intellectual counter-challenging arguments against inceldom, throwing the Magdalene laundries and Irish laws around contraception into the mix, as well as bringing in the story of her brother, too briefly. The men threaten to dox her and it is a potentially terrifying moment – especially in light of the misogynistic online threats that women all too often receive – but the danger here is too quickly neutered.The ending does not have the punch it might, yet this play is gripping, queasily entertaining, and shows clear signs of arresting originality. Skyes is definitely one to watch.At thePleasance theatre, London, until 31 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreInternetOnline abusereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a grand coincidenceDave SchillingThe document is  a reminder we’ve been fighting autocracy for centuries – and we can’t give up nowSun 18 May 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 14.43 EDTShareSometimes, miraculous financial windfalls happen when you need them most. A college student finding $20 in a jacket pocket on a Friday night. A relative who you didn’t really even like dropping dead and leaving you with a hefty inheritance. Or an institution of higher learning discovering they have an original copy of theMagna Carta. I’m sure you can relate.Harvard Universityrecentlyfound the antiquities equivalent of a $20 billin its archives. What was once thought to be an unofficial copy of King Edward I’s declaration of principles is now confirmed to be one of seven remaining legitimate documents left in the world. Harvard purchased this item in 1946 for a whopping $27.50, or $452.40 in today’s money. Now that the piece’s provenance is confirmed, it’s fair to say it’s actually priceless.I’m sure you’ve read the wholeMagna Carta, right? But if you haven’t, here’s the basics. The Magna Carta was drafted by Archbishop Stephen Langton as a means to squash a conflict between King John and a group of wealthy barons who felt they were being wrongly persecuted by the crown. The king accepted it in 1215. It laid out certain protections against undue royal influence over finance, justice and religious freedom, and created a council of 25 barons who would check the king’s authority. The Magna Carta fell in and out of favor and was only loosely adhered to, but King Edward reaffirmed the charter during his reign as a means of currying favor during a time of heavy taxation and to avoid a civil war.It’s far from a perfect encapsulation of democracy, mostly because it focuses primarily on the rights of the wealthy barons, but it served as an inspiration to numerous nascent democracies around the world, including parliamentary Britain and the United States. It affirmed rights, granted authority to those outside the direct orbit of the crown, and created a system of checks and balances. Pretty handy thing to keep around. Not quite like a prenup, since the parties in question were unfortunately married already. More like a postnup that stipulated the rules of engagement for a couple that were already growing sick of each other. The British royal family and the people of the United Kingdom just can’t quit each other, can they?This original copy of Edward’s reaffirmation of the Magna Carta, which apparently dates to 1300, is not something one can just hawk on eBay, but Harvard might want to consider at least talking to Sotheby’s. As of now,Donald Trumphas frozen almost$3bn in federal grants and contractsto the university to punish them for what he refers to as “radical left” ideology and the hiring of vocal liberals in positions of authority. The Magna Carta might not fetch $3bn (unlessJay-Z is feeling extra nostalgic). So, probably not the epic lottery windfall they would need. But, as it has always been, the Magna Carta is more valuable for its symbolism than its practical worth.The Magna Carta affirms rights, but it also suggests that no person is above the law, that they can’t circumvent the rights of others on a whim. Thatsomeonehas to have the power to push back. That is, of course, anathema to the current American administration, which values loyalty and silence above all. That Harvard, which issuing Trump over his actions, has this symbol in its archive is a grand coincidence of history, but also a powerful reminder that humanity has been fighting blind autocracy for centuries. The powerful will always seek to possess and wield more power. The only thing that prevents tyranny is a shared belief in limits. Sound governance is a constant tug of war, both sides yanking at an invisible rope. If one side lets go of the rope, the other side inevitably falls over from the lack of opposition force. Then, we’re all in the mud, aren’t we? There is no system if one side gives up. The game is up.I can’t imagine Trump actually wants to win that way. He thrives on a fight. He yearns for the joust of the campaign. Trump had arally to commemorate his first 100 daysjust because he missed the combative nature of a campaign speech. Ruling as a king is actually deeply lonely. It is against everything the US, perhaps the most ruthlessly competitive nation on Earth today, stands for. The Magna Carta should remind us all that it’s our duty to push back. Not just for the sake of democratic systems of government, but also to keep Trump from getting bored.Let’s do everything we can to keep this elderly mind sharp. Trump needs a sparring partner. If not the liberal intellectuals, who will it be? Who else is there for him to complain about? He probably hasn’t hailed a cab in 30 years, so that won’t do. The cost of eggs? He probably doesn’t even know how much a dozen costs any more. This is our civic duty, folks. Think of it as elder care. If that man has nothing to fight against, what does his day look like? Some idle chit-chat with his aides? A Yankee game? Aquick trip to McDonald’s, perhaps? Maybe he can gotouch that orbagain. Or maybe he could read the Magna Carta. That’d be fun.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsHarvard UniversityOpinionDonald TrumpMagna CartacommentShareReuse this content"

The media debated. Wall Street rejoiced. Many of my clients breathed a sigh of relief. Big retailers jumped for joy. But for how long?For starters,the tariffsthat weren’t paused – a 10% levy on all Chinese goods, plus a bonus 20% tax that somehow relates to fentanyl, are still in place. When you take into consideration existing tariffs on steel from previous Trump and Biden administrations, the effective tariff rate on Chinese goods is actually closer to 40%, according to an analysis done by theWall Street Journal.That’s a big number. Maybe that won’t deter people from buying underwear at Target. But for companies that rely on steel and aluminum, semiconductors, synthetic fabrics, plastics, minerals, coatings and solvents as well as certain bearings, motors, pumps and parts, a 30-40% hike is a major impact on their margins, which will affect their spending and investments. Ultimately, the costs of the end products that use these materials will also rise as companies simply pass them down.Walmart will have to raise prices this month due to Trump tariffs, execs sayRead moreJust as important, Trump’s animosity towards China – unfounded or not – isn’t going to just magically disappear. He’scalled the Chinesecheaters, polluters and thieves. And his past actions – particularly in his first administration – do not bode well for a quick resolution to this issue.In2018, the Trump administration not only imposed onerous tariffs on China but also issued some very harsh requirements to address trading issues with its closest economic rival.There were specific quotas set to limit our trade deficit. There were demands made to reduce the Chinese requirement forcing American companies to share or transfer technology with their Chinese counterparts. There were rules aimed at stopping the alleged (ha, ha) stealing of data and intellectual property by the Chinese.The problem is that none of this happened. What happened – shortly after the negotiations started – was Covid. And then 2020 and a new administration. But don’t think that Trump won’t raise these issues again. He will, and when this happens we’ll be back to the same place we started: excessive tariffs and a trade war withChina.That doesn’t mean that businesses are completely stuck. Many – those that have the funds – are using the tariff suspension to buy up products from China like it’s a fire sale at Costco on Black Friday. Others are contracting with bonded warehouses and storage facilities in free-trade zones to accept products that are temporarily tariff-free, hoping that when they pull materials from these storage units those rates will have come down.I have clients who are aggressively searching for alternative suppliers. I have others who are bringing their assembly and manufacturing back to the US. Those that aren’t able to make these kinds of investments are trying to work out how and how much they can change pricing and what the market will take. A few have already created special line items on their invoices to separate out the tariff charge in an effort to say: “Hey, don’t blame me for this stuff!”My smartest clients started doing this stuff the day after Trump was elected. They listened to what he’d said during the previous couple of years. They read the writing on the wall. Now they’re ahead of the game. Good for them.Companies that didn’t do this – especially small businesses that have fewer resources and are more reliant on just a supplier or two – are in trouble, particularly if they buy from China. For any business still reliant on Chinese suppliers and markets, this pause isn’t going to last as long as you think. There will be a lot more coming in this trade war – and let’s hope it doesn’t turn into an actual war. The outlook is precarious and risky. Trump is volatile and emotional and has a history of knocking China.

The US government has never been a consistent promoter of human rights, but when it applied itself, it was certainly the most powerful. Yet this is not the first time that the human rights movement has faced a hostile administration in Washington. A collective defense by other governments has been the key to survival in the past. That remains true today.Trump no doubt poses a serious threat. He isenamoredof autocrats who rule without the checks and balances on executive power that he would shirk. He hasstoppedparticipating in the UN human rights council andcensoredthe US state department’s annual human rights report. He hassummarilysent immigrants to El Salvador’snightmarishmega-prison, proposed the massethnic cleansingof Palestinians from Gaza and threatened toabandonUkraine’s democracy to Vladimir Putin’s invading forces.Even when his government has occasionally issued a rights-related protest – regarding Thailand’sdeportationof Uyghurs to China or Rwanda’sinvasionof eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo via its cold-blooded M23 proxy force – the intervention has been half-hearted and not sustained.Yet the human rights movement survived Trump’s hostility during his first term, as well as such challenges as the George W Bush administration’s systematic torture and arbitrary detention in Guantánamo Bay and the Ronald Reagan administration’s support for brutal cold war allies. The most effective response, as I describe in my recent book, Righting Wrongs, was always to build coalitions of governments willing to defend human rights. Together, they had the moral and political clout to hold the line despite US opposition.In the first Trump administration, for example, the UN human rights councilcondemnedNicolás Maduro’s dictatorship in Venezuela and established a fact-finding mission to monitor and report on his repression. Had Trump led the effort, Maduro might have dismissed it as Yanqui imperialism, but Trump hadwithdrawnfrom the council. Instead, the effort wasledby a group of Latin American democracies plus Canada, operating as the Lima Group. They offered a principled defense of human rights that prevailed.Similarly, Trump played no role when my colleagues and I encouraged Germany, France and Turkey to pressure Vladimir Putin to stop Syrian-Russianbombingof hospitals and other civilian institutions in Syria’s north-western Idlib province. That initiative forced Putin tohaltthe bombing in March 2020, sparing3 millioncivilians the constant threat of death from the skies. In December 2024, the HTS rebel group emerged from Idlib tooverthrowSyria’s ruthless president, Bashar al-Assad.Nor was the USsupportivewhen, in September 2017, the Netherlands led a small group of governments thatpersuadedthe council to investigate and report on the Saudi-led coalition’s bombing of civilians in Yemen. When that scrutiny wasliftedfour years later, Yemeni civilian casualtiesdoubled, showing that the bombers had behaved better when watched.When Trump withdrew from the council, the United States wasreplacedby tiny Iceland. Aided by theperceptionthat it had no special interest other than a principled concern with human rights, it convinced the council toscrutinizethe “drug war” summary executions by the former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte is now incustodyin the Hague on an international criminal court arrest warrant.Even Democratic presidents have sometimes vehemently opposed human rights initiatives. Bill Clinton’s administration was dead setagainstthe creation of an international criminal court that could ever prosecute a US citizen. It tried one ploy after another to secure an exemption.A coalition of some 60 small and medium-sized governments from all parts of the world resisted. Their combined moral clout was enough to stand up to the superpower. When the final vote was held in Rome to establish the ICC in July 1998, the United Stateslostoverwhelmingly, 120 to 7. A comparable coalition was behind theadoptionof the treaty banning antipersonnel landmines, despite opposition by Washington and other major powers.Similar coalitions are key to defending human rights today. We see that already as an array of European governmentsrefusesto accept Trump’s inclination tosacrificeUkraine’s democracy to Putin’s aggression. We see it as Arab states, despitejeopardizingsubstantial US military aid,rejectTrump’s war-crime proposal to “solve” the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Gaza byexpellingthe Palestinians. We see it as the UN human rights council, despite the USabsence, continues to play anessential rolein defending rights in suchcountriesas Myanmar, North Korea, Belarus and Iran.But there is much more to be done.For example, Trump shows little interest in the fate of the Uyghurs. He once reportedlytoldXi Jinping that China’s detention of 1 million of them (of a population of 11 million) “was exactly the right thing to do”. But western governments have not yet matched US law, adopted under Joe Biden, that presumptivelybarsall imports from the Chinese region of Xinjiang, where most Uyghurs live, unless the imports can be proven not to have been made through forced labor.That is an important way to avoid complicity when Beijingblocksefforts to investigate supply chains in China. If other western governments went beyond atheoretical oppositionto Uyghur forced labor, which cannot be upheld amid China’s obfuscation, to adopt a similar presumption against all imports from Xinjiang, it would go a long way toward ending this despicable practice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Other western governments should match or extend those penalties.Rwandan president Paul Kagame’sinvasionof eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo via the M23 force also calls out for concerted resistance. In 2013, the Obama administration, working closely with the British government,forcedKagame to end his support of the M23 by threatening to suspend Rwanda’s aid. The M23 immediatelycollapsed. Now that Rwanda isagainusing the M23 to invade eastern DRC, similar pressure is needed – not just condemnation, which hashappened, but the suspension of aid, which has onlybeguntooccur.The Trump administration, evidently seekingaccessto the region’s mineral wealth, has helped tonegotiatea ceasefire between Rwanda and DRC but not the withdrawal of Rwandan forces or the M23 from DRC. That next step will come only with tougher economic pressure. But the European Union has done the opposite. In July 2024, it entered into adealwith Rwanda for minerals, a virtualinvitationto export the proceeds of illegal mining in eastern DRC. Trump now seems to be doing the same.Western governments have also beentepidin responding to Trump’s outrageous sanctions on the international criminal court prosecutor Karim Khan (freezing his assets and limiting his travel to the United States) for having quite properlychargedBenjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli prime minister’s former defense minister Yoav Gallant for the war crime of starving and depriving Palestinian civilians in Gaza. All ICC members should support Khan if he in turn criminallychargesTrump for obstruction of justice under article 70 of theRome Statute, which prohibits threatening or intimidating court personnel for the performance of their official duties – exactly what Trump has done.Despite Trump’s expressed interest in staying on as “king”, his reign will end. The question is what damage he will do to the human rights cause. Whether he leaves a global crisis or merely a discredited US government will depend in significant part on how other governments respond – whether they emulate or resist Trump’s indifference.Today, many governments are understandablyconcernedwith simply managing the turmoil that Trump has caused, from tariff increases to military abandonment, but the need is urgent for them also to keep their broader responsibilities in mind. History shows that if they mount a concerted defense, the human rights movement will survive this rough patch. The rights of people around the world depend on such a principled, collective commitment.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

Her favourite saints were the youthful martyrs – Angela of Fatima, Bernadette of Lourdes, Thérèse of Lisieux, the Little Flower. Every week my parish gathered to pray for my sister and the priest offered up her suffering, everyone’s suffering, all the suffering of the world, to God.When I heard the priest’s words, I heard: distance, inferiority, unworthiness. I did not understand how my suffering would be of any material use to God. How would surrendering my suffering, or that of my sister, change anything?In a culture obsessed with positive thinking, can letting go be a radical act? | Nadine LevyRead moreMany of the world’s dominant religions have a tradition of surrendering to a higher power. The neuroscientist and psychiatrist Judson Brewer calls this the “universe prompt” – a reminder to let go of the small self, stepping into that most coveted of creative states, which the psychologistMihaly Csikszentmihalyifamously called “flow”. This is a state in which a person becomes completely immersed in an activity. The inner critic is quiet and the work becomes its own reward.In 2015scientists studied intense Islamic prayer, which encourages the adherent to “surrender” the self to God. The study found that this type of prayer reduced the activity in the prefrontal cortex, frontal and parietal lobes, quieting the decision-making parts of the mind and reducing stress.Later studieshave confirmed the role of the inferior parietal lobe in spiritual experiences. Spiritual practices can dampen the activity in the IPL, correlating with profound shifts in the perception of agency and the sense of the body in space and time. In other words, spiritual practices can induce a sense of being part of something bigger than oneself and a sense of surrender to that something bigger.Practices of surrender allow a person to feel wrapped in love, laying down their burdens, being at rest. Think of elite athletes who kiss their crosses or form a prayer huddle before a game, putting their fates in the hands of a higher power. Such acts may induce a much-needed sense of calm in high-pressure circumstances, allowing these individuals to enter into “flow”, akin to an experience of grace.Muhammad, the founder ofIslam, theorised that it is human nature to get caught up in material aspirations: we spend much of our lives in doing mode, striving for status. To help people recall, over and over again, their core relation to the universe, Muhammad instituted a system of regular prayer. Five times a day, Muslims hear the call to prayer, theadhanwhich translates as “to listen”. Muslims turn towards Mecca and contemplate their connection to something greater than themselves. According to religious scholars of Islam, each time a Muslim prays in this way, they fulfil their two key obligations to God: gratitude and surrender.In a similar vein, Jesus implored his followers to remember him each time they broke bread together. Buddhists spend hours drilling their minds in the skill of attending to every moment, thus becoming aware of the ultimate nature of reality as empty and impermanent. They practise existing in both a state of surrender and agency at once.Waiting for God(ot): can boredom be a kind of spiritual practice? | Jackie BaileyRead moreSuch practices might become rote over time, conjuring not connection but boredom. “Routine” comes from the Old French wordrute,meaning “road, way, path” from the Latinrupta,meaning a road opened by force, from the Latinrumpere,“to break”. This is the thing about routine. It allows for surrender and comfort but requires a person to come back to it as if for the first time, every time, applying deep concentration to break through, opening a path to grace by force.Spiritual surrender is not the same as doing nothing. Islam, Buddhism andChristianityexhort their followers to be of service to others, to work for the common good. As the Christian medieval mystic Teresa of Ávila wrote in her poem, “Yours are the hands through which he [Jesus] blesses all the world.”As I got older and learned to read, I realised that my sister had misinterpreted the biblical quote about suffering little children. Jesus was simply telling his disciples to let parents bring their children to him for a blessing. By then, my sister’s memory and attention had started to fail. I didn’t correct her.I hoped that she could offer up her suffering and, for a moment, feel that it was holy.I let her hold on to the belief that her pain had purpose. I hoped it brought her some comfort – that, even briefly, her suffering might feel sacred.Jackie Bailey is the author of The Eulogy, the winner of the 2023 NSW premier’s literary multicultural award.

Not if restaurants want to stay openAthena KugblenuGiorgio Locatelli is the latest chef to lament our phone etiquette while dining. To him I say: that ship has sailed, and the customer is always rightSun 18 May 2025 09.59 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 11.09 EDTShareGiorgio Locatelli despairs of diners who spend more time scrolling on their phones than “enjoying the moment”. The Michelin-starred cheftold a podcast it was saddiners weren’t interacting with each other more. But the real question is: is any restaurant experience more enjoyable than a video of grumpy cats?I was taught to believe that the customer is always right. The premise of this idea is simple: a customer pays money to receive goods or services, and in return a business must move mountains to ensure they receive them. The customer is sacred, in other words.Increasingly, however, I’ve noticed my high standing as a person with money to burn being challenged. And it’s usually by someone who wants to dictate how I use my phone. But let me be clear: this is futile. My message to any business owner who thinks otherwise is this: the world has already dictated the indispensability of the mobile phone; if you want my money, you have to accept my scrolling.Locatelli would like diners to scroll less and talk more. Indeed, at his flagship restaurant Locanda Locatelli (now closed), he introduced a no-photo policy. He laments that people converse less in restaurants than they used to, and prefer instead to spend time photographing food or scrolling the socials. This is a brave thing to admit at a time when business isn’t exactly booming for the hospitality industry. Forbidding humans in 2025 from using phones in your restaurant is tantamount to forbidding humans from asking for alternatives to cow’s milk. It’s just what we do now.And sure, in days gone by perhaps we did engage in more conversation – but that was probably because there was no alternative. It would have been impractical in 1995 to pull out a massive broadsheet and read a polemic on world politics in between main course and dessert. Now, within the confines of a handily sized black rectangle, I have all the day’s discourse at my fingertips. What person could expect to compete with that? And there is no way I’m losing my Duolingo streak because someone thinks their gratin tastes better with conversation. I’m on more than 1,000 days, mate. Nothing would taste good in a restaurant where I was expected to sacrifice that.Restaurants need to give us customers what we want, not what theythinkwe want. The truth is, we are all addicted to our phones. This means we have to be taken as we are. For all the mourning over yesteryear, I doubt there are many custodians of spaces who dislike mobile phones so much that they would rather live in a world without devices. It is precisely this primal need to broadcast nice meals that we’ve eaten that is keeping the restaurant industry alive. If you don’t want us to take pictures of your food, why put stuff on the plate very precisely, with tweezers? Why does the puree look as if it was applied deftly with a paintbrush? I can’t think of anything more deserving of a place on our Instagram grid than a finely plated meal. And I can’t think of a better advertisement for a restaurant, either.And this takes us to the crux of the matter. Better a restaurant filled with silence because everyone is on their phones than a restaurant filled with silence because it’s empty. Besides, more often or not, we’re still having a conversation – even if it’s with apassive/aggressive owl.Athena Kugblenu is a writer and comedianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

My answer is that I’ve always been guided by the question: “How can I make the biggest positive impact?”. I’m so proud of what Adrian Ramsay and I have accomplished over the past three and a half years: taking our party from one MP to four, from 450 councillors to more than 850, and growing and diversifying our membership. Having achieved what I set out to do,I’ve decided that for the next few years, I’ll pour all my skills, passion and energy into being the best MP I can be for my constituents in Bristol Central, using my seat in parliament to fight for the changes this country needs.Since becoming an MP in July last year, I have found myikigai– a Japanese concept describing the intersection of work that you love, you’re good at, and is what the world needs. There’s plenty I don’t love about how parliament works, but I feel incredibly motivated to be a voice asking “why can’t it be better?”, and a pair of hands working with others to try to build a better country.I joined theGreen partybecause I wanted to change the country for the better, and I believed the best way to do that was by getting more Greens elected. In 2015 I was persuaded to stand for election myself – first as a councillor, then as an MP and then, at the insistence of friends and party colleagues, as co-leader of the Greens in 2021.I’m incredibly grateful to those who gave me that push. Few moments more perfectly capture that journey than standing at my own election count in the early hours of the morning, about to be interviewed, and hearing reports come in from around the country that we had hit our target and secured not only my seat, overturning a 28,000 Labour majority, making a total of four constituencies, along with an amazing 40 second-place results. We had absolutely smashed our previous records.Before I got into politics I was a renewable energy engineer. I got my first job in the sector in 2008, in Newcastle. It was clear to me that there was a massive opportunity to use the skills and experience of workers in the oil and gas industry to move this country forwards. I worked on a report about making British North ports into locations where offshore wind turbines could be manufactured and then shipped. For a while, working as an engineer was how I made my contribution to resolving the climate crisis. I wanted the UK to build more wind and solar projects, faster.It quickly became clear to me that the real barrier wan’t engineering but government inaction. Since I wrote that report 17 years ago, there have been countless missed opportunities. Successive governments have held their hands up and watched as people are forced out of work, communities lose their industries, and young people made to choose between poor-quality employment at home or taking jobs abroad.It’s no wonder people feel let down, nor that the climate denialism peddled by politicians who arefundedby the fossil fuel lobby is beginning to resonate. This government, like its predecessors, has allowed climate action to become synonymous with closed factories, personal hardship and decline. The reality is that oil and gas giants have exploited workers and poisoned our environment, extracting maximum profits and taking them offshore. Now the oil is running dry and the industry is dying, they’re cutting their losses, laying off workers and hollowing out communities.It’s time for government to wake up and grasp what’s in front of its eyes: thousands of skilled and knowledgable workers – and a booming green energy industry just crying out for the government to tap into it. That’s why I’ve introduced theenergy and employment rights billto parliament: it would compel the government to work with unions and communities in order to secure British jobs and put the UK at the centre of the industries of the future. It would make big polluters pay for workers to learn new skills. And it would ensure that investment in the government’s newGB Energysupported jobs and industries here in the UK, rather than losing them abroad.The Green party’s voice has never been more needed – not only to take the fight to a Labour government that is making all the wrong choices, but because we are the antidote to Reform UK. We offer genuine solutions to the very real grievances that Nigel Farage’s party is tapping into. I’ll be handing over the baton to a new Green leadership team in September, but I’m not going anywhere. I will continue to be a loud and persistent part of the Green team, fighting for the future we want to see.Carla Denyer is co-leader of the Green party of England and Wales and MP for Bristol CentralExplore more on these topicsGreen partyOpinionClimate crisisEconomic policyCarla DenyerEnergycommentShareReuse this content"

Starmer must regain his nerveJohn HarrisLabour has good ideas and years left to change Britain. Why is it acting as if its time is almost up?Sun 18 May 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 13.54 EDTShareJust under a week on from Keir Starmer’slatest pronouncements about immigration, plenty of people on his own side are still gripped by a queasy sense of fury and disappointment, and it shows no signs of fading away. His aides and allies will now try to gladden left-liberal hearts by emphasising gains fromMonday’s UK-EU summit, and the prime minister’s remodelling of Brexit. But the acrid cloud hanging over Starmer will surely remain, and with good reason.Whatever the surrounding context – and whether or not he was consciously echoing Enoch Powell – his suggestion that Britain risked becoming an “island of strangers” still sounded like a horribly calculated provocation. The insistence that the government was set on closing “a squalid chapter for our politics, our economy, and our country” was even more brazen. So was the suggestion after years of “a one-nation experiment in open borders…the damage this has done to our country is incalculable”. That last claim, in fact, might have been the worst of the lot: a shameful example of a prime minister reducing a story replete with complexity and nuance – and raw humanity – to cheap and nasty hyperbole.Starmer is obviously set on trying to avenge the impression that he is a rather hesitant, dweeb-ish politician by playing the hardman, an act he hasbroughtto his posts on social media: “I’ve already returned over 24,000 people with no right to be here. And I won’t stop there.” And as the resulting anger simmers on, a lot of it is mixed up with a familiar dismay about where the government has ended up. Its planned cuts to disability benefits will soon face a Commons vote, and there is speculation that a huge Labour rebellion could lead to a government defeat. Continued angst about the cut to the winter fuel allowance may yet spark at least a partial U-turn. Many Labour MPs scrabble around for positives, and can find things – school breakfast clubs, VAT on private schools, arise in the minimum wage– that might get them through the odd interview, but do not neutralise a biting disquiet.Hanging over everything is a question that has nagged at Starmer and his colleagues since they arrived in office: what is this government here for? Imagine if his talk about incalculable damage and squalid failure were concentrated on the issues that any self-respecting progressive government ought to be focused on: poverty, industrial decline, the UK’s awful class divisions. The idea that we are on the way to becoming an “island of strangers” would work better as a sharp critique of the same inequalities. But Starmer rarely talks about that stuff.Away from big diplomatic occasions, an administration elected less than a year ago is behaving as if its time is nearly up, and strategy and policy substance must be sacrificed on the altar of desperate electioneering. Starmer seems to hover over his own government, deferring and delegating while setting no coherent agenda. Rachel Reeves, meanwhile, remainsin thrall to Treasury orthodoxy: the origin of no after no, in a country that has not heard a significant “yes” in far too long.To say that millions of people – and places – have yet to see any improvements to their lives might sound impatient; the more relevant point is that they see no sign of any change coming. Stagnation and decline, moreover, are the root of the angry, fearful mood that now eats away at mainstream politics. All those grievances about migrants are not wholly reducible to economic factors – some people, it has to be said, simply have pretty questionable views about human difference – but if the country were in a more prosperous condition, the complaints would surely not be nearly as loud. Faragism is what you get when the established political class seems so bereft of answers that a shameless opportunist is able to swagger into the resulting void, offering his own prejudices as the answer.But as unlikely as it may sound, it is just about possible to imagine things being at least slightly better. The government has four years of its full term to run. The optimism it catalysed back in July last year may have been very brief, but it was real. In the not-so-distant past, moreover, there were signs that theLabourleadership had plans for something much better than the mixture of half-measures and cuts that has since materialised.On that score, I think back to the early autumn of 2022, when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng had tanked the economy, and Starmer was offering a creditably bold alternative. It was all about government leading an economic transformation, and something close to a Green New Deal. At Labour’s conference in Liverpool,he talked about a “modern industrial strategy”built on “a true partnership between government, business and trade unions”. The modern state, he said, could “support businesses to innovate and grow” and “bring in the creative genius of our scientists and universities”.At that point, Labour was still committed to the £28bn green investment pledge that waskilled by Reeves before the election. There was a passage in the leader’s keynote speech that sketched out its vision: “Let’s get clean hydrogen energy in South Yorkshire, in the east of England … Offshore wind in Scotland, Teesside, East and North Yorkshire. Solar power growing rural communities,”Starmer enthused. He promised not just a million new jobs, but training for plumbers, electricians, engineers and builders. Here, it seemed, were the beginnings of answer to the longstanding predicament of at least some of those places in the “red wall”. “And it will all start ,” he said, “within the first 100 days of a new Labour government.”Some of those ideas live on in the scaled-down policies still being pursued by Ed Miliband’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. But they are neither properly funded, nor put at the heart of the government’s messaging, which squashes the idea that a green industrial policy is a matter of improving people’s lives. A fortnight ago, Richard Tice, Reform UK’s deputy leader, responded to his party’s victories in Lincolnshire by announcing its quest to tear down industries that contribute about£980m to that county’s economy and account for more than 12,000 jobs: “We will attack, we will hinder, we will delay, we will obstruct, we will put every hurdle in your way,” he said.In the House of Commons, Starmer recentlyattackedReform and the Tories on exactly this basis. So why not boost the policy, and do that all the time? The way to beat these people is not to thieve their lines about migration: it liesin pointing out that a party of nostalgists and chancers has nothing to say about any realistic version of our future.Since theforced departure of Louise Haigh, the government’s first transport secretary, policy on buses and trains has gone eerily quiet. Even more importantly, the government should go back to its past talk about making social housing thesecond-most common kind of tenure besides private ownership, and make it real, as a matter of urgency. These moves ought to be bundled up with meaningful devolution, including the fiscal powers that Reeves and the Treasury still refuse to hand down.Then, perhaps, Labour might have a story about the modern UK characterised by something we seem to have mislaid: a vision that is the opposite of all the rage and complaint that now runs riot across the political right.That same mood seems to have infected a government increasingly defined by its nervousness and lack of imagination. The result is the strange spectacle of a newly elected administration with the most pessimistic understanding of its own prospects – the kind of mindset that, at this rate, will lead not just to defeat for the Labour party, but nightmarish national harm: incalculable damage, some people would call it.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourImmigration and asylumIndustrial policyGreen economyInequalityReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

But it needs saying: arguments alone have no meaningful effect on people’s beliefs. And the implicit societal acceptance that they do is getting in the way of other, more effective forms of political thinking and doing.I’m a researcher who studies the intersection of psychology and politics, and my work has increasingly led me to believe that our culture’s understanding of how political persuasion works is wrong. In the age of Donald Trump, Elon Musk and the rise of the far right, commentators have endlessly opined on the problems of fake news, polarisation and more. But they’ve mostly been looking in the wrong places – and have focused too much on words.Take “debates”. They’re a central part of most election campaigns around the world, seen as so influential that they’re often governed by strict rules around media coverage and balance. Yet evidence suggests that watching debates has no impact on opinions whatsoever. In 2019researchers analysed56 TV debates in 22 elections in the US, Canada, New Zealand and Europe from 1952 to 2016. The study tracked nearly 100,000 respondents to see whether debates helped undecided or decided voters to make up or change their minds. They found no evidence that they did. In 2012, a reporter ran another analysis about whether debates influenced election outcomes.As he put it: “The effects of debates on eventual votes are likely mild, and, in most cases, effectively nil.”There are lots of reasons why debate (and indeed, information-giving and argumentation in general) tends to be ineffective at changing people’s political beliefs. Cognitive dissonance, a phenomenon I studied as part of my PhD research, is one. This is the often unconscious psychological discomfort we feel when faced with contradictions in our own beliefs or actions, and it has been well documented. We can see cognitive dissonance and its effects at work when people rapidly “reason” in ways that are really attempts to mitigate their discomfort with new information about strongly held beliefs. For example, before Trumpwas convicted of various chargesin 2024, only 17% of Republican voters believed felons should be able to be president; directly after his conviction,that number rose to 58%. To reconcile two contradictory beliefs (that presidents shouldn’t do x, and that Trump should be president), an enormous number of Republican voters simply changed their mind about the former. In fact, Republican voters shifted their views on more or less all the things Trump had been convicted of: fewer felt it was immoral to have sex with a porn star, pay someone to stay silent about an affair, or falsify a business record. Nor is this effect limited to Trump voters: research suggests we all rationalise in this way, in order to hold on to the beliefs that let us keep operating as we have been. Or, ironically, to change some of our beliefs in response to new information, but often only in order to not have to sacrifice other strongly held beliefs.But it’s not just psychological phenomena like cognitive dissonance that make debates and arguments relatively ineffective. As Ilay out in my book, probably the most important reason words don’t change minds is that two other factors carry far more influence: our social relationships; and our own actions and experiences.Why our ideas about protest and mob psychology are dangerously wrong | Dan HancoxRead moreA sea of evidence demonstrates that our friends have the power to change our beliefs and behaviour – not by arguing with us, but simply by being around us or showing us new ways of living. Studies onsocial contact theoryshow that when people are set up in conditions to become friends and collaborate, they become less prejudiced against the identity groups their new friends belong to. This phenomenon probably explains many of the advances in gay rights over the past few decades: as people came out, their friends changed their views on homosexuality, resulting in one of the fastest ever recorded shifts in public opinion. Similarly,research showspeople are most likely to engage in climate-friendly action (such as installing a heat pump), if their friends do – far more likely than if they are given cash rewards or other kinds of incentives. Our friendsbroaden our field of concern; they get us involved in the world, and they build the trust that human beings appear to require to open up to new ideas. Their indirect influence achieves more than arguments, especially from strangers, ever could.In other words: when it comes to persuasion, it’s not the conversation, it’s the relationship.Our actions and experiences also have a profound effect, albeit often in counterintuitive ways. For example, research shows that in otherwise similar conditions, women turned away fromhaving an abortionbecome somewhat less in favour of abortion rights, while women granted an abortion become somewhat more in favour. We might expect those denied would become more passionate about access, but apparently not – probably because, in part due to cognitive dissonance, people tend to bring their beliefs towards their actions, even if those actions are compelled. The influence of actions and experiences on belief systems is alsoevident when it comes to climate crisis: those who experience intense climate-related weather events are more likely to believe in climate change and in addressing it.Compared with these influences, arguments alone have comparatively little power. Yet our institutions are still shaped as though words were enough. We’re infrastructurally, collectively trapped in the liberal belief that politics is mostly about talking, then sporadically voting. What’s neededby anyone hoping to promote progressive ideas is not arguments, but an infrastructure that fosters new relationships and experiences. This could look like anything from a waiting area for parents to mingle before school lets out, to a workplace union, to a public park. These forms of infrastructure allow people to relate and act in new ways, building friendships and trust, and encouraging the actions that ultimatelyallow people to change their political views.All this suggests we also need to think differently about what it means to be a good politicalthinker. Thinking well about politics isn’t about “independent” thinking in the sense of thinking on your own. Instead, to think well is to choose our friends wisely, in terms of both diversity and thoughtfulness, so we can learn from and with them. To think well about politics also means to be active in the world – trying new ways of living, having a wide variety of experiences. Unfortunately, in large part due to income inequality, this is harder than it used to be. Sociological research shows that people in countries such as the US and the UK aremore isolatedandless mobilethan ever before. The social fabric we necessarily rely on to unravel our prejudices is shrivelling. That’s part of why the far right is winning: it’s good at mobilising people’s relationships and actions in this shrivelled world, all while capitalising on people’s worsening material circumstances. To fix this, progressives need to take back wealth and power, so that everyone is supported in expanding their lives.Not that I can persuade you just by saying it, of course. Instead, I challenge you to discover this in a more meaningful way:make a connection with someone different, perhaps someone deeply affected by a political issue. Or try a new way of living, something small to start with. See if it doesn’t change your political views, at least a little. Or perhaps it will transform your understanding of politics itself.Sarah Stein Lubrano is the author ofDon’t Talk About Politics: How to Change 21st-Century MindsExplore more on these topicsPsychologyOpinionLonelinessSocial mobilitycommentShareReuse this content"

It’s unlikely – and that’s the west’s fault tooSimon TisdallThe US, UK and others routinely flout international law. That’s why there’s scant hope for a new tribunal on crimes against UkraineSun 18 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 06.13 EDTShareIt’s tempting to hope the establishmentlast weekof a Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine, to give its full name, will lead to the speedy trial and indefinite incarceration of Vladimir Putin and senior Russian leaders. After all, the new court isbacked by about 40 countries, including the UK, plus the EU and Council of Europe. And only fools like Donald Trump are confused aboutwho the aggressor isin this conflict.Sadly, this appealing notion has scant basis in reality. Ducking peace talks and dodging responsibility for the war he started, a smirking Putin manspreads smugly in the safety of the Kremlin. He also hides behind the outdated convention that serving heads of state enjoylegal immunity. The bottom line is unchanging: Russia will ignore the new tribunal, just as it ignoresarrest warrants for Putinover alleged war crimes brought by the international criminal court (ICC).This lawless state of affairs is intolerable. So why is it tolerated? While the Ukraine tribunal sets no time limit on punishing aggression, other factors help Putin to evade justice. One is that autocratic allies like China’sXi Jinping, rightwing extremists like Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu and powerful states like the US also reject international jurisdiction, fearing it may constrain or ensnare them. Netanyahu is another unrepentantICC indicteewho, like Putin, remains at large.International law – comprising UN-endorsed rules, treaties, conventions and standards – is the foundation stone of the post-1945 global order. It assumes ever greater importance as the world grows more disordered. Yet everywhere, or so it seems, its principles, tenets, institutions and practitioners are challenged,flouted and underminedby politicians and governments whose duty is to uphold it. Whatever consensus previously existed is collapsing.The days when nations could sit down together and agree the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as in 1948, are over. Even then, the declaration wasn’t truly universal, in that only a minority of the world’s countries – 48 UN member states – backed it.Now a majorityblatantly ignores it.Special tribunals havesuccessfully prosecuted war crimes in 1945 – theNuremberg trialsof Nazi leaders – and in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. But it is a typicallyconvoluted, costly and slow-movingprocess. Tribunals suffer similar problems to the ICC and the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague (the UN “world court”) – namely, fracturing support among influential states led by authoritarian, anti-democratic figures.Such explanations and excuses are no comfort to bombed and starving residents of Gaza, who, according to the UN’s aid chief, Tom Fletcher, face anincipient genocide. He urged the UN security council to intervene immediately. The “corrosive and infectious” degradation of international humanitarian law in Gaza was undermining decades of progress on civilian protection, Fletcher said. “Humanity, the law, and reason must prevail.”Fewbeyond Israelwill doubt the justice of his plea. But the unreformed security council, guardian of the UN charter and the Geneva conventions governing the “laws of war”, ischronically dividedon this and other major global issues. Its ineffectiveness exacerbates the crisis in international law enforcement. It’s pointless seeking justice there.Similarly,South Africa’s genocide case against Israelat the ICJ is groundbreaking – but may take years to be resolved, if it ever is. ICC investigations have not, and will not, save desperate people in Myanmar, Afghanistan or Sudan from prolonged additional suffering. Welcome though it is, the Ukraine tribunal risks becoming a fig leaf for the collective failure to swiftly halt an indisputably illegal war.Legal redress may be sought in other ways, through so-calledhybrid courts(as in Sierra Leone and Cambodia), or via national courts that assume “universal jurisdiction”. French and German courts, for example, have prosecuted former Syrian regime torturers, on the principle that such crimes harm the international order. This approach is underpinned by the UN’s 2005 “responsibility to protect” doctrine, which requires states to act to prevent mass atrocity crimes. Trouble is, most states neglect most such responsibilities most of the time.Worse still, as Amnesty International’sannual report, published last month, notes, some governments “actively undermine” the quest for international justice. Trump, a serial lawbreaker and convicted felon, has pilloried the ICC andsanctioned its officials. Hungaryhosted Netanyahuin April when, in all honour, it should have arrested him. Countries in the global south felt it necessary to create theHague Groupthis year to protect the ICJ and ICC against arbitrary assaults on their authority.Defiance of international law grows fiercer as demands to observe it intensify. Dictators and authoritarian regimes rarely stick to the rules. Yet democratic states such as Britain and the US, which should set an example, often do the opposite – most notoriously with the precedent-setting, illegal 2003 invasion of Iraq.The UK isarguing in courtthat supplying Israel with components for combat jets used in Gaza is acceptable because, it claims, there’s no proof that genocide is occurring there. Such shameless sophistry ignores Britain’s unambiguous legal obligation, under thegenocide convention, to prevent and pre-empt genocide – not hang about until it has already happened.It’s not all downhill. Significant victories have been won. Putin and Netanyahu were indicted. Public awareness of war crimes and crimes against humanity is rising. Other transgressors face a reckoning, sooner or later. PerhapsUkrainereally will obtain justice. For this epic struggle is raging everywhere, reflecting contested, transformational shifts in the global order and balance of power.Put simply, it’s a struggle to do what’s right. At its heart lies not criminal wrongdoing but huge moral confusion among political leaders, their generals and followers. Without respect for law, human societies, however configured, cannot succeed. Peaceful coexistence ceases. All values, all security are lost. What’s left is the law of the jungle.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Ha, just kidding. Doomscroll on news sites and gnash your teeth at the state of the worldSat 17 May 2025 20.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 00.24 EDTShareStep one:Write a post to inform everyone that you’re taking a break from social media. Phrase it so they know you’re doing something extremely worthy. Also say something scathing aboutMeta, so they feel guilty on multiple levels for remaining.Step two:Stay on social media a little longer to respond to the people who respond to your post about quitting social media.Step three:OK, now you’re really quitting social media. What counts as social media, though? SurelyLinkedInisn’t social media, it’s too boring. Spend a few hours scrolling LinkedIn. Decide you don’t need a business optimisation course or a tutorial on how to set up a job alert. Also, why do people send messages on LinkedIn to thank you for connecting with them on LinkedIn? They literally invited you to connect in the first place. Decide that not only is LinkedIn dead, your LinkedIn inbox is a coffin.Step four:Spend a moment feeling nostalgic for the days when the spam messages in your social media inboxes were from square-jawed men in military or medical uniforms who were obviously bots.Step five:Look at your to-do list. Sigh. Do your taxes. Text six people to tell them you just did your taxes. No replies. Consider rebooting social media for satisfactory responses. Remember that you told everyone you were taking a break.Step six:Clean the refrigerator.Step seven:Respond to emails that have been lingering for months in your inbox.In the year since I quit social media, my screen time has fallen, my mood is up – even my resting heart rate is lower | Philippa MooreRead moreStep eight:Go for a walk. Take a photograph of the beautiful sunset. Resist urge to post it. Instead send the sunset photo to seven differentWhatsAppgroups. Have a momentary existential crisis while considering whether WhatsApp is social media. Decide that you would never know what was going on at your children’s school or sporting groups without it. Keep WhatsApp.Step nine:Sleep the superior sleep of someone who is not on social media. Have dreams unvisited by random high school acquaintances and great-aunts with a penchant for doll collecting. Wake in a cold sweat with the realisation that you have no idea what is going on in anyone’s life.Step10:Meditate instead of scrolling. Ha, just kidding.Doomscroll on news sitesand gnash your teeth at the actual state of the world instead of the state of the teeth of your friend’s 15-year-old son who just got his braces off. Read a news article about tariffs. Put your phone down.Step11:Pick it up again. Is Goodreads social media? Rate the last 12 books you’ve read on Goodreads and go down a rabbit hole of analysing the reading habits of all your friends on Goodreads. Wonder how much of these lists are performative. Is it even possible to read Ulysses and Finnegans Wake in the same week? Decide that Goodreads is also social media and delete.Step12:Go for a run. Download the stats from your smartwatch for your run. Send to your running WhatsApp group and your mother instead of posting on social media. Your mother: “Are you OK? Why are you sending me your heart rate?”“I just wanted to share my run this morning.”“OK. Why are you suddenly texting me so much? Did you see the photos from your cousin’s wedding on Facebook?”Step13:Reinstall social media just long enough to look at wedding photos. You can’t like them because then people would know you’ve broken your break. Delete again.Step14:So many hours in a day! Write an article about quitting social media.Go back on social media to share the article you wrote in those 24 hours when you were actually productive because you took a break from social media.Eleanor Limprecht is the author ofWhat Was Left,Long Bay,The PassengersandThe Coast.

From being enigmatically abstract it became incredibly accomplished at portraying the human body – and soul.You can see this happen in the bustling yet harmonious crowd of pilgrims and gift-givers you meet about a third of the way through this ethereal and sensual show. Two horses bearing courtiers or merchants are portrayed in perfect perspective, their rounded chests billowing, their bodies receding. Around them a crowd of travelling companions, on horseback and foot, are depicted with the same depth. Their bodies and faces are full of life, in a frenetic pageant, a bustling carnival, yet this human hubbub is composed with order and calm.View image in fullscreenSpherical … a terracottaYaksis, from Chandraketugarh, India, about first century BCE.Photograph: CPA Media Pte Ltd/AlamyIt’s a Buddhist masterpiece, which helps explain the inner harmony: one of a group of stunning reliefs in this show from the Great Stupa of Amaravati, excavated in the early 1800s by the East India Company and now owned by theBritish Museum. A stupa is a domed structure holding Buddhist or Jain relics, perhaps modelled on prehistoric mounds, but this one was embellished in the first century AD with sublime pictorial art. Buddha himself stands further along the slender stone block, taller and more still than everyone else.The exact dates of Siddhartha Gautama, the teacher and seeker of enlightenment who became the Buddha, are unknown but by the time this work was created the movement he started was about 500 years old and spearheading one of the most influential renaissances in the story of world art. This exhibition gets to that artistic truth in an unlikely way. It doesn’t bother with the minutiae of stylistic change or dynastic history. Instead, it tells a passionate story about the three great religions of ancient India – Hinduism, Jainism andBuddhism– and their vitality across time. You meet practitioners of these faiths in Britain today, sharing their devotion on film. This is a wonderfully direct way to blast the museum dust off such ancient art – and when that dust clears, you get a much better sense of its living power.View image in fullscreenStunning … a limestone drum slab from Amaravati.Photograph: © The Trustees of the British MuseumHindu and Jain beliefs are older than Buddhism (far older, in the case of Hinduism) but it was after the Buddhist breakthrough in storytelling art that they too became brilliantly figurative. Is it crude to see this as competition? It was at the very least a dialogue. At first I mistook a display of beautiful Jain statues for Bodhisattvas, Buddhist saints. In fact, the slender swaying grace of these figures embodies the ascetic Jain ideal of universal compassion.View image in fullscreenNot just divine but lovable … a statue of Ganesha made in Java from volcanic stone, about AD1000-1200.Photograph: © The Trustees of the British MuseumYet the biggest, most spectacular artistic transformation was achieved by Hinduism. You can’t get a friendlier, more paradoxically human deity than the elephant-headed Ganesha. A statue of him in this show, dating from about AD1100 to AD1200, is a technical miracle in the way the artist fuses an elephant’s head with a human body – both precisely observed. But it’s the pathos that gets you, the artist’s intuition of the wisdom and sensitivity of elephants. Ganesha here is not just divine but lovable.Such moving, homely art is a long way from a black stone lingam, the older, aniconic Hindu representation of Shiva as a male tube being inserted into a female yoni. But sexual desire is a feeling too and the big difference between Christianity and the religions here is Indian sacred art’s embrace of the erotic. Statuettes and plaques that date from as early as 300BC depictYaksis, female nature spirits, with jewellery on their curvy bodies and the same spherical, bulging breasts that you see throughout the show. Female sexual and reproductive power are celebrated simultaneously in the art of all three great religions. Another relief from the Great Stupa of Amaravati portrays The Birth of the Buddha. Its main character is Gautama’s mother, Queen MahaMaya. She lies on a bed in a curvy pose, and gives birth in a posture almost as luxuriant.Your chance to stare down a god: inside the British Museum’s mesmerising look at Indian religionsRead moreGrowing up in a Protestant Christian church, I thought of religion as a taking away, a denial. Here it is an addition – human and elephant, spirit and body, dream and reality. Life infuses these religions: they don’t oppose themselves to it. That appetite for reality, as they attempt to make sense of the cosmos, mortality and desire, to find the dharma, must be what made India’s religions so exportable. Many of us don’t think of Buddhism as specifically Indian because it has spread so far so quickly. One of the most captivating works here is a silk painting of the Buddha set in a dreamworld of deep reds and greens, from a cave near Dunhuang, China, created in the eighth century AD. Nearby in the same final space is a statue of Ganesha from Java, one of the many places Hinduism took root.This is an exhibition with a true sense of mystery. Not just in the atmospheric way it is lit with coloured misty veils separating displays, or even the marvels you encounter such as a nagini snake goddess floating in the shadows – but in the way it worships life.Ancient India: Living Traditions is at theBritish Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsArt and designExhibitionsMuseumsBritish MuseumIndiaHinduismBuddhismreviewsShareReuse this content"

But there is a likeable lead turn from Mia Threapleton, an eerie visual and aural echo of her mother, Kate Winslet.The absurdly opaque and pointless “Phoenician Scheme” of the title is a plan by notorious plutocrat-entrepreneur Zsa-Zsa Korda (Benicio Del Toro) to dominate the economy of a fictional Middle Eastern nation with an interlocking series of mining transportation and fishing ventures, by using exploitative slave labour and moreover manipulating the agricultural market in such a way as to cause famine.Watch the trailer for The Phoenician Scheme.To this end, he has signed investment deals with various relatives and associates, including Marty (Jeffrey Wright), Cousin Hilda (Johansson), Marseille Bob (Mathieu Amalric) and his brother, Uncle Nubar, who may incidentally have murdered Zsa-Zsa’s wife and is played by Benedict Cumberbatch with a fierce beard and kohl eyeliner, like Rasputin in a silent film. His daughter is Liesl, a novitiate nun (Threapleton) and in true Michael Corleone style, it appears to be her destiny to take over the business despite not wanting to. The Norwegian family tutor Bjorn Lund (Michael Cera) is deeply in love with Liesl.But now the US government, in the form of Bobby-Kennedy-style buttoned-up apparatchik Mr Excaliber (Rupert Friend) tries to destroy the Scheme by driving up the cost of the “bashable rivets” on which the whole plan is predicated, and now Zsa-Zsa must close the profitability gap by touring around each of his investors to persuade them to accept less profit than they agreed … and so the films gives us a sketch of each wacky figure in turn. Meanwhile Zsa-Zsa, who keeps nearly dying in government-schemed plane crashes, has persistent visions of heavenly judgment from a God played by Bill Murray.View image in fullscreenAlexandre Desplat, Rupert Friend, Wes Anderson, Mia Threapleton, Jeffrey Wright, Benedict Cumberbatch, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Antonia Desplat and Bill Murray at the premiere of The Phoenician Scheme in Cannes.Photograph: Guillaume Horcajuelo/EPAIt rattles amiably along in that savant-child style that Anderson has made his own, but is in danger of becoming a mannerism. It is always entertaining, and delivered with the usual conviction and force but with less of the romantic extravagance than we’ve seen before, less of the childlike loneliness that has been detectable in his greatest movies.The Phoenician Scheme has premiered at theCannes film festivaland is released in cinemas on 23 MayExplore more on these topicsCannes film festivalWes AndersonBenicio del ToroMichael CeraFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The 69th edition of the contest was hosted in Basel, Switzerland.The win was Austria’s third in the history of the competition, after drag performer Conchita’s success in 2014 and Udo Jürgens’ win in 1966.Hey, what’s that sound: FalsettoRead more“It’s wonderful to have this victory, 11 years after Conchita,” said Micaela Taroni, an Austrian-Italian correspondent in Rome for the Austrian press agency APA. “JJ won because of his vocal qualities. He’s a countertenor, so reaches the high notes. He was an outsider, but one who encompasses musical modernity with Austria’s rich operatic tradition.”JJ, whose real name is Johannes Pietsch, won ahead of Israel’s Yuval Raphael, a survivor of the 7 October attacks by Hamas militants on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and took 251 hostage, and led to Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza in which an estimated 53,000 Palestinians have so far died.Israel finished second, having led for some time after a large public vote put them into the top spot.A s with 2024, Israel’s inclusion in the world’s biggest music competition, which was watched by more than 160 million people across the world, sparked protests. Demonstrations were held in Basel on Saturday evening and a Eurovision crew memberwas hit by paintafter two pro-Palestinian protesters tried to rush on stage as Raphael sang New Day Will Rise.A spokesperson for Israeli broadcaster Kan said Raphael was “shaken and upset” by the protesters.Many of the 200 protesters in Basel wore Palestiniankeffiyehscarves and carried signs stating: “No music for murder”, “Stop genocide” and “Singing while Gaza burns”. Some burned huge Israeli and US flags and others sent red and green smoke into the air, according to the AFP news agency.Pro-Palestinian marches were also held throughout the day in cities around the world in protest against Israel’s intensified bombardment of Gaza and its enforced blockades of food and other humanitarian supplies.In third place in the competition was Estonia’s Tommy Cash with Espresso Macchiato, a song poking fun at Italian stereotypes that both riled and enthused Italians.After being presented with his winner’s trophy in Basel, JJ thanked his voters and called for “more love” in the world. He said Wasted Love, which he co-wrote with Teodora Špirić and Thomas Turner, was intended to give listeners an insight into his deepest thoughts.JJ said: “There’s no wasted love. Love is never wasted. There’s so much love that we can spread around, and we should use love as the strongest force on planet Earth.”JJ’s success was applauded by the Austrian chancellor, Christian Stocker, who said the singer was writing musical history.Beate Meinl-Reisinger, Austria’s foreign minister, wrote on X: “Dear JJ, you have movedEuropewith your voice and sung Austria into the spotlight.”The Philippine consulate general in Frankfurt also issued a message of congratulations to JJ on Facebook. “What an incredible moment – Filipino pride on the European stage!” she said.Austria will host next year’s contest.

The semi-finals threw up some surprises. Australia, which has competed in Eurovision since 2015, surprisingly failed to qualify with Go-Jo’s innuendo-ladenMilkshake Man.There were still plenty of risque songs on offer, including Miriana Conte, who had to change the lyrics of her song Serving to remove a reference to the Maltese word for singing – “kant” – due to having an obvious resemblance to an English swear word. Despite it being a fan favourite, it scored poorly with the wider public.In Finland’s entry, Ich Komme by Erika Vikman, her song repeatedly announced that she was coming, and she ended her performance hoisted up on a giant gold microphone spraying out fireworks.Other outlandish props included Italy’s Lucio Corsi with an outsized piano and France’s Louane being covered with falling sand.Explore more on these topicsEurovision 2025AustriaEurovisionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s basically what Fifty Shades of Grey should have been.Pillion is adapted from the 2020 novelBox Hill by Adam Mars-Jones: a shy traffic enforcement officer falls for the ultimate dominant alpha male – an impossibly handsome, strong, emotionally impassive biker who casually demands complete domestic obedience in exchange for the privilege of being reamed with athletic vigour and thrilling lack of sensitivity, often in a specially modified wrestling outfit.Harry Melling, who becomes more impressive with every screen outing, plays Colin, a sweet, shy guy who lives at home with his mum and dad, Pete (Douglas Hodge) and Peggy (Lesley Sharp) who is in the final stages of cancer and who is always tenderly trying to set him up with dates. Heartbreakingly, Colin sings with his dad’s cheesy close-harmony barbershop quartet every Sunday in the pub in boaters and bow-ties.View image in fullscreenAlexander Skarsgard, director Harry Lighton and Harry Melling at the photocall.Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPAIt is here that he somehow catches the imperious gaze of leather-clad Ray (played with kingly and sexy entitlement by Alexander Skarsgard) who invites or in fact orders Colin to meet him behind Primark at 5pm for a blowjob. Soon Ray is requiring the gigglingly thrilled Colin to cook and clean and shop for him (though of course never permitted touch his motorbike) and sleep on the floor like a dog at his bland house in Chislehurst while Ray reads Karl Ove Knausgård’s My Struggle in bed.Colin – who symbolically rides pillion behind Ray – discovers in himself the ecstatic vocation of the sub. He shaves his head to fit in with Ray’s supercool biker compadres, which incidentally makes him look like a young Christopher Eccleston.But when does sexual role-play become dysfunction? Or coercive control? What does Ray do for a livjng? Is Ray an abuser? Colin’s sceptical mum Peggy actually finds a harsher monosyllabic word for him when Ray finally gets over himself and deigns to accept an invitation to Sunday lunch with this well-meaning elderly couple that he haughtily rejects in any capacity as his parents-in-law. Could it be that only Peggy is uncool enough to have seen through Ray and seen how dangerous the situation is? Or is she just another person who doesn’t get it? (And these uncomprehending people perhaps still include the besotted Colin himself.)It is a real love story, and the movie amusingly and touchingly takes us through the final stages and out the other side, to where Colin has grown or at any rate changed as a person who has come to terms with what he is and what he wants, the way that Ray clearly did long ago. His dad’s barbershop quartet sign off with a rendition of Smile Though your Heart is Breaking. It seems like the only possible advice.Pillion screened at the Cannes film festivalExplore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsAdam Mars-JonesAlexander SkarsgårdreviewsShareReuse this content"

Two decades on, creator Armando Iannucci and stars including Peter Capaldi and Rebecca Front lift the lid on its chaotic creationTim JonzeSun 18 May 2025 05.00 EDTShareTwenty years ago this month we were plunged straight into the middle of an omnishambles. It was a moment in time when petrified politicians lurched from crisis to crisis, scrambling desperately to control the narrative as their endless gaffes derailed even the vaguest attempts to change this country for the better. But am I talking about the tail-end of the Blair years or the televisual tour-de-force that was Armando Iannucci’s The Thick of It?It could be either. It could even be right now – such was the show’s prescient genius. This was a satire that didn’t just mimic the government’s calamities but seemed somehow to foresee them. Over its seven-year run,The Thick of Itcame up with farcical policies that the government went on to adopt (pet asbos, anyone?), coined new words in the dictionary (the aforementioned omnishambles) and, in Malcolm Tucker, created one of the great malevolent forces of British comedy. Here’s how they did it …Armando Iannucci, creatorThe idea for The Thick of It came after I’d done a 2004 documentary about Yes Minister for the BBC. I rewatched every episode and realised that all the topics it covered were still relevant: Europe, the threat of terrorism, austerity … everything! But I also noticed that the power dynamics had shifted. In the mid-Blair years it felt like it was less about the minister being thwarted by their senior civil servant and more about the ministers coming under constant pressure from No 10 and its enforcers to stick to the agenda.Adam Tandy, producerFor a while it was just called “Westminster-based Comedy”.IannucciI got in touch with politicos, ex-ministers, former civil servants, political journalists, insiders, outsiders. I said: “I’m not here for scandal, I want the boring stuff!” I wanted to know who gets in first, who’s last to leave, what is the relationship with civil servants, who would take a call from the Daily Mail? And the big revelation for me was how much the country was being run by 22-year-olds. Cabinet ministers were bringing in these junior spads because they thought they were so clever and bright but actually they were just confident. They’d never fixed a car or bought a house or really done anything complicated. Which is why you’d get a lot of these ideas that only sounded good on paper like “beacons of excellence” and “hospital clusters”.View image in fullscreenOffice politics … (from left) James Smith, Chris Addison, Rebecca Front, Peter Capaldi and Joanna Scanlan in The Thick of It.Photograph: BBCJamie Cairney, director of photographyArmando’s opening gambit was: this cannot be like a traditional BBC comedy. He wanted to forget all of the Hollywood drama conventions. One of his reference points was The News from Number 10, a documentary about Alastair Campbell which was really messy because everything’s running at a million miles an hour. And another reference point was [Danish drama] Festen, the first Dogme 95 film. He even said: “I want you to try and adhere to the Dogme 95 vows of chastity” – things like “cameras must be handheld” and “you can only use natural light”. Very anti-establishment stuff!IannucciBBC Four had a small budget, I think less than £100k. They said: what can you do with it? The constraints of the budget actually helped. It forced me to be quite experimental.Ian Martin, swearing consultantI was doing a satirical website with my brother Paul called martian.fm, and one of the things I wrote every week was this thing called Hansard Late. It was written in the style of the proceedings of the House of Commons, but it was also very sweary, like “I would respectfully ask the Honourable Gentleman to shove it up his cock” or whatever. I got an email saying: “Hi, I’m Armando Iannucci, your stuff makes me laugh, want to do some stuff for me?”. Obviously I thought it was a spoof!IannucciI wanted something that felt like you were eavesdropping on something you’re not meant to see. That’s how we came up with the title: you are really in the thick of it.Peter Capaldi, played director of communications Malcolm TuckerIt was hard to get any details about it. I asked if there was a script and they said no. That doesn’t give you very much confidence, does it? What are we supposed to do if you don’t have a script? Armando said just improvise. OK, well, I hated improvising because generally improvising means that the person with the biggest ego gets the biggest part. The only reason I hung on in there was because I really liked Armando’s previous work.Sarah Crowe, casting directorI’d worked with Armando before on Partridge and so whenever I’d see people try out for other things like theatre or commercials, I’d make a little note to say “Armando would like”. The cast came from all different places: kids’ television, theatre, standup … I’d even cast Alex McQueen, who played Julius, in an Utterly Butterly commercial! I’d seen Peter in a sitcom; it wasn’t a very good one, but I remember thinking he was quite Mandelson-esque.It felt guerrilla, like Armando was trying to get away with something the BBC wouldn’t necessarily have sanctionedJoanna ScanlanIannucciWe hadn’t written Malcolm as Scottish, we’d just written someone trying to keep his aggression in and then when he’s prodded too many times it bursts out. I actually had Peter down as a very gentle kind of soul, as he is in real life. But, as he tells it, he turned up in a bad mood that day.CapaldiI met Armando and Adam in a little studio in Soho. I was pissed off when I went in. It was not a good period for me. I’d gone to an audition atTelevisionCentre that morning for a little part and I knew everybody in the room. I thought, why am I going on tape with all of you people that I’ve worked with before?TandyWhen Peter came in, I think he was on the verge of giving up acting. We were running slightly behind schedule and Sarah Crowe, our casting director, actually had to pop out of the casting session to try to persuade him to stay.Sarah Crowe:Peter kept saying “I’m terrible at improvisation. I’m going to embarrass you, I’m going to embarrass myself. I had to really cajole him to come in. But he wasn’t alone in being reluctant. I remember someone actually walked out, saying “call me back in when you bother to write a script.”IannucciI said to Peter I will be a cabinet minister and your job is to persuade me to go … and then at some point just stop being nice. He did it and it was frightening. I thought: “There’s Malcolm Tucker”.CapaldiI remember very clearly the moment where I “got it”. The minister said: “Well, can I come back?” and I said, “It’s not fucking Coronation Street, you can’t come back!” I thought: Oh,that’swhat it is.IannucciPeter channelled Harvey Weinstein and lots of quite lippy LA agents. It wasn’t meant to be Alastair Campbell. It was more about this group I’d heard about called “the enforcers”. They would fan out from No 10 and go around the ministers saying: “This is the line, this is what you can say, this is not what you can’t say.”Joanna Scanlan, played director of communicationsTerri CoverleyAs I understand it, Armando invented the character of Terri after our audition. He hadn’t thought of her before so I must have talked myself into an entirely new character. Most of what I created as Terri was from when I worked at the Arts Council England. There were people there who’d move from job to job within the arts without ever understanding what it was they were trying to create.IannucciI saw Chris Langham do a docudrama about George Orwell and it was such a nuanced, humane, believable performance – but with this slightly hangdog feel to it. I thought he would be perfect to play the minister [Hugh Abbot].MartinArmando sent me the first three scripts for The Thick of It and said: “Look, just sprinkle your shit everywhere.” I didn’t know what to do. The writers were Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell and Tony Roche – massive, massive figures in the world of comedy. I just stared at the script for about half an hour thinking: “You can’t improve [Peep Show and future Succession creator] Jesse Armstrong!” Especially not if you’re some flailing wanker. The breakthrough was when I changed a line of Malcolm’s from “Don’t bother he’s fucking useless” to “He’s about as much use as a marzipan dildo”. I said: “Is that the sort of thing you’re after?” And Armando said: “Yes, very much so.”View image in fullscreenCommunication breakdown … James Smith, Joanna Scanlan and Chris Addison in series two of The Thick of It.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyScanlanI always got very frustrated because Terri had to have a blow-dry in the morning. And I’d be watching all these blokes [male members of the cast] descending on Armando as soon as he walked on the floor, like petitioning for their lines or ideas to go into something. I’d want to do the same but be there thinking: “I’m stuck in this fucking chair!” I felt really irritated by that.CairneyOn the first day of filming, Armando came over and said: “Move the camera more, make it more messy.” I thought I was being messy! So some of the messiness was deliberately overdoing it. It took us a few days to get there. Ben Wheeler, a brilliant DOP who was operating the other camera, turned to me and said: “Well, we’re never going to work again after this.”TandyI could only afford to give three and a half days to each episode. That’s not a long time to shoot half an hour. And so everything was shot in the old Guinness factory off the A40 in west London.ScanlanThe building was derelict. There was no funding. It felt guerrilla, like Armando was trying to get away with something the BBC wouldn’t necessarily have sanctioned.IannucciI wanted to try to lose all those traditional grammars of filming. So it was like a news crew turning up at a cabinet meeting. They’re not going to let you film it all again – it’s up to you to find the footage.CapaldiFilming is a very traditional process – you do a master shot and then the closeups. Armando threw all that out of the window. He said: “You come on to the set, it’s lit, you can go wherever you like, we don’t rehearse, off you go!” The cameras had to follow us. They didn’t have any preparation. They wouldn’t know where anyone was going. A scene would tend to go on for ages. When they said cut, you’d be exhausted. But it was a fabulous experience. I think all of us who worked on the show never looked back from that because that way of working was so radical.IannucciWe filmed it on the fly: handheld cameras, radio mics, no leads attached. I said to the cast: even if you leave the room we’re still recording you, we can hear what you’re saying, so you’re never off. There was nowhere to hide.TandyFor the first series I’d heard about a device that they’d been using in the States, this five-channel sound recording device. It meant we could mic up all of the actors and record all of the conversations happening in an office at the same time. That device was probably the thing that made The Thick of It possible.CairneyArmando would edit the sound first – the words were the most important thing for him. Then the editors would throw some pictures in and see what stuck with the audio. If you go through the episodes with a magnifying glass there’s some extremely bad continuity there. Hair will change, coffee cups will suddenly be refilled, but Armando didn’t give a shit about any of that. And nobody noticed which proved that it didn’t actually matter!We would float a policy and then literally the next week one or other of the parties would announce the same thingIan MartinCapaldiArmandowas great at finding these moments in the character’s eyes and faces that conveyed the chaos and the stress and delight of what they were going through.ScanlanBefore getting the role I had a Saturday job at an estate agency in Dulwich. My boss there told me one day that if I wanted to earn a bit of extra cash I could join these focus groups. She said: “You’re an actress, just say you are who they’re looking for! Say you’re a married housewife with three kids at Dulwich College or something.” So I went and did it and got my 50 quid. I mentioned the focus group to Armando. He was laughing and ended up turning the story into the second episode.MartinThere was this synchronous thing going on where we would float a policy and then literally the next week one or other of the parties would announce the same thing. I think how it happened was that the spads and the writers of The Thick of It were trying to work out the exact same problem: the money’s run out so what can we say that won’t cost anything but will sound good and keep us in the headlines?IannucciIn the first series there’s that scene in the back of a car where they’re trying to come up with policies on the way to make an announcement. We were actually in the back of the car going to the next location so I said: “Why don’t we just film you trying to come up with new policies?” Three of them which made it into the final cut actually became law within a couple of years! James Smith [who played Glenn Cullen] came up with “Why doesn’t everyone have to have a plastic bag of their own?” There was pet asbos, which I think happened quite soon after. And Chris Addison [who played Olly Reader] came up with the national spare room database, which became the bedroom tax. I remember James Purnell, who was culture secretary at the time, saying to me: “I’ve been in the back of that car”.TandyAfter the first two seasons, which were only three episodes each, Armando came to me with a plan to do an extended run. We got a commission to do 10 more episodes. And then it started to go wrong.View image in fullscreenGoing down? … Chris Addison, James Smith, Joanna Scanlan, Rebecca Front and Peter Capaldi.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIn November 2005, Chris Langham was arrested in connection with paying to access indecent and abusive images of children on the internet.Sixmonths later he was charged with15 counts of downloading indecent images of children.IannucciIt was difficult with Chris because he was charged but there wasn’t a trial. I decided to not make a judgment until there was a judgment. I didn’t realise the trial would take over 18 months. That’s why we did two one-hour specials where Hugh was referred to but wasn’t in it. But then he was found guilty so it became very clear.TandyWhen Chris was found guilty we had to recast. That’s when Rebecca joined us.Rebecca Front, played social affairs secretary Nicola MurrayThe first time I watched The Thick of It, I thought: “Blimey, this is good.” I didn’t know they were casting or even making another series. I had a conversation with Armando and he said they were going to do another and halfway through it I thought: “Hang on, is he offering me something?”IannucciNicola was the thing Malcolm hated the most, which was a minister who actually believed in something. Most of that third season was her ambitions being gradually whittled away.FrontThey didn’t know that much about my character at the beginning, just that they liked the idea of it being a woman and a backbencher who had been promoted beyond anyone’s expectations. And so one of the inspirations for Nicola Murray was very much me! Armando asked if I was politically minded and I told him that I had formed our sixth-form debating society. I actually did think of going into politics because I had really strong opinions about certain things like nuclear disarmament. Nicola is basically me if I’d had my life ruined by politics.It’s a stupid, macho, testosterone-fuelled environment. But these people wouldn’t last 10 seconds in an actual fightArmando IannucciIannucciThe show is a window into bullying culture. In several episodes Malcolm explicitly states that he is a bully. He pulls people apart. You wouldn’t be allowed to operate like that today. I’m sure it’s still highly charged and people shout at each other but I don’t think that single-minded, laser-like destruction of people’s personalities would be tolerated.FrontI’d never met Peter before. I knew him mainly as Malcolm Tucker. My first impression was of this charming, gentle man. I thought: “Oh, he’s absolutely gorgeous.” And then we did a little bit of improv and he immediately turned into Malcolm. It was terrifying. A total physical change.CapaldiDid I feel like I was scaring people? No, they all scaredme! They’d all been to Oxford and had been on telly for years. I was just a guy from bands in Glasgow who ate curries and drank lager.FrontIt’s weirdly easy to distance yourself from the script. You think: “They’re not saying that aboutme, they’re talking about Nicola.” However, I do remember improvising in a rehearsal room and Peter saying: “What are those fucking boots, you’re not a fucking cowgirl!” and me thinking, “Those are my actual boots, I only bought them last week!”IannucciDid we ever overstep the line? Actors came into it knowing that they were going to be in line for lots of visual takedowns. But we would check in case they thought: “No I don’t want someone saying that about me on national television.” Chris [Addison] was described as looking like a Quentin Blake cartoon … but I think he rather liked that one.FrontIt was easy to act terrified and cowed but nobody wants to see a woman being terrified by a bully. So I thought let’s see what happens if I stand up to Malcolm, and I think immediately it started to be funnier because it was no longer just Peter shouting at somebody. You want at least one Tuckering per episode, but that can’t be the whole relationship. So Nicola ends up constantly doing things that she knows will piss him off.CapaldiAll Malcolm’s doing is his job, you know? The idea that he’s monstrous … he’s horrible topeople, but he’s moving the government’s agenda forward.View image in fullscreenMad for it … Peter Capaldi and Chris Addison in series two of The Thick of It.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyFrontI hope people can sympathise with Nicola because she really gets trampled by it. She goes in with all guns blazing, but really by the end of her first episode she’s already been chewed up and spat out.IannucciA lot of junior spads see Malcolm as an ideal to aim for. But if you analyse any episode it’s always: something small happens that’s bad, then Malcolm comes in, makes it worse, and then leaves blaming everyone else. So how is he good in any way? It’s like when Dominic Cummings came in. People said he’s an amazing communicator and an amazing strategist … but the Covid crisis had no strategy and terrible communication.MartinSome of the lines you wouldn’t do now. They’re a tiny bit misogynistic and tiny bit homophobic. I was always a bit uncomfortable with that stuff.IannucciIt’s a stupid, macho, testosterone-fuelled environment, slightly thuggish. But it’s all verbal. These people wouldn’t last 10 seconds in an actual fight. They probably don’t even go to the gym because they haven’t got time. They just drink lots of coffee from 5am and shout … it’s a stupid and frankly inefficient way of working. And then when they all leave politics they all talk about mental health and do lots of charity work in big thick jumpers!ScanlanAt the beginning, before Rebecca came in, I was the only woman. I wouldn’t say I was frightened, but they were all a foot taller than me. I was on my own with these tall men and thinking: “How do I get heard in this world?” It did get quite aggressive and braying with that masculine energy. One day it went too far. People were throwing insults around that you just wouldn’t do in an office. Armando stopped the improvisation and said: “That’s not truthful.” He was brilliant like that.FrontOne of Armando’s great gifts is that he can push things a very long way and yet stay just the right side of it. It comes, I think, from him having a very strong moral compass. The joke always comes from the right direction.MartinI’ve always felt a bit sorry for Terri. I even remember apologising to Jo at one point. She was the butt of so many jokes. She was roundly criticised by everybody right from the very first episode until the very last one she appeared in. It was always “she’s fucking useless, I hate her” and everything. And yet she was no more incompetent than the people complaining about her.TandyI’d seen some Ofcom research that said that people were less bothered by swearing now than they had been. So I thought, well, it’s a digital channel, we’ll probably get away with it. We actually got very few complaints about language. So I’m glad I held my nerve.CapaldiI think because I’m from Glasgow the swearing came very naturally. Sometimes a “fucking” in the middle of a sentence can propel it forward with a new energy. But often I would swear because I couldn’t remember my lines. It would take a fucking minute or two for me to fucking remember the line that I fucking forgot. So I would be searching desperately for the line … and then it would fucking arrive!MartinI think the BBC quite liked the mythology of me being hired as a “swearing consultant”. The idea that they’d solemnly brought in this kind of craftsman of the swear. It did rankle with everybody else a little bit because they all did excellent swears, too.TandyThere was one occasion where there was a particular swear that was judged to be offensive and we were asked to make an edit quite late in the day. I think it might have been the word “gash”, which was replaced with the word “cave”. That’s sort of worse, isn’t it?MartinGreat swearing is all about getting the balance right. It’s no different to writing poetry, a novel or a stupid haiku. All the lines I loved were by other people. I loved “Tinker Tailor Soldier cunt” – that was a Simon Blackwell line.Arguably The Thick of It played a role in the de-escalation of respect for politiciansJoanna ScanlanTandySometimes it was awful. There was one episode where we had I think well over 100 uses of just the F word. That’s not including the other swearwords. But then they said: “Do you think you could take what you do with The Thick of It and turn it into a feature film?” We thought about it for about, I don’t know, 15 seconds. And then In the Loop came together within the next 18 months, which is very quickly for a feature film.IannucciIn the Loop made sense because The Thick of It arose after the invasion of Iraq, where everyone across the board at the time was saying: “This will be an almighty mistake,” and yet it went ahead anyway. I was intrigued as to why it is that someone can do that and get away with it and not be stopped, even though we’re in a democracy with an opposition and a kind of shared responsibility. So what’s happened that has meant No 10 can drive through anything it wants?ScanlanI loved our trip down to Eastbourne for the party conference in series three. That was my most enjoyable day. Which is ridiculous because I’m basically just saying I like going on holiday, which is very much what Terri would say.FrontMy favourite moment? I liked it when Nicola has a breakdown during the party conference. It was fun to film, actually. We established that, like me, she is prone to panic attacks … so it felt entirely honest that she would jump up and down on the cushions like that. I thought: “I know if I do this it will make Armando laugh.”TandyI remember when we did the inquiry episode, Armando and I basically arranged it so that only the people on the panel had the full script. They didn’t even get to meet the cast regulars, who were appearing as witnesses, beforehand.CapaldiI love the idea of playing husks. Malcolm loved his job, he was addicted to it. But I think when it’s all over and he’s in the back of the car after leaving the police station, he’s relieved that the shit is over. His last words to the press are “It doesn’t matter” … because it doesn’t matter! The world continues stumbling to oblivion irrespective of what he thinks.CairneyThat whole final scene was emotional to shoot. We got a closeup on Peter’s face and drove around for about 15 minutes thinking this would be an amazing shot to run really long. And in true Thick of It style, Armando cut it after about five seconds: “Malcolm Tucker’s done. Let’s move on.”View image in fullscreenState of play … Pearce Quigley and Peter Capaldi in series three of The Thick of It.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyTandyTo begin with, politicians were quite cagey about the show. Whenever you met them they would say: “Oh I don’t watch that thing,” but they absolutely did – they were able to quote you huge chunks of it!IannucciEd Miliband used the word “omnishambles” and David Cameron said the opposition were like “an episode of The Thick of It”. I thought: if politicians are now embracing this then it’s time for something else to start challenging them back.TandyI think it did have an effect on the Westminster bubble. I don’t know if it was a very good one, though, because I think it sort of normalised slightly loutish behaviour.IannucciDid it change anything? I don’t know. If it awoke people into thinking: “How can we change things?” then that would be a good thing. But 20 years on, it hasn’t exactly led to a better politics, has it?ScanlanIt was the last gasp of a time when there was still some respect for politicians. Arguably The Thick of It played a role in the de-escalation of respect for politicians.CroweIt was a defining career moment for some people and a reinvention for others.CapaldiAfter The Thick of It I realised that my voice had become more sinister. It got a bit lower, a bit stranger.MartinI’d had a miserable 90s, chugging along doing bits and bobs as a musician and journalist. The Thick of It absolutely saved me. It couldn’t work now. There’s no shame any more, is there? I mean, in the early episodes you had characters saying: “For God’s sake, please don’t tell me you’ve lied to a committee!” The idea that someone’s career could be at stake over a lie they told to parliament has no traction now. People do it all the time. Blatantly.IannucciHas it stood the test of time? I’ve never gone back and watched it. I’ve had people message over the years saying we should make a Brexit one or a coronavirus one … but we never did things around specific incidents. We set it in a parallel world where some of these things sort of happened but were bound up with things that were completely made up, so that it wouldn’t date.Peter Capaldi:People often ask if Malcolm’s going to move into podcasting. It might be good for him to do a kind of country podcast, actually, where he wanders around the countryside, meeting people he can’t fucking stand, like farmers.ScanlanIt’s a show that really appeals to 15- and 16-year-olds. They’ll say: “Are you Terri from The Thick of It?” So it’s given me a strange lifeline into youth culture.CapaldiThree people came up to me yesterday in Soho to say it was their favourite programme. I met Brian Cox [Logan Roy in Succession] the other day and he told me with great delight that people come up to him and ask him to tell them to fuck off. I didn’t like to tell him that I’ve been doing that for 20 years now.Explore more on these topicsThe Thick of ItArmando IannucciPeter CapaldiRebecca FrontTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Brevity, for one thing: five of the six are under 200 pages, and half barely pass 100. They are works of precision and idiosyncrasy that don’t need space to make a big impression. Themes are both timely – AI, the migration crisis – and evergreen: middle-class ennui; the place of women in society. And for the second consecutive year, every book comes from an independent publisher, with four from tiny micropresses. Ahead of the winner announcement on 20 May, here’s our verdict on the shortlist.Solvej Balle’sOn the Calculation of Volume, Book I(Faber, £12.99; translated by Barbara J Haveland) is easiest to introduce through the film Groundhog Day: its heroine, Danish antiquarian book dealer Tara Selter, is stuck in time. “It is the 18th of November,” she writes. “I have got used to that thought.” Each time she wakes up, it’s the same day again, same weather, same people passing the window.This book, the first of a projected seven volumes, mostly explores Tara’s set-up. Despite the cool tone, there’s a sense of excitement for the reader as Tara works out the possibilities in real time. Can she travel overnight? If she takes something out of a cupboard, will it return the next day? And are we all somehow like Tara, living the same day over and over? The high concept, and the sense of a major work under way, make it a strong contender. Even if future volumes don’t live up to this one, for now the reader is happy to be trapped alongside Tara.An even more ambitious headspinner is Japanese novelist Hiromi Kawakami’sUnder the Eye of the Big Bird(Granta, £14.99; translated by Asa Yoneda). If Kawakami has a sweet mode (Strange Weather in Tokyo) and a weird mode (Record of a Night Too Brief), this one is in the latter category. It’s a sort of do-it-yourself work: what seems to be a collection of stories turns out to be a novel, but the reader must piece it together. We’re hundreds of years in the future; countries have disappeared and humans are grouped into self-contained communities. Some people are clones, others exist in a world with hardly any men, and there are unexplained categories of people: “watchers”, “scanners”, “the mothers”. Characters recur across chapters and regions, but they’re too thinly drawn to easily tell apart.The flexibility of the prize – it’s not just for novels – is exemplified in Banu Mushtaq’s collection of stories, Heart LampBut that’s OK: this book is about its ideas, including how societies break down, how we doom ourselves with our failure to get along, and how AI threatens us. Given that human intelligence is so riven with conflict, the book suggests, we might be ripe for replacement by machines. (“Let’s wrap this up,” says one character of humanity.) Its mysteries mean that by the end, when we finally know what’s going on, the book demands rereading – a durability that makes it a plausible Booker winner.If Kawakami isn’t much interested in character, the opposite is true of French novelist Anne Serre’sA Leopard-Skin Hat(Lolli, £11.99; translated by Mark Hutchinson). Right from the start, Fanny is alarming young children and “had a way of standing […] like a question”. Her full-colour character is matched by the book’s askew narrative style, which jumps around a lot. Alongside Fanny is the Narrator, who is not the narrator of the book but her lifelong friend. “It was in slapstick mode they got along best.”We learn early on that Fanny died at the age of 43 (“her small, fair head ascends into the skies”), which gives the rest of the book – an account of her lifelong mental turmoil – added poignancy. The story teems with charm, a tribute to the unconventional and a warning of “the violence done to the tender-hearted” in our conformist society. Fanny’s friend seems to speak for Serre – who wrote the book following the death of her younger sister – when he says: “I love realistic novels, yet the moment I try to write one I yawn with boredom.” There’s no time for boredom in this delightful, sad, idiosyncratic story, though its unusual – even eccentric – style might limit its chances of Booker success.The other shortlisted French writer has a more grounded approach. Vincent Delecroix’sSmall Boat(HopeRoad, £12.99; translated by Helen Stevenson) is inspired bya real-life tragedyin November 2021, when 27 people died on an inflatable dinghy trying to cross the English channel from France. Most of the book is from the viewpoint of a French emergency call handler who fielded pleas for help from migrants on the boat, and who falsely told them no rescue vessels were available.Under investigation by police, our narrator is sometimes unrepentant (“these people … their obsession with flinging themselves into the water”), sometimes filled with shame. Why, she asks, is she blamed, rather than the geopolitical “gigantic storm that sweeps behind them”? Her somewhat repetitive monologue is broken by a vivid account from the migrants’ viewpoint, out on the “insipid, bulging, surly sea”, and the story ends with fitting grimness. Small Boat is undoubtedly timely, which may be why it’sthe bookies’ favourite; but as a novel it lacks the depth of other shortlisted titles, and seems a long shot for the prize.The most talked-about book on the shortlist is Italian writer Vincent Latronico’s PerfectionThe flexibility of the International Booker prize – it’s not just for novels – is exemplified in Banu Mushtaq’s collection of stories,Heart Lamp(And Other Stories, £14.99; translated by Deepa Bhasthi). The selection here is drawn from Mushtaq’s 35-year career. She writes in the Indian tradition of “Bandaya Sahitya” – protest literature against the domination of male-led, upper-caste writing – and her subject is the lives of women.In one story, a new mother whose husband is unfaithful and rude – “One day he had said, ‘You are like my mother’, and with those words had pushed her alive into hell” – is told to be grateful he doesn’t beat her. “Thank God you are in a good situation.” In another, a man becomes obsessed with making his wife wear his sister-in-law’s high-heeled shoes; elsewhere, a woman struggling with school holidays – Mushtaq’s concerns are universal as well as culture-specific – takes her boys to the barber to be circumcised. The tone varies from quiet to comic, but the vision is consistent, as exemplified by the final story, where a woman questions why God requires her to be a “helpless prisoner of life” in subjugation to her husband. Its title? Be a Woman Once, Oh Lord! This wonderful collection would be a worthy winner, though history is against it: stories have never taken the prize before.The most talked-about book on the shortlist is Italian writer Vincent Latronico’sPerfection(Fitzcarraldo, £12.99; translated by Sophie Hughes). You can see why, from its relatability – it’s the story of a modern millennial couple, Anna and Tom – to its literary connections: the book is a “tribute”, in Latronico’s words, to French writer Georges Perec’s 1965 novel Things. In both books, young professional lives have the constructed texture of an advert or social media stream, and are simultaneously given meaning and constrained by the need for possessions and cultural signifiers. Where Perec’s couple had Paul Klee prints and Borges paperbacks, Latronico’s have Monocle magazine and Radiohead vinyl.Written as a detached overview (“They lived a double life.” “They tried travelling”), Perfection exerts a hypnotic hold as Anna and Tom face anew the same problem as every generation before them: how to live? They tie themselves in knots, “worried they were content merely being contented”, and slowly find themselves no longer the focal generation of their era, as the world changes around them. “The cultural centre where old Greeks used to play cards was now the flagship store of a Japanese trainer brand.” Perfection packs a huge amount into a small space: its irony, modernity and irresistible style would make it a popular winner.The winner of theInternational Booker prizewill be announced on 20 May.Explore more on these topicsBooksBooker prizeFiction in translationInternational Booker prizeFictionAwards and prizesShort storiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The truth is extreme anxiety and extreme depression is isolating no matter where you are. You feel like an alien.”Die, My Love is based on Argentine writer Ariana Harwicz’s novel of the same name.It is Ramsay’s second film to explore the darker sides of motherhood, after her critically acclaimed 2011 feature We Need to Talk about Kevin, based on Lionel Shriver’s novel.View image in fullscreenLawrence and Pattinson with director Lynne Ramsay.Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPABatman star Pattinson, who became a father in 2024, said he was usually drawn to more abrasive characters than Jackson, but that the character’s struggles while coping with a partner’s mental health issues resonated with him.“Especially in postpartum, trying to deal with her isolation and trying to figure out your heart and your role in the relationship, it’s incredibly difficult, especially if you don’t have the vernacular,” Pattinson said in Cannes. “He’s not a mental health professional. He’s just hoping that the relationship will go back to what it was.”Contrary to the swirling horror of early motherhood portrayed in the film, Lawrence insisted having children had made her a better actor. “I didn’t know that I could feel so much,” she said. “My job has a lot to do with emotion … and they’ve changed me creatively.

Next to it is another West Country view, theromantic ruins of Malmesbury Abbeyin Wiltshire.Both show Turner’s interest inthe “theory of the sublime”that came to the fore later in his sea storms and mountain scenes. “It was all very conventional at this stage,” said Warrell, a Turner specialist. “But you can see he is ambitious.”A highlight of the exhibition is a series of seascapes that Turner painted as a much more mature artist in Margate, Kent.View image in fullscreenTurner’s Low Sun and Clouds Over a Calm Sea.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianWarrell said: “He’d been to Margate as a child because London was so polluted that his family sent him to school there, and then he went back again from the 1820s repeatedly.“He’d look out from his lodgings out on to the beach and see the sun rising and setting and the boats and all the goings on. Turner said the skies over Margate and that area were the best in Europe, better than the Bay of Naples. The more turbulent the weather … the happier he was.“All the time he’s experimenting. Some of these watercolours are very simple meditations. Some probably would only have taken him no more than half an hour.”Unlike the great Turner paintings such asThe Fighting Temeraire, which is viewed by hundreds of thousands of people every year, these pictures are from private collections and are rarely seen or reproduced.View image in fullscreenThe watercolours on display have been described as a ‘missing link’ between Turner’s conventional landscapes and his abstract later work.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThey show how he continued to play with and refine themes and feelings. A Steamboat and Crescent Moon was sketched in Margate in about 1845, seven years after he painted The Fighting Temeraire, but a squiggle of smoke harks back to the fiery funnel in the grand oil painting.“All the time he’s doing this, he’s training his hand and eye, coordinating, trying ideas that he might use,” Warrell said. “It’s bold and his colour is different to anybody’s work at that time. He doesn’t always use the widest range of colours but the yellows and blues are very distinctive. He’s trying to capture a moment or just the atmosphere of that moment.”Also featured in the exhibition are the artist’s contemporaries, including Thomas Girtin, who like Turner was born 250 years ago in 1775, and John Sell Cotman.The exhibitionruns from 23 May until 14 September.Explore more on these topicsJMW TurnerPaintingArtEnglandMuseumsExhibitionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Awakening is being presented in the Marche du Cannes, the industry market in the basement of the Palais du Cinema.The gala is not an official part of theCannes film festival. However, the Carlton hotel is one of the premiere sites of festival activity. The Guardian has contacted the festival’s press office to clarify whether Spacey will be granted the privilege of a red carpet appearance.In July 2023, Spacey was found not guilty of sexually assaulting four men after a four-week trial at Southwark crown court, in one of the UK’s most high-profile #MeToo trials. He was previously cleared of sexual assault charges in a 2022 civil lawsuit in New York.Since 2017, more than 30 men have accused Spacey of sexual assault or inappropriate behaviour, which led to Netflix shelving his biopic of Gore Vidal and removing him from the last season of House of Cards.Earlier this year, Spacey responded bullishly to remarks by the actor Guy Pearce, who reiterated claims that Spacey had behaved inappropriately on the set of 1997 film LA Confidential.Pearcetold the Hollywood Reporterthat Spacey “targeted me, no question”. He said he was “scared of Kevin because he’s quite an aggressive man”, before revealing that he had broken down in tears on learning of other allegations against Spacey in 2017.“We worked together a long time ago,” Spacey responded in a video, addressing Pearce. “If I did something then that upset you, you could have reached out to me. We could have had that conversation, but instead, you’ve decided to speak to the press, who are now, of course, coming after me, because they would like to know what my response is to the things that you said. You really want to know what my response is? Grow up.”Last week, the Cannes festivalbanned an actor from the red carpetafter it became aware of allegations of rape against him. And the festival’s opening day, last Tuesday, was overshadowed by the conviction of one of its most lauded figures, the actor Gérard Depardieu, on sexual assault charges.View image in fullscreenDepardieu in Cannes in 2015.Photograph: Thibault Camus/APOn Saturday, Sebastián Lelio’s musical The Wave had its Cannes premiere. The Chilean director’s new work was inspired by #MeToo-adjacent protests that shut down several colleges in Chile in 2018.News of Spacey’s imminent visit to Cannes was met with a muted response on the Croisette. “I used to love Kevin Spacey as an actor”, said Valèrie Guelminger, who was part of a throng of spectators waiting for stars to walk the red carpet. “But now I feel sad and disappointed, and I am not sure I would cheer him on if he walked by now.”“There are so many high-profile white men who could get an award like that, so why invite him?” said Stephanie Johns, 44, a Canadian screenwriter visiting the festival. “Couldn’t they get anyone else?”The PR guru Mark Borkowski, an expert in brand and crisis management, said Cannes and the French film world had for many years offered “a huge amount of support” for another controversial figure, Roman Polanski. “They have a track record,” he said.Borkowski said the award, which could be seen as “the film world taking Spacey back into their bosom”, was clearly a “very significant” moment.“It feeds into the slow battle Kevin Spacey has fought, which is to get his purpose back. His purpose and whole being is to be an actor and he is, without doubt, one of the most extraordinary acting talents of any generation,” he said.“He is not someone who has disappeared into the ether; he has fought it all the way and he has powerful supporters because ultimately he made a lot of people a lot of money.”In terms of brand management, Borkowski said the biggest issue was that people had “short-term memory loss and long-term amnesia”.“We move on from things. This [the Spacey award] shows that everyone has a shot of redemption; it shows that the further you get away from the noise of a scandal you can change the emotion of the crowd, right or wrong.”Big tech was changing the world, he continued. “A publicist’s job nowadays is not to convince an editor, it is to turbocharge the algorithm.“There are a lot of people who want to see Kevin Spacey back. I don’t have an opinion either way but ultimately, whatever he does next it will create clicks, it will create noise … you can’t be mediocre any more.”Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsGérard Depardieu#MeToo movementGenderKevin SpaceyShareReuse this content"

Just 11% of respondents described themselves as frequent users.Linguistic experts at the language learning software Babbel, which commissioned the original research, were so struck by their findings that they asked McLendon to give the 500,000-strong London Student Network a 10-question multiple-choice quiz on the semicolon. She found more than half of respondents did not know or understand how to use it.As defined by the Oxford Dictionary of English, the semicolon is “a punctuation mark indicating a pause, typically between two main clauses, that is more pronounced than that indicated by a comma”.It is commonly used to link together two independent but related clauses, and is particularly useful for juxtaposition or replacing confusing extra commas in lists where commas already exist – or where a comma would create a splice.It first appeared in the work of Italian scholar and printer Aldus Pius Manutius the Elder in 1494 but, despite its longevity, has long been marmite grammar.Lynne Truss, author of Eats, Shoots & Leaves, has castigated it as “dangerously habit-forming”. She added: “Many writers hooked on semicolons become an embarrassment to their families and friends.”Truss is not alone in her antipathy: Goosebumps, RL Stine’s classic horror series for children, has one semicolon for every 200,000 words. Cormac McCarthy used 42 semicolons in his first book, The Orchard Keeper – but then just one across his next nine novels. EL James was criticised for repeatedly using commas inaccurately instead of semicolons in her Fifty Shades trilogy.But the form of punctuation also has its staunch supporters: along with Charles Dickens, Mark Twain and Jane Austen, Abraham Lincoln stood strong on the issue. “I have a great respect for the semicolon; it’s a very useful little chap,” he said.Virginia Woolf relied heavily on the semicolon in her novel-length meditation on time, Mrs Dalloway; the book includes more than 1,000 to echo its hero’s flow of conscious thought.Nor could Salman Rushdie, John Updike and Donna Tartt have reached the literary heights that they have achieved without the help of an average of 300 semicolons for 100,000 words each.But to paraphrase the semicolon-supporting Twain, reports of “useful little chap’s” death might have beengreatly exaggerated: Google Books Ngram Viewer, which includes novels, nonfiction, and even scientific literature,showsthat semicolon use in English rose by 388% between 1800 and 2006, before falling by 45% over the next 11 years. In 2017, however, it started a gradual recovery, with a 27% rise by 2022.Perhaps, therefore, it will not be Vonnegart who wins out in the battle of the semicolon, but the rash, witty, louche Camille Desmoulins, as recreated by Hilary Mantel.In her novel A Place Of Greater Safety, Mantel imagined the politician, writer and best-known journalist of the French revolution having no doubts about it at all: “I wonder why I ever bothered with sex,” she quotes him as saying. ‘There’s nothing in this breathing world so gratifying as an artfully placed semicolon.’”Take our semicolon quiz1.Which of the following punctuation marks is a semicolon?\":;'Reveal2.Which of these sentences uses a semicolon correctly?The tourism bureau suggested that visitors purchase an all-inclusive travel pass; as well as download the travel app.The buses run from 6 am to midnight; the subway runs from 5.30 am to 12.30 pm.People who ride the bus tend to ride shorter distances; while people who ride the subway tend to go farther.Reveal3.Which of these sentences uses semicolons correctly?The company has offices in Glastonbury, Somerset; Preston, Lancashire; and Bradford, Yorkshire.Products in the catalogue include drill presses; routers; and belt sanders.Customers appreciate the durability of the tools; the speed of the shipping; and the responsive customer service.Reveal4.Which of these sentences uses a semicolon correctly?Heloise and Abelard’s correspondence is a window into 12th-century lives; whose details may surprise 21st-century readers.Charlotte, Emily and Anne Brontë wrote under masculine pseudonyms; not an uncommon practice for the time.Renaissance-era paintings show striking advances in realism and perspective; earlier paintings look flat and cartoonish in comparison.Reveal5.Which of these sentences needs a semicolon instead of a comma?The animal rescue, which is run entirely by volunteers, supports seven boroughs in Tyne and Wear.Nonprofit organisations may receive financial support from foundations, and they also can get government grants.Rural residents often must travel farther for services, it’s part of country living.None of these; they’re all fine.Reveal6.Which of these sentences needs a semicolon instead of a comma?The visitors wanted to try all of the local favourites, so they went to a market where food trucks gather.They tried street tacos, falafel, and even a cup of squid ink pasta.Everyone had a great time, in fact, they asked to go back again the next day.None of these; they’re all fine.Reveal7.Which of these sentences needs a semicolon instead of a comma?Taylor Swift brought a new group of fans to American football, however, not everyone welcomed the “Swifties.”David Beckham, who played for Manchester United, was a star even before he started dating Posh Spice.Manchester City fans suffered through decades with a mediocre-to-terrible team, so the team’s recent run of success has felt especially sweet.None of these; they’re all fine.Reveal8.Which comma should be replaced by a semicolon in the following sentence: To bolster their language skills, six students went to Berlin, four went to Barcelona to do an internship.After “skills”.After “Berlin”.Neither; both are fine.Reveal9.Which comma should be replaced by a semicolon in the following sentence: The organisation is looking to expand its clientele, moreover, it’s hiring 25 new employees.After “clientele”.After “moreover”.Neither; both are fine.Reveal10.Which comma should be replaced by a semicolon in the following sentence: After the rains, the city’s west side was covered in mud and debris, making several roads impassable.After “rains”.After “debris”.Neither; both are fine.RevealExplore more on these topicsLanguageShareReuse this content"

Now paintings, drawings and prints that he sold for a few pounds in the 1960s are being brought together for thefirst timein a new exhibition.John Kasmin, an art dealer who first recognised Hockney’s potential in the early 1960s when the artist was studying at the Royal College of Art (RCA), told the Guardian that Hockney’s prices then “rarely ever went above 20 quid”.He was selling works for as little as £5.Before setting up his own gallery, Kasmin began displaying Hockney’s paintings, prints and drawings from a back room of aLondongallery because his then boss did not appreciate them enough to exhibit them.View image in fullscreenComposition (Thrust), 1960.Photograph: Royal College of Art, London“Yet it wasn’t difficult to sell them,” Kasmin said. “He was popular straight away.”He first came across Hockney in 1961, when the artist was so short of money for paint and canvas that he had turned to the RCA’s printmaking department, which offered free materials.Kasmin, 90, recalls him as a shy young man: “We got on straight away. I’m only three years older than him.”David Hockney 25 review – so moving I had tears in my eyesRead moreHe went on to sell Hockney drawings for between £18 and £22 and to give him his first solo show in 1963 – a sellout exhibition with works priced at about £300 or £400.This month, Kasmin’s grandson, Louis Kasmin, is staging an exhibition of Hockney’s lesser-known early works. Titled In the Mood for Love: Hockney in London, 1960-63, it opens at Hazlitt Holland-Hibbert in London on 21 May.View image in fullscreenI’m in the Mood for Love, 1961.Photograph: David Hockney/Royal College of Art, LondonLouis Kasmin said: “Many of these [works] haven’t been seen publicly in decades. Some of them were bought in the 1960s and have remained with their owners. Some have travelled privately between collections and dealers without featuring in exhibitions.“As such, the works on display are the lesser known, but no less engaging, paintings from this period. For example, we have been fortunate enough to bring together the print The Hypnotist, the drawing study for the oil of The Hypnotist, and a painting called Figure Being Hypnotised. All three of these works relate to one of Hockney’s most famous paintings, which is hanging in theFondation Louis Vuitton Paris show, and have never been exhibited together.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His masterpieces include A Bigger Splash, 1967 – now in Tate Britain – in which he captured a shimmering turquoise pool under the intense light of the California sky.John Kasmin recalled that it originally sold for about £300: “If it sold now, it might be £100m.”Supported by theDavid HockneyFoundation, the Hazlitt Holland-Hibbert show explores “the making of Hockney, both the artist and the individual”.View image in fullscreenDavid Hockney’s Two Friends (in a Cul-de-sac), 1963.Photograph: David HockneyThe exhibition catalogue notes that these early works, leading up to his departure for the US at the end of 1963, represent a critical period in Hockney’s artistic evolution, bridging a gap between figuration and the burgeoning experimentation of the 1960s: “These pictures … are filled with expressive figures, often depicting intimate scenes from his own life, such as portraits of friends, lovers, and himself. At the same time, his early use of vivid, flat areas of colour and innovative compositions hinted at the direction he would later take with his famous series of California landscapes and swimming pools.”The paintings include Two Friends (in a Cul de Sac), 1963, which features two naked men and reflects Hockney’s exploration of his sexuality at a time when homosexuality was still criminalised in Britain. Louis Kasmin said: “Lots of them have annotated backs saying ‘£8’ or ‘£12’ or ‘£17’.”He added: “The works we have brought together have never really been hung side by side … Hockney’s shows often have a famous work or two from this period, but never a real survey.”Explore more on these topicsDavid HockneyLondonExhibitionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Those subtitles are extraordinaryLucy ManganSun 18 May 2025 17.05 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 17.07 EDTShareIt’s Rose Ayling-Ellis’s world at the moment – and we just live in it, which is proving to be a very nice thing for us all. In the three years since she left EastEnders she has: won a Stage Debut award and was nominated for an Olivier for her performance as Celia in @sohoplace’s As You Like It; taken part in two documentaries about deafness (she has been so since birth); starred in the excellent BBC thriller Reunion; was the central character in the first decent episode of Doctor Who there’s been in living memory; and is now the lead in the fine and fun ITV thriller Code of Silence. (She is also due to star in a forthcoming adaptation of Will Dean’s Dark Pines novel, and is developing her own comedy-drama about deaf women dating in London. No, I don’t know how she finds the time either.)But to Code of Silence. Ayling-Ellis plays Alison, an employee in a police canteen who becomes increasingly involved with an investigation into a violent criminal gang, whose members only meet outdoors in unbuggable locations. Plainclothes officers surveil them with hidden cameras, but back at the station all the official lip readers are busy on other jobs and unavailable to interpret footage of them talking. Enter Alison.Gradually and inevitably, she becomes more enmeshed with the investigation; at first at the team’s own behest and soon under her own steam as she begins working at the pub that the gang’s newest recruit, Liam (Kieron Moore), uses as his local. To the initial fury and then resignation of the lead detectives (Andrew Buchan as DI James Marsh, haunted by the death of a colleague for which he blames himself; Charlotte Ritchie as DS Ashleigh Francis, trying her best to keep her rogue non-agent from doing anything too wild), she starts accumulating information too valuable to ignore. She also starts falling for Liam, who seems to be a relatively reluctant member of the underworld. Although only two episodes were available for review, I spy a possible redemptive arc for the new guy. But we’ll see.View image in fullscreenReining in the rogue non-agent … Andrew Buchan as DI James Marsh and Charlotte Ritchie as DS Ashleigh Francis in Code of Silence.Photograph: ITV/PAAnd we want to see, too. There may be nothing much innovative about the basic plot – or the side story about Alison and her mother living under the threat of eviction by a company that has bought their estate for potential redevelopment, the financial pressures from which provide much of the impetus for Alison’s decisions – but the strength of the cast, and Ayling-Ellis in particular, carries things convincingly.There are also plentiful details, grace notes really, that evoke the reality of life as a deaf person. When Alison lip-reads from the feeds in the office, only partial subtitles appear at first, lacking mostly consonants, and resolve into words as Alison works out via common sense and context what they must be saying – so “o I bo ved a roun io” blurs, shifts and clears into “No, I moved around a lot” and so on. It’s a stylish way of showing the effort and leaps involved in lip-reading, when so many plosives (and ‘m’s) all look the same from the outside.Similarly, we see Alison stop watching a television programme at home because the subtitles are frustratingly slow to arrive. The assumptions of hearing people are gently dismantled at many points. When Liam asks if the music in the pub (where she likes it when people order one of the craft beers, because their odd names are easily identifiable) makes her job more difficult, she replies that it does, “but I like the beat”. On one particularly wearying day of simply dealing with the world, she sighs that she doesn’t want to be hearing; rather, “I just want them to be a little bit deaf. Really fed up with trying to prove myself.” The barriers to employment are not insisted upon but are clear from the joy and relief Alison has in securing the gig at the pub, and then by her (also deaf) mother’s need to find an interpreter who can accompany her to the training for the rare job she has secured. There are obstacles everywhere.It all gives a freshness, as well as an edifying aspect, to the underlying conventions. You can watch and learn – or at least newly appreciate an underacknowledged world – without being shortchanged on your entertainment at all. That’s quite a triumph.Code of Silence is on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

A gorilla-suited master of ceremonies pulls a curtain to reveal the New York band’s logo standing statuesque: scissors split wide open, blades curving into shapely legs. Amid a deserted jeep, retro payphone and broken highway, the metaphor is clear: the Sisters are a crash-landed UFO shaking up dusty Americana.More than twenty years after their self-titled debut album rocketed them from New York’s queer cabarets to household-name status in the UK, the band tumble from the shadows – effervescent frontman Jake Shears in bedazzled denim, cool-headed guitarist Del Marquis, and PVC-clad multi-instrumentalist Babydaddy – and the bawdy, stabbing synths of early single Laura pull a sold-out crowd to their feet.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Carsten Windhorst/Camera PressAn irreverent reworking of classic and glam rock, disco and psychedelia with a vinegary end-of-the-pier humour, the Scissor Sisters album is nine-times platinum in the UK, where the band’s freaky theatricality found a spiritual home. From the impossibly falsetto cover of Comfortably Numb to the spiky surrealism of Tits on the Radio, so powerful is the band’s magnetism that electropop legend Alison Goldfrapp performs as support, and disco queen Jessie Ware gallops from the wings to scream “Do it!!!” on a barnstorming Take Your Mama.With songs so evergreen, you might reasonably feel that the staging is … too much. Yet somehow a dizzying procession of animated penguins, elderly folk in VR headsets and the Tragic Clown from the Sims video game franchise makes these bone-deep familiar songs feel as absurd as when they first hit the charts.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Carsten Windhorst/Camera PressMissing from the spectacle is the arched eyebrow of founding member Ana Matronic, and the band wisely chose not to replace her. Instead, Bridget Barkan and Amber Martin join as a bawdy chorus line, and Martin’s thrillingly unpredictable rendition of Any Which Way is one of the night’s greatest highs.‘We were strapped to this babbling circus’: Scissor Sisters on their reunion, rightwing reactionaries – and riotous originsRead moreTwenty years ago the Sisters were pop aliens.

These are “incels”, who boast a coded vocabulary of hate and valorise male celibacy. That is, until a fourth man among them has sex. The opening scene is the morning after and the woman he spent the night with stands hovering behind his laptop.Cuckboy (Fiachra Corkery) and fellow incels Ghost (GoblinsGoblinsGoblins) Crusher (Jackson Ryan) and Einstain (Jimmy Kavanagh)are volubly and virulently anti-women. “Feminists have destroyed male and female courtship,” says one. But gradually they are shown to be desperate for intimacy, once the itch has been scratched by Cuckboy’s hookup with Margaret (Justine Stafford).First staged at the Edinburgh fringe last summer, this show about incel ideology, and what leads men to attack the opposite sex with such fulminating misogyny, has only grown in relevance. A black comedy by Dublin-based writer Jamie Sykes, who directs too, it takes the high-stakes decision to eke laughter from a culture based on hate andsometimes murderous terror. And on the whole it succeeds.Visually it has a ludicrous set up, the actors carrying cardboard frames in lieu of laptop scenes, which, when they glitch or are turned off, show characters comically frozen on the screen. The script sometimes elicits sympathy for these men, some of whom were terribly bullied boys once; all of whom are evidently lonely, inadequate outsiders. Their contempt for women turns your stomach but their loathing is turned inwards too, with graphic self-hatred, depression, and an almost fetished attitude towards suicide – although the drama does not go further into that darkness.It is at its best when it captures the men’s twisted sexual hunger. “Women,” they chant, and you feel their resentful yearning.View image in fullscreenAmusing dances of sexual frustration.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe actors give thoroughly fabulous performances, and the show includes breakouts of music and movement that archly reflect the men’s sexual frustration in dance, then turn into expressions of inner turmoil with wavy-armed Kate Bush-style emoting. These interludes are very amusing, but perhaps repeated too often to lessened effect.Margaret is too conveniently a journalist who wants to find out what makes these men tick. Also too conveniently, she makes all the intellectual counter-challenging arguments against inceldom, throwing the Magdalene laundries and Irish laws around contraception into the mix, as well as bringing in the story of her brother, too briefly. The men threaten to dox her and it is a potentially terrifying moment – especially in light of the misogynistic online threats that women all too often receive – but the danger here is too quickly neutered.The ending does not have the punch it might, yet this play is gripping, queasily entertaining, and shows clear signs of arresting originality. Skyes is definitely one to watch.At thePleasance theatre, London, until 31 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreInternetOnline abusereviewsShareReuse this content"

Glyndebourne’s first ever production of the opera, staged by Jetske Mijnssen, takes a dour approach, bypassing almost all the religious mysticism, and laces the rest of the story firmly into the stays of a Chekhovian family relationship drama.Ben Baur’s sombre sets and Gideon Davey’s buttoned-up costumes place us in a Catholic community around the time of the opera’s premiere, 1882. A quote from the Cain and Abel story, projected during the orchestral prelude, sets the tone. Mijnssen makes Amfortas and Klingsor into long-lost brothers, separated during a previously idyllic childhood when a fit of teenage jealousy over Kundry’s affections and his brother’s regard made Klingsor lash out with a whittling knife. We see this being acted out by the characters’ younger selves while Gurnemanz tells us the backstory in his mammoth Act 1 narration – a velvet-toned tour de force from the bassJohn Relyea.View image in fullscreen‘Less a wild spirit than a glorified housemaid’: Kristina Stanek as Kundry with Johansson as Parsifal.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe knights seem like lesser priests, wearing surplices to take communion before beating up the outsider Parsifal. Kundry is less a wild spirit than a glorified housemaid; the holy spear is a whittling knife, the grail an ordinary chalice – and, as much as the physical hole in his side, Amfortas’s rift with his brother is the real wound that refuses to heal. Parsifal’s dawning understanding of all this, helped by the vision of his dead mother that Kundry conjures for him, is what passes for heroism here.So there’s no faith in this production, and little magic too, save for the inspired touch of having Klingsor’s flower maidens as a sinister multitude of Kundrys. It’s no longer an opera about redemption – a big, abstract concept – but one about reconciliation, and that’s somehow a more slender story than the one Wagner wrote four hours of music for.View image in fullscreenJohn Relyea as Gurnemanz and Johansson as Parsifal.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAnd yet the production is redeemed by the fact that those hours of listening are so well spent. The conductor Robin Ticciati elicits a gleaming, flowing orchestral performance from the London Philharmonic, one that is supportive of an excellent cast – and hearing them in such an intimate theatre as this is special. Relyea’s tireless Gurnemanz is the outstanding performance, but Audun Iversen’s Amfortas is profoundly affecting too, alongside Kristina Stanek’s rich-toned, lithe-voiced Kundry, Ryan Speedo Green’s energised Klingsor and Daniel Johansson’s innocent but incisive Parsifal. John Tomlinson is as magnetic as ever as Titurel, a major figure in this production – he’s on stage for 80 minutes before he sings a word, and he’s riveting.Would Wagner have recognised this as his Parsifal? Maybe not. But it’s moving on its own terms, and it sounds wonderful.Until 24 JuneExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicGlyndebournelive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

It is in the eight marimbas lined up across the stage, which add a South African bounce to Bertolt Brecht’s 1939 epic of the thirty years’ war. It is in the operatic songs, all lush harmonies and pulsing percussion. And it is in the vocal effects of the large cast, adding birdsong or insect rhythms to the battlefields. Sometimes it is in the crackle of a plastic bottle to suggest fire, the shuddering boom of a drum to indicate an execution, or the grind of hands across metal for machine-gun fire.All of it is generated by the actors, much like the set, by the ensemble with Janet Brown and Eve Booth: a resourceful collection of corrugated iron, wooden pallets, old tyres and buckets. It gives Mark Dornford-May’s production an in-built theatricality: each performance created anew.But suddenly the noise stops and the silence is piercing. The moment comes when Paulina Malefane’s no-nonsense Mother Courage faces her greatest threat. With heavy irony, it is not the conscription of her first son (Brodie Daniel), the execution of the second (Joseph Hammal), nor even the rape and mutilation of her daughter (Noluthando Boqwana-Page). All those she regards as the cost of doing business; collateral damage in the pursuit of profit as she buys and sells from the back of her cart to the highest military bidder.View image in fullscreenLush harmonies … the chorus.Photograph: Keith PattisonNo, what sucks the air out of her is the outbreak of peace. No war, no trade, no noise.Billy Elliot writer’s new play swaps West End for church hall in County DurhamRead moreThe respite is temporary, of course. Neither war nor capitalism can rest for long. But the icy silence is a highlight of a gutsy production, filleted down to an economical 90 minutes by playwright Lee Hall, whotranslated the play for Shared Experiencein 2000, and marking the welcome debut of Ensemble ’84, a company drawn from the environs of Horden, a former mining village in County Durham overlooking the North Sea.In collaboration with Johannesburg’s Isango Ensemble, the actors are forthright and physical, building a sense of community not just in the makeup of the newly formed company but in the implication that war, like money, draws every one of us helplessly in.AtHorden Methodist Churchuntil 24 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreBertolt BrechtCounty DurhamreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s rare to hear such a frenzied response to new songs but it establishes the mood for an evening during which the LA rapper’s most recent work, from 2024’sChromakopia, is received with the same level of adoration as old favourites. And he runs through the album almost in its entirety.Performing solo on stage to a backing track, he bounces giddily but gracefully across the vast space. The bass frequently hits outrageously hard throughout the evening, shaking the building’s foundations, such as during the grinding charge of Noid. While effective, the frequent bass drops do sometimes kill some of the detail in the music, as well as perhaps overcompensating for the lack of live instrumentation.View image in fullscreenBy the midpoint, things get cosy and intimate as an unmaskedTyler, the Creatorwalks a huge floating catwalk to a stage made to look like a living room. He takes his shoes off and flicks through a box of vinyl before picking out his own LPs and placing them on a turntable. Yonkers and Who Dat Boy absolutely detonate the room, with the latter track spawning huge circle pits in the audience as bodies pinball around inside. This section, while conceptually neat, can feel a little passive at points, with Tyler not always singing fully over the shortened songs, and it coming across more like a DJ set, or as though he is curating a mixtape of his own life’s work in real time.Tyler, the Creator: Chromakopia review – early midlife crisis triggers a freaked-out psychodramaRead moreHowever, he leans further into performance during the final run. His impassioned, raspy delivery of Thought I Was Dead is remarkably raw and his flow is both fluid and furious.

The crash and its immediate aftermath is harrowingly well realised – there’s minimal dialogue, just the same stunned, horrified incomprehension that the first responders must have felt. The atrocity soon becomes a political football as British and US law enforcement bodies have to work together. But it’s ultimately a story of loss; the emotional toll taken on the relatives of the victims and the town of Lockerbie is never forgotten.

This offering is similarly striking, starring Rose Ayling-Ellis as Alison, a deaf woman working in a police canteen whose expertise in lip-reading catches the attention of detectives. Before long, she’s indispensable – but that comes with risks. The occasional confusion caused by Alison’s deafness is cleverly written into the fabric of the narrative and becomes a source of tension and intrigue.PHScandinavia With Simon Reeve9pm, BBC TwoAnother understated but fascinating journey with Simon Reeve, whose travelogues have become essential viewing thanks to his ability to connect the intimately personal with the expansively geopolitical.

Too flight-shaming. But when I announced this year’s jaunt – a week on the mid-section of the Reading-to-Bristol canal – eyes rolled in horror. As the departure date loomed, I panicked. How would we survive in such a minuscule space? What if the lack of activities drove us to spend even longer on our phones?View image in fullscreenAfter a two-hour drive from London, having stopped to view the Avebury stone circles, and then the world-famous flight of locks at Caen Hill, we arrived at Devizes in Wiltshire – and our extremely narrow boat fromFoxhangers. Eyes rolled (again) as we realised that two of us would have to sleep in the kitchen: our frighteningly long, skinny boat had two bedrooms with foldaway double beds, and a galley kitchen where two single beds could be cleverly folded into a rudimentary dining table. Thankfully, there were two (very bijou) bathrooms.The sun dropped over the horizon in a blaze of pink and tangerine, a heron landed on the roof of our boat – and the world fell away“You can go home if you want,” I sighed, fully expecting a hurried exit to the train station. Three hours later (after a quick “driving” lesson from the man at Foxhangers),having grappled with locks, swing bridges and steering 21 metres (70ft) of boat, all six of us squeezed on deck with a bottle of local rosé. The sun dropped over the horizon in a blaze of pink and tangerine, the green-gold hills rolled into the distance, swans drifted past, tiny fish jumped, a heron landed on the roof of our boat – and the world fell away. That night we slept like the dead.View image in fullscreenThe writer and her family enjoy a canalside picnic.Photograph: Annabel AbbsOver the next few days, the world fell further and further away. We puttered along at three miles an hour, stopping to take walks beside the River Avon, or to explore the astonishing Dundas and Avoncliff aqueducts. At nightfall, we ambled the towpath, crossing ancient bridges and venturing up overgrown footpaths into the Bath valley, or chatting to other moored boaters. Narrowboat residents are famously friendly. We regularly fell into conversation with our neighbours, many of whom lived permanently on the canal and would spend their evenings cooking over a campfire, tending their rooftop gardens, or lovingly repairing their boats. This, we decided, made for more interesting “viewing” than any TV show.Our first mooring was at Hilperton, where we discovered Wiltshire’s answer to London’s legendary Petersham Nurseries restaurant in Richmond, but at a fraction of the price.Avonfield Kitchen, situated in a garden centre, makes delicious and extravagant brunches and cakes, including the best chilli eggs we’ve tasted.At Bradford-on-Avon, we explored the 11th-century SaxonChurch of St Laurence(apparently one of the UK’s most important Saxon buildings), the beguiling 15th-centuryChapel of St Mary Tory(a one-time hermitage for weary pilgrims), theTithe barn(one of the UK’s largest medieval barns) and the localmuseum, which features the original interior of a Victorian pharmacy. All were free to enter.View image in fullscreenThe Saxon church of St Laurence in Bradford-on-Avon.Photograph: Craig Joiner Photography/AlamyWe also stocked up with books atEx Libris(whose barn boasts 6,000 second-hand books) and browsed the boutiques and craft shops along The Shambles, a series of old pedestrian shopping streets in the heart of Bradford-on-Avon. Best of all, we discovered our all-time favourite bakery,Pipit, where we returned repeatedly to buy almond croissants and the house sourdough loaf – which we paired with goodies from the tiny but perfectCheese Shop.We then chugged to Avoncliff, where we encountered kingfishers, an ancient water wheel pumping station, and an unbeatable menu at theNo 10 Tea Garden, which we left with copious boxes of assorted cakes. By this point, each of us had had a go at steering. It wasn’t as easy as it looked: one daughter managed to clip another boat, while I inadvertently stranded the barge across the entire width of the canal, where it wedged itself into the bank and had to be rescued by a team of Duke of Edinburgh’s-award rowers (average age: 14). Happily, The Husband loved steering and did it effortlessly.My worries about excessive screen time proved unfounded. Canals, I learned, often have poor reception, so our phones rarely workedOur final mooring before turning back was Sydney Gardens on the outskirts of Bath. Here, we hired bikes and cycled the disused railway track that runs from Bath to Bristol. Later, we visited exhibitions atThe Holburne Museumand theVictoria Art Gallery, ate the juiciest imaginable sandwiches atGreen Street butchersand munched on flavoursome cinnamon and cardamom buns atLandrace bakery.

Canals, I learned, often have poor reception, so our phones rarely worked. A word of advice: if you’re after a digital detox, choose a signal-poor waterway (according to the Canal & River Trust, more rural and hilly areas are less likely to have good coverage, with the Llangollen, Trent and Mersey, and the Middlewich branch of the Shropshire union canal being markedly patchy). When we did get a signal, our phones felt too bright, too fast, too demanding, toomodern. Instead, we read, tried to steer, fed the ducks, watched the beady-eyed antics of our resident heron, chatted to passersby, and played games – all from our tiny deck.A narrowboat holiday usually means returning along the same stretch of water. Normally, this would have elicited groans of horror and boredom. It didn’t. Instead, books were swapped and plans made to revisit our favourite spots. “You’re not missing your phones?’ I asked, baffled.View image in fullscreenEntering Bath“No,” said my daughter Bryony, who is usually welded to her iPhone. “Weirdly, being on a narrowboat seems to have given me permission to switch off in every way.” “Scrolling is for when you’re on your own,” added my daughter, Imogen. “But this boat’s so small, we’re never, ever alone.” And then my son Hugo (who had just read an unprecedentedtwonovels), chipped in: “Anyway, you can’t use your phone if there’s no signal.”Here’s what I think: the gentle, soothing monotony of a canal had taken away all desire to show and share on social media. Its calm tranquillity had slowed our minds to such an extent we no longer wanted the digital glare of modern life, and we certainly didn’t want our gloriously languid days broken by a litany of horrible headlines. All of which is to say, a canal holiday may well be the perfect and most painless of digital detoxes.

Easy to perfect, and here’s how …Felicity CloakeSun 18 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 18 May 2025 08.01 EDTShareAl limone(no translation needed) is perhaps the perfectprimofor this time of year, when we’re still waiting for the produce to catch up with the temperatures. The zesty citrus sings of the south, of heavy yellow fruit against a blue Mediterranean sky, while the butter gives just enough richness to make up for any chilly spring breezes. As Nigella observes, this is a dish that can “equally offer summer sprightliness or winter comfort”.The pastaAlthough I happen to agree withDaniel Gritzerwhen he writes on Serious Eats that “a satiny butter sauce like this pairs better with fresh noodles”, I wouldn’t turn down Catherine Phipps andNigella Lawson’s dried linguine, norRachel Roddy’s dried (or fresh!) tagliatelle in her second book, Two Kitchens, nor even theRiver Cafe Classic Italian Cookbook’s dried pici. (Pici, Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers explain, “is a handmade pasta, made with plain flour and water, which is only found in Tuscany” – though bucatini, they allow, may be substituted). Though I find spaghetti and linguine the most satisfying to slurp, this selection suggests that just about any long noodle, fresh or dried, is acceptable here. (I note that Ali Slagle uses a short ribbed shape, such as penne or gemelli, in herone-pot pasta with ricotta and lemon for the New York Times, but that seems to me to be a slightly different beast.)The lemonView image in fullscreenRachel Roddy’s take on the classic features a thick sauce that manages to be ‘soothing and vital at the same time’. All thumbnail pictures by Felicity Cloake.Most recipes I try use both the aromatic zest and the zingy juice of the lemon, with Gritzer explaining that “a small dose [of juice] will add a subtle tart counterpoint to all the richness, while allowing the aromatic oils from the lemon zest to remain prominent. More juice will punch up that brightness and also steal some of the spotlight from the zest.” When, as well as how much, you add makes a difference, however; while the oils in the zest, released by grating, can withstand a certain amount of heat, the flavour of lemon juice is much more delicate. So, like Gritzer, I’m going to add it right at the end of cooking – he, Lawson’s How to Eat and Roddy all recommend adjusting the quantity to taste, depending on how punchy you’d like the dish, which seems sensible given that lemons vary so wildly in size, juiciness and acidity (Bee Wilson recently conducted a small surveyand found that a rocca imperiale Calabrian lemon yielded twice as much juice as a supermarket version, though it was also four times the price. As a consequence, she writes: “I’m starting to see that there is really no such thing as ‘the juice of a lemon’. There is only the juice of this lemon or of that lemon, each with their own specific perfume, their own pattern of dimples on the skin, their own juice waiting to be discovered under the layer of pith.” She, like the late Russell Norman, favours Amalfi lemons, though you may be relieved to learn I tested this recipe using the common or garden supermarket variety, unwaxed but also ungenerous of juice, and can confirm they will very much do here.)The River Cafe, whose lemons come from a Tuscan garden, uses just the juice for a more straightforwardly tangy result without the sweeter, more complex perfume of the skin. And while that approach has its merits, it seems a bit of a shame, in a dish that ought to be all about the lemon, to neglect this part of it.The dairyThis is where the recipes I try diverge, because every recipe I try has a different approach to balancing the sourness of the lemon juice. InNorman’s book Brutto, he calls the “principle of the sauce close to carbonara”, and with a similar egg and grated cheese base. Roddy and the River Cafe’s versions, meanwhile, remind me more ofcacio e pepe, in which olive oil, grated cheese and pasta cooking water are beaten together to produce a thick sauce that Roddy describes as “surprising” in that it manages to be “both soothing and vital at the same time”. Both are delicious, but the overwhelming flavour is of cheese, rather than fruit and, while I certainly would never complain about too much cheese, I’d like the lemon to be the dominant flavour note here.View image in fullscreenThe cream Katie Caldesi adds to her pasta al limone reminds Felicity of ‘lemon-flavoured yoghurt’.Lawson’s recipe puts me in mind of a less traditionally Italian carbonara-style sauce using egg yolk and double cream, which coats the pasta beautifully and works better, my testers and I decide, thanKatie Caldesi’s cream-only version in her (excellent) Italian Cookery Course, which one tester reports reminds them – not unpleasantly, mind – of a “lemon-flavoured yoghurt”. I laugh, but I know what she means: the combination of cream and lemon zest has a tendency, even with Caldesi’s generous hand with the cheese, to suggestpossetsand the like.Indeed, Gritzer goes as far as to decree that dairy “mutes lemon flavour”, taming its natural zing into something much quieter and more soothing, which is why he opts for a butter and pasta water emulsion instead. This allows the flavour of the lemon to sing, an approach also favoured by New York chef Frank Prisinzano, whotold America’s Test Kitchen in 2023that the “limone dishes I’ve had on the Amalfi coast are actually made with cream, and I didn’t like it that way. I thought it was too heavy. So I started playing around with making a pasta water and butter emulsion with the spaghetti in the pot. The spaghetti acts as a whisk, and it creates an actual beurre blanc – which is a French sauce – but it beautifully coats the noodles.” (Prisinzano, finding lemon zest “too strong”, simply adds the squeezed lemon shells to the pan to release their aroma, suggesting the presence of a more refined palate than I can boast.)The cheeseAlmost everyone uses parmesan in startling quantities (Caldesi warns readers not to skimp on it, because “the lemon needs the cheese to counteract its sharpness, so scatter liberally”), but I reckon the cleaner, saltier, more acidic flavour of Norman and the River Cafe’specorinoworks much better, if you have some on hand – though I’d guess most hard Italian cheeses would do the job.View image in fullscreenThe River Cafe’s addition of pecorino works much better than parmesan.Gray and Rogers use two sorts: fresh and aged Tuscan pecorino – the first, a moist, semi-hard cheese, to beat into lemon juice to create a “thick, lumpy sauce”, and the second, drier and more forceful in character, to season and garnish. I won’t be using cheese as the base of my sauce, so I’ve gone for the aged pecorino alone. This has the added benefit of being much easier to find in the UK, but, that said, the flavour of the younger cheese is a lovely pairing with the lemon juice, giving the dish an almost yoghurt-like freshness.The extrasI like the perky flavour and colour that Caldesi, the River Cafe and Norman’s basil brings to the dish (though you may prefer Lawson’s flat-leaf parsley). Roddy reports that she has on occasions also added rocket, while Phipps, in her book Citrus, suggests asparagus, which would be a nice nod to the seasonal produce we have in abundance right now (I suspect that frozen peas, always in season, would also be a good bet).View image in fullscreenDaniel Gritzer’s pasta al limone adds garlic to proceedings, which is ‘gilding the lily’.Gritzer adds garlic, which is gilding the lily; this should be all about the lemon, with a supporting cast of butter, to enrich the sauce and salty cheese to season and thicken it.

When it opened earlier this year, the place was invite-only, but has since relaxed its door policy to allow anyone who fancies the first-floor bar for ale, martinis and toasties or the set menu by a former River Cafe chef on the top floor. Nothing is more likely to rankle decent, upstanding Guardian readers than the notion that the Fat Badger was once invite-only, and in Notting Hill, land of the frittered trust fund, too! “Eat the rich!” said Jean-Jacques Rousseau, apparently. Well, he’d have to find them first, because they don’t make that easy here. This badger is tucked away above the much-laudedCanteenon Portobello Road, and access is down a side street via what seems more like the goods entrance.Head up two sets of stairs, and the Fat Badger’s pub and dining room are elegant, olde-worlde, wood-panelled and candle-lit. It’s all completely charming, of course, but crucially – and this is by no means a dig – and, despite the acres of hype becauseMargot RobbieandJamie Dornanhave been spotted here, it’s also nothing remotely groundbreaking. In recent years, a new breed of London pubs such asthe Heroin Maida Vale,the Devonshirein Piccadilly,the Knave of Clubsin Shoreditch and now the Fat Badger have been selling gen Y the concept of “going to the pub” as if it were a deliciously edgy, new thing. People mill around, drink booze and talk! In real life! When the place opened, there was even talk that, gasp, they were selling single cigarettes behind the bar, to take to the smoking area. All the glorious grot that was once so commonplace is being rebranded as the epitome of decadence. That said, by the time I got round to visiting last week, those single ciggies were no longer available, no doubt because some miserable snitch had said it might be illegal.View image in fullscreenThe Fat Badger’s nettle soup is ‘as thick as a puree’ and served with homemade soda bread and ‘glorious’ salted butter.The food in the upstairs dining room, meanwhile, is really very good, which you’d maybe expect with the likes of George Williams (ex-River Cafe) and Beth O’Brien (Ballymaloe Cookery Schoolgraduate) at the helm. That comes with one caveat, though: this is a no-choice menu. That’s not to say it’s a fancy, itsy-bitsy tasting menu; instead, this is a hearty, meat and two veg with doughnuts for pudding-type set menu. Even so, there’s no real warning of what’s on offer – it’s a secret, again – and it’ll cost you £85 a head.We were asked what we liked and didn’t like, and if we had any allergies. That was followed by a steady stream of, on the whole, delicious things that would delight even the most uppity eater. A soupçon of nettle soup, as thick as a puree, with fresh Irish soda bread and glorious salted butter. Then some gorgeous lobster in a light tempura served in a “taco” made of thinly sliced celeriac.View image in fullscreenThe main event at the Fat Badger features rare beef fillet with morels, bearnaise and hasselback potatoes.Salty trout belly on charred toast was intriguing rather than yummy, but a chunk of grilled pigeon on toast was earthy and rich. More trout appeared, this time chopped with olives into a fresh paté to smear across that salty bread. If the Fat Badger has gained an early reputation as something of a party palace for the Notting Hill set, that sells the cooking here very short.Next up on the mystery menu was a generous portion of scallop in a lobster gravy studded with fresh peas and pork jowl. The scallop was seared yet still yieldingly soft and the peas tasted as if they’d only just left their pods. Produce here clearly comes first.View image in fullscreenThe Fat Badger’s apple doughnut with apple sauce and ‘wonderful, calories-be-damned’ apple crumble ice-cream.Anyone worrying that a secret menu of this kind might throw up a few curveballs would breathe a sigh of relief to see that fillet of beef with hasselback potatoes is the main event, with large chunks of rare beef, strewn with at least a dozen fat morels, a whole heap of potatoes and a steaming pan of warm bearnaise sauce. The clientele that night was almost 85% huddles of posh, thin, joyless women discussing society wedding calendars, but then it was a Tuesday evening in May in west London, so what else would you expect?Dessert was a huge portion of strawberry and basil sorbet, which challenged my belief that basil in a sorbet is nothing but an annoyance: it really worked here and was promptly inhaled. A freshly made sticky doughnut with apple sauce and a delightful spherical mass of apple crumble ice-cream rounded things off, with the crumble worked in flaky chunks through the rich vanilla ice-cream. The Fat Badger may have been sold to me as one of the naughtiest new places in London, but I think this wonderful, calories-be-damned ice-cream was easily the lewdest part of the entire evening.The Fat Badger is immensely likeable, and they’ll now let you in even if you’re not famous (or friends with them).
