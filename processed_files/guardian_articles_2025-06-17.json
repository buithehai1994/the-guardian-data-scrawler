Summer heatwaves are so frequent, they’re stretching the bounds of what we think of as summer. Hot-and-bothered home working and sweaty, sleepless nights are now alarmingly common.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Fans sell out when the mercury rises, so get ahead of the pack by ordering one in anticipation: there will always be another heatwave. Get a good fan, and you can also dodge the temptation of air conditioning. Air con is incredibly effective, but it uses a lot of electricity … and burning fossil fuels is how we got into this mess in the first place. Save money and carbon by opting for a great fan instead.Fans are much more energy efficient than air con. A typical portable air conditioner uses 1000W of electricity, which would cost about 26p an hour to run from 1 July, when theenergy price cap changes to 25.73p/kWh. The fans I tested used between 8W and 60W; my favourite, the AirCraft Lume, used 18W on its top setting. You could run it on max for 56 hours, and it would still use no more electricity (money, carbon) than a single air con unit going for an hour.I tested 14 fans of all shapes and sizes, so you can pick the best one for you. I tested them for size, noise, power use and, of course, how much they cool you down. I also tested a few “evaporative coolers”, which use water to cool the air blowing at you while using significantly less energy than air con.At a glanceBest fan overall:AirCraft Lume£129 at AirCraftBest budget fan and best desk fan:Devola desk fan£49.99 at DevolaBest tower fan:Dreo Cruiser TF518£89.99 at AmazonBest travel fan:Morphy Richards Air Flex USB fan£39.99 at Morphy RichardsBest evaporative cooler:Swan 5-litre Nordic air cooler£69.99 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI’m an award-winning consumer tech journalist with decades of experience testing gadgets. I’m also a menopausal woman in her 50s who honestly can’t remember the last time she felt cold: I think that might be why we gravitate towild swimmingin middle age. Oh, and I have a degree in engineering. So I’m triply qualified to put these fans through their paces, scientifically and subjectively.How I testedView image in fullscreenAn anemometer was used to measure the air speed each fan generates on its top setting.Photograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianI chose 14 fans, each from different brands, aiming for a mix of new and highly rated models plus a few stellar bargains. I wanted to make sure there was something for everyone before I put them through their paces.I used a power meter to measure how much electricity (and therefore money and carbon) the fans use, an anemometer to measure the air speed they generate on the top setting, and the Sound Meter app to measure the noise on the top setting (they were all too quiet to register on their lowest).I measured everything from 1m away, although in reality, you’ll probably position a tower or pedestal fan farther away and a desk fan closer to you. That means the noise a desk fan makes matters more.I also measured them myself, as sometimes the official specs can be misleading or wrong. For example, I measured a tower fan that was supposedly 17cm wide, only to find that wasn’t including the base. Here I’ve stuck with each fan’s largest dimensions, including their footprint.I used a thermometer to measure the impact of the evaporative coolers I tested, and took note of everything from how cooling each of the fans felt, how annoying the noise was and how good the controls were. I also considered how they looked and how small they packed away, as well as the price tag.All the fans that weren’t returned to the manufacturers were donated toFurnishing Futures, a charity that furnishes the empty social homes in which women and children are placed after domestic abuse.The best fans in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianBest fan overall:AirCraft LumeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£129 at AirCraft£119 at AOThis pedestal fan was hard to fault, with an elegant design that boasts a dimmable backlight (three brightness levels or you can turn it off, all with the remote control). It’s billed as height adjustable, but rather than scooting up and down, you can remove the bottom pole to convert it into a 63cm desk fan. There’s an LED display and touch controls on the front, and other features include a 12-hour timer and a sleep mode. In fact, of all the fans I tested, this one is probably the best for sleeping: alongside the sleep mode, it is the best for low noise relative to wind speed.Why we love itI loved the AirCraft for many reasons. It’s light but with a reassuringly heavy base, giving it Weeble-like stability: it’s difficult to knock over. It packs away pretty small for the winter because the pole comes apart. I also liked that the packaging is almost plastic-free.It oscillates both horizontally and vertically, so it can circulate air nicely around a whole room. Most importantly of all, this fan can really shift air – its 5.9m/s (metres a second) was the best on test, and you can really feel it. When the heatwave hits, this is what you want. All for a reasonable price, too.It’s a shame that …there’s nowhere to stow the remote control when it’s not in use.Style:pedestal (or desk)Dimensions:37 x 28 x 95cm (WDH)Number of speeds:12Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:55dBPower use on top setting:18WAir speed on top setting:5.9 metres per secondBest budget fan and best desk fan:DevoladeskfanView image in fullscreen£49.99 at Devola£49.99 at AirconCentreThis affordable desk fan punches well above its weight, with good features and powerful airflow. It has a display, touch controls, a remote, a timer and sleep mode. You can choose vertical oscillation (90 degrees), horizontal oscillation (80 degrees) or use both to circulate the air in a room. Not bad for a humble desk fan.Why we love itIt’s a bargain powerhouse, producing a substantial wind. I measured an air speed of 4m/s, which was one of the best on test. It certainly felt cooling.I couldn’t hear the Devola on the first three of its nine speeds, and even when the noise got louder on higher settings, it wasn’t too annoying.It’s a shame that …the display is on the base facing upwards, so you can’t see it unless you’re nearby. There was no instruction manual in the box, either, although I found it straightforward to use.Style:deskDimensions:30 x 21 x 31cm (WDH)Number of speeds:9Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:50dBPower use on top setting:16WAir speed on top setting:4.0m/sBest tower fan:Dreo Cruiser TF518View image in fullscreen£89.99 at Amazon£109.99 with wifi voice control at B&QThis tower fan is slim but striking in black. Features include 90-degree oscillation, a 0- to 12-hour timer, a sleep mode where the fan speed decreases gradually, and an auto mode that adapts the fan speed depending on the room temperature.Why we love itAt full blast, the Dreo felt positively windy and was definitely cooling on a hot day. On the two lowest settings, no sound was audible, but I could still feel a gentle breeze. I also liked the recess at the top-back that makes it easy to carry with one hand.It’s billed as a “25dB silent bladeless fan”, but I measured 60dB on top whack from a metre away. The sound wasn’t too annoying, though, and the fan’s powerful cooling made it forgivable.It’s a shame that …its energy consumption is relatively high. We’re talking pennies in electricity, but still, energy efficiency is good. Also, there’s nowhere to clip the remote control.Style:towerDimensions:32 x 32 x 106cm (WDH)Number of speeds:9Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:60dBPower use on top setting:29WAir speed on top setting:3.6m/sBest travel fan:Morphy Richards Air FlexUSBfanView image in fullscreen£39.99 at Morphy Richards£39.99 at RymanThis is the fan you can take with you anywhere. I don’t mean to fan yourself by hand: it folds down small and it’s cordless and USB rechargeable, so you can be the smuggest person on the train and a very happy camper on a hot day. It can also give you a breeze on a still day on the patio. The battery will last from four to 17 hours, depending on fan speed. And you can plug it into a laptop at your desk or even apower bankfor more juice.Why we love itThe 2.6m/s air speed can’t compete with the big fans on test – but it’s not trying to. It’s an electric fan that can go anywhere, folding down to a cylinder measuring 18 x 18 x 12cm. You can even hang it on the wall, if you wish.There’s no timer or sleep mode, but there’s a “nature mode” that varies the speed to mimic a breeze. And it does oscillate (to 90 degrees). It’s also quiet: I couldn’t hear it on the first of its three speeds, and it was never loud enough to be annoying.It’s a shame that …air speed dips slightly when it’s not plugged in, but only slightly (2.5m/s instead of 2.6m/s)Style:deskDimensions:18 x 18 x 22cm (WDH)Number of speeds:3Remote control?NoPeak noise level on test:35dBPower use on top setting:8WAir speed on top setting:2.6m/sBestevaporative cooler:Swan 5-litre Nordic air coolerView image in fullscreen£69.99 at Swan£69.99 at AmazonThe air speed may not be great, but this Swan model is still a good buy because it’s an evaporative cooler, meaning it uses water from its five-litre reservoir to cool the air it blows at you. It can be used as a regular fan, too. Evaporative coolers are much more energy-efficient than air conditioning, so they use much less power (and therefore less carbon, assuming you’re not on a renewable tariff or producing your own electricity).Why we love itOf the two evaporative coolers I tested, this worked the best. I could see the temperature on the thermometer go down: it cooled by more than 1C in less than 30 minutes. And it felt like a cooling breeze. In fact, it felt a bit like air con.I just filled it with water, but it comes with two ice packs that you can pre-freeze and throw into the reservoir for even colder results.The breeze felt wide, rather than focused. This is a question of personal taste: some people want a powerful fan that’s focused to blast just them, while others prefer a room-filling breeze. In oscillating mode, it’s wider still, as the grille at the front rotates, which is a bit hypnotic. It’s good-looking, too, in a coffee-coloured oatmeal or grey finish. It’s light and on casters, so easy to move around, and its modes include normal, natural, sleep and timer.It’s a shame that …you can hear the water in the pipes: it sounded like a leak. You might even find yourself needing the loo.Style:towerDimensions:29 x 24 x 71cm (WDH)Number of speeds:24Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:45dBPower use on top setting:26WAir speed on top setting:0.9m/sThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianLevoit classic tower fanView image in fullscreen£71.99 at AmazonBest for:a quieter tower fanThis produces a narrow beam of air, so you need to point it at you just right or set it to oscillate (90 degrees). It’s billed as a “20dB silent tower fan”, and it’s inaudible on the lowest four of its 12 speeds, but it was considerably louder at top whack.It’s good-looking, and I liked the space in the back to stow the remote control. There’s a 12-hour timer and a sleep mode, too.It didn’t make the final cut because …for the same price, the Dreo is more powerful, which is what you need on a really hot day.Style:tower;dimensions:29 x 29 x 92cm (WDH);number of speeds:12;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:50dB;power use on top setting:40W;air speed on top setting:1.7m/sVortex Air Pro PlusView image in fullscreen£159.99 from Vortex AirBest for:style, and its all-in-one heater and fan designVortex Air bladeless fans look modern, very Dyson-esque, and this one comes in 10 colour combos. It’s useful year-round, too, doubling as a fan heater. But it’s hard to categorise: too short for a tower fan, too tall for a desk fan.There’s a timer and it oscillates horizontally (71 degrees) and vertically (180 degrees), though it’s hard to imagine why you’d want to point it completely down. The touch controls are at the base, which isn’t very practical if it’s on the floor, and the display was a bit hard to see.It didn’t make the final cut because …I found the noise a bit annoying; I could hear it at levels 2-10.Style:tower;dimensions:25 x 24 x 65cm (WDH);number of speeds:10;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:35dB;power use on top setting:28W;air speed on top setting:2.9m/sHoneywell10-litre evaporative air coolerView image in fullscreen£74.99 from AirconCentre£79.99 at B&Qskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Its swing mode moves horizontally, and you can manually move the grilles to angle the air up or down. It’s on casters, too.I liked its large (10-litre) water capacity and how quiet it was, but the fan wasn’t strong enough, and the evaporative mode wasn’t cold enough. I tried it several times, and in half an hour, it never managed to cool the area in front by a degree.It didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t cool the room down enough.Style:tower;dimensions:31 x 30 x 75cm (WDH);number of speeds:3;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:30dB;power use on top setting:39W;air speed on top setting:1.8m/sShark TurboBlade TF200SUKView image in fullscreen£249.99 at Shark£250 at ArgosBest for:pointing in two directions at onceThis bladeless fan’s unusual T-shaped design has arms that stick out left and right, each putting out air, or you can turn them by 90 degrees for a tall, thin fan. You can angle each arm independently, good for pointing at two people. It’s height-adjustable and can oscillate (180 degrees) horizontally too. I liked that the remote attaches to the top with a strong magnet.It’s powerful, but the sound is very annoying: it sounds like a vacuum cleaner, and I wanted it to stop. It also used the most power on test; even still, a 60W fan costs less than 2p an hour to run at the current energy price cap, so it’s pennies compared with air con.It didn’t make the final cut because …I hated the noise it makes.Style:pedestal;dimensions:80 x 30 x 78-95cm (WDH), or 124 x 30 x 114-130cm in vertical mode;number of speeds:10;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:35dB;power use on top setting:60W;air speed on top setting:3.1m/sDuux Whisper Flex 2View image in fullscreen£179.99 at Duux£179.99 at AmazonBest for:smart controlsThis took quite a bit of assembly, but it’s good-looking, can be converted into a 54cm-high desk fan by removing a pole, and the tech is clever too. You can control it with an app or by voice (Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant) to set up to seven schedules. There’s an optional battery and charging dock to make it cordless.It’s fairly quiet and oscillates well, vertically and horizontally, but I found the standard controls annoying. The display on the base points upwards, so it’s hard to see from across the room, and you have to point the remote very accurately at it.I did like the compostable packaging. But unusually, it drew far too much power (2W) on standby. Less than 1W is the norm.It didn’t make the final cut because …of the annoying controls.Style:pedestal;dimensions:34 x 34 x 92cm (WDH);number of speeds:30;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:40dB;power use on top setting:9W;air speed on top setting:3.1m/sVonHaus air circulator desk fanView image in fullscreen£49.99 at VonHaus£64.99 at The RangeBest for:room-filling breezeThis desk fan has a display and touch controls on the front. And it oscillates well: it turns 90 degrees vertically, 80 degrees horizontally or both together to create a room-filling breeze. I couldn’t hear the lowest five of its 12 speeds, either.It looks good, and the controls are easy to use. Features include a one to 12-hour timer and a sleep mode that decreases fan speed every 30 minutes through the night.It didn’t make the final cut because …I liked the Devola desk fan even more, but this is a solid buy too.Style:desk;dimensions:30 x 21 x 36cm (WDH);number of speeds:12;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:45dB;power use on top setting:13W;air speed on top setting:2.7m/sDyson Cool CF1View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£249 at John Lewis£249.99 at DysonBest for:looks and designYou can see a lot of thought has gone into the CF1’s design. Not just its simple, circular air multiplier, but every single detail. The display is small but very readable. The oscillation (15, 40 or 70 degrees) works well. The magnetic storage on top for the remote control is clever. The controls work well and let you easily set the timer and sleep mode.I couldn’t hear this bladeless fan on the first six of its 10 speeds, and I found the noise easy to live with even at higher speeds.It didn’t make the final cut because …the price is hard to justify. Money no object? Go for it!Style:desk;dimensions:36 x 16 x 55cm (WDH);number of speeds:10;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:35dB;power use on top setting:20W;air speed on top setting:2.9m/sMeaco Sefte 8in portable air circulatorView image in fullscreen£79.99 at MeacoBest for:acordless fanThis is an impressive, new cordless desk fan with a battery life of four to 17 hours, depending on fan speed. I couldn’t hear the first seven of its 12 speeds. It oscillates and you can manually point it up or down, and features include a timer, night and eco modes. Its three-year warranty is a bonus, too (most have two).Overall, I liked it. It’s good-looking and pretty strong, although it’s weaker when cordless; for example, air speed dropped from an impressive 4.6m/s to 3.1m/s when I unplugged it. Still, if you want a desk fan that can sometimes be cordless, it’s a good buy.It didn’t make the final cut because …the USB-powered Morphy Richards is even handier.Style:desk;dimensions:26 x 20 x 38cm (WDH);number of speeds:12;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:55dB;power use on top setting:10W;air speed on top setting:4.6m/sBlueair ComfortPure 3-in-1 T20iView image in fullscreen£299 at AmazonBest for:hay fever and allergy sufferersThis is also a fan heater (so it’s useful all year round) and an air purifier (ideal for allergy sufferers). It cleans the air in a room in 12.5 minutes or a small house in an hour, removing airborne particles such as pollen, odours, dust and smoke.On test, it created a good breeze, even though the anemometer only read 0.8m/s. And on cooler days, it can send purified air upwards instead, circulating air in the room as well as cleaning it.The controls and display are on top, making them hard to see from across the room. But there’s an app and Alexa control as well as a remote. The three-year warranty is nice, too.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s expensive as a fan (but great as an air purifier).Style:tower;dimensions:24 x 24 x 50cm (WDH);number of speeds:4;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:35dB;power use on top setting:21W;air speed on top setting:0.8m/sWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenFor personal comfort, simply point a fan towards you.Photograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianWhatis a bladeless fan?Bladeless fans aren’t magic; they just don’t have visible blades. The work is done inside the body of the fan, and then air is pushed out of a nozzle. The Dyson, Vortex Air and Shark above are all bladeless. They look modern and are easy to clean. And there are no moving parts on show, so zero chance of getting your hair caught.What does oscillation mean?Most fans oscillate (move back and forth) by swivelling on their base, and some let you select how wide an the angle you want. If it’s just for you, pick a narrow angle; if you’re cooling the whole office, go wide. Some fans achieve the same effect in other ways, such as by moving louvres. And some oscillate up and down too, so the fan can circulate air all over the room to create a gentle breeze.What’s sleep mode?Most fans have a sleep mode, where every 30 or 60 minutes the fan lowers its setting until it reaches a certain point. This is a good compromise that helps you get to sleep without wasting energy, minimising the risk of waking up in the middle of the night suddenly cold.Start by lowering the fan speed to the point where you don’t find it annoying. In fact, some people find the white noise of a fan helpful at bedtime. Then use sleep mode.The best sleep aids recommended by experts: from blue light-blockers to apps to help you napRead moreWhere is the best place to position a fan?For personal comfort, simply point it towards you. The cooling feeling is because the moving air from the fan displaces the warm, humid air near your skin, which in turn helps your sweat evaporate, cooling your body down. It’s like a breeze rather than a still day. Or why it feels colder swimming in a river than in a lake, even if the water temperature is the same. Evaporative coolers, of which I’ve included two above, use water to actively cool the air.Never place a fan up against a wall because there needs to be air flowing into the back. If the air’s cooler outside, put the fan in front of an open window or door to bring in the cooler air.How much does a fan cost to use?I’ll set out the maths. For each fan here, I’ve measured its power use on the top setting, in watts (W). Electricity costs are in kilowatt hours (kWh). If, for example, you were using a 30W fan for five hours, it would use 150Wh. Divide by 1,000 to convert it to kilowatt hours: 0.150kWh.The energy price cap for 1 July to 30 September 2025 is 25.73 pence per kWh. Multiply this by the last figure and you’ll discover it will cost just under 4p to run that fan for five hours. Or £14 to run it for five hours every day for a year.Running fans is pretty cheap, then, and a good fan will keep you cool enough to dodge buying any kind of air conditioning. An evaporative cooler is a good alternative to air con. The two I tested used 26W (Swan) and 39W (Honeywell), so they use less than 3% of the electricity of a typical portable air conditioner (1000W). The effect isn’t the same: you can’t turn your bedroom into a fridge. But you can cool the air enough to make a big difference when there’s a heatwave.Do I need air conditioning?If you’re in the UK, honestly, no. It’s tempting to turn your bedroom into a walk-in fridge on a hot day, but fans are great and use much less electricity (and therefore money and carbon) than air con. Unless you’re on a renewable tariff, electricity use accelerates climate breakdown.Caramel Quin is ajournalist specialising in consumer technology.

Nice Kemi. Kind Kemi. Collaborative Kemi. All the Kemis that don’t usually see the light of day. A press conference with Chris Philp and four parents and survivors of child sexual abuse exploitation gangs. A moment of calm. Of reflection. A time to put the victims back where they always should have been. Front and centre. It was nice while it lasted.Maybe it was an act of partial atonement. During her reply to Yvette Cooper’s statement to the Commons on the Casey report on Monday, Kemi had turned the occasion into one that was all about her. Not a hint of apology for any failings for which she and previous Conservative governments might have made. The victims and survivors were just collateral damage in her fight with Labour. Her sole focus Keir Starmer’s refusal to grant a national inquiry six months earlier. Her tone tin-eared at best. Many of her Conservative colleagues looked on in embarrassment.“This is not a time for party politics,” Kemi said in her opening remarks to a small group of journalists. Better late than never. But we were still no closer to understanding why Monday had been exactly the right time for party politics and Tuesday wasn’t. Nor would we find out. If Kemi is capable of self-reflection she keeps her findings to herself. She is thoroughly old school with her emotions. Never explain. Just keep going.After a few introductions, Kemi handed over to the families and survivors. Marlon, Fiona, Teresa and Lucia. Their testimony was both powerful and moving. And brave. It takes guts to speak out. Their stories were all depressingly similar. Of boys and girls whose cries for help went unheard. Whose safety was ignored by police and social workers who didn’t want to rock the boat. Survivors who were blamed for their own exploitation. Widespread cover-ups.For the first question from the media, Kemi more or less held it together. Held the line. Remember to be kind Kemi. Thank the families and survivors. Maybe even look them in the eye. Make them think that they are the main focus of this presser. Yes, she would be happy for the inquiry to go wider into Westminster and Whitehall. It must go where the evidence leads. No one who was complicit should be exempt.Then things began to unravel a little as a Sky reporter observed that the cover-ups had been going on for years, during most of which theConservativeshad been in power. So maybe some kind of apology was in order. Could she just maybe whisper a sorry? Or if that was too hard, then merely mouth the word? A sorryette.No. Hear that? No. She wasn’t sorry for anything. None of this had been anything to do with her. Even though she had once been minister for children. Suella Braverman and Sajid Javid had been heroes throughout. The Tories had never put a foot wrong. The families and survivors looked on in silence.“Er … You didn’t offer an apology,” said a BBC journalist. Now Kemi started to get notably brittle. She had said sorry sometime in the past. She couldn’t remember what it was for or who it was said to, but it would have to do. She wasn’t going to say sorry again. Now wasn’t the time for politicians to apologise. She seemed to be unaware that she had spent most of the previous day angrily demanding that the Labour government apologise. I guess she doesn’t consider Starmer to be a proper politician. “Apologies are easy,” she snapped. Though not for her.It didn’t get any better. ITV wondered if she was as keen to investigate the Tories as she was Labour. Kemi side-stepped that one. Why should she be? The Tories had done nothing wrong. Did she regret her tone on Monday? Of course not.Elle ne regrette rien. Cue another pile-on to Labour for the imaginary crime of not voting for a Tory amendment that would have killed the child safety bill.View image in fullscreenFor most of the press conference, the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp (right), had kept quiet.Photograph: Lucy North/PAFor most of the press conference, the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, had kept quiet. It was possible he also had his reservations about his party leader. So he had just sat silently. Nodding with compassion. Trying to look decorative. Trying to look like a man who cared. But come the end, he just couldn’t help himself as the topic moved to his favourite subject. Small boats crossings. “The lack of control at the border is fuelling the risk here,” he said. They should be locked up on sight.For an object lesson in personal responsibility, you had to look elsewhere. Specifically to a Westminster committee room, where Louise Casey, the author of the report, wasgiving evidence to the home affairs select committee. Here was the humility of someone capable of not just asking other people the hard questions, but herself too. She wasn’t one to give herself a free ride. She didn’t take shit from other people and she didn’t take shit from herself.“I was surprised to be asked to re-engage with the child sexual exploitation scandal,” she said, having authored the original report into the Rotherham gangs. “But I soon came to see it was the right thing to do. I found myself asking whether I had done a good enough job. Where had I been when the abuse continued? Did I do enough, given everything she had known? We know it’s still going on.”You won’t find that kind of integrity – that visceral, unsparing self-examination – from many others. In Westminster they prefer to shift the blame elsewhere. Further down the food chain. Yet to realise that an apology can be an admission of strength. Not of defeat.Casey went on to list her demands. A thorough inquiry that was done quickly. One that didn’t duck the difficult questions. One that rooted out abuse in every city. Where the data was used professionally. To show no fear. It was a big ask. But someone has to step up. So it might as well be her.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchKemi BadenochConservativesUK child abuse inquirycommentShareReuse this content"

When these sickle-winged birds do come down – after several years in perpetual flight, even sleeping midair – it is to nest in the eaves of roofs across Europe after spending winters in sub-Saharan Africa, migrating 7,000 miles (11,000km) every year. They are celebrated by nature lovers, artists and poets as they race through city skies on long summer evenings, filling the air with their screaming calls.The fastest bird in level flight (top speed: 69mph/111kph), they feed on airborne insects. Swifts are in trouble because of steep declines in insects, but also because they are losing traditional nesting sites. Swifts once nested in caves and hollow trees but moved into buildings hundreds of years ago. Modern insulation, particularly in roofs, removes the crevices and cavities where they have nested for centuries.View image in fullscreenSwifts moved into buildings hundreds of years ago.Photograph: Nick Upton/AlamyWhat are the prospects for swifts?Grim. Swift populations in Britain slumped by66% between 1995 and 2022and have continued a rapid downward trend. Since the last count of 59,000 breeding pairs, the population this summer is set to be just 40,000 pairs. In five years’ time there could be fewer than 25,000, unless action is taken.Declines arenot so pronouncedacross continental Europe, despitesimilar insect declines. Countries such as Germany and France appear to have retained more nesting sites in old buildings than Britain, wherefew buildings constructed after 1944 can accommodate swifts.What are swift bricks and how can they help?View image in fullscreenSwift bricks slot into the brickwork of houses.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianA swift brick is a hollow brick that slots into the brickwork of new or old homes, providing a cavity where swifts can nest. The bricks have also been found to help other cavity-nesting birds, including the rapidly decliningred-listed house martin, house sparrow and starling. Other species including blue tits, great tits, nuthatches and wrens will also nest in the bricks.Swift bricks are made by brick manufacturers large and small, and typically cost about £35. There isa British standard for themand some developers are already fitting them to new homes.What is the swift brick campaign?View image in fullscreenSwift bricks can be a boon to other cavity-nesting birds as well.Photograph: Simon Stirrup/AlamyThree years ago, the writer and bird lover Hannah Bourne-Taylorlaunched a campaignto oblige every new home to be fitted with a swift brick. When in opposition, the Labour party supported the “swift brick amendment”,first tabled by the Conservative peer Zac Goldsmith, to do this in England. Now in government, Labour isresisting attemptsby its own backbench MP Barry Gardiner to insert a swift brick amendment into thecontroversialplanning and infrastructure bill.Why is there disagreement?View image in fullscreenHannah Bourne-Taylor says many planning authorities lack the resources to ensure conditions are met.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianLabour is reluctant to impose additional regulations on housebuilders as it attempts to address the UK’s housing affordability crisis with a big push for new homes. Nearly 30 housebuilders have voluntarily agreed to install one brick for every new home built. Labour’s latest move is to suggest adding swift bricks to national planning policy guidance so that all England’s local planning authorities insist on them for new homes. But Bourne-Taylor says this won’t guarantee more swift bricks, because many planning authorities lack the resources to ensure planning conditions are met. A recent study found developers, who make multibillions in profits, werenot providing 75% of the nesting boxesstipulated in planning permissions.“By refusing to mandate swift bricks, the government is making it clear to their voters that they do not care about nature, because this would be the easiest nature recovery action ever,” said Bourne-Taylor. “Loads of people have told me that they will never vote Labour again because of how the government have acted on swift bricks.”What else can people do to help swifts find nesting sites?View image in fullscreenWooden swift boxes are an alternative to integral bricks.Photograph: Kevin Elsby/AlamyWooden swift boxes arewidely availableand are suitable for swifts, provided they can be installed at least 4.5 metres above ground and not on a south-facing aspect, because this is too hot for the nesting birds. Retrofitting an integral brick is more expensive but slightly better because it provides a cooler space and will last longer than a wooden box.How else can we help these birds?Even if a swift box is ignored by swifts, it will be a boon to other birds. And there are many other ways to help swifts. TheSwift Local Networkunites swift lovers across Britain. Local groups rescue fallen birds and protect existing nesting sites. Talking to neighbours who have swifts in their roofs raises awareness if roofs are renovated.The government’scommitment to insulate Britainwill be welcomed by all environmentally minded voters, but this makes it more crucial than ever that swift bricks are integrated into all new homes. Campaigners are emailing the housing secretary, Angela Rayner, to let her know.Some people have put up swift boxes but not attracted swifts. Why?Site-faithful swifts sometimes take a while to discover new nesting opportunities. If house sparrows first take up residence, this is good news because swifts often seek out nesting spaces where they see sparrows – they are a signal for swifts that there are good homes here.Some peopleplay swift callsfrom a window close to a new nestbox to attract curious swifts when they first arrive back in Britain in May. This can help, but usually only in areas that already have swift populations.Explore more on these topicsBirdsWildlifeConservationPlanning policyexplainersShareReuse this content"

No, me neitherTue 17 Jun 2025 08.53 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 16.01 EDTShareWhenever I need to leave a boring party, I always get my press secretary to tweet the apologies, and so it was that White House spokesmonster Karoline Leavittinformed X usersin the dead of night that Donald Trump had ditched the G7 after barely 24 hours of mid-price hotel drabness, thus avoiding the possibility of getting cornered by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the kitchen. Trump later said he had to leave the summit “for obvious reasons”, though failed to elaborate whether he meant he’d been expected to talkwithleaders, notatthem, or simply that the trouser press in his room was broken.You probably can’t call it a French exit if the French president then claims you left early to work on a ceasefire. But you can definitely up the stakes on Le Bumptious by calling him “publicity-seeking”, someone who “always gets it wrong”, and adding – almost by way of an afterthought – that all Iranians should “immediately evacuate” Tehran. (Population: 9.8 million.)Incidentally, how are your tension headaches these days? I woke up at 2am with a blinder and nothing to do in the small hours but diagnostic detective work. Had I slept in a draught? Ground my teeth? Was I dehydrated? No, no and no. Once you have eliminated the impossible, I suppose you just have to face it: the less-improbable-by-the-day threat of total conflagration might just be the explanation.But look, hopefully this is all just the relaxing buildup to Iran signing a nuclear deal? If so, someone should tell Trump’s beloved stock market, which doesn’t love the increased tensions in the Middle East since Israel began striking nuclear and military targets in Iran on Friday. Furthermore, it has yet to alight on either a fight or flight reflex following Trump’s delphic pronouncement – probably posted in the middle of the night while on the Air Force One toilet – that something “much bigger” is coming. Nor can it ignore the fact that Trump’s wasn’t even the first evacuation order for Tehran in the past day, with Israel havingalready issued oneon Monday afternoon.The US president has made clear his impatient incredulity that Iran did not sign a deal to largely dismantle its nuclear programme in the various forms it has been on the table. Then again, it was only five incredibly long years ago that Trump thought Israel and Palestine should sign his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s “deal of the century”, which the two sides somehow resisted, no doubt leaving present-day Kushner staring into one of his many infinity pools and sighing: “I could have made it SO easy for them.”As for who could next give statecraft a whirl, anyone underwhelmed by the thought of Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff meeting Iranian leaders should prepare for an even bigger tension headache at the prospect of Trump’s other floated idea – that he mightsend vice-president JD Vanceto meet them. That would certainly be a face-off for the age, given how well all of Vance’s other forays into the art of international diplomacy have gone. Nato, Ukraine, Greenland – he’ll have enough for a greatest shits album soon.But back to theG7, which today is somehow trying to carry on without its central character – a bit like The Office did after Steve Carell left. It’s hard when you’ve spent days of buildup reading that a G7 in the age of second-term Trump is effectively The Donald Show. He is the centre of gravity, everything revolves around him – pick your physics metaphor, basically, then try to imagine a post-physics G7/G6/G-also-rans/Gee why don’t we just sack the whole thing off and go hiking in the Rockies.The Iranian people were starting to win their battle for liberty and prosperity. Then Israel attacked | Esfandyar BatmanghelidjRead moreYou just know that all the other leaders are relieved that it’s Emmanuel Macron, and not them, getting it right in the truth-socials. It was barely two weeks ago that Macron was the beneficiary of one of Trump’s lethal expressions of support, with the president breaking off from his farewell-to-Elon-Musk press conference to reassure reporters that despite poor old Macronappearing to have been shovedby his wife on his presidential plane, “he’s fine”.The one thing Trump did have time for was signing the much-vauntedUS-UK trade deal, which he unveiled to the media at a photocall with grateful supplicant Keir Starmer, before dropping the papers all over the floor. The UK prime minister promptly scrabbled around to pick up what he could, which should in no way be regarded as a metaphor for the fact he is celebrating having a 10% tariff on car exports that didn’t exist a few months ago, on the basis that it isno longer 27.5%. Trump made zero attempt to help pick up the mess he’d made, which apparently should also not be regarded as a metaphor. And there was precisely nothing on lifting the 25% steel tariff, much less that the next stage of the deal will include Tata Steel. Forget metaphors here – that would be simply and literally bad.As for the rather bigger story of the day, we’re probably at the stage of wondering which lucky journalist will be accidentally added to the group chat ahead of any US military strike inIran, and get all the juicy operational details and high-end bitching in real time.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Earlier this year, opposing theatres in Charing Cross Road displayed “sold out” signs for their shows. Both of them –Stranger Things: The First ShadowandKyoto– were co-directed by Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin. “It was surreal,” says Martin. “Someone sent me a photo and I thought: I’m keeping that. As a little Australian, I’m still surprised to make a living out of this crazy career.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Kyoto had a limited run butStranger Thingshas been going for 18 months and has “the noisiest audience I’ve ever heard”, Martin reports. “I think the stat is that 60% of [them] have never been to a play before. So they eat popcorn throughout and just respond in a really natural way. If it’s boring, they leave. If they’re frightened, they really scream and gasp. It’s very live but, if you’re used to traditional theatre, it’s weird.”Jodie Comer to reprise Prima Facie role ‘one last time’ for a tourRead moreMartin has had a centre seat for the modern evolution of theatregoing. As a solo director, he staged Suzie Miller’sPrima Facie, a horrifying monologue by a barrister who is a survivor of rape, with Jodie Comer winning Olivier and Tony awards in London and New York. Uniquely for a stage play, it also twice topped the UK cinema box office when screened by NT Live. For Martin, that felt as unlikely an achievement as having double hits in London.“I think a lot of it was Jodie,” he reflects. “But also the subject matter of the play: that people wanted to be part of that conversation about relationships and consent. With a new play, you never know what you’ve got until it meets the audience. The first preview of Prima Facie, the audience was almost all women and I’d placedStephen Daldryin the middle of the stalls to give me notes. And, even as the final music cue played, all the women in the theatre leaped to their feet with such energy and passion. And that was pretty much repeated everywhere.”Martin and Daldry intermittently fantasise about creating templates for sellout shows that can be copied around the world by assistants who occasionally check in by Zoom with the creators on their yachts. “Sadly,” he laughs, “we don’t seem to have achieved that. We have to be around a lot for every run.”View image in fullscreen‘They really scream and gasp’ … Stranger Things: The First Shadow on Broadway.Photograph: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman/APJust back from working with Daldry to open Stranger Things on Broadway, Martin will next year direct Comer again in a UK and Ireland tour of Prima Facie. Next month, he makes a National Theatre debut withMiller’s new play. Whereas the earlier work took its title from the Latin legal phrase meaning “at first sight”, Inter Alia borrows the lawyers’ term for “among other things”. And, after the barrister’s monologue of Prima Facie, Inter Alia is a sort of double soliloquy, for a high court judge, Jessica Parks (Rosamund Pike), who delivers both her public and private thoughts as a family crisis tests, inter alia, her judiciousness.“In conversation” is a favourite term of Martin’s for how culture works and Inter Alia has a lot to say toAdolescence, the Netflix mega-hit, as the judge becomes involved in the case of a young man accused of an assault on a classmate.“They’re definitely related,” Martin agrees. “Both Inter Alia and Adolescence are talking about what everyone’s talking about, which is how to bring up boys with an understanding of women and consent. What interested me about Adolescence was the response: get rid of mobile phones, get rid of social media. And you think: that’s one of the things but there are other issues about our complicity in the society we’ve created. Rosamund’s character in our play is trying to bring up a feminist son. And what does that mean? Suzie’s play is wrestling with how to bring up boys.”The Adolescence overlap is another example of a phenomenon that fascinates Martin: how plays are changed by the surrounding context. Kyoto by Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson – known to Martin and Daldry as “the Joes”, having previously written for themThe Jungle, the 2017 immersive drama about a refugee camp at Calais –premiered in summer 2024by the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford-upon-Avon and transferred to London this year.View image in fullscreenKyoto by ‘the Joes’ Murphy and Robertson at the Playhouse, London, in 2018.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian“What was amazing about that play,” says Martin, “is that we changed it a little bit between the two productions but the world had changed a huge amount.” He means the election of Donald Trump, which made the audience even more unnerved about an American lobbyist, Don Pearlman (played by Stephen Kunken), trying to sabotage the 1997 international agreement in Japan to reduce global warming.“If you do stuff about what’s going on now, which is what I like to do, then it’s exciting when the context changes the play. Because of Trump, the play’s discussion of the divisiveness of America had a different focus.”Kunken was, pantomime-like, regularly booed at curtain calls. But Martin has deep experience of theatre bumping into current affairs. In 2013, when Margaret Thatcher died, he was assistant director to Daldry on two West End shows in which the contentious former prime minister was satirised: Lee Hall and Elton John’s musical Billy Elliot and Peter Morgan’s Westminster bio-dramaThe Audience.“We thought: hang on, these shows become about something different tonight. Stephen held anaudience voteat Billy Elliot about whether the song fantasising about Thatcher’s death should be included. [It was.] And Peter and I went on stage before The Audience and talked to the, er, audience about whether the Thatcher scene should be included. [It was.] But, when it gets like that, it’s really exciting. WhenHaydn Gwynne, who was playing Thatcher, came on, the audience all went deeply quiet as if: are we allowed to do this tonight? But then she did her deep curtsey to the queen and everyone laughed and it was as if there was permission to be in conversation with what had just happened. It was electric.”Martin was working as “resident director” (day-to-day show-running) on the Australian production of Billy Elliot when he first encountered Daldry and moved up, via assistant and associate director, to co-director (on The Jungle, Kyoto and Stranger Things). Some duos who use that term sit side by side at desks during rehearsals, but not Daldry/Martin: “We divide up the show and then come back together to look at what the other has done. Every director runs out of ideas in a rehearsal room so it’s great to have someone who can pick it up and run with it.”Together and separately, a trait of their productions is pace. Without ever dropping a word, Comer in Prima Facie gave a sense of a racing brain and body. Kyoto, a hefty two-act play, felt much shorter than its running length.Martin nods: “I love it when a play is just ahead of the audience and they’re trying to catch it. With a monologue, it’s someone’s inner thoughts and people think so quickly so it has to go: boom, boom, boom. When I started on Prima Facie, it wasn’t quite coming alive and I rang up the friend who did it in Australia and she said with monologues you have to go at a rapid pace because of the speed of thought. I think pace is everything. Although it can be a fight now because a lot of actors try to actbetween the lines.That’s the influence of screen work where it’s in the pause, it’s in the look. But in theatre you have to acton the line. It’s an oral medium; if you’re not hearing it, there’s nothing going on. Stephen and I are notorious for saying to actors: if you’re doing nothing, then nothing is happening.”‘The courtroom is not fit for purpose’: the hard truths behind sexual assault drama Prima FacieRead moreMartin is one of a group of Australian directors – Simon Stone, Benedict Andrews, Kip Williams – who have worked prominently in London. “I came over chasing a partner who had moved here and I just found it was the place I wanted to work,” he says. He is pleased that Inter Alia is scheduled for NT Live. “For someone living across the world from where my parents are, it’s a way of connecting … But, more importantly, it’s democratised theatre.”All his big shows have been new – including The Fear of 13 with Adrien Brody – but do producers ring up and offer The Cherry Orchard or Richard III? “Yep.” And he says no? “Yep. Until I find my own way into a classic the way Stephen did to An Inspector Calls, where you feel the play is turned on its head.”After Inter Alia he is planning to complete a trilogy with Miller: “We have a third one with another Latin legal title that I can’t say for the moment.” While Martin insists that collaboration must remain sub judice for now, his track record suggests audiences are unlikely to be in absentia.Inter Alia is at theNational Theatre, London, 10 July-13 September, and in cinemas as part ofNT Livefrom 4 September.

Later he took to his own social media platform, Truth Social, to suggest that the US had Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in its bomb-sights, and could make an imminent decision to take offensive action.Trump demands Iran’s ‘unconditional surrender’ and says US won’t kill supreme leader ‘for now’ – latest updatesRead more“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there – We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump said. “But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.”In a post a few minutes later, Trump bluntly demanded “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER”.It was not just Trump’s all-caps threats that triggered speculation that the US might join offensive operations. They were accompanied by the sudden forward deployment of US military aircraft to Europe and the Middle East, amid a general consensus that Iran’s deeply buried uranium enrichment facilities could prove impregnable without huge bunker-busting bombs that only the US air force possesses.“If Iran does not back down, complete destruction of Iranian nuclear programme is on the agenda, which Israel cannot achieve alone,” German chancellor Friedrich Merz told ZDF television a day after meeting Trump at the G7 summit in Canada.But France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, urged restraint, saying: “We recognize Israel’s right to self-defense, but we do not support actions that threaten stability in the region. The biggest mistake that can be made today is to try to change the regime in Iran by military means – because that would lead to chaos.”Despite the US military deployments and Trump’s menacing comments, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, who was also at the G7 meeting, insisted the US was not about to join the Israeli bombing campaign.“There’s nothing the president said that suggests that he’s about to get involved in this conflict,” Starmer said. “On the contrary, the G7 statement was about de-escalation ... I was sitting right next to President Trump [at the dinner], so I’ve no doubt, in my mind, the level of agreement.”Trump left the Canadian summit a day earlyand flew back to Washington around midnight on Monday. On the way,he told journalists he was not seeking a ceasefire in Israel’s war on Iran but instead wanted to seea “complete give-up” by Iran, as well as “a real end” to Iran’s nuclear programme, with Tehran abandoning its uranium enrichment “entirely”.The vice president, JD Vance, also took to social media to discuss Trump’s options.“He may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president,” Vance wrote, before adding that “people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy”.The US president predicted Israel would not let up in its bombing campaign and suggested a decisive moment in that campaign was imminent, though he made clear he expected Israel to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities without US help.“You’re going to find out over the next two days … Nobody’s slowed up so far,” he told CBS News on the flight back to Washington, saying he was returning to the White House to focus on the conflict.Israel’s justification for its shock attack on Iran was called into question on Tuesday whenCNN cited US intelligence assessmentsas saying that when Iran was attacked, it had been “up to three years away from being able to produce and deliver [a nuclear bomb] to a target of its choosing”.The report echoed a public assessment in March by Trump’s own director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who told Congress “Iran is not building a nuclear weapon” and the supreme leader “has not authorised the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003”.On Tuesday, Trump shrugged off that assessment, siding instead with Israel’s claims that Tehran was on the brink of making a warhead.“I don’t care what she said,” Trump said. “I think they were very close to having it.”In freewheeling remarks to reporters on Air Force One, Trump also stressed that any Iranian attack on Americans or US bases, which Iran has threatened, would be met with overwhelming force, saying: “We’ll come down so hard, it’d be gloves off.”Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran was open to resuming talks with the US. “If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,” he said.View image in fullscreenRescuers at the site of an airstrike on a residential area in Tehran on Tuesday.Photograph: Iranian Red Crescent Society/EPABenjamin Netanyahu was also dismissive of the idea of diplomacy. “Of course they want to stop. They want to stop, and to keep producing the tools of death. We gave that a chance,” the Israeli prime minister said, laying out a new, expanded set of war aims.“We want three central results: eliminating the nuclear programme, eliminating the ability to produce ballistic missiles and eliminating the axis of terror.”He left vague what the third war aim would entail. Later on Tuesday, his foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, described it differently as a mission to “severely damage [the Iranians’] plan to eliminate the state of Israel”.Asked how that would be achieved, Sa’ar told the Guardian: “We are doing that gradually. First we cut the [tentacles] of the octopus, when we dealt with Hamas and Hezbollah. Now we are dealing with the head of the octopus.”“Regime change is not an objective of this war,” the minister insisted however, during a visit to a missile strike site in Rishon LeZion, east of Tel Aviv. He added that regime change “may be a result, but its not an objective” of the war.Israel’s choice of targets has broadened over the course of the campaign, in line with its rhetoric. In recent days it has bombed the Iranian capital,ordering the residents of a part of northern Tehran, a third of a million people, to leave their homes.View image in fullscreenIsraeli air defences intercept a missile fired from Iran over Tel Aviv on Monday night.Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPAThe Israeli evacuation order was modelled on those routinely issued to Palestinians in Gaza, where bombing by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has flattened entire residential neighbourhoods over the course of a 20-month conflict.Explosion could be heard in Tehran early on Wednesday after Israel announced a wave of fresh attacks. The IDF warned residents to evacuate from a neighbourhood south of Mehrabad International Airport, which includes residential areas, military installations, pharmaceutical companies and industrial firms.The Israeli ultimatum on Monday said the bombing of Tehran would be aimed at “military infrastructure”, but one of the targets hit was astate television station, killing three staff and ending live broadcasts. Israel has also been bombing Iran’s oil and gas installations, and Iran has retaliated with strikes on Haifa, damaging a power station and a refinery in the Mediterranean port.Israeli airstrikes killed at least 24 Iranians across the country on Tuesday morning, bringing the toll since Friday’s surprise attack to at least 224 people dead and more than 1,400 injured, Iran’s health ministry said. The scale of destruction and the threats from the IDF and Trump triggered an exodus of Tehranis, jamming the roads out of the capital overnight.View image in fullscreenHeavy traffic on the road leading out of Tehran as people try to flee the city.Photograph: Social Media/ReutersIn Israel, the death toll after four days was 24, with about 600 injured. Iran fired a total of 20 to 30 missiles on Tuesday morning, according to the IDF, lightly wounding five people, marking a significant drop in the tempo of its attack compared with the previous few days.‘There’s a smell of death in the air’: chaos in Tehran as residents try to flee or find shelterRead moreThe IDF said Iran had used 370 missiles in eight salvoes out of a US-estimated arsenal of 3,000 ballistic missiles. The IDF further claims to have destroyed 200 of Iran’s missile launchers, half the total.Israel has also struck a severe blow to Iran’s chain of command, killing at least 11 top generals and, in some cases, their replacements. On Tuesday the IDF said it had killed the acting armed forces commander, Maj Gen Ali Shadmani, who had been in the post for only four days, after his predecessor was targeted in the first wave of strikes on Friday morning.“Iran is completely naked and we have full freedom of action. This is an unprecedented achievement,” an IDF general staff officer told the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.Iran continued to threaten Israeli cities however, with its senior army commander echoing Israeli methods by calling for the residents of Haifa and Tel Aviv to evacuate immediately.If those threats prove empty and IDF claims of its dominance are borne out, it will leave Iran with few cards to play. The Iranian parliament has prepared a bill that would withdraw Iran from the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty, so that it would no longer be legally bound to forgo nuclear weapons, but the government insists it remains opposed to all weapons of mass destruction.View image in fullscreenA house destroyed by an Iranian ballistic missile in Bnei Brak, near Tel Aviv.Photograph: Matan Golan/Sopa Images/ShutterstockState TV has also aired calls from hardline politicians suggesting that Iran block the strategically important strait of Hormuz, potentially stopping the passage of more than 17m barrels of oil a day and producing a dramatic spike in world oil prices and global inflation.Iran and Israel crisis: what does it mean for the price of oil?Read moreOn Tuesday, the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that Israeli bombing sorties on the enrichment plant in Natanz had penetrated to its underground levels. But, as the war enters its sixth day, the focus of key decisions in Israel and the US is likely to be the underground facility at Fordow, near the religious centre of Qom, which houses Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium as well as an enrichment plant. However, Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, said its presence was not likely to be relevant to military calculations“Blowing up the stockpiles at Fordow would release a limited amount of radiation and chemical toxicity from the UF6, but it would be confined to the site,” Davenport said. “There may be a very slight risk that if Iran has enough 60 percent enriched uranium stored at the site, an explosion could trigger a chain reaction. But I would be very surprised if that is the reason Fordow is not being bombed. Israel knows it cannot destroy the site.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

What if there are secret storage facilities around us? The fear of not knowing created a lot of anxiety,” said Mina*, 24, a finance professional in Tehran.They were some of the thousands of Tehran residents who have fledsince Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes on Iran early on Friday morning, which it said was aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.Iran responded by launching a barrage of ballistic missiles and drones at Israel in a steadily escalating tit-for-tat war, which has entered its fifth day.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises after the Israeli attack on the Iranian state broadcaster’s building in Tehran.Photograph: Majid Asgaripour/ReutersUnlike Israel, which was well prepared for Iranian ballistic missiles, Tehran has no dedicated bomb shelters.

The message, issued via the social media platform X, resembled similar alerts issued by the Israeli military in Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen.X is officially banned in Iran and the Iranian government has been throttling internet access since Israeli attacks began on Friday, preventing many Iranians from seeing the evacuation orders.Donald Trump later urged everyone to immediately evacuate Tehran in a post on Truth Social, his social media platform.The Israel-Iran war in maps, videos and satellite imagesRead moreHuman rights experts criticised the evacuation orders, which they said were overly vague and seemed designed to promote displacement.“The most ‘specific’ evacuation order we have seen in Iran is 300,000 people. That’s a massive, massive order. You cannot just order 300,000 people to leave without giving specific routes to leave,” said Hussein Baoumi, the deputy regional director for theMiddle East and north Africaat Amnesty International.“The evacuation orders seem to be following the same pattern as in Lebanon and Gaza, where they really seem aimed at causing confusion and panic, rather than offering protection to civilians,” Baoumi added.Not all residents of Tehran could flee. The war with Israel comes during Iran’s worst economic crisis in decades and some lacked the means to travel out of the city.“There are three kinds of people that are still in Tehran: those who have no place to go; those who have no money to leave; and medium-level government staff whose leave request was rejected by the government,” said Sadia*, a woman in her 40s who was still in the city.Activists also raised the alarm about Evin prison, which sits on the edge of the area specified by Israel’s evacuation order. It is filled with political prisoners and female protesters detained in the 2022 Woman, Life, Freedom protests, as well as ordinary offenders and has not been evacuated.“My dad is in prison!

His knowledge of the country is filtered through intelligence briefings, which see Iran as a hostile problem, and through the lens of pro-Israeli thinktanks.If Netanyahu’s comments appear eerily familiar, it is because they are. The same Netanyahu, and Iran hawks in the US, pushed a similar argument in the run-up to the invasion ofIraqin 2003. Iraqis then, like Iranians, the world was told, would welcome the removal of Saddam. The Middle East would be reshaped.Meaningful regime change, however (whatever that means in practical terms), is not the same as regime destruction.In Iraq, where ultimately an incompetent US effort was made at nation-building, andLibya– where it was not – there followed periods of bloody chaos, which continues in Libya.Ironically, it is not a story unfamiliar in Iran’s own revolution. While there is a tendency, through historical foreshortening, to see the Islamic revolution emerging fully formed in 1979 – the reality is that the fall of the shah triggered a period of competition inIranbetween conservative Islamists, communists and different factions within both the Shia clergy and revolutionary cadres.And the notion that Netanyahu and Israel will be seen as a distant saviour is a dubious one at best.“Iranian activists, people who fought for freedom and justice all their lives, first of all know that their value has little to do with people like Netanyahu,” Arash Azizi, author of the book What Iranians Want, told CNN earlier this week.Ali Vaez argued on the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Pivotal States podcast, only days before Israel launched its attack, that historically many Iranians – himself included – have been nervous of sudden change.“I was born after the revolution. Obviously there was a high degree of dissatisfaction within the country even in the 1990s when I was a teenager.“I think there was this sense in my generation and in my parents’ generation that radical change often results in a worse outcome. It ends in grief. It rarely brings about a better situation.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises following an Israeli attack on Iran’s state broadcaster in Tehran on Monday.Photograph: Majid Asgaripour/Reuters“Reform is better. Evolutionary change is better. That was the concept that we were pursuing.”Democracy activists in Tehran have echoed that view in recent days: an Israeli war does not help them.What is clear is that Israel sees regime destruction as an end in its own right, with no interest in Iran’s future beyond weakening and destabilising a regional rival.That is entirely in line with Israel’s long-term approach to what it perceives as security issues. Israel backedHamasagainst Fatah, a policy whose consequences are visible in the carnage in Gaza today. It backed the South Lebanese army (SLA) in Lebanon, until the SLA’s collapse amid the emergence of Hezbollah.Now Israel is armingviolent criminal factions in Gaza against Hamasamid the overwhelming sense that Netanyahu has no plan for Gaza’s future even as he is reducing it to rubble.Netanyahu’s enthusiasm for regime change appears to be viewed – for now at least – with some scepticism in Washington.The Israel-Iran war in maps, videos and satellite imagesRead more“They might be more comfortable with regime change than we are,” a US official told Axios. “They may be more comfortable with destroying the country than we are.”Iraq and Libya also demonstrate the practical difficulties of a violent transition between regimes. In Iraq, US and other officials promoted figures from the Iraqi exile diaspora, such as Ahmed Chalabi, while having, for a protracted period, a negligible grasp of emerging centres of influence or tribal and sectarian tensions.In Libya – in the immediate aftermath of Gaddafi – that dynamic was even more in evidence as international missions, including European, struggled as midwives to a transitional government without authority, and challenged by warlordism, even as other powers including the UAE and Russia moved into the vacuum.Long-term Iran watchers are also highly dubious that Israel can engineer a path to regime destruction through aerial warfare, even in the event of decapitation with the killing of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. They point out that the Israeli offensive could just as easily allow the regime to retrench and accelerate efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon.More widely there is a risk that Israel’s efforts to destabilise Iran could lend new legitimacy to the clerical regime, even in Middle Eastern countries profoundly suspicious of it as they grow increasingly anxious over Israel’s increasingly violent reach.“With Israel’s expansion of its offensive to include Iran, there is no telling where the boundaries of this battleground will end,” King Abdullah of Jordan said on Tuesday. His country has faced the recent challenge of hosting both Syrian and Iraqis fleeing their civil conflicts. “And that is a threat to people everywhere. Ultimately, this conflict must end,” he added.Peter Beaumont is a senior international correspondent for the Guardian and former Jerusalem correspondent.

The planes, mostly KC-135 Stratotankers and KC-46 Pegasuses, were tracked by AirNav Systems, a flight-tracking website, as they headed east towards Europe on Sunday. There were further reports of some planes flying further east on Tuesday.US Air Force B-2 bombers have a long range, of about 6,000 miles without refuelling, but they usually operate from a limited number of bases: Whiteman in Missouri, Fairford in Oxfordshire and most notably the isolated base of Diego Garcia in the south Indian Ocean, now leased from Mauritius by the UK for the US.B-2 bombers attacked five underground Houthi weapon facilities from Whiteman, 8,000 miles away, last October. Diego Garcia is far closer to Fordow, a 3,200-mile trip each way, which would require refuelling on the return leg once a bombing run on Iran’s nuclear sites had been completed.Location of USS NimitzOnly the US is considered to have a bomb large enough – the GBU 57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator – to possibly destroy Fordow, one of Iran’s two main uranium enrichment sites, estimated to be 80-90 metres below a mountain. The only plane certified to carry the 6-metre weapon is the B-2.At one point in the middle of the last decade, the US was thought to have only 20 of the bombs, its largest non-nuclear weapon, but more recent estimates are higher.Though Israel appears to have achieved dominance over Iran’s skies since it launched its attack on the country on Friday, it attacked Fordow on only the first day of the operation. The IAEA nuclear watchdogsaid on Mondaythat no damage to the enrichment plant had been seen.View image in fullscreenA satellite image provided by Maxar Technologies of the Fordow fuel enrichment plant in central Iran on 14 June.Photograph: Maxar Technologies/AFP/Getty ImagesJustin Bronk, an aviation expert with the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said “multiple impacts” would almost certainly be required to destroy Fordow, “with the second bomb impacting inside the hole made by the first”.Though a B-2 can carry two bunker-busting bombs, a serious assault by the US designed to eliminate the facility would probably require the deployment of more than one bomber. Bronk said: “An attack would require redundancy since the weapons have to function and be delivered perfectly to get down into the facility and explode at the right depth to cause critical damage.”Satellite image of Fordow’s underground facilitiesSatellite imagery in May showed the presence ofsix B-2 bombers at Diego Garcia, about half the total number considered operational at any one time – the US has a total of 19 – but there has not been any more recent reporting. Several companies supplying commercial satellite imaging also work for the US government.According to a 2019 article in the New York Times, at some point a decade before, the US Pentagon constructed a replica of Fordow and test-bombed it with a 30,000lb device. A highly classified video of the attack was later shown by Leon Panetta, a defence secretary under Barack Obama’s presidency, to the Israeli politician Ehud Barak. “The bomb destroyed the mock-up in the desert,” the newspaper reported.Natanz graphic mapThe US may also consider attacking Iran’s other nuclear enrichment site, at Natanz. Though a smaller overground site was destroyed by bombing on Friday, a facility somewhere between 8 and 12 metres underground is said by the IAEA to be relatively undamaged, though the Israeli military has disputed this.An important question for the White House and the Pentagon is whether they believe, after five days of airstrikes by Israel, that there is any threat to US jets operating over Iran. But there is no shortage of military assets available if the US wants to mount an expanded attack targeting any remaining air defence and missile launch sites.A second aircraft carrier strike group, led by the USS Nimitz was sent from east Asia towards the Middle East earlier this week, where it will join the USS Carl Vinson carrier, which is already operating relatively close to Iran, around the Arabian Sea. At least three US destroyers are now also in the eastern Mediterranean.Explore more on these topicsIranTrump administrationIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

People at the scene and doctors described seeing injured and dead with wounds typical of those caused by artillery or tank fire. Unverified video shared on social media showed about a dozen mangled bodies lying in a street.Multiple other incidents of violence involving crowds of desperate Palestinians trying to get food were reported on Tuesday. Medics said at least 14 other people were also killed by Israeli gunfire and airstrikes elsewhere in the densely populated enclave, taking Tuesday’s overall death toll to at least 73.Eight Palestinians were reported to have died in a separate shooting near an aid distribution site in the city of Rafah, and several more injured or killed in a third incident between Rafah and Khan Younis.View image in fullscreenWomen mourn for those killed after Israeli soldiers opened fire in Khan Younis on Monday.Photograph: Moaz Abu Taha/APAImages/ShutterstockThe Israeli military acknowledged firing in the area of the crowd in Khan Younis and said it was looking into the incident.Musab Barbakh, 22, said he had arrived at the al-Tahlia junction at midnight. “I was sitting with a group of young men at around 8.30am when suddenly a shell landed right in the middle of us. I don’t know how I survived without any injuries. As I was running away, another shell hit another group of people. Then a missile was fired, followed by random gunfire,” he said.“The ground was filled with martyrs, the wounded, and pools of blood. Cars were exploding, the bodies of the martyrs were torn apart – wherever you looked, you saw scenes of body parts, blood, and corpses. I felt like I was living in a horror movie.”Abdullah Anshasi, 30, from the al-Amal neighbourhood in Khan Younis, said he, too, was waiting for the aid to arrive when “explosions began and shrapnel rained down around us”.“Many people were killed. We saw several artillery shells land around us,” he said. “What we witnessed was horrifying: human bodies flying through the air, hundreds of injured people lying on the ground. We survived by a miracle.”View image in fullscreenThe Nasser hospital received 51 dead and 250 injured people, said Dr Mohamed Saqer.Photograph: Dr Mohammed SaqerPalestinian medics said at least 59 people were killed and 221 wounded in the incident, at least 20 of them in critical condition.“The injured were transported to us … on donkey carts, with multiple injured people stacked on top of each other. In some, as many as 20 wounded all piled up,” Dr Mohammed Saqer, the head of the nursing department at the Nasser medical complex in Khan Younis, said.“Most of the injuries are in the upper body – limbs, chest, heart, and head. Many victims arrived as dismembered body parts, with amputations and other severe injuries. Based on our inquiries with eyewitnesses and those accompanying the injured, the attack appears to have been carried out using artillery shells, followed by live gunfire from soldiers.”A second doctor at the Nasser medical complex said the hospital morgue was completely full, so bodies were being placed outside the building. “Thousands of people – relatives and injured – have flooded the hospital, searching for their loved ones. Wounded people are lying in the hospital courtyards. The emergency department has been completely paralysed,” they said.View image in fullscreen‘Thousands of people have flooded the hospital,’ said one doctor at the Nasser medical complex.Photograph: Dr Mohammed SaqerThe IDF said it was aware of reports of casualties “from IDF fire”.“The details of the incident are under review. The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals and operates to minimise harm as much as possible to them while maintaining the safety of our troops,” its statement said.The IDF said a crowd had been identified adjacent to an aid distribution truck that had got stuck in the area of Khan Younis, and in proximity to IDF troops operating in the area.The exact identity of the trucks expected at the al-Tahlia junction was not immediately clear. UN agencies, commercial operators and others have all moved limited amounts of aid intoGazain recent weeks.Anas Barbakh, 21, said he had travelled to al-Tahlia after hearing that trucks loaded with flour had reached the crossroads for the past two days.“So many people were killed and wounded that we couldn’t even tell who was dead, who was injured, or who was still alive. My brother and my cousin Musab were injured – one in the head and the other in the chest. We transported them to the hospital on horse-drawn carts,” he told the Guardian.View image in fullscreenA crowd gathers near Nasser hospital in Khan Younis as Palestinian casualties – who were waiting to receive aid – are brought in after an Israeli strike.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersA tight blockade on all supplies entering Gaza was imposed by Israel throughout March and April, threatening many of the 2.3 million people who live there with a“critical risk of famine”. Food has become extremely scarce, sending prices for basics soaring.“Despite the danger, we are forced to go [to get aid]. No one can afford to buy a bag of flour for $400 … I have a family of 10 people to feed,” said Barbakh.Since the blockade was partially lifted last month, the UN has tried to bring in aid but has faced major obstacles, including rubble-choked roads, Israeli military restrictions, continuing air strikes and growing anarchy.Aid officials said between 20 and 30 UN trucks had entered Gaza through the main checkpoint of Kerem Shalom in recent days but all had been looted. “There is no law and order. Some of it is criminal and organised but mostly it is just desperate people trying to get some food,” a senior UN official told the Guardian.Palestinians say Israeli forces have opened fire repeatedly on crowds trying to reach food distribution points run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private organisation that recently began operating in Gaza with Israeli and US support.The second incident reported on Monday involved Palestinians seeking to access an aid hub in Rafah. The details of the third incident were unclear, though witnesses described many injured. There was no immediate comment from the IDF or GHF.On Monday,at least 37 Palestinians were killedas they tried to reach a GHF site, local authorities said. The IDF disputed the death toll, saying it did not match their information. Witnesses blamed that shooting on Israeli troops who opened fire early in the morning as crowds of hungry Palestinians converged on two hubs managed by the GHF.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Israel hopes the GHF will replace the previous comprehensive system of aid distribution run by the UN, which Israeli officials claim allowed Hamas to steal and sell aid. UN agencies and major aid groups, which have delivered humanitarian aid across Gaza since the start of war, haverejected the new system, saying it is impractical, inadequate and unethical. They deny there is widespread theft of aid by Hamas.The GHF’s provisions so far have been grossly inadequate, humanitarian officials in the devastated territory said.Israel’s military campaign since October 2023 has killed more than 55,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Its count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.Israel launched its campaign aiming to destroy Hamas after the group’s 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 251 hostage. The militants still hold 53 hostages, fewer than half of them alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.Associated Press contributed to reportingExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelHumanitarian responseUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

The offence of inducing a miscarriage carries a maximum sentence of life.The amendment, put forward by the Labour backbencher Tonia Antoniazzi, passed in a free vote of MPs, with 379 voting in favour, and 137 voting against.It came after growing calls for a change in the law as the number of women investigated, arrested or prosecuted has increased in recent years.Calls for abortion law change grew louder as number of prosecutions roseRead moreIn 2022, a judge at Oxford crown court said he was “flabbergasted” that a prosecution had been brought against a then 25-year-old mother, who had been reported to police when a clinician found pills in her body believed to be abortion medication – even though her 4lb 4oz baby had survived.The recorder, John Hardy KC, described the case as “sad and tragic” and the intended trial as a “waste of court time [that] exacerbates the absence of any public interest I can detect in pursuing this prosecution”.In June 2023, Carla Foster was sentenced to 28 months in prison for terminating a pregnancy between 32 and 34 weeks. She had obtained pills supplied in good faith, after a remote consultation during lockdown.A month later, hersentence was reduced to 14 monthsand suspended. Sitting at the court of appeal, Dame Victoria Sharp said Foster’s was “a case that calls for compassion, not punishment”.In 2024, the CPS dropped its case againstBethany Cox, then 22, from Teesside. Her barrister, Nicholas Lumley KC, said at the time that she had been interviewed by police in the “throes of grief” and had been investigated for three years.Prosecutors offered no evidence against Cox, who was not in court when she was formally acquitted, because, Lumley said, “she has suffered so extensively over this prosecution and investigation, all the while grieving what took place”.Most recently, just last month,Nicola Packerwas cleared of taking abortion pills beyond the time limit after a trial at Isleworth crown court. She had spent almost half a decade waiting for the case to come to court, before she was finally found not guilty.“To waste five years of my life that I’m never going to get back, I don’t know how anybody could justify that – to drag out the trauma continuously,” Packer said.“I would not wish this on anyone,” she added. “It has been the worst four and a half years of my life.”Urging colleagues to vote for her amendment, Antoniazzi highlighted several cases, including Packer’s and a woman called Laura, who had been jailed for two years while her abusive partner, who had coerced her into taking abortion pills, had never faced any consequences.She said parliament had a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to put an end to this” and that there was a “moral imperative here”, which she said was “namely, vulnerable women being dragged from hospital bed to police on suspicion of ending their own pregnancies”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They cannot afford to wait.”Among those calling for an urgent change to the law were six medical colleges, the British Medical Association, and charities including Women’s Aid and the Fawcett Society.Prof Ranee Thakar, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said the vote was “a victory for women and for their essential reproductive rights.”“At a time when we’re seeing rollbacks on reproductive rights, most notably in the United States, this crucial milestone in the fight for reproductive rights sends a powerful message that our lawmakers are standing up for women,” Louise McCudden, UK head of external affairs at MSI Reproductive Choices, said.Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said the vote was “a landmark moment for women’s rights in this country and the most significant change to our abortion law since the 1967AbortionAct was passed”.“This is a hard-won victory,” she added, “and we thank all those who have campaigned alongside us, and in particular those women, like Nicola Packer, who have spoken out about their traumatic experiences in the hope of achieving the change parliament has delivered today.”Speaking to reporters at the G7 summit in Canada, Keir Starmer indicated that he would have backed the amendment if he had been in parliament, saying that, while it was a free vote, he was a longstanding supporter of safe and legal abortion.“It is a conscience issue, therefore it is a free vote. And therefore in that sense, it’s in the same category as assisted dying,” Starmer said. “But my longstanding in principle position is that women have the right to a safe and legal abortion.”A rival decriminalisation amendment put forward by another Labour backbencher, Stella Creasy, was not put to a vote, while an amendment from Conservative MP Caroline Johnson, which sought to restrict access to telemedicine, did not pass.The changes will not become law until the bill in its entirety passes through the House of Commons and House of Lords, and receives royal assent, but given the size of the government’s majority, it is expected to pass without issue.Explore more on these topicsAbortionWomenReproductive rightsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Officials are still negotiating over the fine points of a deal to cover the steel and aluminium industry, amid US concerns about the fact thatTataSteel imports raw materials from abroad.‘Vital’ that British steel gets Trump tariff deal after UK-US trade pact, say unionsRead moreStarmer told reporters in Banff, Canada: “There’s further work to do in relation to steel, but we’re getting on and doing that work.”Trump and Starmer announced the main terms of the trade agreementin May, with the UK prime minister calling it a “fantastic, historic day”. According to that deal, tariffs on up to 100,000 British cars are due to be reduced to 10% from 27.5%.As it stands, UK steelmakers still face 25% tariffs, although this is lower than the global tariff of 50% imposed by theTrump administrationon other nations. The UK business department said the two leaders had pledged to “make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed”in May.The deal was heralded by Downing Street as a triumph for Starmer’s brand of gentle diplomacy, in which he wooed the president with the promise of a state visit while shying away from any direct criticism on topics such as trade.The May trade announcement itself was followed by weeks of further talks as the two sides continued to negotiate over the small print. Monday’s announcement by the two leaders means the tariff reductions will kick in for aerospace and automobiles over the coming weeks, with Starmer saying they would begin “very soon”.However, the Trump administration is understood to be seeking further guarantees on British steel exports, given Tata Steel hasclosed its blast furnaces at Port Talbot last yearand therefore now imports raw materials from abroad until the planned opening of a new, much cleaner electric arc furnace in 2027.According to US import rules, steel must be “melted and poured” in a country to qualify as having originated in that country.The company says these supplies come from Tata’s other sites, mainly those in the Netherlands and India.US trade officials are considering granting Tata an exemption, sources say, but are asking for guarantees about when it will switch on its new electric arc furnaces, and therefore stop importing raw materials from abroad. They also want to know where those supplies are coming from and how Tata is able to track their movements throughout the supply chain.The British government is hoping that the fact that Tata does not import any of the raw steel from China will persuade the Trump administration to include all British exports in the deal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our steel producers and their US customers need an end to the current state of uncertainty to allow normal business to resume.“Crucially, we must see a full exemption for all UK steel exports to the US – without that guarantee, some of our leading steel businesses could be left behind, with a threat to jobs and livelihoods.”A government source said: “Thanks to our agreement with the US, the UK is the only country in the world to be exempt from the 50% tariff on steel and aluminium that other countries now face.“Yesterday the US president confirmed his intention to work with the UK to remove the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium, helping us to ensure they can be implemented as soon as possible and in the best interests of the UK industry.”Additional reporting by Peter Walker in BanffExplore more on these topicsSteel industryTrump tariffsTataInternational tradeDonald TrumpTrump administrationManufacturing sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Trump said he needed to focus on the Israel-Iran conflict.In a further blow for Kyiv the US vetoed a joint statement on Ukraine from the summit, on the grounds that the wording was too anti-Russian and could compromise negotiations withVladimir Putin.Instead, some of the language around the war will be included in Canadian prime minister Mark Carney’s “chair’s statement”.Some Ukrainian officials said they were not sure now if it will be worth Zelenskyy attending theNatosummit in The Hague next week since there was no guarantee that Trump would attend.One said: “It is an permanent hazard that Ukraine is a victim of events and Trump’s short attention span. Vladimir Putin knows that, which may be why there wassuch a large attack in Ukraine last night. There had been all sorts of promises for this summit – including new US arms deliveries being offered.” Ukraine was proposing to buy US weapons including new air defences, so getting round the Trump complaint that Ukraine is a drain on the US budget.Trump leaves Europe in the cold in the Rocky Mountains, and Iran with a stark choiceRead moreThe German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said Trump had promised to attend the Nato summit.With the US chair at the G7 summit removed, Zelenskyy instead sat down with the other members of the group at a special session dedicated toUkraine, but the central purpose of the session – to try to enlist Trump’s support to put pressure on Putin to agree a ceasefire – had been nullified by the US president’s abrupt departure announced to fellow G7 leaders in the afternoon. Zelenskyy was also due to have a one to one meeting with Trump.The sense of upset, impossible for Ukraine to express in public due to the need to retain Trump’s support, was intensified by the fact that Zelenskyy was being relayed news of Russia’s massive attack across Ukraine as he flew by plane to the meeting inCanada.As he met the G7 host, Canada’s Mark Carney, Zelenskyy made no direct reference to Trump’s decision to absent himself. Looking downbeat, he said: “We need the help of our allies to for our soldiers to stay strong untilRussiais ready for peace negotiations.”He stressed: “We are ready for an unconditional ceasefire.”Zelenskyy had billed that theG7summit as one of two golden chances to apply collective western pressure on Trump, and to discuss Ukraine’s plans to buy as much as $30bn to $50bn worth of air defense systems and weapons from the United States as a form of security guarantees.There had been signals that the US was willing to sell the arms to Ukraine, but Trump – who spoke again to Putin this week – sometimes argues that providing Ukraine with arms will only prolong a war he is committed to ending.Zelenskyy had also been seeking US agreement to a cut in the oil cap from $60 a barrel to $45 in a bid to cut Russian oil revenues. The oil price cap requiring complex enforcement was introduced by G7 nations and it would need at least tacit US support for it to be instituted effectively.Although there has been a recent spike in the price of oil due to the Iranian crisis, the debate around lowering the price cap had become centre stage due to the slow fall in the price of oil. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, acknowledged the immediate pressure to lower the cap had been reduced.In discussions at the summit, Trump on Monday expressed reluctance to impose any further sanctions, saying Europeans should “do it first” and that “sanctions cost us a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Austria has strong ties with Russia, and is seen by some Ukrainian leaders as a more trustworthy intermediary than Turkey, which has much to gain commercially from a peace settlement.Speaking in Brussels, the EU foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, addressed the latest Russian attacks, saying: “Russia remains unrelenting in its attacks, targeting civilians and prolonging its war. This is yet another sign: Russia is just not interested in peace, so we must keep up the pressure.”The EU is close to agreeing an 18th package of sanctions that will include a ban on the importation of Russian oil refined by third-party countries and then exported to Europe. The EU plan intends to designate oil as Russian and therefore banned unless the importer has clear documentation demonstrating it has originated elsewhere. Countries will also have to publish new “diversification plans” showing how they will end reliance on both Russian oil and gas.Kallas is convinced that although sanctions have taken longer than expected to have an impact, a corner has been turned.She said last week: “Russia has lost tens of billions in oil revenues. Its economy is shrinking, and its GDP has dropped.” Sanctioningthe “shadow fleet” [of unflagged Russian tankers]has been particularly impactful: after our last sanctions package, the 17th sanctions package, the oil exports from Russia via the Black Sea and Baltic Sea routes declined by 30% in a week.“Only in the month of May, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund declined by $6bn, from $42bn to $36bn, and it could run out of money by next year. By cutting off revenue streams, we prevent them from refilling their war chest”.Explore more on these topicsG7UkraineDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinRussiaIranShareReuse this content"

While previous studies have linked cannabis use to cardiovascular problems, the scale of the risk has until now not been clear.This is an important gap in light of major changes in consumption, researchers at the University of Toulouse in France said.Sadiq Khan calls for partial decriminalisation of cannabis possessionRead moreTo strengthen the evidence base, they searched databases looking for large observational studies, published between 2016 and 2023, which explored cannabis use and cardiovascular outcomes.Twenty-four studies, involving about 200 million people, were included in a pooled data analysis of the results: 17 cross-sectional studies, six cohort studies, and one case-control study.Study participants were mostly aged between 19 and 59. And in those studies where sex was recorded, cannabis users tended to be mostly male and younger than non-users.The analysis revealed heightened risks for cannabis use: 29% higher for acute coronary syndrome; 20% higher for stroke; and a doubling in the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. The findings were published in the journalHeart.The researchers acknowledged several limitations to their systematic review and meta analysis. There was a moderate to high risk of bias in most of the included studies, largely because of lack of information on missing data and imprecise measures of cannabis exposure. Most of them were observational and several used the same data.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cannabis is now generally more potent and has diversified into a wide array of inhaled high potency cannabis concentrates, synthetic psychoactive cannabinoids, and edibles, they added.They wrote: “How these changes affect cardiovascular risk requires clarification, as does the proportion of risk attributable to cannabinoids themselves versus particulate matter, terpenes or other components of the exposure.“Cannabis needs to be incorporated into the framework for prevention of clinical cardiovascular disease. So too must cardiovascular disease prevention be incorporated into the regulation of cannabis markets. Effective product warnings and education on risks must be developed, required, and implemented.“Cardiovascular and other health risks must be considered in the regulation of allowable product and marketing design as the evidence base grows. Today that regulation is focused on establishing the legal market with woeful neglect of minimising health risks.“Specifically, cannabis should be treated like tobacco: not criminalised, but discouraged, with protection of bystanders from secondhand exposure.”Explore more on these topicsCannabisDrugsHealthHeart diseaseStrokenewsShareReuse this content"

This process is seen as a notable disincentive, with the number of Albanian nationals seeking asylum in the UK having dropped sharply.“We’ve done a number of bilateral returns agreements,” Starmer said. “So the question is, again, whether it’s possible to go a bit beyond that. We are including looking at whether we can’t be a bit smarter with the use of our visas in return in relation to countries that don’t have a returns agreement with us.”This would be, he added, more “transactional” in approach.More widely, Starmer said he had spoken with France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, about asylum and small boats.He said: “I think we need to strengthen our existing tools, but then go further and see what else we can do. And that is a piece of work we’re looking at with the French in particular.”At the joint session on migration, Starmer said, he also put out proposals on “counter-terrorism, powers and sanctions”.He added: “I obviously raised it specifically, and indeed in detail, with President Macron, and in terms of the specific actions that I want us to take together, as I did with Giorgia Meloni, slightly more upstream with her, which is where she’s shown some success in reducing her own numbers, and with Friedrich Merz as well, because some of the boats are transiting through Germany.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumG7Keir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

But it’s one we will sort out.”Referencing recently reportedclaims of fraud by contractorssupplying workers, she will add: “There are allegations that parts of the supply chain have been defrauding taxpayers, and I have been clear that these need to be investigated rapidly and rigorously. If fraud is found, then the consequences will be felt by all involved.”Labour had the chance to finally kill off HS2. Instead, it’s throwing more money into the pit | Simon JenkinsRead moreALaboursource said: “The cost inflated out of all control, billions were wasted due to political indecision. There was a failure of ministerial oversight from the then transport secretary and a delivery company not fit for purpose. It’s a comedy of errors, but no one’s laughing.”The Conservatives were contacted for comment.Alexander will lay out the results of two reviews into the scheme: one by James Stewart into what went wrong and what it can teach ministers about how to run future infrastructure projects, and an initial assessment by Mark Wild, the chief executive of HS2 Ltd, looking at how and when to construct the rest of the phase oneline from London to Birmingham.The problems identified in those reports go beyond the escalating costs of tunnelling and environmental mitigations such asthe £100m bat tunnel, which has been singled out for criticism by the prime minister, Keir Starmer.Phase one of the HS2 scheme was projected in 2012 to cost £20bn, butmore recent estimatesnow put that figure at as much as £57bn. Wild’s review, according to sources quoted by the rail expert, Christian Wolmar, could lead to the full budget being restated at current prices at more than £100bn.Alexander will tell MPs that among the mistakes made by the previous government was the decision to sign a series of construction contracts despite having been advised by a review in 2020 not to do so until the scope of the project had been fully decided.TheOakervee review,which was commissioned by Boris Johnson as prime minister, recommended in 2020 that the government renegotiate key contracts to build the scheme and hold off signing further ones until making political decisions about its future.The transport secretary will tell MPs on Wednesday that contracts continued to be signed even when those decisions had yet to be made.Ministers were also commissioning two sets of designs for a new station at Euston at a total cost of over £250m, only to scrap both of them.

Furthermore, HS2 Ltd has formally reported the allegations to HMRC.”One of the measures Alexander is taking to try to get the project back on track is to appoint Mike Brown, the former commissioner ofTransportfor London (TfL), as the new chair of HS2 Ltd. He will replace Jon Thompson, who stepped down in the spring after a series of colourful public interventions, including disclosing the bat tunnel saga.Brown worked under and then succeeded the current rail minister, Lord Hendy, in running TfL.Meanwhile, Wild has written to Alexander setting out the broad terms of a “reset” for the project to keep costs down and get construction back on track. He carried out a similar role with TfL on the Elizabeth line to eventuallydeliver it successfullywithin a revised timescale and budget.However, in the short term it is likely to mean that HS2’s full opening, even on the reduced network, is pushed back further into the 2030s, while the budget is likely to soar in real terms.Explore more on these topicsHS2Rail transportTransportTransport policyRail industryLabournewsShareReuse this content"

But the lack of urgent action to come forward with a plan to address the fast-approaching cliff edge for under-pressure authorities would seem to suggest it is comfortable with the current state of affairs as normalised background noise.‘Ticking timebomb’: how Send spending could bankrupt English councilsRead more“Alarmingly, scrutiny of council finances can now provoke a sense of deja vu, with the same unfixed issues seen over and over.”Since 2021 councils have been able to keep high needs deficits off their balance sheets through a “statutory override” granted by the previous government. But the accounting manoeuvre expires in March 2026, the end of the current financial year.The inquiry said that the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the Treasury and the Department for Education “should work together to set out their solution for ensuring local authorities can achieve a sustainable financial position when the statutory override ends in March 2026. The solution must include how cumulative deficits will be treated.”Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said: “We expect the government to provide urgent clarity on how it plans to address high needs deficits, which are projected to rise to £5bn next year, as part of its forthcoming special educational needs and disabilities reforms.Ministers plan major changes to Send education in EnglandRead more“Over half of councils have warned us they will become insolvent next year when the statutory override flexibility ends and we continue to urge the government to write off these deficits.”The committee also accused the government of creating “significant uncertainty” over a string of promised reforms and reorganisations, including for funding, special needs provision and social care.Clifton-Brown said: “Aspirations for wide-ranging reforms seem to be unengaged with a reality in which local authorities do not have good and strong capacity to fundamentally change the way they work.”But Jim McMahon, minister of state for local government, said: “These claims are not supported by the evidence. From a standing start we have set out a clear plan to fix the foundations of local government and have wasted no time in taking action as part of our plan for change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sacoolas was not arrested, even though the police had every power to do so. She fled the country, and they didn’t tell us. They mishandled vital evidence, including Harry’s clothing, which we now know was left in storage for years with his remains still on it.“These are failures no family should ever have to endure.

This report is clear and unflinching. Now it has been published, I will ask the chief constable for assurance that the recommendations are being implemented, so that no other family has the same experience as Harry Dunn’s.”Radd Seiger, a spokesperson for Dunn’s family, said the report “lays bare a series of grave errors” but praised the force for “putting transparency first”. He said: “It marks a real turning point compared to the disastrous and toxic Adderley regime.”James said: “I hope some good comes out of this. We have taken a deep look at ourselves and hope the transparent way we have identified failings of the past will go some way to rebuilding the confidence of Harry’s family and friends going forward as well as of the wider public at large.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceNorthamptonshireUK criminal justiceEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

She is held in solitary confinement with access to the outside world strictly controlled and only rare supervised visits from her legal team.The videos, dated August and December 2022, show Aung San Suu Kyi appearing in a makeshift courtroom with deposed president Win Myint during military-run corruption trials that were condemned by the UN, US and EU as politically motivated. The cases contributed to her 33-year prison sentence.The footage and logs – shown to the Guardian by military defector group People’s Embrace – shed light on her condition and routine, amidconcerns from her family and supportersthat her health has seriously deteriorated and her life may be at risk.The logs cover a handful of days in January and February 2024 and detail a regimented life inside a specially built detention facility in Naypyidaw, the capital, in which she remains isolated from the outside world and the violent civil war engulfing her country.1:13Leaked footage shows Aung San Suu Kyi inside Myanmar courtroom – videoAMyanmarprison source, unaffiliated with the group, who last saw her in early 2024 confirmed the material.“Her voice and way of walking remained unchanged,” said the source. “She has stopped wearing flowers in her hair – partly because she doesn’t want to.”Medical concernsThe records raise concerns about Aung San Suu Kyi’s health and detail the medications she receives for a range of issues.Dr Aung Kyaw, 30, a former political prisoner jailed for treating anti-coup protesters, described her care as “rudimentary and basic”.“It addresses only the symptoms, not the root causes,” he said, adding that poor nutrition, lack of sunlight, and the risk of dehydration and heatstroke during central Myanmar’s sweltering summer could worsen her health. The records show that on at least one day the temperature in her room reached 31C.He added she might be especially vulnerable to Covid-19, tuberculosis and skin infections, which are common in Myanmar’s prisons.“The health implications of keeping someone who’s almost 80 in confined space and isolation, and cutting her connection with family and friends, can have a very heavy toll on her physical and mental health.”Meditation, reading, isolationLogs show her days as beginning at 4.30am and ending about 8.30pm. She meditates for over an hour each morning and walks around the room for evening exercise, using Buddhist prayer beads throughout the day.In one entry, she is recorded having a lunch of “two spoons of rice, chicken, fish balls soup, two pieces of chocolate, and a piece of dragon fruit” – her largest meal of the day.Meals in general are sparse: “two half-fried eggs” for breakfast; small portions of rice, meat or fish for lunch; soup and bread for dinner.Aung San Suu Kyi receives junta-controlled newspapers, providing some awareness of the civil war engulfing the country since 2021.Within days of her detention,peaceful protests erupted across Myanmar, but were violently suppressed by the military. In their wake emerged civilian resistance groups, some backed by ethnic armies that have fought for borderland autonomy for decades. The conflict has claimed thousands of lives, with the military accused of widespread atrocities.Aung San Suu Kyi has spent decades under some form of military detention; from 1989 to 2010 she was under house arrest at her family’s lakeside Yangon home because of her outspoken opposition to the military junta ruling Myanmar at that time.View image in fullscreenA policeman standing guard is surrounded by journalists outside the gate of the family house of detained Myanmar civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon on 5 February 2025.Photograph: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty ImagesDuring that period she maintained links with the outside world through radios on which she listened to the BBC World Service and Voice of America. In her current detention, Aung San Suu Kyi is not afforded the same privileges, however according to the source her legal team has managed to fulfil some of her requests for English-language books and French novels. The logs show she spends hours reading every day.Her son, Kim Aris, said his last contact with her was a letter “over two years ago” focused on “family matters”.“We know the military would censor everything. We don’t talk about anything political. I was filling her in with how my children are, and enquiring after her health, similar to what she does when she writes to me.”He said he would feel “so much happier” if she were in her Yangon home, where she had access to a doctor and some contact with the outside world. Since its coup, the military has made severalunsuccessful attempts to auction the property.“I am extremely concerned,” Aris said. “A lot of the world seems to think she’s under house arrest, and that’s just not the case. I don’t even know if she’s alive or not – there’s no way to confirm that.”Aris, who has been raising humanitarian funds for Myanmar, plans to run 80 kilometres over eight days ahead of her 80th birthday on 19 June.“She never wanted me to get involved in politics, but there are ways we can help,” he said. “I’ve never seen the situation in Burma this bad. It’s getting worse every day for everybody there.”The UN reported in January 2025 that nearly half of Myanmar’s population was living below the poverty line, with essential services crumbling and the economy in disarray.In June 2022, Aung San Suu Kyi’s legal team ordered a birthday cake featuring her photograph, according to a source familiar with the occasion. A small celebration was held after a court hearing, where she shared the cake with court staff and guards.Sean Turnell, an Australian economist who served as her adviser and was imprisoned in Myanmarbefore his release in November 2022, said she refused air conditioning because it was not available to other inmates.“They don’t mind us [high-profile prisoners] suffering, but they don’t want us to die,” he said. “It’s a dangerous game they’re playing.”He was sentenced in the same prefabricated courtroom shown in the videos, he said, located near the prison staff buildings within the compound in Naypyidaw.Turnell recalled when he last saw her after two years in detention she had “lost a hell of a lot of weight”, though her spirit remained “undiminished.”In April 2024, a junta spokesperson said Aung San Suu Kyi and Win Myint were moved to an unspecified site due to extreme heat – a claim the source believes may indicate transfer to a military compound.View image in fullscreenProtesters hold portraits of Aung San Suu Kyi and make three-finger salutes as Burmese people in Thailand gather outside the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok to mark two years since the military seized power from a democratically elected civilian government.Photograph: Peerapon Boonyakiat/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock‘Wait it out’On the military’s approach to Aung San Suu Kyi, Turnell said the junta appears content to “wait it out” – but warned of consequences if she were to die in custody.“There would be incredible anger in Burma,” he said, adding that her death could push non-aligned people into resistance.Inside Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi remains a revered figure – the daughter of independence hero Aung San and a symbol of the country’s pro-democracy struggle.Yet her international standing collapsed after 2017,when she defended Myanmar against genocide allegations at the international court of justiceover military atrocities against the Rohingya Muslim minority. Nearly a million Rohingya fled Myanmar to refugee camps in neighbouring Bangladesh.Democracy activist Nilar Thein, widow of dissident Ko Jimmy whose execution by the junta in 2022 caused international outrage, said the military fears Aung San Suu Kyi “because they know she would expose their wrongdoings” and “reinvigorate the resistance”.But, she added, the movement was not dependent on Aung San Suu Kyi’s release.“This is a popular uprising driven by the people themselves,” she said. “And it will continue to move forward.”The charges against the Nobel laureate – incitement, electoral fraud and corruption – have been dismissed by rights groups as a sham. In August 2023,the junta issued a partial pardon, reducing her sentence to 27 years – meaning she would be released aged 105.She is one of more than 29,200 people detained since the 2021 coup, according to monitoring group the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners.The junta did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsAung San Suu KyiMyanmarMyanmar coupSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Carla Foster was jailed in 2023 for an illegal abortion, before having hersentence suspended a month laterby the court of appeal. And just weeks ago,Nicola Packerwas cleared by a jury after spending almost five years facing the threat of prison.British women are being jailed under archaic abortion laws. MPs can act to end that this week | Frances RyanRead moreThirteen people, both men and women, made a first appearance at magistrates court charged with abortion-related offences in 2022, according to freedom of information data from the Crown Prosecution Service, compared with four people in 2019 and three in both 2020 and 2021.Data from about half of Britain’s police forces showed at least 11 people were arrested in 2023 on suspicion of child destruction or inducing a miscarriage, including a 31-year-old woman in north Wales “reported to have taken illicit substances to initiate an abortion”.There are several more known cases of women arrested in the past 18 months that are not included in the data.In the last parliament, Diana Johnson, now a Home Office minister, attempted to change the law by bringing an amendment to the previous government’s criminal justice bill, but the 2024 general election meant the legislation never made its way through parliament.Parliament had already brought in a move towards more liberal abortion laws. In 2020 telemedicine brought the biggest reform to abortion provision in England and Wales since the 1967AbortionAct, which set out the current framework by which terminations can be carried out.Instead of women seeking a termination in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy needing to take the first pill under medical supervision, they could receive both pills by post after a remote consultation.Although it was introduced as an emergency measure during the pandemic, telemedicine was made permanent in 2022, with MPs voting 215 in favour to 188 against. The same year, parliament also voted 297-110 to introduce safe access zones, commonly known as “buffer zones” around clinics, to stop women seeking abortion care from being harassed by protesters.In 2019, Northern Ireland’s abortion laws were also modernised, with terminations allowed up to 12 weeks, and later under limited circumstances.In a referendum in 2018,Irelandhad also made abortion legal on request up to 12 weeks, and later if the foetus would be likely to die before or shortly after birth or if there is a risk of death or serious harm to a pregnant woman.In both Northern Ireland and Ireland, the culpability for a termination carried out outside legal time frames lies with anyone who assists a woman procure an abortion, rather than the woman herself. Both countries had also previously had some of the strictest abortion laws in the world, with terminations banned in almost all circumstances.In other parts of the world, change is moving in the opposite direction. In June 2022, the United States supreme court overturned the decision ofRoe v Wade, and ruled there was no constitutional right to abortion. Laws are instead now decided state by state, with19 of them either banning abortion or restricting access.Parliament’s latest vote is unlikely be the last on the subject. Medics, lawyers, politicians and campaigners recognise that the 1967 act is in need of reform.Work to establish what a new framework should look like has already begun, but as Louise McCudden, UK head of external affairs at MSI Reproductive Choices, a reproductive health NGO, said: “Getting abortion law reform right will take time, and we want to make sure we do that in a way that takes into account expert opinion, takes into account women’s voices [and] human rights groups.”But, McCudden said: “The women who are being investigated and facing prosecution and jail can’t afford to wait.” And parliament’s latest vote means that now there will be no more Carla Fosters, or Nicola Packers.Explore more on these topicsAbortionWomenHealthHouse of CommonsRoe v WadeIrelandNorthern IrelandanalysisShareReuse this content"

There are co-director credits for Pixar stalwarts Adrian Molina (who was the co-director and co-screenwriter ofCoco) and feature first-timer Madeline Sharafian, and Pixar will be hoping for a handsome return here to match the success of its recent box office champInside Out 2.Elio may well indeed do the business. It has charm, likability and that potent ingredient: childhood loneliness and vulnerability. Its opening act is set aboard a military base where an ambitious young officer has postponed or even abandoned her dream of being astronaut to look after her orphaned nephew. But once the film leaves planet Earth and its recognisably real, lump-in-the-throat emotional world and inhabits the goofy multi-voiced arena of space aliens, it loses, for me, a little (though not all) of its charge. There is occasionally something a little formulaic, a bit programmatic and … well … which two letters of the alphabet sum it up?The film takes place in the present day, though references to “ham radios” might confuse you a little. Yonas Kibreab voices Elio, a little boy with a tousled short haircut, like Barry who opens the door to the aliens in Close Encounters, or Alfred E Neuman on the front of Mad magazine. He is deeply traumatised and depressed by the death of his mum and dad and now lives on the base with his aunt Olga, voiced byZoe Saldaña, a smart, squared-away young unmarried officer who is now his legal guardian. She is at her wit’s end, utterly at a loss as to how to get through to him.A visit to the space-exploration museum turns things around. Elio is thrilled by the exhibit dedicated to Nasa’s Voyager 1 space probe which launched in 1977, sending out a message of peace to any life forms in outer space. So he starts transmitting poignant pleas to any intergalactic life form to abduct him because no one loves him down here on Earth. (Here, the movie surely missed a trick in not usingthe Carpenters’ version of Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Crafton the soundtrack.) Due to a bizarre quirk of events, Elio finds himself being mistaken for Earth’s official ambassador by a benign, UN-style outer space assembly called the Communiverse, and asked to negotiate on their behalf with the aggressive alien Lord Grigon (voiced by Brad Garrett) who wants to take everything over. Elio fatefully makes contact with Grigon’s troubled, peaceful son Glordon (Remy Edgerly).View image in fullscreenA bizarre turn of events … Elio.Photograph: PixarThere are plenty of nice touches. Before starting negotiations with the terrifying Lord Grigon, Elio has schooled himself in what can only be called the art of the deal, and reminds himself: “Start from a position of power.” Whoever can have inspired screenwriters Julia Cho, Mark Hammer and Mike Jones on this? And given that the film was ready in 2023, could it be that they considered this person a harmless figure of fun, apt for marginal humour and safely confined to the dustbin of history?Maybe. The cosmic crisis continues, complicating Elio’s relationship with Glordon – leading to a very Spielbergian near-death incident – and with his ersatz mother. Plot developments mean, perhaps oddly, that Elio has to wear a blue eyepatch for much of the movie, a contrivance that facilitates an identity reveal. Overall, it’s an entertaining bit of summer fun.Elio is out on 19 June in Australia, and on 20 June in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmScience fiction and fantasy filmsFamily filmsPixarZoe SaldañareviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s a taste of her invaluable adviceHarry SmithTue 17 Jun 2025 12.48 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 13.01 EDTShareKim Woodburn, best known for the Channel 4 show How Clean is Your House?,has died aged 83after a short illness. Along with her co-host Aggie MacKenzie, she took people to task on their dirty and cluttered homes.Woodburn’s trademark plaited bun and sharp tongue were recognisable to millions, and many found her cleaning advice invaluable for keeping their homes spotless. Here are her top five tips:Keep it naturalWoodburn was well known for not using harsh chemicals, instead preferring natural household solutions such as baking soda and white vinegar. Over the years, these two common household items became something of a trademark of hers, as she appreciated them for their kindness on the skin and gentler impact on the home.All it takes is 10 minutes a dayThe Queen of Clean said in a 2022 interview that to avoid your home becoming like the ones you often see on TV. “10 minutes every day and you can keep everything manageable”.Little and often was the key: she encouraged people to do just 10 minutes a day or, if they couldn’t manage that, to “clean as you go”.The kitchen is the heart of the homeAccording to Woodburn, wiping down appliances and cleaning up spills straight away are essential in the kitchen. In particular, cleaning inside the fridge every two months with a cloth dipped in warm water and bicarbonate soda are key.“When you start going over that timeframe, by God, you’re asking for trouble,” she said. Along with binning leftover food, these tasks were essential to avoid attracting flies or worse – the unwanted attention of pets.Use a wet feather dusterThis method catches dust and stops it spreading around the home. Once you’re done, wait for it to dry then shake it out outside or into the bin.When hosting a party, lay down the lawWhen giving advice on hosting a house party, Woodburn kept it simple: don’t have one. For her, a party meant mucky beggars messing up her home. But if you were brave enough (or foolish enough) to ignore her and go ahead anyway, the advice was equally to the point.Before the party say: “This is what’s going to happen. I love you, but if you’re not willing to adhere to these rules, mate, you can’t come.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The water comes from an artesian well close to this small, rickety dressing room that doubles as a clubhouse. They say it flows from 80 metres underground and should be consumed just like this, served a little above body temperature and sipped gently so the body’s cells can properly hydrate. Nobody at FK Real Pharma would drink anything else before training and Lykhovydov swears by an extra benefit. “A doctor from Dynamo Kyiv told me this is the best water in Ukraine,” he announces. “It is the secret of eternal youth.”Whether marvel or myth, the regimen is serving Lykhovydov well. He turned 59 in January and is, as far as anybody knows, the oldest active professional footballer in the world. At almost a year older than the Japanese greatKazuyoshi Miurahe lays convincing claim to the record and has no intention of stopping here. He can still do a job in the Ukrainian third tier. “I was thinking I’d make it to 50,” he says. “But now I’m almost 60 I won’t put limits on myself.”A goods train rattles along the railway line on a raised bank behind the building. The effort needed to keep Ukraine moving in wartime is lost on nobody in Odesa’s northern suburbs, which have spent nearly three and a half years under constant threat. Lykhovydov moves outside as it passes and situates himself next to a small putting green; the rest of Real Pharma’s players have finished the first phase of today’s training session and shortly he will join them on Stadion Ivan’s pitch.There is a specific procedure to undergo first. “Like the haka,” he laughs while administering a full-body pat-down that he says loosens the muscles and promotes lymph drainage. About 15 years ago he felt an inflamed sciatic nerve and was advised such a warm-up could keep him playing. He jogs over to his teammates, many of them less than a third of his age, and takes command of the nearest available ball.These are modest surroundings, the seating that flanks one side of the field never extending beyond two rows deep. Behind the far corner flag is a large cage housing chickens and cockerels. Real Pharma play their home games here and it is often a struggle: when we meet they are nailed on to finish bottom of the second league’s Group A, although there will at least be no relegation. “Four of our players are 17,” says Borys Tyshkul, the sporting director, as he watches the session. “Youngsters can sign their first pro agreements with us and maybe it’s a passport for them to climb higher. They earn €200 (£170) or €300 a month plus a win bonus but there have only been two of those this season.”View image in fullscreenMykola Lykhovydov played 11 times in the 2024-25 season, scoring two goals.Lykhovydov is an outlier in this team of raw hopefuls, many of them the products of local academies such as the nearby giants Chernomorets. But he has made a contribution to their campaign as a poised attacking midfielder through semi-regular starts and judiciously chosen cameos from the bench. The previous week he played his 11th and, it turns out, final match of 2024-25; those outings brought two goals, both from the penalty spot. “If I’ve gone out there and brought results then I’ll probably start the next game,” he says. “Otherwise, most likely I’ll be on the bench and play a few minutes at the end. If my performance is low, I won’t play much.”A significant further dimension comes into play here: it bears mentioning that Lykhovydov is also Real Pharma’s president and, through the pharmaceutical company he runs, its owner. “I dreamed of being a pro, I wanted to play at a high level,” he says. “So I grabbed this dream with my own hands, and made it myself.”It should be emphasised that he was no dilettante when, in July 2011 and at the age of 45, he finally made his professional debut in a match against Prykarpattya Ivano-Frankivsk. He had shown considerable promise as a youngster before his parents, a working-class couple employed by a coal mine in Kuyalnik, insisted he prioritise his education. He taught Ukrainian history at Odesa’s medical university before starting his business but football remained a daily presence.“I’d created teams ever since childhood,” he says. “At school, in my home village Novaya Kovalivka, at university, then at senior level.” As a player-coach he enjoyed success in regional competitions, eventually creating the club that became Real Pharma at the turn of the millennium. They won three consecutive Odessa cup competitions at amateur level before turning professional in 2011. Lykhovydov may have built himself a dream, but Real Pharma had proved themselves ready to make the next step.There have been flirtations with greater success across 14 years and, for Lykhovydov, close to 200 appearances. A bittersweet memory is the final matchday in 2016-17, when Real Pharma were a win from the playoffs for promotion to the second tier. “We had to beat Nyva Vinnytsia,” he remembers. “They dominated but 10 minutes before the end our right-back scored. We were super happy but they equalised late on and that was it. It was a range of emotions only sport can give you. I don’t know where I can find a similar rush.”At this level of Ukrainian football it is, given the wider context, a minor miracle Real Pharma can keep going at all. A few hours later that fact is reiterated when, while sitting in the Lykhovydov family’s back yard, an explosion caused by a ballistic missile attack on nearby Chernomorsk makes the ground shake. Earlier in the war, two missiles destroyed a building 100 metres away while his wife, Viktoriia, and daughter Lada were at home.“A week after Russia’s invasion we gathered for training,” Lykhovydov says. “Of course, in those early days, half the players told me they wanted to join the army. I went to the mobilisation point with my son Andriy but they had no weapons left so told us they would be in touch later. So I had to tell the players: ‘Let’s do what we love and know, playing football, and see how it goes.’ This is our life now.”On 24 February 2022, the first day of the full-scale invasion, Lykhovydov drove to Odesa’s city centre to make sure his 50 employees had enough cash to spend in the absence of functioning ATMs. Later he began delivering medicines and other practical aid such as heaters, sourced through his company, to soldiers based near the frontline. As the situation in parts of southern Ukraine snowballed into a full-blown humanitarian crisis, he brought children’s clothes and food to some of the worst-affected areas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We felt all of Europe with us. In 2022 there was such a huge uprising of spirits that, if we’d received all the weapons we needed, we would have won the war already.”That day is yet to arrive, so Lykhovydov continues to juggle business with football. He describes how corruption, a wearingly familiar staple in Odesa since the collapse of the USSR, virtually ceased three years ago but has made a return in subtler ways through spurious check-ups and fines. “If it wasn’t for football I wouldn’t be able to do the rest of my work,” he says. “It gives me strength and inspiration to do other things.”View image in fullscreenMykola Lykhovydov has helped Ukraine’s war effort since 2022.Photograph: FK Real PharmaHe makes sure Real Pharma’s players are paid on time. On a typical week he will join them for three of their four training sessions, devoting the rest of his day to company business. “I’ll often take a 15- or 20-minute nap some time between 4pm and 6pm,” he says. “But not half an hour, that’s too much.”Can he still pull his weight? “He doesn’t have speed but has good vision,” laughs the 25-year-old Andriy, who has captained Real Pharma and made his own piece of history when debuting at the age of 14 years, nine months and five days in 2014. “Call him Zidane.” Even if his teenaged companions do most of the running for him, on the training pitch there is ample evidence of a cushioned first touch and varied passing range.Lykhovydov has undoubtedly been fortunate: he has possessed the means to turn a pipedream into solid, material reality. But there is little querying his seriousness, both when channelled towards Real Pharma’s future and maintaining his own spry physical condition. “It was never my aim to be the world’s oldest player, that possibility only occurred to me a couple of years ago,” he says. The club have written to Fifa, which is yet to provide official confirmation of the record.When the war has finished, Real Pharma hope to leverage some of Tyshkul’s international contacts and sign players from countries such as Georgia, Serbia and Poland. They would like to make a go of things. Perhaps, at that point, time and sporting imperatives may overtake Lykhovydov at last. “I will always have an opportunity to finish,” he says. There is little suggestion that he will take it just yet.Explore more on these topicsFootballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Don’t tell me it’s “competitive”– tell me if I’ll be able to afford to eat.You’re in luck – one suggestion is making employers include salary bracket or specific salary in job ads. Others include banning asking candidates about their pay history and making the provision of clear information on pay structures and career progression mandatory.Didn’t the EU do something similar recently?Yes, theEU Pay Transparency Directive, which comes into force next year, introduces similar measures – it also bans pay secrecy clauses, which stop employees from discussing their salaries with colleagues.Good stuff. So whatis the problem?Well, speaking of discussing what you earn, one ofthe other measures the UK is consideringis “providing employees with information on their pay level and how their pay compares with those doing the same role or work of equal value”.So?

But what if, under these new proposed rules, you found out that he was?I would go full Godzilla, ripping through the open space screaming,tearing out cables and kicking over bins.You see the problem. There’s a certain potential for, let’s say, tension, if people find out they’re earning less than their colleagues (especially crap ones).But, come on, how likely is it that employers will be forced, or choose, to reveal specific individualised information on who earns exactly what?Admittedly, very unlikely – this is all still theoretical. But look what happenedwhen the BBC published pay bracket information on presenters? All hell broke loose!You mean a scandalous gender pay gap was exposed and addressed?I see your point. But we’re funny about money –a 2021 pollfound 36% of British people don’t even tell their spouses what they earn. Pay transparency provisions are definitely a good thing, but this could get messy.Do say:“So how much do you earn?”Don’t say:“£7,840 more than you and I’m worth every penny, Darren.”Explore more on these topicsWork & careersPass notesGender pay gapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He had achieved many hallmarks of adulthood: a college degree, a career he enjoyed, and two beloved dogs. But he’d never had a relationship, or even a sexual partner.This weighed heavy on him; he craved the experience of a deep romantic connection and wondered how it might feel to be in love.Matt, who is using a pseudonym, grew up in a fundamentalist Christian household where sex and masturbation were considered sins. The only message he could ever remember hearing was that it would ruin his life and condemn him to hell.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Though he’d drifted from evangelicalism, sexual shame still clung to him. Around his birthday, he decided to experiment and bought a male sex toy. But after unwrapping the bulky plastic object and fumbling with it, he felt nothing.“I felt so embarrassed and stupid,” he said. “I’m 40 and I don’t even know how to use this thing.”Frustrated, he vented in a Facebook group for ex-evangelicals, ranting about how he’d never learned even the basics of sex. It struck a chord. With 30,000 members, the group regularly discusses sexuality and relationships. Members trade stories, comfort each other, and share resources – books, therapists, anything that might help.Curious about sex parties? Here’s what they’re really likeRead moreOne commenter recommended a private group: the Purity Culture Dropout Program, run by sex educator Erica Smith. It offers sex-ed lessons and a safe space for people to unpack fear, compare upbringings, and confront the shame they’ve internalized.Matt enthusiastically signed up.Purity culture – the conservative Christian belief in abstaining from sex until marriage – boomed in the 1990s and early 2000s, just as Matt was a teen.In 1993, the Southern Baptist Convention launched its“true love waits” program, which encouraged teens to take “pledges” promising to save themselves for marriage. Books such asI Kissed Dating Goodbye(1997), gave teens strict instructions not to date for fun.Purity ballspopped up, where girls attended with their fathers, who vowed to “protect” their daughters’ virginity.By the 2000s, purity culture was mainstream. The Jonas brothers wore true love waits “purity rings.” But it wasn’t just a church thing – its leaders pushed it as a national issue.In 1994, “true love waits” gathered thousands of teens in Washington, carpeting the National Mall with 200,000 pink, yellow, and blue pledge cards. Two years later, Bill Clinton signed a bill funding abstinence-only sex ed at $50m a year. The Bush administration expanded it, despite mounting evidence that abstinence-only education didn’t reduce teen sexual activity.Purity culture enforced rigid gender roles: men were cast as aggressors; girls were told not to tempt them. Both ended up alienated from their bodies and desires.But rarely do we hear about heterosexual men raised in this ideology. Purity culture “tells men they’re supposed to lead”, says former minister and religion scholar Bradley Onishi, co-host of the podcast Straight White American Jesus. “It says God made you aggressive, an uncontrollable sexual beast.”“If men don’t heal from purity culture, they’ll keep hurting themselves and others,” he adds. “They won’t form healthy relationships – romantic, familial, professional, or political.”Joshua Harris, author of I Kissed Dating Goodbye, has since apologized for the fear he instilled and the false promise that his method would lead to a happy ending.Too little, too late, perhaps. Today, 17 US states still offer abstinence-only sex ed – and they have higher-than-average teen pregnancy rates.Matt was born in 1982 in Pennsylvania. His father was heavily involved with the Independent Fundamentalist Baptist church, a deeply conservative denomination that believes men have divine authority over women and children. Weekends meant choir practice and pledging allegiance to the American flag near the pulpit.As a child, Matt was quiet and empathetic. He couldn’t play sports due to a heart condition and instead enjoyed music and art – activities his community considered feminine. “I got the message early that there was something inappropriate about that,” he said. “The message was men should be strong and tough.”Formal sex education was off-limits in his house. However, like many children, he discovered masturbation around the age of nine or 10 – even though he did not understand what it was. “Sometimes I had trouble falling asleep, and I realised that touching myself was soothing,” he said.At 11, his father caught him in the act and dragged him to the dining room, where his mother was helping Matt’s younger brother with homework. “He was yelling at me, screaming ‘Are you sexually active?’” Matt remembered. “I felt so humiliated, I just wanted to melt into a puddle on the floor.”Weeks later, his Sunday school teacher told the class Magic Johnson’s HIV diagnosis was God’s punishment for sexual sin.“I immediately started panicking,” Matt said. “I figured I must have made some kind of sexual sin, and that was why my dad had been so angry. So I thought I must have made God just as angry.”He soon found himself in a repetitive loop, promising God not to masturbate again, then breaking his promise and praying for forgiveness.“I think I eventually figured out you can’t catch HIV from masturbating,” he recalled dryly. “But by then, I was receiving all kinds of other purity culture messages.”As he moved through his teens, the purity industry was booming. Matt’s youth pastors read passages from I Kissed Dating Goodbye and explained that sexual contact would ruin their future marriages. They compared pre-marital sex to a piece of gum: the more times it’s chewed, the less appealing it is.“The idea of sexual sin terrified me,” Matt remembered. Whenever he came across pornography or sex scenes in movies, they didn’t make him feel aroused: “Which made me feel smug, like I was more godly than other boys.”According to his church’s teachings, this godly behavior would be rewarded with a perfect relationship, and Matt still craved a romantic connection. But he wasn’t sure how to turn any of his friendships with girls into something deeper.“From what I was taught, it seemed you were friends with someone and at some point it would just happen,” he said. “But I didn’t know how to make it happen.”The Purity Culture Dropout Program costs $50 a month. It offers two live lessons per month, a lesson archive, and a private discussion space.The first session Matt joined, in 2024, tackled the myth of porn addiction. Most experts don’t consider it physically addictive, though it can become compulsive. Matt shared that youth leaders had told him porn would destroy his life.“The responses were so open and accepting – it felt safe,” he said.Smith, the course founder, wasn’t raised in purity culture but has seen its wreckage firsthand. She has an MA in Education from Widener University’s Center for HumanSexualityStudies and previously taught sex ed to young women and LGBTQ youth in Philadelphia’s juvenile justice system.She’s watched the post-2016 wave of religious “deconstruction” accelerate during Covid. “People were leaving churches and saying, ‘I need sex ed. I need someone to talk to,’” she said.When she launched the program in 2019, most clients were women. Now, more men are signing up – often nudged by partners or female friends.She sees two main groups: men who rushed into marriage to have sex, only to end up in dysfunctional relationships; and men like Matt, who arrive at adulthood with no sexual experience at all.“So many struggle with sexual thoughts, body image, and basic confidence,” Smith said. “And when it comes to dating, they don’t know where to begin.”Sex therapist Jeremiah Gibson often quips that “you don’t need to have grown up in the church to be fucked over by the church”. Along with his partner Julia Postema, he specialises in working with couples who’ve left high-control religions. The pair also host a podcast,Sexvangelicals, with the tagline: “The sex education the church didn’t want you to have.”Both were raised in fundamentalist traditions and married – then subsequently divorced – while young. They partly blame purity culture for those relationship breakdowns; none of them had the emotional tools to discuss the crucial components of a life lived together.“Communicating your sexual needs and desires is one of the most vulnerable things you can do,” Gibson said. “One of the theories in sex therapy is that if couples can solve problems around sexuality, then they can solve problems around anything.”“Purity culture can really dehumanize both men and women,” added Postema. She says the men she works with are often stuck in a “double-bind” of being told God made them insatiable sexual creatures, but that they must also constantly fight this God-given nature.Gibson believes that comprehensive sex education would not just help couples have healthier sex lives, but would go some way to reducing wider divisions in society.“If it were a part of our curriculum, I think that we would have better ways of resolving differences,” Gibson said. “We wouldn’t be excoriating people who have different values to us. We’d see an increase in both men’s and women’s ability to communicate clearly and concisely.”Nathanial, or “Nate”, now 37, grew up attending a non-denominational evangelical megachurch in upstate New York. Religion trickled down to every aspect of family life.In his early teens he joined a church-based men’s “accountability group”. These sprung up around the country during the 1990s, with the most famous being Focus on the Family’sPromise Keepers. Youth leaders encouraged the boys to confess every time they “stumbled” by looking at porn or masturbating. Nate and his peers shared tactics on how to resist sin, such as snapping an elastic band around their wrist when they had “impure thoughts”.“What that does – or at least, what it did in my mind – is that all women are viewed as potential wives,” he said. “It frames women as not people, but as plot devices in your life.”Nate met his first girlfriend at church when he was 16 and asked her out by telling her he could see them getting married one day. The pair were determined to keep their relationship as Godly as possible. The one time the couple went slightly further than kissing, “she was so upset she didn’t speak to me for a whole week”.He met his now-wife, Katy, on a study abroad program in France and got married at 23. Though they were beginning to question evangelical teachings, they still waited until their wedding to have sex – partly because Katy, who’d never received sex education, was terrified of getting pregnant.But their combined lack of experience placed a strain on the relationship. Katy had been taught in church to submit to her husband, that she should never refuse him sex, and that men needed to have sex daily. When Nate would sometimes rather – in his words – “eat ice cream and watch TV”, she’d feel upset and rejected.“There were times where it was uncomfortable, because we had certain expectations of what the opposite sex wanted,” said Katy. “And when that wasn’t the case, it felt very confusing.”Therapists working with couples in similar situations often witness relationships break down entirely. But over time, Nate and Katy learned to discuss what they were experiencing. These conversations led them to completely pick apart purity culture, and they eventually left evangelical Christianity in favour of the liberalELCA church.“In a weird way, [purity culture] helped us communicate – we didn’t have previous partners to figure things out with, so we had to figure them out together,” Katy said.Hearing about women’s experiences in evangelical culture has played a big role in helping Nate question the ideas around gender he grew up with. “For us boys, the teachings were always very internal, policing our thoughts and feelings,” he said. Katy, on the other hand, was taught from an early age to not tempt men to stray, to always dress modestly and never do anything that could be misconstrued as flirting: “It sounds like so much pressure, having to monitor your surroundings.”The experience has shaped how the couple are raising their six-year-old daughter and ten-year-old son. “I want my daughter to have full information about her body – I don’t want her to go through what I did,” said Katy. As for their son, “I just want him to understand that women are people,” said Nate.Today, most of the purity balls and rings are gone, only to be replaced by Christian influencers. “I see this new generation of TikTok and Instagram influencers talking about how wonderful it is to follow God and wait until marriage for sex,” says Smith. She also sees purity messaging being absorbed into new-age spirituality, with ideas about the “divine masculine or feminine” mirroring the same rigid gender roles.As he made his way through the Purity Culture Dropout Program, Matt began sifting through childhood memories. “I see so much that triggered shame, and that probably made me the way that I am,” he said.As someone who doesn’t feel much arousal from typical erotic material, the course has helped him realise he may fall somewhere on the asexuality spectrum. “But the question I still have is: Was I always that way? Or is it because of purity culture?” he said. “I think it really installed a fear of anything sexual in me.”Matt still longs for a romantic connection, but the idea of embarking on one remains daunting. “Not having any of that practice that most people have had, and having this trauma, it all makes me a bit nervous at the idea of going into relationships,” he said. “I don’t know if that will ever change.”Explore more on these topicsSexSexualitySexual consentRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nowadays, that could lead to some very awkward conversationsTue 17 Jun 2025 13.07 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 20.06 EDTShareSarah Jessica Parker, the Sex and the City star andBooker prize judge, has a nifty trick for getting out of taking selfies with her fans. “I did this for a really, really long time and it worked for ever,” Parker said in aninterview with Howard Stern. “I used to say, ‘I can’t, because of the government,’ and I’d do this,” Parker said, pointing up to the sky. “It really confused people. This was through different administrations, so it wasn’t political.”It is not entirely clear why Parker – who has saidshe refuses to take selfiesand would rather “have a conversation” instead because “it’s much more meaningful” – stopped using this brilliant excuse. But one does have to wonder whether it is because the US has become a nation ofconspiracy theorists. Rather than backing away from the weird “the government is watching” woman, perhaps fans started to excitedly engage her with theories about how Bill Gates has implanted us all with mind-controlling microchips. Or maybe she just got tired of the joke. I don’t know. But I’m sure someone out there (the government) does.Conspiracy theories have become so mainstream that they are even prompting nonsensical legislation. Earlier this month, Louisiana lawmakers sent a bill to the state’s governor seeking to ban “chemtrails” – which don’t actually exist. They are a longstanding conspiracy which posits that the white lines sometimes left behind by aircraft aren’t just due to condensed water vapour but are far more sinister. Somepeople believethat the government is spraying toxic metals to reduce populations; others believe they are evidence that dark forces are trying to control the weather or people’s minds.Lawmakers inat least 11 otherstates are trying to advance similar “chemtrail” bans. “Every bill like this is kind of symbolic, or is introduced to appease a very vocal group, but it can still cause real harm by signalling that these conspiracies deserve this level of legal attention,” a member of the National Association for Media Literacy Educationtold the Associated Press.Also causing real harm in the US with his obsession with imaginary problems is health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. The vaccine sceptic recently firedevery single memberof a critical advisory committee on immunisation practices. He has replaced them with people who reportedly have very little vaccine expertise and areaccused of spreading misinformation. The ousted members of the vaccine committee have said that the shake-up may “impact people’s access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses.”RFK Jr is also fixated on conspiracy theories about fluoride,which he calls “a dangerous neurotoxin”. There are, to be clear, valid concerns about ingesting too much fluoride, including its effects on IQ as well as potential tooth discoloration. But experts are pretty unanimous that fluoride in drinking water is a great public health achievement that has done wonders forpreventing tooth decay. There are worries that RFK Jr’s meddling will cause a significant increase in dental cavities,especially among childrenin lower-income groups.Anyway, I’ve got a good idea for Parker. Since acting like a conspiracy theorist no longer seems to ward off unwanted attention, why not try engaging selfie-seeking fans with a rational fact-based discussion? Increasingly large numbers of Americans seem allergic to that; some fans will immediately run a mile. I have some other thoughts too but I’m afraid I can’t elaborate any more on this issue for top secret reasons. But here’s a hint: it’s because of the government.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Not only in confronting the horrific crimes committed against vulnerable girls in towns such as Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford and Telford, but in deciding how we respond to them as a country.The Casey reviewoffers a sobering account of institutional failure. These girls were not simply let down. They were failed by systems and individuals tasked with their protection. That must never happen again. Justice, accountability and reform are essential.I write to you as a British Muslim, a third-generation British Pakistani woman, and someone who has worked with communities across the country, to express deep concern about how this issue is being spoken about and misrepresented.You asked Lady Casey to examine ethnicity alongside “cultural and social drivers”. The review identifies disproportionate numbers of Asian men among suspects in Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. At the same time, it stresses that national data is incomplete and inconsistent. These findings are in tension. Yet the media and political response has amplified a simplified message: that there was a cover-up and that ethnicity itself was the cause.Louise Casey is right: children must be saved from grooming gangs. But the culture warriors must be ignored | Polly ToynbeeRead moreIn areas where British Pakistani communities are more populous, over-representation may reflect local demographics, not cultural traits. Without that context, statistics are easily distorted. Crime patterns often follow social conditions. They do not reveal cultural predisposition.The way this has been framed has caused widespread fear and alarm. Over the past few days, I have received messages from friends and colleagues anxious about the direction of the national conversation. Terms like “Pakistani rape gangs” or “Asian grooming gangs” have dominated headlines. Social media are awash with commentators calling for the death penalty and a ban on Pakistani migration, while asitting MP has called for deportationsin the “many, many thousands”. A complex issue is being reduced to harmful generalisations.The claim that British Pakistani culture itself is to blame for these crimes is not only untrue – it is a dangerous distortion,when child sexual exploitation and abuse affects the entire country. There is no credible evidence to suggest that ethnicity or religion are driving factors in this form of abuse. Turning this into a question of identity rather than accountability shifts attention away from the very systems that failed to protect vulnerable girls. It allows prejudice to masquerade as policy, and that cannot go unchallenged.When culture is invoked without evidence or definition, it does more than obscure the facts – it casts entire groups of people under suspicion. This has real consequences for people like me, my family and neighbours, who are being viewed not as citizens, but as potential threats. The risk now is that prejudice is embedded into policy. Institutional failures in safeguarding and accountability thus become repurposed to legitimise the collective blame of British Muslims.We have already seen what this kind of framing can provoke. Last summer,riots eruptedin cities across England and Northern Ireland, stoked by misinformation and inflammatory rhetoric.Mosques and community centres were attacked. Vehicles were stopped because drivers “looked Asian”. Just days ago, in Ballymena, there were racially motivated attacks on foreigners that “left families cowering in their homes”,according to the police, after days of disorder that left communities in fear and distress. Even in Liverpool, after a car was driven into fans gathered for a football parade, police were quick to confirm the suspect’s ethnicity, a reflection of how heightened the atmosphere has become, and the fear that misinformation could spark race-related unrest. This is the climate in which any government intervention now sits. The need for not just reason and calm but a principled defence of minority communities, of fairness and proportion, is urgent.The pain of the survivors must remain at the centre of this conversation. Justice for them is non-negotiable. We must also not forget that some victims came from the very minority communities that are now under scrutiny. Their experiences are often erased. The perpetrators did not care who their victims were. Their motives were abuse, control and exploitation.The Casey review presents an opportunity to strengthen safeguarding and rebuild trust. We can only do that if we stay grounded in evidence, not prejudice, and in responsibility, not rhetoric.The forthcoming inquiry must examine how these crimes were allowed to happen, how institutions failed to respond and how to prevent such abuse in future. It must not allow the story to become one of racialised suspicion. That path leads not to justice, but to division.British Muslims, like all citizens, want justice and safety. We want our institutions to act fairly and with integrity. What we do not want is to be made to feel complicit in crimes we did not commit.Criminals must face the law, whoever they are.Zara Mohammed is former secretary-general of the Muslim Council of BritainDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After another stunning defeat, in which we slipped from a mediocre seventh or eighth back to last place, having had 20 points deducted because I poked the quiz guy with a pencil, I’m ready to pass on some basic quizdom.First, don’t poke the quiz guy with a pencil. Don’t harangue the marking team or try to cut a deal. In fact, keep all extra-team interactions at zero. Forget the captain, forget the person with the best handwriting, choose your most emollient member and make them do the talking for all of you.Second, the easier a round sounds, the harder it will be. You’ll take a look at “condiments” and think it’s a shoo-in because you know what it’s called when they mix beetroot with horseradish; then you’ll be asked who designed the logo for Colman’s in 1814.Third, dead wood always gets a bad name in this environment, but good-hearted, neutral players who don’t have much to add beyond “yes, Manchester City sounds plausible” are much more useful than anyone with a strong view.Fourth, if you really want to help, learn one of the following and forget everything else: the entire London underground map; the county town of every British county; all the Doctor Who leads. Maybe that will make you the hero three times in your life, maybe you’ll never use it, but you’ll stave off cognitive decline. It’s win-win.Fifth, that song title will come to you eventually; you just have to stop time and cast a sleeping spell over everyone else in the room. If, for any reason, this option isn’t available to you, will you just for the love of God get over yourself?This is really just a long and very public way of saying: sorry, team; sorry, quizmaster; sorry, other teams; sorry, world of general knowledge.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPubsOpinionHobbiescommentShareReuse this content"

If he intervenes, he’ll undermine his own foreign policyTue 17 Jun 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 12.41 EDTShareDuring his three presidential campaigns,Donald Trumpran as an opponent of serial military interventions and wars of “regime change” à la Iraq and Libya, which neoconservatives and liberal internationalists alike had embraced after the end of the cold war. He correctly sensed that many Americans had tired of “forever wars”.Benjamin Netanyahu’s attack on Iran is a watershed moment for Trump. It will force him to reveal whether he truly represents a clean break with the foreign policy establishment, often referred to as “the blob”, or is in fact a continuation of it. It all depends on whether he decides to join Israel’s attacks on Iran.Trump faces a tough choice. Israel has strong, longstanding, deep and variegated support in the US, and Netanyahu may seek substantial American military engagement, even military intervention. He’s already begun setting the stage. In a flattery-filledbirthday missive, he gushed that Trump has “done great things for Israel” and that “we’re dealing with something that will threaten all of us sooner or later. Our victory will be your victory”.Netanyahu bombed Iran when Washington and Tehran were still negotiating the future of its nuclear enrichment program, andreportedly despite hearing from the USthat an attack could jeopardise the talks. Netanyahu opposed any agreement because of two firmly held beliefs. First: a nuclear-armed Iran can be prevented only by destroying its entire enrichment infrastructure. Second: Iran’s threat to Israel isn’t limited to nuclear weapons; the Islamic Republic’s ideology rejects the very existence of a Jewish state in historic Palestine. These two convictions explain why Netanyahu has not only targeted Iran’s nuclear installationsbut also urged Iraniansto overthrow their government.Trump must decide whether he wants to join a war guided by these two goals. If he jumps in, he’ll reveal himself to be no different from the blob; if he doesn’t, he risks running afoul of Israel’s most fervent American allies – not just Jewish organisations, but also voting blocs such as evangelical Christians. There has been much debate about whether Netanyahu sandbagged Trump, or whether Trump greenlighted the war from the outset because, despite his self-presentation as a foreign policy maverick, he, like Joe Biden – whom he loves to malign – is in fact an unalloyed supporter ofIsrael.Regardless of which theory is accurate, Trump confronts a hard decision. He can either back Netanyahu’s war or tell him that having started it unilaterally, he’s on his own. Trump could try to split the difference by limiting himself to what he isalready doing: helping to intercept Israel-bound Iranian drones and missiles, while steering clear of a military clash with Iran.Yet if Iran’s missile barrages intensify and Israel experiences far more death and destruction than it has so far, that gambit could fail. Trump will face intense pressure to enter the fray to defend Israel. But prominent members of the Maga movement’s isolationist-oriented wing will oppose a war with Iran. One of them, Tucker Carlson, has already accused the president of being “complicit” in Israel’s war on Iran and betraying his “America first” foreign policy pledge, and his sentiments have wider purchase.Netanyahu has put Trump in a bind – unnecessarily.Irandid not attack Israel. Nor was it preparing to, which means that Netanyahu’s attack was not a pre-emptive one necessitated by the imperative of beating an adversary to the punch. Both variants of self-defence-based war have a basis in international law and military ethics. Netanyahu’s war doesn’t belong to either genre. It is a preventive war comparable to George W Bush’s attack on Iraq and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Both were justified by invoking a hypothetical threat; neither was necessitated by a clear and present danger.Netanyahu has beenwarningabout a nuclear-equipped Iransince 1992, when he predicted that Tehran would build the bomb in three to five years. If an Iran with nuclear weapons is Netanyahu’s nightmare, he should have applauded, notlambasted, the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) that the Obama administration and Iran signed in 2015. Once Trump was elected, Netanyahu convinced him to defenestrate that deal. The JCPOA’s provisions – some extended to 13 years, others to 15 – eliminated 98% of Iran’s enriched uranium stocks, capped uranium enrichment at 3.67%, dismantled about two-thirds of its centrifuges, placed stringent limits on heavy water production, and incorporated extensiveverification measures.Netanyahu launched the war to scuttle the US-Iran talks and, if possible, bring down the Islamic Republic. Iraq 2003 and Ukraine 2022 prove that “preventive” wars should never be legitimised; they allow leaders excessive, needless and dangerous leeway. Trump therefore has strong grounds to oppose Israel’s attack on Iran. At a press conference at the G7 summit in Canada, he refused to comment when asked whether he would join Israel, but noted that “the United States has always supported Israel”, that Iran wasn’t winning, that Israel “was doing very well”, and that Iran brought the war on itself by spurning his 60-day deadline to sign an agreement and now wanted to talk.Trump reportedly resisted putting his name to a draft statement calling for de-escalation, produced by the other G7 members, before eventually signing. On the other hand, after Netanyahusaid he hadn’t ruled outkilling Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, several news outlets, citing American officials,reported that Trump“vetoed” that step, no doubt realising that it could make the confrontation careen out of control.Even assuming that Trump didn’t want Israel to attack when it did, he has manoeuvred to turn events to his advantage, suggesting that the war will compel Iran to sign a deal on his terms. The president’s problem is that this war could continue for days, even weeks. And the longer it lasts, the harder it will be to finesse direct questions with ambiguous replies and to avoid hard decisions, especially if Israel needs direct US help. At some point, Israel’s American supporters and the anti-intervention camp within the US may each ask: “Will the real Donald Trump please stand up?”Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace StudiesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionBenjamin NetanyahuUS foreign policyIsraelIrancommentShareReuse this content"

I’ve marched against apartheid, wasarrested for defendingExtinction Rebellion’s right to peacefully protest, have campaigned for warm homes with Friends of the Earth, worked with peace-builders in war-torn northern Uganda and more. I’ve spent my life fighting for a fairer, greener world.And today, as a member of parliament andGreen partyco-leadership candidate alongside Adrian Ramsay, I’m more convinced than ever that the power and hope of activism must go hand in hand with electoral nous to win the change we need at the heart of our politics.Because the stakes couldn’t be higher.We face an accelerating climate and nature crisis, soaring inequality in everything from health to housing, and a government complicit in genocide. Disillusionment with politicsis at record levels.After years of Conservative chaos, people hoped Labour would bring real change. Instead, it’s doubling down on the damage: cutting support to the most vulnerable, refusing to tax extreme wealth, rowing back on climate action andtrashing protections for the natural world. They may not call it austerity, but it feels the same.It’s no wonder Nigel Farage and Reform UK are exploiting this opportunity, sowing division and channelling justified anger at inequality into misdirected hate. And it’s more urgent than ever that we step up with credible solutions.This is the defining political battle of our time: hope v fear. The Green party can and must lead a hopeful fightback, offering a genuine alternative and a home for voters who feel abandoned by Labour and the Tories.People trust the Greens – polling shows we now havehigher favourability ratingsthan any other party. Under the leadership of Carla Denyer and Adrian, we’ve had our most successful electoral period,quadrupling our number of MPsand almost doubling our number of councillors. We’ve built the foundation. Now it’s time to build the transformation.View image in fullscreenEllie Chowns and Adrian RamsayAdrian and I are standing to be co-leaders of the Green party with one simple aim: to win enough Green MPs to be able to shape government policy after the next general election. In our skewed electoral system, that means building a broad coalition of voters – reaching out well beyond our traditional base, not just preaching to the choir. And that’s exactly what Adrian and I know how to do.We’ve been campaigners all our lives. Adrian joined the Greens at 16 and became one of the youngest councillors in the UK. He played a key part in creating the party’s “target to win” strategy that has transformed our electoral fortunes.I joined in 2015, compelled by the rise of Farage’s politics of division. I couldn’t bear to see his brand of political poison seeping into the lifeblood of my country. And in July last year, I overturned a Conservative majority of almost 25,000 to become MP for North Herefordshire –one of the biggest electoral swingsin UK history.Let’s be clear: it’s entirely possible that Greens at Westminster could play a pivotal role in a hung parliament and help shape the next government. Green parties around the world – in Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland and Finland – have successfully grown their vote and won real power in government.We need to be laser-focused on our goal: to convert the support we have in the community into leverage at the centre of political power. For that, we need leadership with the experience and credibility to win new voters over, and then convert that mandate into policy wins.As MPs, Adrian and I are already speaking out in parliament every day, challenging injustice and bringing the voice of grassroots campaigns into the parliamentary system. We’re insurgents with integrity, campaigners with a platform in the Commons.Our leadership campaign is about turning protest into political change: empowering local teams, raising national ambition, and growing a party that’s ready for power in parliament and in councils, communities and coalitions across the country.We believe the Green party can and must take on Reform and win. Not by aping the divisive “populist” rhetoric of Farage, but by connecting with the broadest possible range of people and showing that Green policies embody their aspirations for a fairer country and a livable future.And that’s where our record matters. Adrian and I have won multiple first-past-the-post elections by inspiring huge teams of activists. We know what it takes to win in, and then to transform, our broken political system.Again and again, we’ve found that our values correspond with deep wellsprings of compassion and solidarity among people in every community and demographic. That’s why we know that we can grow the Green party even faster.So to every Green party member considering this election, I say: let’s not walk away from the success that we’ve built and the trust that we’ve won.As other parties react to the crises we face by sliding ever deeper into magical thinking and empty rhetoric, we need a Green leadership that’s firmly rooted in our values, unafraid to speak truth and ready to act on it. Divisive populist politics is a recipe for chaos and failure. By turning widely shared green values into many more Green votes, the Green party can and must be the antidote.Ellie Chowns is the MP for North HerefordshireExplore more on these topicsGreen partyOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Beads of sweat form over her forehead. Her burning ears might warm my still-cold fingers. But most notable is her expression, changing from composed to flustered in a split second. She is like a defeated firefighter, battling to bring the conflagration under control before resorting to simply biding her time.“Sorry about that,” she grimaces.My patient’s cancer was curable but for years she endured painful sex. This story is all too familiar | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreGoing by the clock at the bottom of my screen, the “event” takes two minutes from start to finish. In that time I have had a front seat to a dramatic version of the adverse effect that oncologists often mention in passing to breast cancer patients using anti-oestrogen therapy.“How often do you experience this?”“A dozen times on a good day,” she shrugs.Roughly three-quarters of breast cancers are oestrogen-receptor positive, which means the cancer cells are stimulated by oestrogen. Women with this type of cancer benefit from oestrogen suppression, achieved via different methods including a pill, an injection and removal of the ovaries. This induces menopause in younger women and more complete oestrogen suppression in the already menopausal.With more than 20,000 Australian women and 2 million women worldwide diagnosed with breast cancer every year, anti-oestrogen medication is akin to the penicillin of oncology. Each week, I write, renew and replace multiple scripts.But while every prescriber mentions the anticipated side-effect of hot flushes, it strikes me that no one (including me) quite explains the living horror that many patients go on to experience.Why is that?Women who have concluded an arduous trek of chemotherapy and radiation for early breast cancer express the hope of “never having to go through this again”.Women with metastatic breast cancer harbour the hope that their cancer, while not curable, may remain at bay for years.Every woman’s risk profile warrants a tailored conversation but, broadly speaking, imagine giving this advice: “There is an effective medication to reduce recurrence risk and improve survival. Over the many years you will be on it, youcould experiencehot flushes, stiff joints, disturbed sleep, low mood, weight gain and sexual dysfunction.”If it sounds like punishment served at the end of a punishing diagnosis, it is. However, when a drug works, oncologists want to encourage adherence and hope that the side-effects either don’t occur or can be managed.“Vasomotor symptoms”, the medical term for hot flushes, affect up to 90% of women with breast cancer and are often severe. Up to half of all women prescribed anti-oestrogen medication stop taking the drug – and they are just the ones who tell us. Every oncologist knows the heart-sink moment when a high-risk patient declines treatment. But we also know all too well the toll that led them to do so.Given the ubiquitous nature of hot flushes, the lack of good treatments is frustrating. Of the panoply of advertised options such as cognitive behavioural therapy, acupuncture, hypnosis, diet, exercise and off-label use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants, none has been shown to help in a meaningful way.Then there is the irony of taking one medication to counter the side-effect of another and gaining weight and its associated complications in the process.As a result, most women just put up with the trailing cost of having breast cancer.Now, there is hope. In arandomised controlled trialof drug versus placebo, a once-daily pill meaningfully reduced hot flushes in women taking anti-oestrogen therapy for breast cancer.Elinzanetantworks by affecting the brain signals involved in temperature regulation.At baseline, women experienced a mean of a dozen daily episodes. By one month, 61% of women on active treatment reported a reduction of at least 50% in the daily frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flushes compared with 27% on placebo. Sleep quality improved, as did overall quality of life. Crossover from placebo to the active drug resulted in similar findings.No drug is without side-effects. More than 60% of women in each group reported at least one mild adverse event but severe ones were rare. Somnolence, fatigue and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in the active therapy group but they can also be caused by cancer therapy. More than 90% of women who completed one year of treatment chose to continue for an optional two years, suggesting a high rate of acceptability.The experts: oncologists on the simple, doable, everyday things they do to try to prevent cancerRead moreThe drug is yet unapproved and oncologists will seek more details before widespread prescribing.Breast cancer outcomes are poorer in non-white women but 88% of the participants were white. Will this drug be effective in, and tolerable for, all eligible patients.Does taking the “remedy” drug improve adherence to the primary one that reduces cancer risk? This would be the point of prescribing it.Finally, patients on clinical trials are strictly selected and heavily monitored. Will the real-world experience match the clinical trial experience? We know that it rarely does.On the way out, I commend my patient’s determination to persevere with difficult treatment, and she smiles gratefully at the acknowledgement.She is only two years into treatment. I allow myself to envision a day when there will be room for reprieve.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

Yet as the industrialised world urgesde-escalationin the Middle East, the devastation continues. On Tuesday morning, witnessesdescribedIsraeli forces firing towards a crowd waiting for trucks loaded with flour, leaving more than 50 dead. These are not stray bullets in wartime chaos, they are the outcome of a system that makes relief deadly.As Médecins Sans Frontièresdeclaredthis week, what is unfolding in Gaza is “the calculated evisceration of the very systems that sustain life”. That includes homes, markets, water networks and hospitals – with healthcare continually under attack. Last week, aUN commissionfound that more than 90% of the Gaza Strip’s schools and universities have been damaged or destroyed by Israeli forces using airstrikes, burning, shelling and controlled demolitions. What’s happening is not the collateral damage of military necessity, it is a programme of civic annihilation.In such circumstances, words without action are worse than meaningless. Western powers cannot decry war crimes and genocide while supplying the arms that cause them elsewhere. If they believe in international law, countries such as the UK should act to uphold it. The law is not law if no one enforces it. Israel is theoccupyingpower in Gaza and has a clear duty under thefourth Geneva conventionto ensure the population’s access to food, water and medical care.Instead, it has imposed a blockade and driven out UN humanitarian operations. In their place, it has backed the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private aid scheme coordinated with its military and guarded by US mercenaries. Citing unproven claims of Hamas infiltration, Israel scrapped 400 UN-backed aid sites for just four GHF-run, militarised hubs. In a few weeks, around300Palestinians have reportedly died trying to access these food sites. UN officials are right to say the GHF scheme is “engineered scarcity” that has made aid distribution “a death trap”. The US-basedCenter for Constitutional Rightshas also warned that the GHF may be prosecuted for aiding “war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide”. Yet Donald Trump’s state department ismullinga $500m grant.In the UK, ministers sayallegationsof genocide are for courts to decide upon, while government lawyers in court assert that there is no genocide. This is not just moral evasiveness but tactical contradiction, designed to sustain arms sales and diplomatic cover. This hypocrisy has consequences. By shielding Israel from accountability in Gaza, and now endorsing its illegal strike on Iran, western governments are not merely complicit – they are dismantling the legal order they claim to defend. They are falling in line with Mr Trump’s attempts to undermine institutions designed to hold powerful actors accountable, replacing legal norms with political cover.As the former USAID official Jeremy Konyndyk hassaid, if GHF were a genuine humanitarian project it would have halted a model that produces daily massacres. According to the Carnegie Endowment’sKatherine Wilkens, GHF imposes severe limits on food, subjects civilians to invasive biometric vetting and hands out aid at gunpoint under Israeli control – in clear breach of international law. What is collapsing in Gaza is not just infrastructure. It is the principle that even war has rules. When those rules are waived for allies, no one is safe.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So do itEditorialThe UK still has ways to press for the release of the British-Egyptian writer and bring an end to the hunger strike endangering his mother’s lifeTue 17 Jun 2025 13.47 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 15.25 EDTShareLast month, Sir Keir Starmer promised to do “everything I possibly can” to free Egypt’s highest profile political prisoner, Alaa Abd el-Fattah. A few months earlier, the foreign secretary had described the case of the British-Egyptian writer and campaigner as the “number one issue”. In opposition, David Lammy had joined a protest in Mr Abd el-Fattah’s support outside the Foreign Office anddemandedserious diplomatic consequences for Cairo if no progress was made.Progress has not been made and time is running out. Arbitrary detention has stolen almost a decade of Mr Abd el-Fattah’s life, while that ofhis remarkable mother, Laila Soueif, may be drawing to its close. As of Tuesday, the 69-year-old, who lives in London,had not eatenfor 261 days, as she demands her son’s release. After taking 300-calorie liquid supplements for a short period, she returned to a full hunger strike almost a month ago and has been hospitalised since the end of May. In Egypt, Mr Abd el-Fattah has been on hunger strike for more than 100 days.Mr Abd el-Fattah, whose current ordeal began when he was detained in 2019, should never have been held. He was sentenced to five years for “spreading false news”; his real offence was to speak truth to power. But the injustice was compounded when, instead of releasing him in September, as Egypt’s own criminal code requires, the state chose to ignore his pre-trial detention. His jail term was deemed to have begun only after his conviction in December 2021, meaning that it would run until the end of next year.The UN working group on arbitrary detention found last month that his detention wasunlawful on multiple grounds, including the lack of arrest warrant, violation of his right to free expression and the lack of a fair trial. His 13-year-old son, who lives in Brighton, has been denied the chance to know his father.In over a decade in office, Gen Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, Egypt’s president, has proved to be evenmore repressivethan his former boss, Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown in the Arab spring. Executions have soared, and more than 1,500 political prisoners were detained last year alone. Sir Keir has twice raised Mr Abd el-Fattah’s case directly in calls with Gen Sisi, and has written to him multiple times. Yet Britain has not even gained consular access to the 43-year-old. Egypt hasreleased dual nationalsbefore when under pressure. It appearsparticularly obduratein this case.Supporters have made a strong case forimposing sanctionsand bringing a case at the international court of justice. Given the health of Mr Abd el-Fattah and Ms Soueif, however, the priority must be measures with immediate effect. The first should be tochange travel advice, warning against travelling to Egypt, and to refuse trade talks. Mr Abd el-Fattah’s case clearly indicates the risks for Britons, given the lack of fair process and consular access. Egypt’s economy, which remains fragile following an International Monetary Fund bailout last year, is heavily dependent on tourism and around half a million Britons travel there every year.The prime minister’s advocacy is welcome. But as Mr Lammydemandedin 2022, “what diplomatic price has Egypt paid for denying the right of consular access to a British citizen?” It is clear that Britain has not, in fact, done everything it possibly can to change the Egyptian government’s mind. It must now do so.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He has since been charged with burglary. So on balance, and while an entirely tempting, innovative option, this is probably not the way to go.Pressure makes diamonds, as online graft-influencers like to say. But it also makes the average human yearn for a little quiet space. That same Tuesday morningTrent Alexander-Arnold, who could probably also do with a break from the white noise, was taking his second Real Madrid training session in the 32C (90F) heat of the Gardens North County District Park, a hundred miles south-east of Polk, and in a team where the entire experience can at times resemble an unceasing spousal argument.Messi drink launch affirms Spanish as new lingua franca at Club World Cup | Barney RonayRead moreMadrid are the most relentlessly exposed football club on the planet, huge even in a place where it feels at times as if nobody actually knows theClub World Cupis going on just up the road. Towards the end of the opening ceremony on Saturday a Fifa-branded wailing wall of hope was wheeled out on to the pitch at the Hard Rock Stadium, trailed by a gaggle of children, who then solemnly implanted 32 lighted bricks bearing the badges of every competing club.The big screen lingered on one badge only, the Madrid emblem, drawing huge, shrill cheers from a crowd that had to that point seemed interested only in Lionel Messi doing his Elvis in Vegas act. Welcome to the world, Trent, as we may now call him, a place where every moment is public, every second in the branded nylon out there to be hungrily consumed.The Hard Rock Stadium is also the venue for Madrid’s opening game against Al-Hilal on Wednesday in the brain-mangling heat of a (frankly insane) 3pm kick-off. Before then it is to be hoped there is space to take a few breaths, because this will surely be the most scrutinised pre-season debut any footballer has faced, globally streamed, instantly consumed and analysed. In America the sun rises every day, as Ronald Reagan pointed out, accurately. But it tends also to bring quite a bit of light and heat with it.There is something else, too. For all the hype and hopeful talk, one thing is true: the evidence is that he will probably fail. This is not a criticism, more an assessment of the balance of facts. There are also competing positives. Madrid have a huge wealth of talent plusa very good new manager. The early sessions with the team have been encouragingly moreish.The chat among the Spanish journalists who follow Madrid is that Trent has tended to trail after Jude Bellingham “like the new kid at school”, and there was something tender about the first glimpse of Alexander-Arnold in the rondo, out there surrounded by all those faces, Luka, Kylian, Vini, trying to control a ball on plastic grass, like some recurring anxiety nightmare.View image in fullscreenAlexander-Arnold has been trailing after Jude Bellingham ‘like the new kid at school’.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersBut his own verdict was encouragingly plain: “It’s high quality, the ball moves very fast. It’s a lot different to what I’m used to.” And the optics are good. He’s a proper athlete, not just a mobile passing brain, impressive physically, with a grace and power that aren’t always evident on TV. Trent in sleeveless Madrid training gear looks starry, handsome, easy in his movements.Speaking Spanish early on is also very smart, thehala Madrid-la stuff, the serviceable accent. The “rebranding” as Trent is a nice idea, a New Me, a post-breakup reinvention. Trent12 posing in front of Madrid’s massed European Cups looked disarmingly relaxed. He has already lifted that pot you know. He has already done terrible things to Barcelona. The new kid has moves too.But there is also one great unanswered question. Is Alexander‑Arnold actually a transferable commodity? He is both a very good player and a very strange one. This is not like bolting on an orthodox centre‑half or a goal-sniffing No 9. Alexander‑Arnold was brilliant for Liverpool in a highly specialised role. And there is so far no evidence, aged 26, that this can be transplanted.All of his professional success has been for one club under one manager: Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool, that system, three hard-running midfielders inside him, empowered to lean only into his strengths. The Arne Slot season was decent, so-so, a fudge. Either side Alexander‑Arnold has never played for any other club, never managed to succeed with England. He has only been his best self in one shirt, under one manager, at the club he grew up with.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold impressed by speaking Spanish at his Real Madrid unveiling.Photograph: Chema Moya/EPAIt is easy, from this starting point, to see only the darker clouds. Klopp drew extraordinary returns out of Alexander-Arnold’s creative, high-precision passing. But we remember also the tendency to switch off, the good, competent defending interspersed with moments of no defending at all. Some will suggest no Englishman has ever really succeeded at Madrid, aside from Steve McManaman, a different kind of player, and probably David Beckham,El Jefe de Miami.There is another more structural problem. Madrid don’t just have a new manager, they have an entirely newtypeof manager. In Xabi Alonso the club of vibes, energy, imperial freedoms, have appointed a hard systems coach. Basically, Kylian is going to have to do things now. How’s that going to work out?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThis is also nuanced. Alonso is not an aura-dad in the Carlo Ancelotti mould. He’s also not a pure number-wanging technocrat. He’s a blend of these personas, a super-cool systems guy, auraandnumbers. He’s got nice tailoring. He’s also got an iPad. For all that, two things are undeniably true.First, the Madrid squad is not instantly suited to replicating the Bayer Leverkusen style, which featured exceptionally disciplined pressing, learned patterns, brutal periods of running and resilient defence. And second, Alonso obviously knows this. He knows the club and the players. He knows the task here is not to go Full Amorim, to adapt and integrate.For all the pre-analysis nobody actually knows how Alonso is going to embrace this point of tension. Like Trent he faces the associated challenges of the step up to this stage, a manager who will basically spend his first few months trying to juggle a bowl of fruit while also putting out a minor kitchen fire and making soufflé for 500 paying guests.View image in fullscreenXabi Alonso has to find a way of getting the best out of Alexander-Arnold.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersBut there are also good points for Alexander-Arnold in this. Much has been made of Alonso’s Leverkusen formation. But at its best this was only ever really a starting point, an armature for a controlled fluidity, rotation, drilled overloads.And the fact is that wing-backs/full-backs were key to that success. Alonso drew his flank players into the central rotation. He had dribbling on one side, passing smarts on the other. Perhaps the best early model for Trent in Madrid is as a kind of right-sided Álex Grimaldo, freed up to use his creative passing, to spark the transitions, to move into the centre.It is clearly also a good thing that Mbappé will start on the left. Nobody has been able to make him run backwards. But perhaps Trent can make him go the other way, his excellent diagonal passing into the Mbappé channel an obvious point of interest.Madrid’s new No 12 is very, very good at providing creative direction for speedy players in front of him. Make the midfield work, make those players fit and understand their roles, and there is an opportunity for some pretty decent chemistry here.The only real issue is time. As in: you don’t get any. The same goes for margin for error, forgiveness, latitude, even when the urge to crawl off and hide in someone else’s bathtub is at its most profound. This why even the opening act in Miami feels vital, the first step in a high‑wire act, and a first chance to prove the Trent identity, always a little butterfly-ish, can flourish in that unforgiving heat.Explore more on these topicsTrent Alexander-ArnoldReal MadridClub World Cup 2025Club World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 22-year-old had also been aware of his presence at tournaments in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha in preceding weeks.Speaking after the incident, Raducanu told reporters: “I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like: ‘I don’t know how I’m going to finish.’ I literally couldn’t see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like: ‘I need to just take a breather.’ I’m always with someone and always being watched.”Raducanu, who shot to global fame when she won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021, said that her behaviour had changed since the incident in Dubai. “I’m obviously wary when I go out,” she said.“I try not to be careless about it because you only realise how much of a problem it is when you’re in that situation and I don’t necessarily want to be in that situation again.”Raducanu has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man given a five-year restraining order in 2022 after he walked 23 miles to her home.On Tuesday the British No 2, Katie Boulter, said that she hadreceived abuse and death threatson social media and had been followed around London by an unknown vehicle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When they closed out the victory, it was the trigger for overwhelming happiness, although Levy said it had to be the foundation for further glories.“We’ve won a European trophy but it’s not enough,” he said. “It’s what we haven’t done that’s more important. We need to win the league. We want to win the Premier League. We want to win the Champions League. We want to win. I have very broad shoulders. Failure is not an option. The desire is to succeed. And because it’s so difficult I want to succeed even more.”“The pressure and the disappointment of not winning over a number of years … I just wanted it so desperately. Not just for me and my family but all the fans around the world. We deserved some luck. That last seven or so minutes was horrific. It felt like hours. So when that final whistle went that was just an amazing experience.”Levy spoke in a video uploaded to the club’s website alongside the new chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, who has come in, as he put it, to take “more of a lead day-to-day on operational matters on and off the pitch”. Spurs are set to confirm the sacking of the chief football officer, Scott Munn. Venkatesham has joined after spending 14 years at Arsenal in a variety of roles – mainly commercial.Levy said: “We’re very proud of our stadium but we need to make sure we win on the pitch. There’s no point having a wonderful stadium if you haven’t got a wonderful team and aren’t winning. The reason we do all these other events [at the stadium] is to provide additional financial resources to the club which, in turn, go back into the team. Everything is about the team. Everything.”View image in fullscreenDaniel Levy sacked Ange Postecoglou despite leading the club to the Europa League trophy.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAVenkatesham said Spurs had analysed “more than 30 candidates” to succeed Postecoglou before spending a lot of time on a shortlist. Frank was “absolutely the No 1” choice of the board. Venkatesham said: “One of the things I’m really excited about is that he is an outstanding developer of young players so I really look forward to seeing what he can do with the squad we have here.”On Postecoglou, Levy said: “I’m very grateful to Ange. I don’t regret appointing Ange. We were over the moon to win a trophy. But we need to compete in all competitions. I’ve got an excellent relationship with him. I told him that he’s always going to be part of our history. Himself and his family are always welcome back. It was a collective decision [to sack him].

My focus is solely on England. They [Arsenal] took me from a really dark place and gave me an opportunity but we achieved incredible things together, so let’s see what happens.”The former Arsenal youth player scored the winning goal when the Lionesses secured their European crown in 2022, and she added the club European title to her CV when Arsenal defeated Barcelona in Lisbon. Kelly said of the Champions League win: “It was an incredible moment for English sport and English women’s sport. It’s made us very excited [for] the Euros now.”“I feel like I’ve grown so much from being at Arsenal. Every day I was learning from a great manager in Renée [Slegers]. I learned so much on the pitch and off the pitch from her. She’s a great person and to come away with a Champions League is incredible. She gave me belief and confidence and I will always be grateful for her.”Kelly was speaking at the national football centre, St George’s Park, on England’s squad media day, two and a half weeks before their Euro 2025 Group D opener against France in Zurich. The Lionesses received positive news on Monday with the return to full training of Lauren James.The Chelsea forward, who sustained a hamstring injury in April, said: “I always had in my head that I was going to make it [to the European Championship]. I never really doubted myself, because I think as soon as you have a doubt in your head, then it’s always negative thoughts. Obviously I didn’t tell people that. I took it day by day.“Lucy [Bronze] and I always kept in touch. She always would say: ‘You’ll be there.’ Then obviously having that support, it always makes you kind of think: ‘Oh, yeah, I’ll be there as well.’I feel good.

If there is a better performance over a mile by a three‑year-old later on in the season, it feels long odds‑on that Field Of Gold will be the horse to produce it.John and Thady Gosden’s grey colt was one of three Classic winners in the field, though his winning performance was further evidence that, had Ruling Court not been allowed first run in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, the fast-finishing Field Of Gold would surely have taken that too. Ruling Court was only third here, nearly four lengths behind Henri Matisse, the French 2,000 Guineas winner, who was in turn three and a half adrift of Field Of Gold at the line.Royal Ascot 2025 day one updates: news, previews and more – liveRead moreKieran Shoemark shouldered the blame for Field Of Gold’s defeat at Newmarket and Colin Keane, newly appointed as the Juddmonte operation’s retained rider in Europe, enjoyed one of the smoothest rides of his career in his saddle on Tuesday.“Good horses make it look easy,” Keane said. “I don’t know when was the last time three Guineas winners clashed, but Field Of Gold was very good at the Curragh and very good again today. If anything, the leaders probably didn’t bring us far enough and we got there plenty soon, but he’s tough and genuine. I am fortunate enough to be riding him and, at this moment, he is the best horse I have sat on.”Gosden said afterwards that if Field Of Gold had not run in the Irish Guineas, a step up in trip in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown next month would have been a possibility, but his winner is more likely to wait for the Sussex Stakes, over a mile at Glorious Goodwood, for which he was cut to even-money favourite from around 4-1.“This year, he has been exemplary in everything he has done,” Gosden said. “He is a pleasure to train because he’s a pretty laid‑back character, which is very useful. It was never the plan to go to Ireland, it became the plan [after his defeat at Newmarket], so he’s had a trial, two Guineas and this. It’s a lot of racing and we’re not even beginning to be halfway through the season.“When they win like that, they make it look easy, but they are taking a lot out of themselves, so I wouldn’t want to be seen as someone trying to run him back in the Eclipse quick off this.”Royal Ascot stages three of its eight Group One races on the opening afternoon and, while the Juddmonte colours prevailed in the feature event, two trainers from outside the small group of powerhouse bloodstock operations celebrated landmark wins earlier in the day.View image in fullscreenDocklands, ridden by Mark Zahra (nearside), just beats Rosallion to win the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHarry Eustace’s Docklands, at 14-1, edged out the 5-2 favourite, Rosallion, by a nose in the opening Queen Anne Stakes, while American Affair, from Jim Goldie’s stable 20 miles south‑west of Glasgow, had a neck to spare over Frost At Dawn in the King Charles III Stakes. For both trainers, it was the first Group One success of their career.“I have lost my voice,” Eustace said after his win with Docklands, who was winning for the first time since taking the Britannia Handicap at this meeting in 2023. “That was pretty sweet. He has been an absolute legend for us and if ever there was a track where you’d want a horse that’s a specialist, it’s here because it’s the best racing.”American Affair’s latest win before Tuesday’s Group One success was in a handicap at York’s Dante meeting in May off a mark of 98. “I have trained the family for three generations, so it’s very sweet,” Goldie, who saddled his first runners in 1995, said.“I was quite confident he could do it today. He has the talent. I knew he was probably one of the fastest horses in the race, but it’s how you control that. We’ve come down a day early, got him relaxed and it all fell into place. It means a lot.”Hopes for a winner in the Royal colours were dashed later in the day as Willie Mullins’s Reaching High, the 11-4 favourite, finished ninth behind Henry de Bromhead’s Ascending (20‑1) in the Ascot Stakes Handicap after a tricky passage in the straight.The scarlet and purple silks will be on a likely favourite again on Wednesday when Rainbow’s Edge, a lightly raced four-year-old filly, goes to post for the Kensington Palace Stakes at 5.35pm.See The Fire a red-hot fancyJeff Smith, the owner of See The Fire, paid a £70,000 supplementary fee to get her into the Prince Of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot on Wednesday, and it can prove to be money well spent when his four-year-old filly goes to post for the feature event on day two of the meeting.See The Fire is a daughter of Arabian Queen, who won York’s International Stakes at 50-1 in Smith’s colours back in 2015, and showed glimpses of top-level ability in the autumn of her three-year-old season.She has looked much-improved with another winter behind her, however, and travelled like the best horse in the Gordon Richards Stakes at Sandown in April before lack of a run started to tell in the closing stages.See The Fire(4.20)then stepped up significantly for the outing in the Middleton Stakes at York, where she powered a remarkable 12 lengths clear of her field and stopped the clock in a time that backed up the visual impression of the form.A 3lb sex allowance from the market leaders, Los Angeles and Anmaat, is another plus and she is an attractive bet at around 5-1 to underline her improvement with a first Group One success on Wednesday.Royal Ascot 2.30A huge field of lightly-raced juvenile fillies includes seven unbeaten runners and 13 that won last time out, but Karl Burke’s Zelaina has dominated the market since running away with a Nottingham maiden earlier this month. She achieved no more or less than several rivals, however, and while American-trained challenger Lennilu is an obvious danger, the 12-1 on offer forStayacatches the eye too. George Scott’s filly travelled extremely well and then quickened impressively to win at Yarmouth first time up in a strong time.Royal Ascot 3.05This mile-and-three-quarter trip is at least two furlongs more than most of these three-year-olds have tried as yet, so plenty can be expected to progress for the experience and Francis-Henri Graffard’sAsmaranicould take the biggest step forward. He ran well enough to finish a close second in a Group Three when dropped back to 11 furlongs last time but has plenty of stamina on both sides of his pedigree and this trip will probably be his optimum.Royal Ascot 3.40A repeat of her form when pulling nearly five lengths clear of her field in the Dahlia Stakes at Newmarket should be enough to seeCinderella’s Dreamregister another Group Two win.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Wednesday tipsShowHamilton2.15 Rampant 2.50 Baggot Street 3.23 Canon’s House 4.00 Havana Rum 4.40 Blufferonthebus 5.20 Cymbidium 5.55 Desert Of The SeaRoyal Ascot2.30 Staya 3.05 Asmarani 3.40 Cinderella’s Dream  4.20 See The Fire 5.00 Qirat (nb) 5.35 Independent Expert (nap) 6.10 Rogue LegendWorcester2.40 Rocks Up Late 3.15 Jeudidee 3.50 Chicago Storm 4.30 Whizz Kid 5.10 Twirling 5.40 Carlton 6.20 Gore PointLingfield5.45 Writteninthestars 6.15 Rory Rocket 6.45 Due Date 7.15 Sawgrass 7.45 Golden Handshake 8.15 Classic Cause 8.45 Offiah’s BoyRipon6.30 Duskaura 7.00 Modern Times 7.30 Lord Protector 8.00 Mr Cool 8.30 Jenubiyah 9.00 AzucenaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Royal Ascot 5.00A pair of lightly-raced four-year-olds – My Cloud and The Liffey – dominate the betting for this year’s Royal Hunt Cup and fit the profile of several recent winners of this ultra-competitive handicap, but neither has as much experience asQiratover Ascot’s straight course and Ralph Beckett’s runner appeals as a better bet at around 12-1.

It is both the question that most intrigues and the one that he steadfastly does not answerfollowing his return to Saracens.“There’s nothing for me to do other than concentrate on getting myself back here and getting myself in the best place I can and everything else is hypothetical,” is a typical example of his response. There were a number of others in the 20 minutes spent in his company, back at the StoneX Stadium after a torrid season with Racing 92, but all gave little insight into what his reaction might be if Steve Borthwick or his dad, Andy Farrell, wish to call him up for either England’s summer tour of Argentina and the US, or the Lions’ trip to Australia.Johnny Sexton insists he is ‘here to help’ Finn Russell despite past Lions criticismRead moreFarrell, of course, has every right to keep his counsel. He is still unpacking boxes at his Harpenden home, so recent was the confirmation of his move back toSaracens. He turns 34 in September and, though he doesn’t regret his move to Racing, the sense he gives is that his remaining playing days are precious so where better to spend them than at his boyhood club. “I couldn’t see myself anywhere else other than here,” he says. “This is my home and this is the place where I’d want to go.”He speaks of a determination to “get myself in a good place”, to “enjoy myself” and to “be happy” after a season littered with injury problems that began in pre‑season in Paris. The fallout from the 2023 World Cup campaign in which he became England’s record points scorer and was booed by his own supporters, prompting a decisionto step away from international dutybefore his move to Racing was sealed, is significant, too.He is unequivocal that he has not retired from England duty – keeping the door open on adding to his 112 caps – but it is easy to come to the conclusion that settling back into Saracens with a full pre-season is what he wants most for now. “I keep talking about enjoying myself, and being happy,” he says. “I think that’s the way I get more out of it now. More out of the playing side now, and more out of everything. That’s what opens up more opportunity. If I get to that, and I’m loving what I’m doing, then we’ll see.”View image in fullscreenOwen Farrell is back in England to resume his Saracens career.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAYet when offered ample opportunity to say he remains unavailable for international action this summer, he does not take it. He confesses to finding it hard watching England’s Six Nations campaign in 2024 and, after a concussion last month brought a premature end to his Racing season, he is closing in on full fitness. “I’m still working and training on my own. It would probably be better if I was with a team at the minute, but if I was to play I’d have to go through the protocol to get back to contact. I shouldn’t be far away from that.”He has been in fairly regular contact with Borthwick, who visited Farrell in Paris, and now that he is back at Saracens he is in theory available again. He could already be back at England’s training camp in Bagshot but you suspect it would take an injury for the England head coach to sound Farrell out about this summer.The Lions tour is a different proposition but, in some ways, something to which Farrell might be more suited. He has been on three tours before, knows precisely what they entail, and his father Andy would know exactly what he is getting. Andy revealed that the door was still open for Farrell Jr to join the tour at a later stage when announcing his squad last month and, asked what the current state of play is, Owen replied: “It’s not changed I don’t think, it’s the same.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were only two fly‑halves picked and I was 21 and was involved in all but one game,” he says. “I loved it.”It is as good a clue as any as to his answer if the call does come – for Farrell strikes as entirely genuine in his pursuit of happiness, but across his 17-year career he has rarely seemed happier than when in the heat of battle.Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsOwen FarrellSaracensEngland rugby union teamRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The series is all square, one Test each with one to play. England, batting first, have made an even 400, thanks in large part to a century by Andrew Strauss and 88 from his Middlesex teammate Owais Shah, who is making his debut.It is just past tea on the second day and India’s openers are already gone, bounced out by Matthew Hoggard.Sachin Tendulkaris at No 4 and England’s captain, Andrew Flintoff, has just thrown the ball to his first-change bowler, Jimmy Anderson.ICC ready to back WTC four-day Tests in boost for smaller nationsRead moreAnderson is 23. He has already played 12 Tests; the last of them was 14 months earlier, against South Africa in Johannesburg, the other side of the 2005 Ashes, which he spent carrying drinks. It was,he told me last month, “a hard time” in his life. England’s coaches had been trying to rebuild his action and he had been sent on an England A Tour of the West Indies to work on it.He was playing in India only because Simon Jones had gone home, injured. Now here he is, ball in hand, with Tendulkar, who Anderson grew up watching on TV, waiting at the other end and the series in the balance.Coming up on two decades later, the Board of Control forCricketin India and the England and Wales Cricket Board have renamed the Pataudi Trophy for the two of them. Some people are upset they are so quick to overwrite the game’s history. Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi was the only man to play for England and India; his son, Mansoor Ali Khan, played for Oxford University and Sussex and went on to become one of India’s best captains after being given the job when he was 21. The decision to get rid of the Pataudi family name was quick, and careless, but we can at least be glad they chose Anderson and Tendulkar.They first played against each other in a World Cup, in Durban in 2003, but this match, in 2006, was the first time that they had squared off in a Test. Anderson’s first ball slid down the leg side, his second was blocked to cover, his third thumped straight to point, his fourth went through to the wicketkeeper Geraint Jones, his fifth was dropped down by Tendulkar’s feet, his sixth was driven to gully, and his seventh, well, his seventh was the one that got him. It was short, and wide, and Tendulkar, who had scored one off 20 balls up to that point, decided he needed to punish it.View image in fullscreenSachin Tendulkar hooks Jimmy Anderson for four at the Oval in 2007.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHe leaned back in his crease and flicked his bat out to punch the ball through cover. But the ball had been moving away from him all the while and it flew, instead, off his outside edge through to Jones. Tendulkar c Jones b Anderson 1. The moment is best remembered because as Tendulkar was walking off a group of home fans booed him.Anderson finished with four for 40 in the innings and England went on to win the match and draw the series. It gets forgotten among all the happy memories of what they did in the 2005 Ashes, but their head coach Duncan Fletcher always said it was one of their finest victories.Anderson would take Tendulkar’s wicket eight more times in 13 Tests. By the time Tendulkar retired in 2013, he had got out to Anderson more often than he had any other bowler. Often as not, Anderson would have him caught behind or do him lbw. It was as if he had found a crack in Tendulkar’s batting and he played on it, pitilessly. Tendulkar would say Anderson was the first bowler he had faced who seemed to be able to bowl a reversed version of reverse swing. There is a video, when Tendulkar explains it to Brian Lara, full of nerdyenthusiasm for Anderson’s technical ability. It is one master craftsman appreciating another.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While age gave the compensation of experience it was not enough to cover for what he had lost along the way.Tendulkar scored one century against England while Anderson was playing, although it was one of his best, and most famous, in the fourth innings at Chennai in 2008, when India made 387 to win a game they had been trailing for three days. But their records against each other are not the point. They are the two most-capped Test players.Tendulkar played 200 games, Anderson 188, and their careers spanned almost a quarter of the history of Test cricket, 35 years from Tendulkar’s first match in 1989 to Anderson’s last in 2024.

But when disability closed down most of her opportunities, a strange career beganByGabrielle DroletTue 17 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTShareWhen people ask what I do for a living, I’m faced with two choices: either I can lie or I can bore them with the truth, which is too complicated to explain succinctly. While those around me have normal, definable jobs – accountant, journalist, engineer – my work requires headings and subheadings to get it across properly: a map of overlapping gigs and contracts.“What do you do?” It’s a simple question, and one that often gets asked on first dates. No matter how much I pare down my reply, it’s always long-winded.“Well, I’m a freelancer,” I start, “so I have a million little jobs …”The first of my million little jobs is what I call “Horse News”. It works like this: every weekday morning I wake up at 6am and make my way to my desk, stumbling and still half asleep. I flick on an old lamp and wince as my eyes adjust to the light. I turn on my computer and use a piece of software that shows me all of the American horse-racing-related news from the past 24 hours. It pulls up radio clips, Fox News segments and articles from publications called BloodHorse or Daily Racing Form – anything that could be relevant to my interests.I sift through countless story summaries, many of which sound fake. “Army Wife defeats Crazy Beautiful Woman in race!” “Another doping scandal emerges in Northern California!” “A disgraced-but-very-good trainer is no longer banned from the track!” “A famous YouTuber has invested millions into a betting app!” I compile the important stuff into a newsletter: stories about track renovations, big events, the series of horse laws that were passed, then repealed, then approved again in 2023.This is a real thing. These laws (known as the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act) are meant to keep racehorses and jockeys safer. Tracks are required to provide on-site vets and doctors and to follow standardised safety protocols. But it is much cheaper, it turns out, to ignore the laws and have the horses race in dangerous conditions. Vets and safety gear are expensive, which is upsetting to the billionaires who own the racetracks. And so certain states have fought these laws, calling them unconstitutional. I have followed along, every step of the way.When the newsletter is finished, I send it to my client, a company that owns race tracks across the US. Though, to be clear, I don’t work for them directly. I work for a reputation management firm. This company’s entire purpose is to monitor the news for other companies, keeping tabs on what the public is saying about their clients and the major trends in those industries. I didn’t know this was a real job until I started doing it.I got this job the way I’ve gotten most of my jobs: through an acquaintance who heard I was looking for work. This is key to success in freelancing. You just need to build a roster of industry connections who know how desperate you are.“It’s just an hour per morning,” she told me. “Usually less.”“Sure,” I said, still not understanding what I was agreeing to. “I’ll do it.”The reputation management firm has a slew of different clients, each of whom want a customised newsletter about their industry. There’s a fast food chain, a brewery, an environmental organisation. But I was assigned to the horse-racing client. And so I keep up with the Horse News and the Horse Laws. By 7.30am, the report is done and I go back to bed.The Horse News makes me feel like a bad person sometimes. Racing is an odd, archaic and often cruel sport. The more I read about it, the more convinced I become that it should not exist. I root for the Horse Laws, and grow sad when a state bucks against them. The thing about Horse News, though, is that someone has to compile it. It might as well be me.I got the offer to do Horse News not long after I moved to Montreal, at a time when I needed work more than ever. I was 24 and a full-time adult now, tasked with the question of how I planned to fill my time and make a living.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Gabrielle DroletA year and a half earlier, when I’d finished my undergraduate studies in English and creative writing, I had immediately enrolled in another creative writing programme. I wish I could say this was entirely because I was devoted to my craft or that it was my life’s dream to write a book, but that’s only a small part of the truth. The main reason I joined a master’s programme was because I didn’t want to face what life would look like once I was no longer a student.As I got closer to finishing my undergrad, I kept getting asked what came next. For years, the question of what I was going to do when I grew up had been answered the same way: I’m going to be a writer. This was an answer that adults found cute when I was a child, and concerning as I got older. A writer, they echoed, mulling the word over slowly. Interesting. By the time I got to university, it was an answer that felt downright unacceptable. Sharing dreams about writing for a living elicited looks of mingled confusion and pity. A writer?I understood that being a writer was fraught. I understood that it was a hard way to make a living. There were no jobs in the industry, and books didn’t sell for as much as they used to. And so, the question of what I wanted to do after graduating was one that made me physically sick, because I didn’t know what being a writer meant either.I decided the solution was grad school. If anyone dared to ask me what I was doing after that, I could shrug and tell them I had a few more years to think about it.My plan worked for a year, though not exactly as expected. First, the pandemic hit and I moved to Nova Scotia with my now ex-girlfriend. Then, I became disabled. I developed a nerve condition that became chronic. Pain had spread through my neck, my arms, my hands. When it first started, I couldn’t type at all. I had to readjust every aspect of my life: how I cooked, how I brushed my teeth – and how I worked.By the second year of the programme, I had moved to Toronto, but I was still struggling with voice-to-text and barely able to keep up with basic assignments. The thought of writing a thesis – an entire book – felt impossible. I was also writing freelance articles on the side to help pay my rent and I simply couldn’t do both, mentally or physically. Forced to choose between work and school, I chose work. So I took medical leave, saying I would return in a year but unsure if I actually would.Leaving school meant I had to face the question of who I was, if I wasn’t a student, much earlier than anticipated. Without a schedule filled with classes to attend and readings to do, I was just a person with an empty calendar and one and a half arts degrees.“What’re you going to do now?” a friend asked over beers at a Mexican restaurant in downtown Toronto. I dragged a chip through guacamole. “I don’t know, to be honest. I mean, I’ll work, obviously.”“I’m sure you could get an office job somewhere,” she said. “Or go back to being a barista, maybe.”People kept suggesting jobs to me like this. Why don’t you just become a barista? A cashier? A secretary? Every time, it was a sharp reminder of how little they understood my physical limitations. I’m too disabled for that, I wanted to say.I held my tongue, but it was true. My pain was so crippling at this point that I struggled to perform basic tasks around the house. I knew I was no longer able to do most of the jobs I’d had in high school or when I was an undergrad: I couldn’t work as a barista, my forearms too weak to tamp down espresso grounds, nor in retail nor as a waitress, as the weight from my own dinner plate at home was enough to make me wince with pain. As I scrolled through job postings for office work, I knew a nine-to-five wasn’t feasible either. I needed the kind of flexibility a job like that wouldn’t allow: the ability to take long breaks when I was in too much pain, to shift deadlines, to use tedious and time-consuming adaptive technology. Back then, I was in so much pain I could barely use a mouse, commanding my entire computer with my voice. Open Google Chrome. New tab. Copy that. Paste that. In addition to being annoying in an office setting, it just wasn’t fast enough.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Gabrielle Drolet“I think I’ll just write,” I told my friend. “Like I’ve been doing, but full-time.”She blinked at me. “Will that be enough?”I understood the question. I’d enjoyed the freelance writing I’d done, mostly penning articles about health and pop culture for Canadian outlets and the odd American one. It paid poorly and inconsistently.For a long time, I’d thought of this freelance work as a stepping stone to a real job as a writer or an editor, with a salary and benefits. Now, it seemed like going all-in on freelancing was my only real career option. It was the only way, I thought, that I could truly work on my own schedule and tend to my needs without falling short of employer expectations.“I’ll manage. It’ll work out, I’m sure of it.” I’d never been less sure of anything.In the weeks that followed I launched myself into freelancing, pitching an endless stream of articles and essays to my editors. I was lucky to have a few people who championed my work and encouraged me to send them my ideas. I’d never met any of them in person, which was strange: they felt fake to me, just email addresses that provided me with opportunities and pay cheques. There had been even more, in the past – editors I’d worked with and felt comfortable contacting – but many had faded away, either leaving the industry or simply starting to ignore my emails.As I started writing more freelance pieces, I was, in a way, living the life I’d always wanted. I was a writer. It was my actual job. I balanced deadlines, rotating between articles and editors. I sent out more and more pitches. I worked late into the night, fuelled by instant coffee and bad music.It wasn’t enough. The number of pitches I was landing couldn’t comfortably sustain me. And it often took ages for me to get paid for my work. A fully written article might be put on hold – it would sit and collect virtual dust, and I wouldn’t be paid until it was published. I knew I needed more consistent work. I longed for some sort of pay cheque I could rely on month to month. My savings dwindled as I paid for rent, pricey physiotherapy appointments and adaptive tools. I moved to Montreal, where the cost of living was cheaper, but I still struggled to get by.This was when Horse News entered my life. As I settled into my new city, I was shown the ropes of this strange job: how to use the monitoring software, how to identify stories worth including in the newsletter, who the big players in Horse World were. I was promised hourly pay, with a lump sum deposited into my account at the end of each month. And I suddenly became aware of the possibility of odd jobs that were writing-adjacent – the kind of unglamorous work that would pay the bills while allowing me to keep writing on my own schedule.In the coming months, other odd jobs entered and exited my roster. I wrote Instagram captions for a hospital foundation. I wrote online content for a bank (which always paid me late and said it was because they couldn’t figure out how to transfer the money, which made me grateful it was not my bank). Importantly, I wrote a column where I recapped episodes of The Bachelorette. I was constantly writing some odd article for a different publication. Throughout all of this, Horse News was the only stable work I had. Every weekday, without fail, the horses raced on and I compiled my newsletter.As new opportunities presented themselves, I found myself unable to say no to work. No matter how busy I was or how strange the job was, I accepted every single offer that came my way, worried the gigs would eventually dry up.In early summer, as Montreal’s unbearably cold season gave way to an unbearably hot one, I got a text from a friend. She worked at a major Canadian newspaper – which, she said, wasn’t paying her enough. She’d taken on a side gig to compensate for the poor salary. She’d heard I was looking for work, and thought I might be interested.“What is it?” I texted.“Writing erotica,” she answered.The next week, I had a Zoom meeting with someone who worked at the company. She was young, in her late 20s, with pink cheeks and glossy blond hair. She explained that she needed writers for an app she was running that was like a choose-your-own-adventure story, only hornier. Users, mostly women, would select a story and start reading. They were all written in the second person, placing users in the protagonist’s shoes: You walk into a restaurant … You see a hot guy sitting at the bar … What will you do next? They were then presented with two choices.One would be boring (ignore the guy!), and the other would be depraved (ask him to go back to your place and [redacted]!). Choosing depravity cost $0.99. These stories were long, most of them basically novels.New chapters came out every week, each instalment getting increasingly risque. This was a business strategy: users became invested in a story, and were then charged money to read the new material.“Do you think you’d be able to keep up with it?”“I think so.”I agreed to write one or two chapters per week. Each would be about 4,000 words long and the story would ultimately have at least 20 chapters. I would get paid US$120 for each chapter.If I had worked this out or thought about this critically, I’d have realised this was a very bad idea. It was a monumental amount of work and creative energy to expend for pretty poor pay, especially as someone who couldn’t type very much. Unfortunately, I was distracted by how fun the work sounded. Like many young women who grew up with the internet, I had lived through the days of reading whatever perverted and poorly written erotica I could find about my favourite fictional characters. The prospect of now becoming a professional erotica writer was too enticing to turn down. Plus, if my friend was balancing full-time newspaper work with this, how hard could it be?The woman who would become my editor nodded.“The categories that perform best right now are domination, stepbrother and campus stuff. You know, student-teacher situations?” She looked through a printout of figures and nodded. “Vampire and werewolf stories are making a resurgence, too.”I jotted this down in a notebook, my handwriting messy and quick. Campus, werewolf, domination. “Got it.”“By the way, the app store won’t let us use the words penis, vagina or cock,” she said flatly.“Oh,” I said. “Why not?”“Terms of service stuff.”“Got it.”“Read a few of the stories for inspiration on how to work around this. You’ll get the hang of it.”“Right.”“People get really creative. Fruit works, sometimes.”“Fruit?”“You’ll see what I mean,” she said. “And you’ll need a pen name. Unless you want to use your own?”I shook my head. “I’ll find a pen name.”That afternoon, I sat on my friends’ balcony. I told them about my new job, which would somehow slot in alongside all the other jobs I was doing. It was one of the first truly warm days of summer, and we were determined to spend the entire thing outside. Between sips of iced coffee, we plotted out my story chapter by chapter, my friends enthusiastic about its trajectory.“Maybe she can hook up with her roommate?” I suggested.“Yes, that’s great,” John said. “Make it a love triangle.”He dragged a finger through the air, drawing a triangle.“I can’t believe you’re writing porn,” Maria said, leaning back in a wooden folding chair. “How fun.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Gabrielle Drolet“Not porn. Erotica.”“Same difference,” John said. He pulled the notes I’d scrawled towards him and squinted. “OK, what happens next?”By the end of the day, John and I had plotted out an entire story arc: the student and the TA’s tumultuous affair; the way they were almost found out; the forces that almost pulled them apart. Ultimately, love and sex brought them back together.“This is basically an entire romance novel,” John said.“Smuttier, though.”“Of course.”“And worse.”Maria spent the day brainstorming pen name ideas, which she would occasionally pipe up to suggest. Madame Scarlett? Delilah Rose? Candy Mae? Jolene Fox? “What kind of vibe are you looking for, anyways?”Now, my days looked like this: I woke up at 6am and did the Horse News; I hammered out whatever freelance writing assignment I was working on; I wrote erotica; I ended my workday around 5pm, tired and achy.In the coming months, I sat in my hot, un-air-conditioned apartment, sweating and damp, and wrote between 3,500 and 8,000 words of smut per week. Since I was doing this with voice-to-text, I had to keep my windows closed, mortified at the thought of my neighbours hearing me speak vile things into my computer: words like member, length, girth and sometimes the names of fruit.I worked on one story throughout the whole summer.On weeks when, for whatever reason, I couldn’t keep up – say, my hands were worse than usual or I got too busy with other work – my boss at the app was understanding.Your health is more important than this, she would say.Rest.It was the most compassion I’d ever gotten from an employer, which was nice but also annoying. Part of me hoped to be fired, freed entirely from my contract. But no – these people were, unfortunately, sweet and thoughtful.Within a few weeks I had come to hate the work. Though it was fun in the beginning, it quickly lost its charm, the sex scenes becoming tedious and exhausting once they were no longer new to me.“There are only so many ways to write ‘they had sex’, you know?” I told Maria one day.She shook her head. “I really don’t.”The biggest problem was just that I was overworked. Writing that much sapped all of my creative and physical energy, leaving me unwilling or unable to write much else.When I neared the final chapter, my friends and I sat around with a bottle of wine and celebrated the fact that my life as an erotica writer was almost done. They suggested words and phrases I should try to sneak into the final chapter as a little personal challenge: cornucopia, sledgehammer, pumpernickel, Seinfeld, Donna Tartt, the Watergate scandal.Maria squinted at John. “That last one is too silly,” she said. “She won’t be able to manage it.”“Have faith,” I said.I managed them all, laughing along the way as I tweaked the story to include them.By the time it was done, I’d written more than 70,000 words of smut. My editor asked if I wanted to renew my contract and I declined. She insisted, saying we could alter the work schedule, maybe even up my pay by another $5 per chapter.My story, she revealed, was gaining a devoted following, quickly becoming one of the most popular on the app. This felt nice – my anonymous magnum opus. Still, I said no.As time passed in Montreal and I did more odd jobs, my hands were getting marginally better. This meant that, as long as I was very careful and worked within a strict set of limitations, there was one more type of work that became available to me again: cartooning.I’d loved drawing since I was a kid. Growing up, I drew countless pictures of animals (especially birds), carefully copying them from the books I begged my mom to buy me.When my pain first started in 2021 and I realised I would have to take a months-long break from drawing, it had been a particularly tough blow.Drawingwasn’t as big of a part of my income or my identity as writing was, but it still mattered to me immensely. What felt worse was the fact that, a month before I lost the ability to draw, I’d sold my first cartoon to the New Yorker – an accomplishment I’d worked towards for years, and which I worried I might never be able to repeat.Now, in my very ergonomic home office, I could draw again (though I needed to set a timer beforehand to make sure I didn’t work for more than 20 minutes at a time).When the timer went off, I’d stand and stretch and take a break. I limited the amount of projects I took on so I wouldn’t overdo it. However, every now and then I pitched a cartoon to the New Yorker, or accepted a commission request for a portrait of someone’s dog.Cartooning became a very small part of the tapestry of odd jobs that came together to make up an income. But it was one I was happy to be able to include.On dates, I try to condense this all into a short spiel. I’m a writer. I do the Horse News. I’m a copywriter. I also draw cartoons, sometimes, but that’s neither here nor there. Even this has omissions, but it’s the best I can do.“Wouldn’t you rather just have a normal job?” one date – a lawyer – asked.Fifty shades of white: the long fight against racism in romance novelsRead moreIt’s something I’ve wondered myself. Sometimes, looking at overlapping assignments and deadlines on my Google calendar, I feel overwhelmed and exhausted. But when I’m in pain, I can take a break in the middle of the day, or even go back to bed if I need to.“This suits me best,” I said.I ended that date early, as I do all weekday dates. I have a great excuse: Horse News is due at 7.30 tomorrow morning.Excerpted fromLook Ma, No Handsby Gabrielle Drolet.Published by McClelland & Stewart, a division of Penguin Random House Canada LimitedListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readJournalism, publishing and public relationsArtDrawingDisabilitySexfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It just further fuels this hatred and misinformation,” she said. She wanted him to hear from her directly how painful it was to see his words after the brutality her state endured. Lee didn’t say much, according to Smith, and seemed surprised to be confronted.Within hours of the shootings, rightwing social media accounts with millions of followers manufactured false conspiracy theories about the suspect and his motives, falsely portraying the man whose friends say he is an evangelical Christian Trump supporter as a radical leftwing assassin and attempting to paint him as a political ally of Tim Walz, the Democratic governor and former vice-presidential candidate.Suspect in Minnesota shootings visited other legislators’ homes, say authoritiesRead moreIt was the latest example of a rightwing media ecosystem that swiftly spins up narratives that serve their political agendas after tragic events, regardless of accuracy, and does not correct them after further information shows them to be untrue or incomplete. Elected officials such as Lee and others often share in the spreading rumors, lending legitimacy to these claims.Vance Luther Boelter, 57, was captured on Sunday after he allegedly killed Hortman, a Democratic house speaker, and her husband, and wounded John Hoffman, a state senator, and his wife.Collin Rugg, an engagement farmer on X, advanced a debunkable theory to his followers on X that Hortman was killed over healthcare policy for undocumented immigrants, implying the violence came from the left. He shared a video that ping-ponged around the rightwing internet of Hortman, emotional, describing a vote to repeal healthcare eligibility for undocumented adults.Missing from the post was the context: Hortman supported this care, only voting for its repeal to pass a state budget deal in an evenly split state House. Hoffman, the state senator, had not voted to repeal the provision.Rightwing social media personality Mike Cernovich, with 1.5 million followers, escalated the lie by suggesting Walz ordered the assassination. He hasn’t taken the post down and has continued to advance the claims, posting on Monday that “Democrats know they are now seen as the party of political violence so their propaganda agents are trying to shift the blame. It won’t work.”Laura Loomer, the far-right conspiracy theorist and Trump whisperer, posted that “Walz’s goons are now assassinating lawmakers who support legislation Walz opposes” and called the Democratic party “a terrorist organization”. Loomer and others on the right also tried to tie Boelter to the “No Kings” protests against the Trump administration. Officials found rudimentary signs in the suspect’s vehicle that said “No Kings”, an indication he knew of the event, not that he would attend it as a protester.Elon Musk, a frequent poster of unverified rightwing claims, amplified the narrative to his 200 million followers, quote-tweeting claims that “the left” killed Hortman and saying “the far left is murderously violent”.The lies ignore overwhelming evidence of Boelter’s actual politics: his roommate David Carlson told reporters that Boelter voted for Trump and “was a strong supporter” of the president. Other longtime friends told local media Boelter was right-leaning. WhileMinnesotavoters don’t list party affiliation, he was registered as a Republican in Oklahoma in 2004.Boelter’s own recorded sermons expose his extremist views. Preaching in Congo in 2023, he is recorded as saying: “The churches are so messed up, they don’t know abortion is wrong.” He ranted against LGBTQ+ people as “confused”, claiming “the enemy has gotten so far into their mind and their soul”. His alleged hit list included abortion providers and pro-choice advocates.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In reality, Boelter was first appointed by Walz’s predecessor, who was a Democrat, in 2016 to a 60-member volunteer advisory board. Walz did, however, renew the appointment in 2019, considered a routine administrative decision for one of hundreds of such positions. Walz did not know Boelter.“It was the equivalent of calling a Sunday school volunteer an ‘appointee of the bishop’,” alocal reporter wrote.Rightwing X user Viva Frei, with more than 700,000 followers, posted a thread casting doubt on Boelter being a Trump supporter. The account has continued to post about the shootings, attempting to tie Walz to Boelter and his wife, Jennifer. A different Jennifer Boelter interned in Walz’s congressional office, though Frei has not accepted that fact.“Do you believe @GovTimWalz spokesperson when they claim that the Jennifer Boelter who interned for Tim Walz in 2010 is not the same Jennifer Boelter who is married to suspected assassin/domestic terrorist Vance Boelter?” the account asked in a poll.On Monday, posts showing a man at a protest with a shirt with a gun that says “resist” falsely claimed the man was Boelter. “Yea Libs sorry. He’s one of you. Keep saying he’s not. No one believes you,” said one post that got more than 2m views. The actual man in the picture debunked it, saying he was at a “No Kings” rally in Texas in the photo, making clear it was not Boelter.Local Republican officials have largely not contributed to the rumors, in some cases pushing back on the narratives.Harry Niska, the Republican floor leader in the Minnesota House, said on X that he often has and will continue to criticize Walz’s policies and rhetoric. “But there is no responsible basis to attribute to him any of the evil acts committed by Vance Boelter,” he said.Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaUS crimeFar right (US)Social mediaUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

During still winter periods when freezing temperatures drive demand for energy higher, they can often request large fees to fire up their generators.In early January this year, two gas power plants in Hertfordshire and Flintshire, north Wales, werepaid a total of £17.8mto run their gas turbines between 4pm and 7pm when demand for electricity was forecast to reach its peak.The payouts, which were up to 100 times higher than normal market prices, ignited concerns within the industry that gas power plants were able tocommand excessive paymentsto generate power when renewable energy generation drops.They were particularly high because several generators extended their planned outages or scheduled new ones when demand was low during the mild Christmas period before a sharp turn in the weather drove demand up again.The higher number of gas plants available for the winter ahead does not necessarily mean that the power system will rely more heavily on gas power – or that record high payments will be paid to those which do run.The the NationalEnergySystem Operator (Neso) instructs which of the available power plants, batteries and renewable energy projects will generate on a given day in order to maintain a balance between supply and demand.In the winter ahead the UK will also have greater access to electricity imports after the launch of the Greenlink power cable connecting the UK grid to Ireland, and more battery power, according to the Neso.It said the extra power supply options would more than offset the expected rise in peak power demand forecast for the winter ahead compared to last year.Deborah Petterson, a director at Neso, said: “Our early view of the winter ahead shows a positive outlook with sufficient margins throughout the colder winter months.”The system operator is also confident about energy supplies in Europe, which it found would be “adequate” for the winter months.“We will continue to monitor developments in global energy markets, remaining vigilant in our preparations to ensure that the resilience and reliability of the electricity network is maintained,” Petterson said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He told journalists on the sidelines of an offshore wind industry conference that the target had “always been stretching and achievable – and it is absolutely achievable”.At the same event he warned that the government would “win this fight” against critics of Britain’s net zero plan, in part by creating more offshore wind jobs in the former industrial heartlands where Reform UK has gained support.He said: “The forces that want to take us backwards, the forces that oppose net zero, will have to reckon not just with the government.

They then tracked how long the daughters lived as adults.Archie said the team focused on female offspring because males often moved to other social groups as adults, making it difficult to track how long they live.The researchers found that female baboons who, during the first four years of their life, lived in the same group as their fathers for longer and spent more time grooming with them, lived two to four years longer as adults than those who experienced weaker relationships with their dads. If only one of the two occurred, an increase of about two to three years was found, Archie added.“A typical lifespan for a female baboon, if she reaches adulthood, [is] 18 years,” she said, noting that females tended to have offspring every 18 months or so. “So living two to three years longer would allow her time potentially to have another kid.”That, Archie added, might provide an incentive for fathers, given males were less able to fight others for mates as they get older.“They can no longer compete for females, but what they can do is help their daughters,” said Archie. “And if their daughters live a little bit longer, then the fathers will pass on more genes and have higher fitness because their daughters are living longer and having more kids.”The researchers found that strong relationships between young females and adult males in general, or with males who were not their fathers, was not associated with an increase in females’ survival as adults.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

When one of her older children returned home, however, she was refused an exception to the two-child limit that she thought she had been entitled to.The other woman, EFG, had two children who were the conceived through rape and a third who was conceived through a consensual relationship.The court heard that EFG was initially paid for her third child but that the payments were rescinded once her fourth child was born, with the Department for Work and Pensions telling her she could only claim for two children, not four, due to the “ordering provisions”.Monaghan told the judge Mrs Justice Collins Rice that these ordering provisions were irrational and breached the women’s right not to be discriminated against under article 14 of the European convention on human rights.She also told the court that the government had an obligation under article 3 of the convention, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, to ensure that “women are not penalised” and “they have the resources to support themselves”.“It must ensure it doesn’t take away benefits because the two children are the product of non-consensual sex,” Monaghan said.She said the money these women could receive was “a drop in an ocean” of the £300bn-plus national benefits budget.The hearing, which neither woman attended in person, is due to continue on Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsUniversal creditBenefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

One fan said on social media that they “go to the theatre to share the same space with a performer”, while another said: “Sorry, are you saying I’ve paid £350 for 2 tickets and she’s singing the biggest number outside at people who haven’t paid?”But others have argued that the outdoor performancereinforces key themes in Evita, such as spectacle and political theatre.Chris Peterson, the founder of OnStage Blog, wrote: “This isn’t just clever staging or a viral moment for social media, although it’s certainly generating buzz. It’s a reimagined theatrical gesture that reframes everything we think we know about Eva Perón. It turns a moment of private confession into a public performance.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His Olivier- and Tony-winningrebootof another Lloyd Webber classic, Sunset Boulevard, similarly sent a character out on to the street for a scene, which was streamed to audiences inside the Savoy theatre.And as part of his production ofRomeo and Juliet, the Spider-Man star Tom Holland was sent to the roof of the Duke of York’s theatre, with his performance filmed by drones and beamed into the auditorium.Zegler, who found herself at the centre of controversy during the release of Snow White for her pro-Palestine activism and dismissal of Disney’s old-fashioned themes, has previously spoken of her love for the musical.“Evita has been such an important musical to me since I was a little girl, when my dad and I would sing Don’t Cry for Me Argentina together on my back patio,” she said. “The opportunity to bring Jamie Lloyd’s singular, visionary ideas to life on stage is an honour unlike any other.”She leads a cast that includes Diego Andres Rodriguez as Che, James Olivas as Juan Perón, Aaron Lee Lambert as Agustín Magaldi and Bella Brown as the Mistress.Explore more on these topicsWest EndMusicalsJamie LloydTheatreLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But if they were filled with solar panels and developed into energy plants, the report claims, they could generate enough energy to power as big and power hungry a nation as Germany.Cheng Cheng Wu, the project manager for the energy transition tracker at GEM, said: “The legacy of coal is written into the land, but that legacy does not have to define the future. The coalmine to solar transition is under way, and this potential is ready to be unlocked in major coal producers like Australia, the US, Indonesia and India.“Repurposing mines for solar development offers a rare chance to bring together land restoration, local job creation, and clean energy deployment in a single strategy. With the right choices, the same ground that powered the industrial era can help power the climate solutions we now urgently need.”Once lauded as exploiting the “buried sunshine” of the past, burning coal for energy is gradually being phased out around the world because of its high carbon emissions. At the same time, solar energy has become more accessible and affordable.In 2024, 599GW of solar energy capacity was installed around the world, and there are more than 2,000GW of utility scale solar projects in development, GEM said. Globally, the total installed photovoltaic capacity late last year surpassed 2TW (terawatts), according to the Global Solar Council.But the need for space to lay out sufficient solar panels has led to land use conflicts, with the farming and nature conservation lobbies – among others – objecting to solar developments.Using mined-out lands could be a partial solution to such conflicts, GEM says, adding that such sites were already primed for development, with 96% of recently abandoned mines less than 10km from an electricity grid.It would also mitigate unemployment crises in former coal communities, such as those in many parts of the UK when the government shut down the country’s coal industry in the 1980s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But mined-out coalfields harbour huge potential for powering a clean energy future.“It’s already happening. We just need the right mix of incentives to put people to work building the next generation of solar in coal country.”Explore more on these topicsSolar powerCoalRenewable energyFossil fuelsEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

They will have to reckon with all these companies that are creating jobs.”The government’s £1bn investment in the supply chain companies that support the offshore wind industry includes £300m funding from Great BritishEnergyand match funding of £300m from the offshore wind industry. This will come alongside a £400m investment from the crown estate.The government expects the funding to support thousands of long-term additional jobs, including the electricians manufacturing the turbines and blades used by offshore windfarm developers to the engineers responsible for the construction and maintenance of windfarms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said in his ruling that the council had failed to lawfully assess the impacts of spreading manure or digestate – a byproduct of the anaerobic digestion of poultry manure – as indirect effects of the development.Fordham also found that the council had failed to properly assess the reality of having multiple polluting poultry units in one area, especially in light of the high density of existing large poultry units in the River Severn catchment.Caffyn, who brought the judicial review on behalf of campaign group River Action, said the case highlighted systemic failures to account for the environmental toll of having clusters of industrial-scale poultry farms in one area. She said: “There are nearly 65 chickens for every person in Shropshire and yet the council still thought we needed more.”Emma Dearnaley, River Action’s head of legal, said the case was a “big win for our rivers … The reckless spread of intensive agriculture must end now”.She said the ruling had consequences for other councils who must now take the health of the wider area into account and look at the broader consequences when it comes to agricultural waste.“No more megafarms without looking at the bigger picture,” she said.The case argued that a rise in large intensive poultry units, known as IPUs, in the valleys of the Rivers Wye and Severn was akey cause of river pollutionas chicken droppings contain more phosphates – which starve fish and river plants of oxygen – than any other animal manure. Intensive poultry farming also causes air pollution, submissions to the court say.The counties of Shropshire, Herefordshire and Powysare home to more than 50 million chickensat any one time, and Caffyn, who has researched the scale of IPUs in the area, argued this was placing huge pressures on the Rivers Wye and Severn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

She said the location of the proposed unit in Shropshire is just 400 metres from an existing one, which appeared to be in breach of government guidelines that say IPUs should not be built within 3km (1.9 miles) of each other because of the biosecurity risks of bird flu spreading between sites.Shropshire council approved the planning permission after the applicants promised they would transfer the manure to a third-party anaerobic digestion unit. But the ruling said the spreading of digestate, which still contains high levels of phosphates and nitrates, had an indirect impact that the council had failed to assess.A Shropshire ouncil spokesperson said: “We acknowledge today’s judgment and will now take some time to study it and consider its implications.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentRiversPollutionShropshireFarmingnewsShareReuse this content"

Around the world, scientists arereporting catastrophic declinesin their numbers, even in nature reserves that are largely protected from human touch. We are also beginning to see huge drops in the populations of other animals – such as birds – that depend on insects as food.Many of the drivers of those declines are structural, and require strong action by governments to turn around. But there are clear, easy steps that anyone can take to support the insect world. For species under such pressure, any respite is important, and we can create refuges for insects in a world increasingly hostile to their survival. In creating better habitats for insects, you can also reap the benefits: thriving gardens, more songbirds, and a healthier web of life.Here are 25 small, achievable, science-backed actions you can take today – at home, in the garden, or out in the city.Turn out the lightsEveryone has seen moths circle a bulb at night. But if that light stays on, researchers estimate one-third of insects trapped in its orbit will die before morning. Light pollution isa huge driver of insect declines: it changes insect behaviour and can evenmake leaves too toughfor them to eat. It is also a relatively easy one to solve, saysBrett Seymoure, a behavioural ecologistat Washington University in St Louis. “Once you turn off a light, it is gone. You don’t have to go and clean up, like you do with most pollutants. I am not saying we need to get rid of light at night, I think we just need to use it wisely.” You can help by switching off your outdoor lights or putting them on a sensor, and shading windows so they’re not shining out into the night. You can also ask your local council to consider switching off some street lights for at least part of the night, particularly in parks and nature reserves – a move thatstudies have shownbenefits insects and saves councils money.Plant nativeOne of the best things you can do for insects is cultivate native plants, says Prof Douglas Tallamy, an entomologist at the University of Delaware. Local insects have evolved alongside local plants, and adapted to specific bloom shapes or leaf textures – many bees, for example, will onlyvisit a single type of flower, even if others are growing nearby. Imported ornamental species and foreign plants often don’t work as food or shelter for local species – by installing native plants, you can help insects get the food they need.View image in fullscreenPests such a clothes moths can be tackled without using chemicals.Photograph: Yon Marsh Natural History/AlamySwap moth bombs for waspsClothing moths are a huge pest in many households, chewing through winter coats, jumpers and wool carpets. But insecticides such as moth bombs can kill off every other insect in the vicinity. Now, some experts – including museums, which can’t expose their artworks to chemicals – are experimenting with a natural ally: tiny parasitic wasps. The wasps are minuscule, barely visible to the naked eye, and lay eggs in moth larvae. Once the moths are gone, the wasps go too. The tiny wardrobe allies have been trialled bythe National Trust, and used forpest controlon cassava crops.You can order sachets of the wasps online.Start compostingEven on the coldest winter days, compost heapsprovide warm, safe habitatfor insects to thrive. Over time, compost also improves soil structure and fertility, providing food and habitat for other garden insects. If you don’t have a compost heap of your own, many organisations run neighbourhood composting schemes.View image in fullscreenCompost heaps provide a favourable habitat for insects.Photograph: Premaphotos/AlamyProvide waterAs the climate heats, droughts are ramping up – and insects are struggling to survive the dry conditions. Providing sources of water with a basin, puddle, pond or bowl can help. Keep in mind that bees can’t swim, so deeper water sources will need either a clear rim to drink from, or “islands”:according to University of California, floating corks or piles of rocks can work.Research has also shownthat bees get important nutrients from “dirty” water, where leaves or algae are breaking down, so don’t keep your bee pools pristine.One monthly flea treatment for a large dog contains enough imidacloprid to kill 25 million beesLeave the leavesWhen trees shed their greenery, resist the urge to rake them up: leaf litter is a crucial habitat.Researchers have foundthat raking up leaves reduces moth and butterfly numbers by 45%, beetles 24%, and spiders up to 67%. Save yourself the trouble, and let the leaves lie.Install a window box or balcony gardenCreating food for insects can happen on any scale: a sprawling meadow, tiny balcony, or even single window box. If you have a balcony, you can create a pollinator garden entirely in pots. If you don’t have any outdoor space at all, even window pots or boxes with flowering native plants can provide a valuable pitstop for pollinators flying through.Useantibioticsand other medicationscarefullyMost people aren’t aware of the link between medical prescriptions and insect life. But overuse of antibiotics and other medications was ranked in the top five emerging threats to pollinators. The clearest links to damage are fromagricultural antibiotics, sprayed on fields. But human medications – huge amounts of which enter ecosystemsthrough waterways– are also affecting many species, and are ofgrowing concern for ecologists. No one should stop taking necessary medications, but you should use them only as directed, and dispose of them properly when out of date – don’t just flush them down the toilet.‘Half the tree of life’: ecologists’ horror as nature reserves are emptied of insectsRead moreBuild a butterfly bankSome butterflies rely on just a few plant species for food and reproduction. They also need variations in habitat, particularly scrubby areas with sparse, longer vegetation, shade from intense heat, and shelter. That’s wherebutterfly bankscome in. By creating a raised area of habitat that provides shade and natural variations in temperature throughout the day, butterflies have areas of refuge from unpredictable weather extremes. Manynature reservesand some farms areusing them to helpbutterflies survive global heating. Recent trials havebuilt the banks in an “E” shape– if you have access to a larger garden or piece of land, you can do the same.Avoidtoxic de-flea potionsWhile many harmful insecticides have been banned in food production, some remain legal for treating fleas in dogs and cats. A growing number of studies show that they are a disaster for wildlife, often leaching into waterways from fur. One monthly flea treatment for a large dog contains enough imidacloprid to kill 25 million bees, according torecent research. Avoid them altogether, or if you absolutely must de-flea, don’t let your dog swim forat least a monthafter treatment.Follow the 3 x 3 x 3 systemIf you’re planting for pollinators, knowing where to start can feel overwhelming. Many nature-loving gardeners advocate for the 3 x 3 x 3 method: pick three native plant species that flower in each growing season – spring, summer and autumn – and plant them each roughly in their own area. This way, you provide insects with food and habitat throughout the year. Here is abeginners’ guideto getting started.View image in fullscreenCaterpillars – and other insects and birds – depend on a variety of keystone plants, such as willow, for survival.Photograph: Helen White/AlamyChoose keystone plantsWhile native plants in general will help, a smaller subset are absolutely critical for insects – particularly caterpillars – and the birds that feed on them. “Just 14% of our native plants are supporting 90% of the caterpillar species in North America – we call them keystone plants,” Tallamy says – and the same applies to many other countries. After he rehabilitated his own plot of land with keystone species, Tallamy says, he watched the numbers of insects and birds shoot up. For the US, those keystone plant species are listed by regionby the National Wildlife Federation. The UK also has keystone plants, and the Woodland Trustprovides lists of woodland species: native varieties of ash and oak, for example, supportalmost 400 specieswhich cannot be supported by other trees. In other regions, try searching for insect keystone species for your area - if they aren’t available, focus on planting native.Sprinkle some rocksOf theworld’s more than 20,000 bee species, between 64% and 83% nest in the ground. Researchers from Australia conducted an experiment to find how native bees responded to different nest materials, and found that sprinkling rocks and gravel over the soilresulted in the greatest increaseof nests. Different bee species need different environments to survive – you can speak to local bee conservation groups about specific ways to make gardens around you more nest-friendly for local and endangered species.Glyphosate, one of the world’s most common herbicides, has significant effects on insects, damaging their immune systemsEat organicThere is very clear evidence that collapsing insect populations are driven by the rollout of intensive agriculture and pesticide use. If you can afford it, buying organic foods, which are produced without the use of synthetic pesticides, can help give space for insects to recover.Choose polyester-free clothing“Tiny plastic particles are everywhere and can reduce pollinator health and lifespan,”a new reporton threats to global pollinators has found – ranking microplastics as the second most significant emerging threat to insects. All polyester, nylon, spandex and acrylic fabrics are plastic, and they shed millions of fragments as they’re washed and worn – a single load of polyester-containing laundry canshed 700,000 microplastic fibres. Natural fibres, such as wool, silk and linen don’t shed any (cotton also does not shed microplastics, but isresponsible for about 4% to 10%of the world’s pesticide and insecticide use – you could opt for organic cotton, which does not use synthetic pesticides).Cut your plasticsLikewise, reducing all of your plastic use – bags, packaging, bottles, toys – will help cut the microplastics you release into the world.View image in fullscreenThe larvae of threatened stag beetles feed on rotting wood.Photograph: Gillian Pullinger/AlamyLet things rotDeath and disintegration are part of the life cycle of ecosystems, providing vital food and homes for insects, and adding nutrients to the soil. Dead trees, fallen branches and logs – even small dead mammals – all provide important food for invertebrates. By clearing them away, we eliminate habitats and nutrients. If you can safely do so, let things rot.Weed by handHerbicides and pesticides are one of the most significant threats to insect life. Glyphosate, one of the world’s most common herbicides, hassignificant effects on insects, damaging their immune systems. Avoid blasting unwanted plants with chemicals and weed by hand instead – there is also research to indicate that spending time gardening is linked tobetter physical and psychologicalhealth.Create shadeInsects are particularly sensitive to changes in temperature, which act as a trigger for stages of their lifecycle. But as global heating disrupts previously predictable weather patterns, these processes are increasingly out of sync. Creating cooler areas of shade – particularly when temperatures are abnormally high – provides shelter and respite for insects.You can volunteer for one of the butterfly counts now run across the UK, US, Europe, and many other parts of the worldSkipthe lawn – or mow it lessNo mow May is one of the most successful recent environmental campaigns in the UK, intended to provide more habitat to bees, butterflies and other invertebrates during a key part of their lifecycle when they are emerging from a cold, hard winter. But it doesn’t have to be only May. Letting grasses grow uninterrupted, particularly where native wildflowers thrive, can be a big boost for insects.Sprinkle wildflowersSometimes, all a vacant plot, neglected berm or empty lot needs to boost its biodiversity value is seeds. Researchers from Poland recently found that patches of wildflowers in cities can bejust as good for insectsas natural meadows. By protecting and growing those patches, “we can alleviate the hostile environment of urban space for wildlife”, the researchers wrote. A number of NGOs distribute free native wildflower seed packs. You can even buy (or construct) your own sprinkling system: put a mix of seeds in a spice shaker, and carry it to sow flowering species in neglected spots of green.View image in fullscreenUsing seed bombs to sow wildflowers boosts insect numbers, even in cities.Photograph: Miriam Doerr/Getty Images/iStockphotoHelp countResearch on insects has been troubled by a lack of good population data. To fill the gap, some researchers are turning to surveys by citizen scientists or local communities: one of the most influential, robust pieces of research on insect declines was a study that used data from amateur entomologists across Germany, and found insects innature reserves had dropped 82%. You can volunteer for one of the butterfly counts now run across the UK, US, Europe, and many other parts of the world. Often, that involves just 15 minutes of counting butterflies in a nearby location. The UK also has theBuglife “splatometer” survey, measuring how many bugs are squashed on vehicle number plates over time.Spot invasive speciesInvasive species can be catastrophic for biodiversity. A single colony of Asian hornets, for example,can “butcher” 90,000 UK pollinating insectsin just one season. You can help control invasive species that haven’t yet established breeding populations by learning what to look for, and reporting sightings to the relevant government department. The UK, for example,runs an Asian hornet-spotting app, and most US states have their own process for reporting an invasive species to their wildlife departments.Protect owls and batsWhile often hidden from sight, bats and some owl species feast on insects through the spring, summer and early autumn, and play a key role in regulating their populations. Where owls and bats disappear, farmers tend to increase their insecticides: astudylast year found that when the local bat population died, farmers dramatically increased chemical pesticide use. By supporting your local bat and owl populations, you can have positive knock-on effects for insects.Cut your carbon footprint“We’re at a new point in human history,”entomologist David Wagner says,where the heating planet has become the biggest threat to insect life across the world. Up until the last decade, “the major drivers of biodiversity losses around the planet were really land degradation and land loss, habitat loss. But I think now, that climate change is by far exceeding that,” Wagner says. Stopping the worst of global heating – and saving trillions of insects – requires us to dramatically cut our use of fossil fuels.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageThis article was amended on 17 June 2025.

Apart from a wartime gap in 1941, a census has been conductedevery 10 yearsin Britain since 1801.Those in favour of scrapping the census argue that the value of a once-a-decade snapshot is limited when so much real-time data is routinely collected by public sector bodies such as the NHS, HMRC or in school enrolment.“Based on our work to date … we can move beyond the decade-long cycle of population statistics that has dominated for centuries,” the then national statistician, Prof Ian Diamond,said in 2023.However, the proposal concerned statistical bodies and senior statisticians, who queried the feasibility and cost of patching together datasets that may have been collected in widely different ways.The Royal Statistical Society, whilebroadly supportiveof the principle, said it had concerns over how reliably other bodies would share information and how comprehensive a piecemeal approach would be.In addition, 60 academics and leading statisticians published anopen letterwarning that an “untested patchwork” of other sources “risks an increasingly fragmented and inaccurate data landscape”, describing the government’s plans as “wishful thinking”.The UK Statistics Authority (UKSA), the government body that oversees official data collection,has now recommendedthat the England and Wales census goes ahead in 2031 as planned.While acknowledging that the final decision rests with ministers, acting national statistician, Emma Rourke, said on Tuesday: “It has been clear from consultation and engagement that the decennial census, asked of the whole population, remains of enormous value for informing the most important decisions facing our country.”Alice Sullivan, professor of sociology at UCL’s social research institute, said: “I am absolutely delighted that the census has been saved. National census data is a foundational part of our data infrastructure, as it furnishes the benchmark against which we judge whether other data sources, such as surveys, are representative.“Without a trusted picture of the population, we would have moved closer to a post-truth world of untestable ‘alternative facts’.”Jane Frost, the CEO of the Market Research Society – the UK’s regulator and trade body for the sector – said researchers would “breathe a collective sigh of relief” at the UKSA’s recommendations.“Our £9bn market and social research sector in the UK has long relied on the survey’s rich, consistent and reliable data to provide businesses and policymakers with all-important insight on the British people, informing critical decisions across public and private sectors,” she said.Statistics bodies inScotlandandNorthern Irelandconduct their own censuses. The UKSA said the ONS was working with National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, “who are also advising their relevant ministers”.Explore more on these topicsCensusEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The last census figures show that 57% of Greater Manchester is white and 21% is Asian, according to the report.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why didn’t you say one word about it?” the prime minister asked in a direct message to Badenoch as he spoke to reporters at the G7 summit in Canada.Starmer also defended his record, saying he brought about the first prosecutions of grooming gang members while director of public prosecutions, changed the rules to make gang prosecution easier and called for mandatory reporting, which the Conservatives rejected.“I’m now the prime minister who has passed into law mandatory reporting, who has taken forward the unique identifier for children, because I’ve always been really worried that children falling outside of school are not being picked up, and they are very vulnerable to exploitation,” he said. “And obviously now [I have] announced this national inquiry.”Casey told the BBC’s Newsnight on Monday that she was “disappointed” by the Conservatives’ response to her review of the grooming gangs scandal. “We need to change some laws, we need to do a national criminal investigation, we need to get on with a national inquiry with local footprint in it, and ideally wouldn’t it be great if everybody came behind that and backed you?” she said.“I felt the opposition could have just been a bit, you know, ‘Yes we will all come together behind you.’ Maybe there’s still time to do that. I think it’s just so important that they do.”At a hastily arranged press conference, Badenoch said she was “not doing politics now” but criticised people who sought to “tone police those who are pointing out when something has gone wrong”.“I do think that we should take the politics out of it. But who was it that said when we raised this issue that we were pandering to the far right? That’s what brought the politics into it,” she said.Badenoch said her party backed a national inquiry into the scandal and had been calling for one “for six months”.Explore more on these topicsChildrenLouise CaseyRochdale child sex abuse ringChild protectionKemi BadenochYvette CooperEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

We are reforming our welfare system, making it more sustainable, protecting the most vulnerable and supporting more people back into secure work lifting them out of poverty.”Labour MPs are demanding big changes to the proposals first put forward in March in thewelfare green paper, including a rethink on eligibility for personal independence payments (Pip) for disabled people and benefits for carers.Kendall’s plans to save £5bn a year by overhauling the welfare system, including by cutting Pip, triggered alarm in the party, with experts saying that up to1.2 million people with disabilitiesare expected to lose thousands of pounds a year.Nevertheless, the government is not expected to make any further changes to the welfare bill after it is published. “The £5bn is already spent,” said one senior government source. “Any further tweaks to the bill including on start dates or on criteria or tapering would mean that we start to spend money we don’t have. And this goes far beyond welfare.“We have to be able to make tough decisions. We have to be able to make a budget add up in the autumn. We have to be able to make tough reforms that are the right thing to do. If we cannot get this through the consequences are far bigger than just this reform.”Senior No 10 figures said the numbers who eventually rebelled or abstained might be as high as 50 – but did not believe Labour was at risk of losing the vote, which is expected in early July. “We think that when it comes to it, MPs will want to vote with their government,” one said.The government has beenintensifying efforts to quell a growing rebellionoverwelfare cuts, with whips stepping up contact with MPs and strategists drawing up plans for a cabinet reshuffle in case of resignations.Ministers are taking a carrot-and-stick approach by laying out extra support for people who face losing their benefits, while also warning mutinous MPs of the consequences of voting against the plans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The facts are undeniable: these cuts won’t create jobs – they’ll only push 3 million people deeper into hardship.“After 14 years of Tory cuts, the benefits system is already driving disabled people into destitution. Another wave of cuts won’t clean up their mess – it’ll make things worse. I urge ministers to pause, withdraw these cuts, and work with disabled people’s organisations to redesign a fairer benefits system.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsDisabilityLabourRachel ReevesLiz KendallnewsShareReuse this content"

He fatally stabbed Joanne Pearson and beat her in their flat in the Buckinghamshire city before stabbing his son Jake Brown, leaving him with a life-threatening wound to his chest, Luton crown court heard.He then went to his neighbour’s flat where he stabbed Teohna Grant to death and tried to kill her boyfriend, Bradley Latter, by also stabbing him several times.The prosecutor Deanna Heer KC told the court: “The evidence suggests that the assaults were wholly unprovoked, committed by the defendant whilst he was under the influence of cocaine.”The court heard that Brown and Pearson had been in an “unhealthy” relationship for several years, with both taking class A drugs, Heer said. Jake visited their flat and Pearson told him they had been smoking crack cocaine. After she was reluctant to smoke it in front of Jake, Brown “seemed to become suspicious”, Heer said.“The defendant then picked up a screwdriver and a kitchen knife from the table in the living room and approached Pearson, who asked him what he was doing and tried to walk away. Without saying a word, he began to stab her with the knife repeatedly in a frenzied attack. Jake Brown tried to pull his father away from her, only for the defendant to turn to him and stab him in the chest.”Brown then made his way across the communal landing to the flat next door where Latter and Grant were sitting in the living room enjoying a quiet Christmas Day, the court heard. With a blank face, the defendant stabbed both victims multiple times, Heer said.Latter told Brown in a victim impact statement: “We both thought of you as our neighbour and close friend for a number of years. The impact your crimes have had on me are never-ending. My whole world and future was heinously taken away by you. The world will now and forever go on without you here.”Grant’s sister, Parris Grant, said Grant was “a pure and kind soul” and described her as “irreplaceable”. She told Jazwell Brown: “I don’t see Christmas as Christmas any more – I see it as the day you stole my sister.”Mr Justice Kerr told the defendant: “The terrible crimes you committed that day have torn apart the lives of many people.” The judge said he accepted a psychiatric report that “the use of illegal drugs was the immediate trigger of the attacks”, adding: “That intoxication was voluntary.” He said Brown’s assault on his son was “a terrible betrayal of a son’s natural trust in his father”.Brown was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 39 years after pleading guilty to two charges of murder, two of attempted murder, one of unlawful possession of a knife and one of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.Explore more on these topicsCrimeMilton KeynesEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The airline cited a combination of aircraft unavailability, technical snags, airspace restrictions, and extended safety checks.At least three other Dreamliner flights have been grounded or delayed in the past 48 hours, as India’s aviation regulator ordered rigorous pre-flight inspections across Air India’s fleet of 33 Dreamliners. A Boeing 777 operating the San Francisco-Mumbai route was also grounded because of a technical hitch.The disruption came as pressure mounted on Air India and Boeing as the investigation into India’s deadliest plane crash in decades continued. Investigators are pursuing multiple theories, including what some independent experts believe may have been a catastrophic – and extremely rare – dual engine failure.Offering a measure of relief for Air India late on Tuesday, India’s aviation regulator said it had found no major safety flaws in the airline’s Dreamliner fleet but warned of persistent maintenance shortcomings and coordination lapses that could undermine reliability.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which conducted in-depth inspections of 24 Dreamliners, raised concerns over delays linked to spare-part shortages and weak internal coordination between engineering, ground handling, and operations teams.Still, in a boost to theTataowned airline, which is facing intense scrutiny after the crash, the DGCA said all inspected Dreamliners were compliant with existing aviation safety standards. The wide-body jets form the backbone of Air India’s long-haul network.Flight AI171 issued a Mayday call moments after taking off from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel international airport on 12 June. It reached only 650 feet before crashing into a medical college complex, erupting into a fireball. Onlyone of the 242 people onboard survived, with at least 29 people on the ground also killed.By Tuesday, officials had matched the DNA of 135 victims and returned 101 bodies to relatives, though they said five of those individuals had not been listed on the flight manifest.The identification process has been slow and gruelling. Many victims were burned beyond recognition, and officials said the remains were being processed in small batches through genetic testing. The official death toll cannot be finalised until the meticulous process of DNA identification is complete.Dr Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent at Ahmedabad civil hospital, said “135 DNA samples have been matched, and 101 bodies have already been handed over to the respective families. Of these 101 deceased, five were not on board the flight.” He said he hoped DNA profiling would be completed by Wednesday.The sole survivor, a 40-year-old British national of Indian origin, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, described the horror of the crash: “Right in front of my eyes, I saw air hostesses, uncles, aunties dying,” said Ramesh, who lost his brother Ashok in the tragedy.On Tuesday, hundreds of people gathered in Mumbai to pay an emotional farewell at the funeral of the flight’s captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, whose final actions may have prevented even greater loss of life. A veteran pilot with more than 8,000 hours of experience, he has been praised for appearing to have steered the aircraft clear of a densely populated area.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau is leading the inquiry, supported by UK and US safety agencies. Investigators are examiningmultiple potential causes, from thrust-and-flap settings to fact that the landing gear did not appear to have retracted. Investigators, who haverecovered the cockpit voice and flight data recorders, are also looking at whether the aircraft lost thrust in both engines. “There was some sort of dual engine failure,” said Steve Scheibner, a former US navy pilot, commentator, and a retired American Airlines captain.The DGCA has asked Air India to submit records from recent inspections and detailed personnel files of the pilots and flight dispatcher, Reuters reported. It has also ordered safety drills in all airports and instructed flying schools to conduct compliance checks.The crash marks a pivotal moment for Air India. The tea-to-steel Tata Group, which acquired the carrier in 2022 after nearly 70 years of state ownership, has invested billions of dollars to modernise its ageing fleet and revive the brand’s image.Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chair of Tata Sons, said: “We need to use this incident as an act of force to build a safer airline. We’re going to get through this.”Boeing’s commercial chief, Stephanie Pope, met Chandrasekaran at Air India’s headquarters near Delhi on Tuesday. The tragedy involving Boeing’s most advanced aircraft in service has renewed scrutiny of the manufacturer’s controversial safety record. Boeing has said only that it was “focused on supporting the investigation”.Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaBoeingTataAirline industrySouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

In financial statements filed in bankruptcy court last year, Jones listed his net worth at $8.4m.The Sandy Hook families won nearly $1.5bn in judgments in 2022 in lawsuits filed in Connecticut andTexasaccusing Jones of defamation and emotional distress for saying the school shooting that killed 20 first-graders and six educators was a hoax. Victims’ relatives testified in court about being terrorized by Jones’s supporters.Attempts to liquidate Jones’s Infowars broadcasting and product-selling platforms and give the proceeds to the families and other creditors have been hindered by a failed auction and legal wrangling. Jones, meanwhile, continues to appeal the Sandy Hook judgments.Here’s what to know about the status of Jones’s bankruptcy case:The trustee, Christopher Murray, alleges that Jones tried to shield the money through a complex series of money and property transfers among family members, various trusts and limited liability companies. Other named defendants include Jones’s wife, Erika; his father, David Jones; and companies and trusts.Murray alleges that a trust run by Jones and his father fraudulently transferred nearly $1.5m to various other Jones-associated entities in the months leading up to the bankruptcy. Jones is also accused of fraudulently transferring $1.5m to his wife, more than $800,000 in cash and property to his father, and trying to hide ownership of two condominiums in Austin, Texas, with a combined value of more than $1.5m.Murray is trying to recoup that money and property for creditors.Jones’s bankruptcy lawyers did not return email messages seeking comment.In an email to the Associated Press, Erika Wulff Jones called the lawsuits “pure harassment” and said she already had sat for a deposition. She said “the accounting has been done”, but did not elaborate.A lawyer for David Jones did not immediately return an email seeking comment.Jones railed against the new allegations on his show on Saturday. He has repeatedly said Democratic activists and the justice department are behind the Sandy Hook defamation lawsuits and bankruptcy proceedings, and claimed they were now “trying to get” to him by suing his father, who he says is seriously ill.The fraud allegations are similar to those in a lawsuit in a Texas state court filed by Sandy Hook families. Jones also denied those claims. That lawsuit was put on hold because of the bankruptcy.Jones says the fact that the Sandy Hook families haven’t received any money from him yet should be expected because he is appealing the $1.5bn in judgments.Infowars’ assets continue to be tied up in the legal processes. Those assets, and some of Jones’s personal assets, are being held by Murray for eventual distribution to creditors.An effort to sell Infowars’ assets was derailed when US bankruptcy judge Christopher Lopez rejected the results of a November auction in which the Onion, a satirical news outlet, was named the winning bidder over only one other proposal by a company affiliated with Jones. The Onion had planned to turn the Infowars platforms into parody sites.Lopez had several concerns about the auction, including a lack of transparency and murky details about the actual value of the Onion’s bid and whether it was better than the other offer. The judge rejected holding another auction and said the families could pursue liquidation of Jones’s assets in the state courts where the defamation judgments were awarded.In a financial statement last year, Infowars’ parent company, Free Speech Systems, listed $18m, including merchandise and studio equipment.Lawyers for the Sandy Hook families said they will soon move their effort to sell Infowars’ assets to a Texas state court in Austin, where they expect a receiver to be appointed to take possession of the platform’s possessions and sell them to provide money to creditors. A court schedule has not been set.“The families we represent are as determined as ever to enforce the jury’s verdict, and he will never outrun it,” Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuit, said Tuesday.Jones’s appeals, meanwhile, continue in the courts. He said he plans to appeal the Connecticut lawsuit judgment to the US supreme court, after the Connecticut supreme court declined to hear his challenge. A lower state appeals court upheld all but $150m of the original $1.4bn judgment. The $49m judgment in the Texas lawsuit is before a state appeals court.He said in 2022 that he believes the shootings were “100% real”.Because Infowars’ assets are still tied up in the courts, Jones has been allowed to continue broadcasting his shows and hawking merchandise from Infowars’ Austin studio.Explore more on these topicsNewtown shootingLaw (US)US school shootingsConnecticutTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

Any contracts entered into from today would have to be wound up by 1 January 2026, but companies with pre-existing agreements have a final deadline of 1 January 2028.The proposal is facing a backlash from Hungary, Slovakia andAustria, but these countries are not thought to have enough support to block the plan from becoming EU law.View image in fullscreen‘Russia has weaponised energy against us’: Dan Jørgensen speaking in Strasbourg, France, on 17 June.Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPAJørgensen said plans to phase out Russian fossil fuels were not a response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “This is a ban that we introduce becauseRussiahas weaponised energy against us, because Russia has blackmailed member states in the EU, and therefore they are not a trading partner that can be trusted,” he said. “That also means that, irrespectively of whether there is a peace or not – which we all hope there will be of course – this ban will still stand.”EU importers will be required to provide customs officers with detailed information about the source of gas to prevent any attempts to sell Russian imports under a new flag.About 13% of EU gas imports is expected to come from Russia in 2025, compared with 45% in 2021. While Europe has cut supplies of pipeline gas from Russia, in 2024 itbought record amounts of Russian LNG, raising questions about the EU’s commitment to Ukraine and climate goals.The commission expressed confidence that European companies terminating long-term gas contracts would not be liable for damages. Jørgensen said the EU ban was beyond any individual company’s control. “It is not them who are breaking the contract, it is indeed force majeure.”graphThe EU also wants to end imports of Russian oil by 2028, compared with 3% today and 27% in 2021.But the latest proposal does not remove an exemption from the EU’s oil embargo granted to Hungary and Slovakia. When the EU agreed an oil import embargo in March 2023, the central European countriessecured an opt-outthat allowed them to continue to be supplied via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline. This carve-out, agreed under the EU’s sanctions regime, cannot be touched by this legislation, which has a different legal basis.Hungary and Slovakia have sharply criticised the EU plans to phase out fossil fuels. Péter Szíjjártó, the Hungarian foreign minister, claimed Hungarian consumers could pay four times more for utilities, and he posted avideo on social mediaon Monday in which he spoke over a dramatic action movie-style soundtrack. EU officials reject suggestions that prices would go up.In more muted criticism, Austria’s energy ministrytold the Financial Timesthat the EU should be open to resuming gas imports from Russia if there was a deal to end the war in Ukraine.However, Lena Schilling, an Austrian Green MEP and formerFridays for the Futureactivist, called the stance shortsighted and morally irresponsible. “Have we learned nothing from bombed hospitals, abducted children and a war of aggression in the heart of Europe?” she asked.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryOil and gas companiesEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionRussiaUkraineAustrianewsShareReuse this content"

He remembers the making of Smile, Surf’s Up and moreAs told toDave SimpsonTue 17 Jun 2025 09.49 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 09.50 EDTShareIt was the Beatles’ publicist Derek Taylor – who I met backstage at their first concert at the Hollywood Bowl – who first declared “Brian Wilson is a genius” as part of a [1966] publicity campaign. I knew that word would come back to haunt Brian and it did: from then on he was competing in a world of heightened expectations, but he did that very bravely all his life. He was basically forever competing against a previous version of himself, but as the great American beat poet Lewis MacAdams said: “If it’s not impossible, I’m not interested.” As for lyrics, you can’t beat “I’m a cork on the ocean” [in Til I Die] for a redux of thought from a Beach Boy. I will call that genius and I think the word does apply to Brian.The things he could do with a piano, bass and a couple of guitars were like him entering a dark room and breathing light and life into itHe had so many gifts. One of them was mutual empowerment. He brought out the best in everyone around him. In the studio, under great tensile strength, the things he could do with a piano, bass, and maybe a couple of guitars were like him entering a dark room and breathing light and life into it. He was a celebratory spirit with a dark coda on his life: the burden of some psychosis. I don’t believe that was caused by drugs. I think it was in his genes, but he had the ability to dig deep. He had a disciplined spiritual force and had sat on church pews and had learned musical lingos, had loved and absorbed everything from barbershop quartets to calypso to composers to Gershwin, was growing up when they coined the expression “Americana” and configured all this into a new kind of pop.Equally, he was a positive social force while Rome was burning and certainly Vietnam was. People were being hosed down in Selma [Alabama, on civil rights marches] and there was panic and apprehension and assassinations, but against that backdrop we got the tonic of Brian Wilson’s music. I’m glad he didn’t see a state senator shot down to the ground this weekend.In mid-1960s Laurel Canyon, I was very active and had played on stuff like the Byrds’ Fifth Dimension. David Crosby encouraged me to become a Byrd but I wasn’t strong enough to be that, but they were wonderful people and Roger McGuinn was a great lyricist. I did everything in my power to surround myself with superior talents and really found one in Brian. I can’t remember whether it was David or [Byrds’ producer] Terry Melcher or [talent agent] Loren Schwartz who introduced us, but I went over when they were working on Good Vibrations. I suggested the cello parts with triplets playedarco[with a bow] that became part of the song’s signature, like the ruby slippers in The Wizard of Oz. I thought I might get taken on as an arranger or rather a musician trying to become an arranger, but that wasn’t the job Brian had for me at all. Suddenly I was a lyricist.At that time, I knew nothing about Brian Wilson – I was a Beatles fan – and lyrics weren’t really my background. It’s possible that he’d heard my song High Coin [first recorded in 1965 by Rick Jarrard], which [psychedelic band] the Charlatans had done in San Francisco to very minor impact.When I rode up to Brian’s poolside mansion in Beverly Hills on a motorcycle I was pulled over by a cop who asked me what I was doing in such a neighbourhood. He didn’t believe me so accompanied me to Brian’s front door. When Brian answered it turned out that the cop’s sister went out with Dennis [Wilson]. It was all smoothed over, but Brian asked me what I needed that would draw less attention. At the time, a Volvo was the safest car built. The next day I got a cheque with no conditions for $5,000, to buy myself a Volvo. I hardly knew this man, but sometimes good things happen on trust.We wrote songs right there in his living room. The first was Heroes and Villains. Brian was the leader and came up with the melody and with it the required number of syllables. I started “I’ve been in this town so long that back in the city / I’ve been taken for lost and gone and unknown for a long long time / Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl from the Spanish and Indian home / home of the heroes and villains …” and never changed a syllable. I envisaged a country and western ballad – a story, kind of. It was a beautiful experience, one of the “eureka” moments of my relationship with Brian Wilson.We came up with Surf’s Up in one night. We talked about how classical music had died and was being replaced by something else, and there were things to be discovered. I sat there with Brian as we were reinventing the song form. One of the things he did then was record in modular fragments – sections which would then be put together – as opposed to whole songs, a bit like the way people like Robert Altman were making movies.I don’t know how much Brian consciously was trying to top Pet Sounds [1966] but he wanted out of the box. Placing his piano in a sand-box in his living room wasn’t an example of his craziness. It was both a pop art statement and his fantastic sense of humour. He’d wanted to drop the surfboard and progress so I mischievously suggested the title Surf’s Up. It was naughty … but how could his cousin Mike Love [Beach Boys singer/co-lyricist, who famously wasn’t always receptive to Wilson and Parks’s experimentation] argue with a title like Surf’s Up? I wanted to help Brian have a moment he deserved.The lyrics were inspired by an artist called Frank Holmes, whose pictures interested me so I tried to adhere to them. “Columnated ruins domino, canvas the town and brush the backdrop / Are you sleeping?” The lyrics are inadvertently about a man who attends a concert and has an epiphany. We did a whole bunch of songs and Frank [who subsequently did the cover art] can testify that I suggested the title Smile for the album.During the recording sessions Brian dominated the piano. Musicians would come and go, but Carol Kaye [bass] was very important. Elegant and swell, the only female on that set and she played on so much stuff. Dennis [Wilson] was nice to me and Carl [Wilson] knew what Brian was up against so was inclined to promote his brother’s search for freedom, but Brian had to fight to make an album at his own expense and the group felt threatened or diminished, maybe. I walked away. [Wilson pulled Smile, which – although some tracks emerged – became a “legendary lost album”. He withdrew further into drug use.]A few years later I was in a Warner Brothers meeting about the Beach Boys’ Holland album [1973], which they said was unreleasable without Brian. Mo Ostin [chief executive] said to me: “Can you get Brian?” I went over to his place with my cassette recorder and came up with a few notes, the words “Sail on, sail on sailor” and the title Sail On Sailor. It got him outta bed. We sent the tape to the Beach Boys [who recorded it for Holland]. I take no further credit for the song, which was sweet, desperate and elevating, but it put me in the position of being an effective agitator.‘The joy shot out of his voice’: Ray Davies, Graham Nash and others on Brian Wilson’s songwriting geniusRead moreWe reunited again for [Parks’s 1995 solo album] Orange Crate Art, which reignited Brian’s recording career. It was my last record for Warners and I was infatuated with the word “orange”, because of its associations with Florida and California. He was sitting in a beach home, looking at a television that wasn’t on, but I so wanted him to sing the word “orange”. He came to the studio and when I got him in front of a microphone he suddenly asked me: “Why aren’t you singing this song?” I said: “Quite frankly Brian, I just don’t like the sound of my own voice,” and quick as a flash he said: “I don’t blame you.” That was Brian: dry as bones. When he became lead vocalist it was different to the 1960s because of whatever had happened to him and he was singing parts that I dictated. It sank without a trace, but it was a step forward – he realised he could get out of the tomb.Working together again on Brian Wilson Presents Smile [2004, the album as it was originally intended] was more of a long-distance love. I didn’t have the chance to socialise with him at that time, but did some audio intervals, played some parts and so on. I went to the triumphant Royal Festival Hall show [2004] where he performed the Smile songs and my only regret is that my parents weren’t alive to see the joy those songs generated.Brian and I stayed in touch. My wife Sally and I were close to Brian and both of his wives. Our friendship spanned decades and his various associations and casts of characters. Losing him is so tough and leaves a vacuum, but Brian bloomed where he was planted and his music documented an America that no longer exists. He moved mountains. He changed the language. He treated me kindly when he didn’t need to and when people say his music is astonishing, I agree.Explore more on these topicsMusicBrian WilsonPop and rockBeach BoysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Along with a lot of enjoyable hokum about the old guy mentoring the rookie hothead (a plot it broadly shares withPixar’s 2006 adventure Cars), F1 the Movie gives you the corporate sheen, real-life race footage with Brad as the star in an unreasonably priced car, the tech fetish of the cars themselves (almost making you forget how amazingly ugly they are) with brand names speckling every square inch of every surface, the simulation graphics writ large, and the bizarre occult spectacle of motor racing itself.This is a movie which (like Barbie) has been licensed by the brand, with Lewis Hamilton credited as a producer; he gets a stately walk-on and plenty of big names are glimpsed. At one stage, Brad noticesMax Verstappenout there on the track: “Damn, he’s good!” he mutters. Oh sure, yes, Max Verstappen is good, but is he a reckless, intuitive risk-taker and old-school motor race romantic who might get himself killed chasing some undefinable something out there on the burning, shimmering tarmac? We may never know.Pitt plays Sonny Hayes, a supercool driver who lost his way after a near-fatal crash 30 years ago, got himself back together after a stint in the wilderness as a professional gambler and New York City taxi driver (no flashbacks to that sadly) and now freelances as a race-car hombre, drifting around in his campervan, signing up for races where he can, wowing the young kids with his crazy attack strategies and wily cunning. His old driving buddy Ruben (Javier Bardem), now an owner, is in desperate need of some special old-school magic to revivify his failing team and offers Sonny a slot, to the nervous disapproval of pointy-headed board member and duplicitous creep Banning (Tobias Menzies) and the open disdain of mercurial young driving star Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris) who refers to him as “old man”. Is Sonny going to exasperate and yet excite Ruben by breaking all the rules? Oh but yes.Rangy, good-humoured Sonny soon works his cheeky magic with everyone, especially the technical director Kate McKenna; this is a really good performance from Kerry Condon who stamps hard on the relatability pedal and without whomBrad Pittand his finite range of expressions might have been floundering. And so we follow Sonny and the team as they compete all over the world from London to Abu Dhabi, each event prefaced with videogame-style graphics of the track and plenty of huge sans-serif titles saying things like “LAP 14”. The arcana of racing is lovingly reproduced, particularly the (to me, baffling) convention of the team meeting where everyone is wearing headphones and headset mics; can they not hear each other without them? Don’t other people at equally large conference tables manage without all this?Motor racing is a sport in which constituent team members seem to be competing against each other as much as against the opposition, and so it ought to be an ideal subject for a movie treatment. There’s a fair bit of macho silliness here, but the panache with which director Joseph Kosinski puts it together is very entertaining. Condon is a vital fuel ingredient and to a F1 non-believer like me, the result is surreal and spectacular.F1 the Movie is out on 25 June in the UK; 26 June in Australia; 27 June in the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFormula OneLewis HamiltonMax VerstappenFerrariMotor sportreviewsShareReuse this content"

That was the year the late Rob Ford, then mayor of Toronto, was reported to have beenfilmed smoking crack cocaine. He denied it, twisting the allegations into what he suggested was a smear campaign by an untrustworthy, left-leaning mainstream media. A few months later, the city’s chief of police, Bill Blair, held a press conference in which he announced that the police had the video in question, and it showed Ford smoking a glass pipe. The mayor was defiant. “I have no reason to resign,” he said. He didn’t.Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem manages to squash the chaos of Ford’s many scandals into an appropriately hectic 49 minutes of documentary. (The fact that the police reporting the existence of a crack pipe video is only one of these scandals is telling: a reporter here vividly likens the number of controversies surrounding Ford to “sweat off a runner”.) It provides a brief account of his entry into politics, and viewers with an interest in the psyche of “controversial” politicians will be amazed and astonished to learn that, like Donald Trump, Ford was probably motivated by wanting to impress his tough millionaire businessman father, who had been a bellicose politician himself.Ford won Toronto’s mayoral race by a landslide in 2010. He was straight-talking, rightwing, and positioned himself as being on the outside of a wasteful and excessively bureaucratic system; he was appealing, says one observer, to both “bankers and bus drivers”. There were initial reports of earlier controversies, yet to blossom into full-blown scandals: prior drug- and alcohol-related arrests, accounts of him disappearing from official duties to coach a local high school football team. They rippled to the surface and dissipated quickly. Ford said he was only human, and his supporters lapped it up.By 2013, however, reporters and journalists began to hear more stories. Ford’s chief of staff, Mark Towhey, recalls a military gala where Ford arrived dishevelled and inebriated, eventually getting Towhey in a headlock. It opened the floodgates to reports of the existence of the first crack-pipe video. The subsequent circus of controversy and chaos turned Ford into an international figure, and, many argue, a punchline. Even so, half of Toronto’s residents still thought the video had been fabricated. Towhey says that when he confronted his boss about it, he was troubled that Ford said, “There is no video,” rather than, “I didn’t do it.”Reporters and staff members recall their time in the Ford family whirlwind with varying degrees of amusement, exasperation and even fondness. It is this cocktail of reactions that makes the story so tempting to view as a model for the populist wave to come. It is easy to transpose Ford’s tactics on to Trump’s electoral successes, for example. He sowed the seeds of doubt when it came to institutions offering checks and balances on his power. He bamboozled observers, supporters and detractors by repeatedly transgressing boundaries. All of this made it difficult for the electorate to know what to believe. This version of politics as spectacle, no matter what it is that the spectacle is comprised of, has become mainstream in many western nations. There’s no such thing as bad publicity, indeed.The tragedy of this zippy documentary is that what was shocking back in 2013 has become relatively ordinary. Ford is shown repeatedly jostling with crowds of reporters. He makes outrageous statements. He admits to smoking crack, and blames being in a “drunken stupor” for his poor decisions. Still, he doesn’t resign. The idea of a public becoming numb to boundary-busting behaviour is floated, very briefly, though there is nowhere near enough time to get into the thick of it. Neither is there space to address the fact that, while this is a story of politics, it is also a story about drugs and alcohol and addiction. At the end, there is the briefest suggestion that Ford had a good side and a bad side, and that he did good, and bad, things for the city. It feels tacked on and trite, and the opportunity to go further is thrown away.But this is jaw-dropping, and provocative, and a reminder of how certain parts of the western world got to where we are. The firstTrainwreck, in 2022, was about the horrors of theWoodstock 99 music festival, which descended into a soup of greed, violence and riots. It used its three episodes wisely. Mayor of Mayhem is a frantic, surface retelling of a much more complex, and much more intriguing, story.Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionPolitics pastCanadareviewsShareReuse this content"

That means the makers are free to turn a beloved character into a murderous man-beast psychopath, with theWinnie-the-Pooh derived Blood and Honey franchisea prime example.Meanwhile, the moment black-and-white cartoon Steamboat Willie, the 1928 debut of Mickey Mouse, entered the public domain, almost half a dozen Mickey-themed slasher pics were born, like spores released from a fruiting body. In a very low-bar environment, I Heart Willie is perhaps a tick better than previous public domain horrors, or maybe we have reached the film critic’s equivalent of Stockholm syndrome, with our defences worn down by shoddy production values, originality deficits and lame performances.At least I Heart Willie offers a somewhat unusual backdrop: it is set in Michoacán, a western state ofMexico, where four teenagers, who mostly speak English even though three of them are locals, set out looking for trouble, as kids are wont to do in these films. They’ve heard of a house in the area haunted by a dead German mouse-boy named Willie; turns out rumours of his death are somewhat exaggerated as he’s still there and quite buff (and is played by the film’s screenwriter David Vaughn), although half of his skin is covered in mutilated latex and he wears a homemade mouse mask most of the time.Willie spends his time mutilating randoms who wander on to his property while blasting aptly public domain recordings such as Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries. Inevitably, nearly every member of the crew gets picked off, but there’s a twist, with one of the party not exactly who they seem to be. Final girl Maya Luna stars as Nora, a seemingly prim-in-pink type who displays an impressive acting range. Her charisma and commitment to this nonsense elevates the material just enough to make the marketing push behind this seem justified. That said, let’s not let the film’s tedious sadism and crappy dialogue off the hook.I Heart Willie is on digital platforms from 23 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsMexicoWalt Disney CompanyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, in his cheerfully celebratory and slightly corporate-promo way, he has made a film about Irish viticulture and drink in general, which means not simply wineries, breweries and distilleries actually in Ireland, but also abroad: this is about drinks producers with an Irish background, such as Hennessy brandy, which has an obvious Irish ancestry.It’s what this film calls “an Irish drink in a French terroir” – or, in fact, a terroir anywhere in the world, meaning places in Europe, the US and occasionally Australia and New Zealand. The film even jauntily insists that Ireland invented whiskey before Scotland. Prince Albert II of Monaco is interviewed about his love of Irish viticulture and the importance of his mother, Grace Kelly, one of the Kellys of County Mayo. The chief interviewee, however, is the amiableOz Clarke, himself of Irish heritage, who beamingly descants on how great Irish wine is.View image in fullscreenThe Baileys ‘ladies’ … A Sip of IrishThis is a film that is genially untroubled and unproblematic in its approach; the issue of, say, the homogenisation and industrialisation of wine production that, a generation ago, worriedfilm-maker Jonathan Nossiter in his 2004 film Mondovino, is absent. Mannion and his interviewees are content to simply find a range of nuances and differences, although the garrulous tone of Mannion’s film is not so far from Rossiter’s. The most startling moments of the film come when he visits the Baileys farm in County Wicklow, whose proprietor talks about the cows who produce the raw material for Baileys Irish Cream: his 230 “ladies”.

Yet regard for his playing was never by any means universal; what his many admirers found as searching, considered and profound in his interpretations, others heard as colourless and lacking in spontaneity. But Brendel’s lasting popularity is evidenced by his recorded legacy, which is certainly extensive enough for generations to come to make their own assessment of his stature. In a recording career that stretched well over half a century, he made more than 100 albums, which included three complete cycles of the Beethoven sonatas.As his career burgeoned, Beethoven, and the other great composers of the Austro-German tradition - Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Brahms - were increasingly the focus of Brendel’s recital repertory, but a glance at a chronology of his recordings reveals how wide his musical interests really were. If it is Brendel’s discs of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert that will be treasured above all, there is much else to be discovered among the myriad recordings he left us. The recordings that follow, therefore, are very much a personal choice; another day, it might be entirely different.Busoni: Fantasia Contrappuntistica (1953)Busoni was a composer who fascinated Brendel, but he recorded very little of the piano music, with the exception of this early performance of the Italian musician’s most challenging solo work.Mussorgsky, Balakirev and Stravinsky (1955)A sampler from early in his career of some of the Russian repertoire with which Brendel was never associated later in his life.Liszt: Opera Transcriptions (1958)Liszt, especially the great B minor Sonata, remained part of Brendel’s repertory for much of his career, but early on he spread his net much wider, as this collection shows.Schumann: Works for oboe (1980)Brendel recorded relatively little chamber music, but he did make some discs as an accompanist, including a Winterreise with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and this jewel-like collection in which he partnered the greatest oboist of the age, Heinz Holliger.Mozart: The Piano Concertos (1980s)The cycle of the Mozart piano concertos that Brendel recorded with Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields was one of landmark discs of the 1980s.Haydn: 11 Sonatas (1986)The essence of Brendel’s Viennese style, utterly lacking in affectation and mannerisms.Schubert: Piano Sonatas D958, 959 & 960 (1988)Schubert’s late sonatas always seem to bring the best out of Brendel, his intellectual rigour, his sense of lyricism and sometimes sheer fun.Brahms: Piano Concerto No 1 (1987)In later years especially, Brendel did not play much of Brahms’s solo piano music, but he performed the concertos, as this magnificent account of the First, with Claudio Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic shows.Beethoven Piano Concerto No 5 (1988)A majestic, live performance of the Emperor Concerto, with Kurt Masur conducting.Beethoven: Diabelli Variations (1990)As masterly as all his Beethoven performances were, it often seemed as if the Diabelli Variations brought the very best out of Brendel, with their quickfire changes of mood, moments of introspection and wicked humour.Beethoven: Piano Sonatas Opp 90, 101, 106,109, 110, 111 (1993)A compilation from the second of Brendel’s three Beethoven sonata cycles, released just as he was about to begin a third, digital cycle for Philips.Schoenberg: Piano Concerto (1996)After the early years Brendel played very little 20th-century music, but Schoenberg’s concerto did remain part of his repertory; this recording, with Michael Gielen conducting, is one of at least two that he made.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicAlfred BrendelShareReuse this content"

It is the 1950s, she is a young teen, and the highlight of her week is going to the Saturday morning “flicks” with a neighbour’s slightly older daughter. One particular movie scene has stayed with her: it involves a man dressed in a vaguely historical costume who is fleeing for his life. Face contorted with terror, he makes it as far as the door of a cathedral, whereupon he knocks loudly and cries “Sanctuary!” The door opens a crack, the man slides inside, and the Saturday morning audience breaths a collective sigh of relief. Even if the plot points remain hazy – is Robin Hood somehow involved? – the underlying principle needs no explaining. The fugitive has invoked the ancient right by gaining entrance to a designated sacred space. As long as he stays put his pursuers can’t touch him.From these hyper-local beginnings, Warner sets out to explore and expand what “sanctuary” means in an age when millions are on the move around the world, chased out of their homes by environmental disaster, economic collapse, war and political oppression.It is in these grim circumstances that she proposes a new concept of sanctuary, one built not from bricks and mortar or even tents and blankets, but by tales and their telling. Over the past 50 years of her distinguished career as a cultural historian, Warner has immersed herself in liminal literature, tracing the way that fairytales, playground chants, lullabies, fables, patter and ditties manage to evade the censor, slip under the radar, and slide into conversations without attracting too much attention. Now she suggests putting these folk forms to work, using them to build bridges and forge connections between arrivants (a term she prefers to “migrants”) and their often hostile hosts.It is at this point that sceptics might ask how Warner’s proposed “commons of wonder”, filled with stories of myth and magic, can possibly help with the practical needs of displaced people more likely to be worried about clean water, healthcare, a job and, above all, the legal right to remain.This is a challenge that she knows well and has spent her career confronting. Her earliest books on the Virgin Mary (1976), Joan of Arc (1981) and, especially, female statuary (the magnificent Monuments and Maidens, 1985), all made the case for allegorical forms having a powerful conditioning effect on the way that people understand and experience their own lives. She got critical flak for it, as well as a great deal of praise. Decades on she shows no signs of being abashed, insisting as strongly as ever that storytelling can function as a “binding agent” between strangers, creating spaces for concepts of justice and coexistence to develop. As back-up she deploys the British anthropologist Alfred Gell’s useful phrase “art as agency” to underscore her belief that telling stories has real-world consequences.This won’t be enough to convince everyone, yet even the most literal-minded critic must admire Warner’s commitment to making things happen. In 2015 she won the prestigious Holberg prize and used her £380,000 winnings to help set upStories in Transit, a project designed to facilitate the exchange of stories between the young people, mostly men, who daily arrive in Sicily from the Middle East, the Maghreb, Bangladesh, Pakistan and the eastern Mediterranean. What might emerge, Warner wanted to know, if these travellers and their tales were encouraged to mix and mingle?Din from Guinea, where civil strife has destroyed his family, arrived in Sicily after a two-year trek by foot across the Sahara followed by a journey across the Mediterranean in a boat. During a Stories in Transit workshop he tells a traditional tale from home called The Huntsman, the King’s Son and the Enchanted Deer, a spirited mashup of politics and magic, comedy and sorrow, with one tale nestled inside another in the manner of One Thousand and One Nights. What strikes the comparatist in Warner is the way that this Guinean tale echoes animal stories from both the medieval Arab world and the even older Aesop’s Fables. Still, it is not where a story has come from that concerns her so much as where it is going. Over the course of several sessions, The Huntsman, the King’s Son and the Enchanted Deer develops into a promenade piece, complete with puppetry, song and animated film. From here another arrivant, this time from Gambia, takes the spirit of Din’s story and turns it into something quite distinct, a comic parable with music called One for You and One for Me.Sceptics once again might worry that this privileging of fantastical and shape-shifting narratives strikes the wrong note in a world where truth has become slippery and facts are optional. But Warner is ready for them, pointing out that the world in which the arrivants live is already fictional. Rhetorically marshalled into “hordes” or “swarms”, these “aliens” are routinely denigrated as “scroungers” and even “criminals”. The official maps that tell them where they have come from and where they should go are also imaginary, continually redrawn in the wake of colonial and nationalistic carve-ups that frequently take little account of linguistic, cultural and ethnic affinities.There is another reason Warner feels strongly about encouraging the arrivants to play fast and loose with the materials to hand. At every stage in their hazardous journey they have been required to narrate their life stories to officials in particular ways if they are to be allowed to proceed to the next stage in their search for sanctuary. The dates must be right, the dangers consistent, and motives must be pure, involving escape from tyranny rather than desire for a better job. To deviate from the first telling of an account is to risk deportation. As a result, suggests Warner, in an exquisitely attuned reading of the situation, arrivants are sealed into versions of themselves that take no account of their changing feelings and experience. It is in this context that making up stories becomes vital in ensuring a form of survival that is as psychically healthy as it is physically safe.Sanctuary: Ways of Telling, Ways of Dwelling by Marina Warner is published by William Collins (£22).

Some authors avoid it entirely; even those who have been called great can come a cropper. Which is why I want to start this review by saying that the sex scenes in Ordinary Love are some of the best I have read this year, and that Marie Rutkoski has a facility for writing physical intimacy that can elude even some of our most gifted authors. Her voice has been compared to that of Sally Rooney. I don’t see much of that in this novel beyond a Rooneyesque ability to write sex well, but that is a talent worth noting.Ordinary Love is a queer romance that tells the story of Emily and Gen, teenage sweethearts who break up in college and reunite in their 30s, their paths having diverged dramatically. Emily marries Jack, who is wealthy and emotionally abusive. When she sees Gen again, she is in the process of leaving him for the second time (the novel opens with a scene vividly depicting the dealbreaker: it is violence against a child that finally does it). Gen, meanwhile, has become an Olympic athlete and serial womaniser. Both are carrying the wounds of their adolescent relationship, which is recounted in flashback, and the homophobia they faced, particularly from Emily’s father. In one particularly moving scene, Gen’s grandmother – who raised her after her mother died from opioid addiction – counters his bigotry by making a toast: “To my granddaughter. I love you. I love everything about you. I am so proud.”It’s in her exploration of the intricacies of family, as well as romantic relationships, that Rutkoski is at her most impressiveIt is in her exploration of the intricacies of family, as well as romantic relationships, that Rutkoski is at her most impressive. Parenthood and childhood are explored, but so are kinship care and the notion of surrogate family – Gen’s grandmother offers kindness to Emily where her own parents have fallen short. The relationship between Emily and her emotionally distant mother is particularly well rendered. As for Emily and Jack’s marriage, we soon realise that Emily is in the grip of coercive control. This is done subtly; what Rutkoski doesn’t say is as important as what she does. With great economy she conveys how Emily tiptoes around the threat of Jack’s displeasure, as well as his facility for manipulation as a way of wielding power (when she feeds the baby formula, his response, before he hits her with a verbal sledgehammer, is “bewildered, disappointed, yet with the expression of someone trying to be gentle”).I have heard it remarked of American fiction that too often the protagonists don’t seem to have any friends. This is not the case here: Ordinary Love is replete with friends, and some of the best writing comes in the novel’s exploration of how they try to save Emily from Jack, only for him to isolate her almost completely. Emily’s regret, and her attempts to repair these friendships, are so richly written that they almost overshadow the central romance between Emily and Gen, which despite the various stumbling blocks to happiness is somehow more straightforward, and less nuanced, than these female friendships. Perhaps it is because we see little of Gen’s interior life in comparison with Emily’s, although it should be noted that we do get to meet her friends, too.Ordinary Love never sags. Rutkoski has written a page-turner, and her prose is generally good. However, every few pages there is a turn of phrase or a metaphor that makes my teeth itch. The first I highlighted was “snow scalloped into drifts like thoughts that start small and then amount to something”. That’s not too bad, you might think, but then we have “[it] felt like the architectural expression of PTSD, where things vanished like bad memories”, and (the unintentionally comical) “She made Emily feel like an egg without its shell”, and “Gen felt distant now, like a half-finished daydream, as did Emily’s youth”. Perhaps most egregious of all: “Emily wanted Gen so badly it was like how people want what they can never have.”How much you enjoy this book will depend on your tolerance for this sort of thing. Mine is generally low, but I pressed on. The plot zipped along and the clumsy metaphors seemed to drop off by the second half, I suspect owing to an editor’s guillotine. To quote the text: “The past was done, over; it isn’t a novel you can revise until you get it right.” One more round of revision in this case would have been no bad thing. Saying that, Ordinary Love is still superior to the vast majority of books in a similar vein, and it has much to recommend it – not least the fact that the sex is very good indeed.Ordinary Love by Marie Rutkoski (Little, Brown Book Group, £16.99).

Sixty years on, Fieseler’s book comes out under the second Trump administration, amid attacks on progressive priorities.“We’re in denial as a society right now that we live ina second red scare,” Fieseler said. “The level of fear now is equivalent or greater to the level of fear felt in the 1950s and 60s.“I thought this was going to be left-field history. That it was just going to sort of help me sort out my disorientation in this American moment. And then the rise of DeSantisism happened, after I signed the contract for the book. It was shocking:banningAP African American history,attackingthe University of Florida, the whole ‘let’s go after Disney’ thing [over its socially inclusive outlook] – that all reinforced the sense that Florida politics are cyclical and certain: everything old is new again.View image in fullscreenCharley Johns with portraits of himself and his brother.Photograph: Courtesy of Florida Memory“When you find a good scapegoat inFlorida, you keep the populace in a state of panic and fear, and you manipulate the system to benefit yourself personally.“Queer folk have been a convenient enemy.Anita Bryantin the 1970s with her anti-homosexual campaign. The rise of Christian conservatism and the Moral Majority, when Jeb Bush played on a lot of anti-gay politics, specifically around the idea of gay adoption. DeSantis is sort of a grandiose revival of all of these unoriginal ideas.“And the reason all that happened is because the Johns committee was allowed to get away with what they got away with, and that set the stage for future politicians, understanding they probably will be able to do so as well.”American Scare is Fieseler’s second book, afterTinderbox: The Untold Story of the Up Stairs Lounge Fire and the Rise of Gay Liberation, a story of New Orleans published in 2018. As influences, he cites “nonfiction books that portrayed reality with literary flair, like Friday Night Lights, which I absorbed, inhaled, or John Berendt’s Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and what that did for portraying Savannah as a character.”Accordingly, American Scare contains evocative portraits of Miami, Gainesville and other engines of the economic boom that propelled Florida from agricultural backwater to political power center, alongside compelling character studies of Johns committee victims.One was theRev Theodore Gibson, an NAACP leader who championed desegregation.“It’s important to know this was a man that the Johns committee persecuted,” Fieseler said. “They forced him to testify publicly. They tried to spuriously get him to give away the records of the Florida NAACP, so that they could harass and arrest members. When he refused, they hounded him, threatened him with jail sentences and fines, and then they chased him all the way up to the US supreme court, where hewonby one vote.“He went on to be a Miami city commissioner and died with sort of hero status in the community he loved and helped. But people don’t know about him now. Why? Because his story has long been excised from the official record.”There is alsoArt Copleston,“one of the last living Johns committee survivors”, in the mid-50s a student at the University of Florida hauled from an exam room to be interrogated about his sexuality, a horrifying episode Fieseler retells at the start of his book.View image in fullscreenArt Copleston.Photograph: Courtesy of Art Copleston PapersCopleston is “in his early 90s now, quite outspoken and brave, and an exception, one of the Johns committee survivors who as part of his lifelong process of recovery from the trauma has to talk in late life about the things that occurred to him as a young man”.In telling Copleston’s story and others, Fieseler shows the brutal cost of the Johns committee. He does so in such depth thanks to a remarkable act of generosity.Bonnie Stark was a master’s student at the University of South Florida when she became “the first Johns committee scholar of any note”.“She learned about the Johns committee initially in a civil rights class, and she became obsessed. She was a child of the Brown decision [Brown v Board of Education, 1954, against racial segregation in public education], she is a civil rights history aficionado, but she was horrified that she hadn’t heard about the Johns committee more, that the red scare had visited Florida, and what went on.“She devoted close to seven years to it, moving from Tampa to Tallahassee and taking a job as a paralegal so she could be closer to the state archives and what were then closed records. She went and sought out the major players and she was able to win them over. She was the only living person to ever get interviews with Remus Strickland and Mark Hawes, the chief investigator and chief attorney of the Johns committee.”Fieseler readStark’s thesis. Reportorial instincts kicked in.“I’m like, ‘Oh my god, she talked to them,’ and I’m thinking, ‘She’s a paralegal, she might be a pack rat.’ So I reached out to compliment her, and also to see, ‘Hey, do you happen to have those transcripts of the interview with Remus Strickland, or maybe even in the recording?’ And what happened was even better.“She said, ‘I actually have the secret second set of all the Johns committee records. They’re all in my house, and I want to give them to you.’ I wept. That was out of a clear blue sky. You know, we as journalists and historians, we are little truffle pigs. We look for things and we celebrate the smallest victory. And this was just like, ‘Oh my god, she’s going to give me a war room of information.’ To this day, what motivated her to give someone like me such a gift is overwhelming to think about, because this was her life’s work.”The records were sloppily redacted. Rather than crawl through state archives, seeking information obscured by design, Fieseler could immerse himself in the Johns committee’s work, reconstructing episodes previously lost to history.It took six years. The records loom over our conversation, stacked in bankers’ boxes. At mention of the Purple Pamphlet, a homophobic Johns publication from 1964 which backfired, prompting the committee’s demise, Fieseler displays a copy.View image in fullscreenA mother escorts her two daughters to the Orchard Villa elementary school in 1959.Photograph: Courtesy of Florida Memory“Major individuals targeted by the Johns committee” prominently included Sigismond Diettrich, a prominent geographer who was driven to attempt suicide. But Fieseler also used the records to tell the stories of more obscure figures, “individuals who were informants, and informants who tried to go further and collaborate. It was really sad: the collaborators were usually betrayed by the committee and simply subjected to the same terrible fate as the individuals who didn’t cooperate.”One thing might be said to be missing from American Scare: a sense that the persecutors ever paid much of a price.“Charlie Johns did not die in prison,” Fieseler said. “He did not face trial for violations of civil liberties or for betraying his oath to the Florida constitution or its people. The question of the records of the Johns committee being opened up didn’t really arise until he had died. He was never apologetic for what he did to others. I don’t think he understood the degree to which his actions destroyed other lives. I don’t think his ego could process that. He thought he was a chummy good guy who could help out a friend.“Remus Strickland came up for federal bribery and perjury charges but escaped by the skin of his teeth. He died without fame. Mark Hawes, the chief attorney, had a seizure and died unable to speak.“So in a thematic sense, time and biology caught up with these men who played around with power as if they would live for ever. But the gears of justice never did spin.”American Scare isout nowExplore more on these topicsBooksFloridaRaceLGBTQ+ rightsUS constitution and civil libertiesHistory booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The debut trailer featured eerie, futuristic imagery, an astronaut, and a blond-haired little girl, but there was nothing concrete or clear about its content. And when it missed its 2022 release window and was“paused indefinitely”in 2023, it wasn’t clear if Pragmata would ever come to be.That all changed on 4 June, when a brand-new trailer was broadcast during aPlayStationshowcase. The blond-haired little girl turns out to be a weaponised android, accompanying an astronaut called Hugh (of course) through space-station shootouts. I played about 20 minutes of the game during Summer Game Fest the following weekend. A lengthy, troubled development cycle is usually a bad omen, but my time with it was promising.Pragmata begins with the aforementioned astronaut, Hugh Williams, unconscious and lying prone amid metallic detritus, his suit is blaring a repeat warning: “integrity compromised”. A child with long, unkept blond hair wearing an oversized blue jacket and nothing else (a bizarre choice, if I’m being honest) runs past Hugh and struggles to tip over a large case nearby. When she finally knocks it on its side, she opens it up to reveal a device that emits lunafilament nanoweave, a material that absorbs and copies any information it is exposed to. She uses it to repair his suit, which in turn heals his wounds, and he’s on his feet (though confused) in no time.Pragmata trailerWe learn they ,are on a moon-based space station, to which Hugh was dispatched after an earthquake. This facility appears to have an autonomous robotic security system that considers Hugh an intruder, however, which means it’s time to fight. And I was not ready for how much fun fighting is.The robot adversaries in Pragmataall have powerful shields, which means Hugh’s arsenal of weapons (which you can add to by finding different firearms around the map) is essentially useless. Thankfully, the barefoot little girl, whom we now call Diana, can hack these enemies to make them vulnerable – you’ll just have to do itwhilethey’re attacking you, and she’s riding on your shoulder.With the face buttons on your controller, you’ll have to navigate through the robot’s mainframe, depicted as several rows and columns of tiles, until you get to a green tile, which will temporarily disarm its shield. You have to do thisfast, however, often while dodging their strikes, and failing these hacks and starting over made for some incredibly tense (and fun) combat.Pragmata’s hacking feels like when you call in a Helldivers 2 stratagem and have to swiftly but purposefully push buttons while under extreme pressure. It turns every firefight into a white-knuckle moment: different robot types require different hacks, and messing up will set you back. In the brief time I spent with Pragmata, there was a pleasing variety of enemies and weapons already.I was engrossed in combat by the time someone tapped me on the shoulder and told me the demo time was over (right before a big boss fight, boo). Despite five-plus years in development, it feels fresh.Pragmata will be out in 2026 forXbox, PlayStation, and PC.Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsFighting gamesXboxPlayStationPCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what are those fake eyelashes doing in there?Charlotte JansenTue 17 Jun 2025 11.05 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 15.16 EDTShareIn 2016, almost by accident, the US artist Taryn Simon ended up making a video work about the most important moment in recent British political history. While scouting for a location for another work, she visited Alexandra Palace in London just as a rehearsal for theBrexitballot-counting was taking place. “I immediately asked if I could come back and film the actual count,” says Simon, whose request was approved, making her the only person in the world permitted to record a Brexit count.She’s speaking with me from Paris, where the video has just gone on show. Presented on two screens, it is at first unremarkable: one view shows a wide frame of the historic Great Hall of the palace, with count staff seated at tables covered with black tablecloths and scattered with paper. A second screen offers a closeup view of two count staff in their official burgundy T-shirts, sorting papers into “Leave” and “Remain”. The tension mounts as each stack grows, but no climax is reached.“It’s a basic picture of the act,” says Simon, who was up until 4am filming the vote count. “I was thinking about the things that trigger these decisions: how the process of counting up desires – and the fervour for change – happens literally in our sleep, deep in the night.”1:16Brexit votes pile up in an excerpt from Taryn Simon's film Haringey Ballot Count  – videoThe undramatic and sober view of this monumental event becomes increasingly chilling with the endless, repetitive sound of paper-sorting, leading towards the outcome we all now know. “Ultimately, it’s just paper,” says Simon, “but it has such a heavy outcome for so many people.” Simon sees the papers as “surrogates” for citizens, the near weightlessness of the material at odds with the gravity of the decision. “I remember sitting there in extreme shock as they were calling out the results and being amazed how something could turn so quickly. It felt unreal.”Simon, 50, is best known for her minimalist, index-like photographs, densely researched still lifes and portraits of things that are hidden – or so familiar they usually pass you by. Working with a large-format camera, she has often gone to extremes, to the edges of society. She has photographed Saddam Hussein’s son Uday’s body double, a nuclear waste storage facility in Washington State, a cryopreservation unit where bodies are frozen just after death, and the Church of Scientology.View image in fullscreen‘They are actually directions we are following’ … Taryn Simon.Photograph: Eli Baden-Lasar/© Taryn Simon, courtesy of the Artist and Almine RechThe Brexit video is part of The Game, a new exhibition of Simon’s work at the Almine Rech gallery in Paris. The Game deals with the everyday objects and events that influence electoral outcomes, right down to a cat from Ohio called Miss Sassy. Alongside the Brexit video, Simon has installed artefact-like photographs, printed and framed in bright colours, chosen to catch your attention as if they’re playful “distractions”. However, as she points out, “They are actually directions we’re following – whether by force, ignorance, or both.”Each image is related to the 2024 presidential election in the US, where Simon lives. She travelled the country photographing things such as a Fox News microphone, Capitol police riot gear, McDonald’s fries, and balloons on standby at a Republican National Convention. She also photographed Miss Sassy, the cat who was at the centre of a media maelstrom last year after her owner accused her Haitian immigrant neighbours in Springfield, Ohio, of abducting her. By the timeDonald Trump got hold of the story, Haitians were accused of eating her.“It’s just a cat,” says Simon. “She had no idea what narrative she was part of, nor did she have any active participation. But she became this emblem ofparanoia and conspiracy theorythat consumed a town and created incredible discord. The cat was later found alive in her owner’s basement – but the outcome doesn’t matter. The story kept going. You can hang your hat on the lie and that’s quite scary.”Simon turns Miss Sassy back into a straightforward image of a cat, but one that is now also a symbol of the disease and the proliferation of misinformation. It recalls one of her early, groundbreaking projects in the early 00s, The Innocents, in which the artist documented people who had been wrongfully convicted and imprisoned for violent crimes. She photographed many of them at the crime scenes after they’d been released – places they had no association with or had never been to. “The fiction takes over, the story consumes, even when there’s so much evidence of the opposite.”View image in fullscreenAt the centre of another storm … Representative Jasmine Crockett’s Eyelashes.Photograph: Maris Hutchinson/© Taryn Simon, courtesy of the artist and Almine RechAnother photograph is of false eyelashes worn by the Democratic politicianJasmine Crockett. Enshrined in their white and pink case, they are eerie and unseeing. “I could have gone to CVS to buy a pair,” Simon says, “but that’s the horror of my work – I never fake it.” She photographed them aftera fiery showdown– that later went viral – during a US House Committee meeting in 2024, triggered by Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene telling Crockett: “I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you’re reading.” She hit back with comments about Greene’s bleached blonde hair. Crockett’s office were somewhat taken aback by Simon’s request to photograph her eyelashes, but agreed. “Sometimes, these quieter things that stand outside and fly by are actually the crux of the story.”The Game sees Simon – who had a solo exhibition at London’s Tate Modern in 2011, aged 36 – returning to the kind of photographic work she made her name with, after years focusing on performance and installation work. “Obviously, the photographic document can generate or reinscribe certainties that are wrong, but it’s also an important tool for pushing against error. It can be that mushy. I don’t think photography has to be clear. I think of photographs as their own creatures who help us see things we can’t or don’t see. They stop time and let you look, make you pause. That’s incredibly valuable, even if I can’t get them to answer.”The show also pays homage to Simon’s father, an inventor of arcade and video games. “He made pinball machines, air hockey tables, skeeball. I spent my whole childhood in arcades. I always wanted to make a game but I never found the thing that aligned with what I do.” But now she has – and it takes the form of her reimagining the kleroterion – an ancient Athenian device for randomly selecting male citizens for public roles.“Only fragments of it exist,” she says animatedly, “and no one really knows how it worked. It had hundreds of slots and any male citizen could insert a chip and have a chance at being chosen for public office or jury duty.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s fun to play a game’ … a detail of Simon’s Kleroterion.Photograph: Maris Hutchinson/© Taryn Simon, courtesy of the artist and Almine RechThe kleroterion highlights an important and under-appreciated element of Simon’s often hard-hitting work: humour. In the gallery in Paris, she has installed a red and blue Vegas-esque carpet. “A weird collision,” she jokes, “between the UN and a cruise ship.” Her work revels in life’s more laughable absurdities – even if, in the past, it has been hard to see because of the gravity of her themes. For now, at least, she is happy to sit back and enjoy it. “It’s fun to watch people enter a serious gallery space and have to play a game.”‘A very old political trope’: the racist US history behind Trump’s Haitian pet eater claimRead moreSimon’s kleroterion is an interactive sculpture that looks like a tall cabinet, with five slots for tokens arranged vertically, and another five horizontally – intended to reflect average family sizes, globally. It encourages us to think about how decision-making happens at a domestic and national level. It took a few years for Simon to figure out the engineering. “The only way to really get a random result is by error,” she says, “which was an interesting thought.”Simon’s father was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s soon after she decided to make the work. “That’s the sadness of it. He’s been part of literally every single thing I’ve done, and now he’s not totally present. But he loves it in his own way.” The work isn’t just a tribute to her father – it could herald another career shift. “I wouldn’t mind quitting,” she says, “and going into arcading.”Taryn Simon: The Game is atAlmine Rech, Paris, until 26 July.Explore more on these topicsArt and designPhotographyExhibitionsArtSculptureBrexitDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had loving parents, but I had to find things out for myself.”He studied piano and composition until he was 16,thereafter he was largely self-taught. Aged 17 he gave his first public recital in Graz with works by Bach, Brahms and Liszt on the programme, one of the encores was his own composition – a sonata with a double fugue. The teenage Brendel was also an author and an exhibited painter, but in 1949 he won fourth prize in the prestigious Busoni competition, which launched his career as a performing musician.His concert and recording career lasted more than 60 years with performances at the world’s most important musical centres and festivals alongside the leading orchestras and conductors. He became particularly associated with the music of Beethoven, and made the first complete recording of the composer’s entire piano music. He took a prominent role in highlighting Haydn’s importance as a composer,in establishingSchubert’s Sonatas and Schoenberg’s Concerto in the repertoire, and rekindling interest in Liszt’s piano music. He moved to London in 1971, and made his home in Hampstead, his second marriage brought three children (his son,Adrian is an acclaimed cellist, his daughter by his first,Doris, is a pop and rock singer). His final publicconcert was in Vienna in 2008but in the succeeding years he published poetry and essays, lectured and continued to teach and give masterclasses.View image in fullscreenInspirational and uncompromising: Alfred Brendel.Photograph: Benjamin Ealovega“I don’t feel guilty about being ‘intellectual’ if that means thinking about the structure and character and humour in a piece of music,”he told the Guardian in 2010on the occasion of receiving Gramophone magazine’s Lifetime Achievement award. “But I’m not talking about dry analysis, which is relatively easy if you know how. I do the opposite. I familiarise myself with a piece and wait for it to tell me what it’s about, and what makes it a masterpiece. That’s what fascinates.”Widely regarded by colleagues as the “musicians’ musician” as well as the “pianists’ mentor”: Brendel’s pupils include Paul Lewis, Imogen Cooper, Kit Armstrong and Till Fellner and he devoted a significant part of his time to sharing his experiences as a musician with younger artists.“Alfred Brendel was my guide, mentor and an endless source of inspiration for more than 30 years, and his passing is an enormous loss not only for music, but on a personal level for those of us who were fortunate enough to be guided and touched by his wisdom and insight, of which he gave so generously and selflessly,” said Lewis. “[He] was unique in the pantheon of great pianists – inspirational and uncompromising, with a formidable knowledge of literature and art as well as of music. His playing was intense and visionary, his teaching no less so – but dry humour was never far,” added Cooper.Brendel received 23 honorary degrees from universities including Weimar, Cambridge, Oxford, Yale and The Juilliard School, the Honorary Vice-Presidency of the Royal Academy of Music and a number of prestigious awards such as honorary membership in the Vienna Philharmonic, the Sonning and Siemens prizes and the Praemium Imperiale in Japan.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicAlfred BrendelnewsShareReuse this content"

It is about an elderly man, Bo, living in a rural village in the north of Sweden with his dog, which his son insists must be taken away. The idea for the book came to Ridzén through the discovery of notes her grandfather’s care team had left.More than 600 Waterstones booksellers were involved in the selection of the shortlist, and a panel of booksellers will choose the winner.Previous winners of the award are Tess Gunty, Alice Winn and Ferdia Lennon, whowon last yearfor his novel Glorious Exploits, andwent on to winthe Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse prize.Explore more on these topicsBooksWaterstonesAwards and prizesFictionnewsShareReuse this content"

The biting play about a pivotal, forgotten momentIt was a turning point in the push for African independence – and it took place in Chorlton-on-Medlock Town Hall. We meet the writer of a play about the fifth Pan-African CongressAnya RyanTue 17 Jun 2025 10.12 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 15.16 EDTShareOn the facade of the building that once housed Chorlton-on-Medlock Town Hall in Manchester sits a plaque commemorating a turning point in the push for African independence. The fifth Pan-African Congress in October 1945 was attended by future global leaders as well as activists and scholars from acrossAfricaand its diaspora. But despite the event’s international importance, it has been largely overlooked by mainstream British history.Now a biting new play is set to remedy this.“I think a lot of Mancunians don’t know it happened,” says playwright Ntombizodwa Nyoni, who lectures in the same building, now part of Manchester Metropolitan University. “But it’s like: you’re part of such a phenomenal moment in history.” Eighty years later, her dramatisation of the event, Liberation, is about to receive its world premiere atManchester international festival.“Quite early on, I was interested in how leaders are made,” Nyoni explains when we meet, post-rehearsal. She started working on Liberation in 2019, spending the first year and a half “getting to know” the 200 delegates through extensive reading and tracing their individual timelines. Then came the task of bringing the attendees to life, showing the people behind their legacies. “I think we have this idea around activists … that they are these extraordinary people. But actually they were all normal people who did extraordinary things,” she says.View image in fullscreenThe cost of activism … Leonie Elliott in rehearsals.Photograph: Ella Mayamothi SommeilNyoni set out to write a play that dug underneath the scant history already available, and focused on the social dynamics between the delegates and the sacrifices they’d have to make to bring about global change. The play zooms in on the attendees’ specific motivations. The congress organiser, George Padmore, is reckoning with his mortality as he considers whom to pass the baton on to, while Jamaican social worker Alma La Badie sometimes feels “like she’s a footnote in history”. “I was looking for who the person is. Because just summarising them through their actions doesn’t tell the full story,” Nyoni explains.The death of George Floyd in May 2020 was, she says, “a pivotal moment” for her writing. “Even in the midst of a pandemic, we were seeing brutality on Black bodies,” she says. “By struggling with my own sense of hope and hopelessness, it made me look at the play very differently.” Liberation morphed into a piece about “survival”, and the cost of activism on “your mental health, your spirituality and your physical health”.“I knew the 80th anniversary was coming,” Nyoni continues, “and I was thinking, ‘OK, actually, how much of what they were talking about at the congress has changed?’” Liberation bridges the gap between past and presentby drawing parallels between the anticolonial struggles of the 1940s, the ongoing fight against systemic racism, and the psychological toll of activism today.Staged at the in-the-roundRoyal Exchangetheatre, director Monique Touko’s production pulls the audience of 2025 into the drama, making them feel like “delegates, active in the conversation”. “We are rebranding Congress. The vision hasn’t been actualised, so we have to go again,” Touko says. She hopes audiences will leave feeling “charged”. “We want history to feel relatable and not so distant. That it still exists in the everyday,” adds Nyoni.View image in fullscreen‘Making the audience feel active in the conversation’ … delegates at the 1945 conference.Photograph: John Deakin/Getty ImagesThe writer-director duo see Liberation as a form of activism in itself. “As a writer, this ismyactivism,” Nyoni says. “I want people to participate in the conversation, and figure out: ‘What is yours?’” The play paints the fight for change as “a marathon” that continues from one generation to the next. “So much of what they were asking for hasn’t come into fruition,” Nyoni continues. “The characters end up doing more than speaking to where they were in 1945 … they are speaking to where we’re at today: it is an ongoing conversation.”Sonically, the play draws on then and now, too. Ife Ogunjobi, from the Brit award-winningEzra Collective, composed a score directly from Nyoni’s own writing playlist, which had music “from across Africa, the Caribbean and across Europe” up until the end of 1945. “Ife took all of that, and he did a beautiful thing with the new and old and fused the worlds together,” says Nyoni. He joins a creative team including choreographer Kloe Dean, who has worked with Little Simz, and costume designer Sunny Dolat. “A lot of people have come from outside theatre … it brings a new energy,” Touko says.The play that changed my life: ‘Daniel Kaluuya winked at me and my mum – and said he acted better for us’Read moreThe significance of Liberation being staged in Manchester on this anniversary feels deeply meaningful – although Touko is careful to credit the grassroots organisations that have previously worked to commemorate the congress in the city. But it is clear that for Nyoni, the play existed before she even wrote it, in Manchester’s very air. When she walks through the old Chorlton Town Hall building she says she feels “the ghosts of people walking around” her. “It is engraved in stone,” Nyoni says.Liberationis at the Royal Exchange theatre, Manchester, from 3 to 19 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal ExchangeEzra CollectiveBlack British cultureColonialismAfricaRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it a good idea?Kate McCuskerTue 17 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 13.24 EDTShareWhen Natalie Rowcroft decided to raffle off her house in Salford, everybody – including her husband, Bradley Rowcroft – thought she “had lost the plot”. It was July 2020; people were doing stranger things with their first pandemic summer. But given that she had read a newspaper article about a couple who’d raffled their house in the morning, and had put her own up for sale by the evening, the scepticism was well-founded. “At first, I wanted nothing to do with it,” says Bradley, a 38-year-old carpenter. It didn’t help that she had also chucked the family car in the draw for good measure.Still, Natalie, 38, a teaching assistant, persevered. She printed out leaflets and put them up all over Salford and Manchester, set up social media accounts to promote the draw and bought a big poster to hang in the couple’s driveway.The Rowcrofts had long dreamed of moving to Australia – but as the pandemic took hold and the housing market stagnated, it began to look increasingly like a dream that might never get off the ground. It was a story that struck a chord with penned-in Facebook scrollers everywhere: soon, Natalie was staying up into the early hours to field entrants’ questions from around the world. She even began to be recognised – through her face mask – in the local supermarket.Rowcroft realised that the more details she shared of the couple’s life on social media, the more tickets they sold on Raffall, the site they used to host the draw. “People would drive past and say: ‘Oh my God, there’s the crazy Rowcrofts, raffling off their house,’” she says.Raffall, a UK-based company founded a decade ago, allows sellers to set a minimum ticket threshold, which they must meet for their property to be won. If they don’t sell enough tickets, they can either give 50% of the ticket revenue to the winner and keep 40% themselves, or give away the house anyway and keep more of the proceeds. Naturally, the company gets a cut of the profit in both scenarios – between 10 and 15%, depending on a seller’s subscription plan.View image in fullscreenNatalie Rowcroft, pictured outside her house in Manchester.Photograph: Courtesy of Natalie RowcroftThe Rowcrofts, whose house was valued at £290,000, needed to sell 200,000 tickets at £2 each to pay off their mortgage, cover both sides’ fees and have some cash left over to pay for their flights and visas. The car was just a bonus – it wasn’t worth the money they would spend shipping it to Brisbane. They gave themselves 90 days but, in the end, managed to meet their ticket threshold in a month-and-a-half.“I didn’t sleep for those 45 days,” says Natalie. “I lost so much weight. It was the hardest time of my life – we were living and breathing it.” Much of that effort was expended reassuring people that it wasn’t a scam: “People didn’t believe it was actually real.” Neither did the winner when, just a few weeks and £400,000 worth of tickets later, the raffle company got in touch to tell her she’d won a five bedroom semi-detached house and a white BMW saloon. After the mortgage and both sides’ fees were paid and Raffall had taken its cut, the Rowcrofts pocketed about £90,000.Natalie, who has three children, says the high of getting the competition over the line was “like giving birth”. In the world of online property raffles, if you’re going to do things by halves, you may as well not even bother.Property competitions are big business in the UK, but for individual sellers, who are attempting to jostle with professional competition companies such as Raffle House, Tramway Path, Elite Competitions, BOTB and yes,Omaze – the prize draw giantthat has been keeping UK punters in multimillion-pound dream houses since 2020 – stories such as the Rowcrofts’ are rare. It is not for a lack of trying on the part of plucky sellers, who – often unable to sell the old-fashioned way – take matters into their own hands. A far cry from the multimillion pound profits of professional competition companies, many lone rafflers just want to make enough money to pay off their mortgage and move on.View image in fullscreenKaren Sugden tried to sell her Dublin flat.Photograph: Courtesy of Karen Sugden“I really wanted it to work,” says Karen Sugden, a 50-year-old HR professional who tried to sell her Dublin flat on Raffall in 2023. A house raffle enthusiast herself (just before we speak, she has entered Tramway Path’s latest competition to win a two-bed flat in south-east London), Sugden, who grew up in Yorkshire, was selling up in order to move to Paris. “Property in Dublin was and is horribly expensive, so I thought: ‘This is a nice way for someone to get on the property ladder for a fiver,’” she says. Modest but cosy, the one-bed flat in Kilmainham, on the edge of Phoenix Park, would’ve been a dream for a first-time buyer. Worth about €250,000 (£213,000), Sugden had lived there happily for 17 years.“I wanted someone to get that place,” she says. “I didn’t want it to go to an investor.”Despite her best efforts, the raffle ended when she was within spitting distance of her 120,000 ticket target, the winner got a cash payout – “still a life changing amount of money” – and the flat was subsequently sold to an investor hoping to build on his existing Dublin property portfolio. It’s a grim, if all too familiar, fable about the state of the modern housing market in the UK and Ireland. “The flat wasn’t huge, but the rental income for it would have been €1,800 a month,” says Sugden, “which is an absolute joke.”Raffall isn’t the only site where individual rafflers can set up shop, but it is one of the most namechecked; last month, Imelda Collins used the platform to raffle her picturesque cottage in Leitrim, Ireland, for £5 a ticket. Thanks to international media coverage and the cottage’s postcard-worthy charm, sales surpassed the minimum threshold of 150,000. Though it’s unknown how many tickets were sold, with the house valued at £255,000, the prize draw netted a profit of at least £495,000 – not bad for a two-bedroom bungalow. “I am not the first to do this and certainly won’t be the last,” Collins toldthe New York Timesa few days before the competition closed. When contacted by the Guardian, she responded that she and the winner, who is thought to be American, are “keeping a low profile. Letting it all sink in.” “Clearly I wasn’t as savvy as Imelda was,” says Sugden.But to what extent does our desire for stories of triumph –the man who failed to sell his sprawling £545,000 farmhousethrough an estate agent and instead raffled it off to a 23-year-old admin assistant; the newlywed who hadmultiple sales fall throughbefore he decided to set up his own raffle company – belie these competitions’ success?Jason Dale, the managing director of raffle curation site Loquax, says that of the Raffall property competitions that his site has listed, just 13% have concluded with a house winner. “I think it’s much harder now for an individual to give away their house than it was back in 2020,” he says. “For a while, people were coming along thinking, ‘Here’s my house in Grimsby or somewhere, I’m going to put it on at £50 a ticket, and I’m going to become a millionaire.’ It just didn’t work.”For one, properties belonging to ordinary sellers – a (perfectly nice)Sheffield semi-detached; aone-bedroom flat in Aberdeen– appear almost risibly shabby compared with the palatial houses of Omaze, or the flashy McMansions of Elite Competitions. Then there’s the legwork required to garner the publicity that professional raffle companies inherently attract. “One thing that people don’t realise when they go to Raffall is that they’ve still got to become influencers,” says Dale, who has listed more than 500 house competitions on Loquax since 2017. “They’ve got to do all the social media and get the press involved and keep going and going. It’s a really tough task. ”Loquax, which earns revenue from raffle companies when entrants click through from its site, has listed 63 house competitions so far this year – mostly from professional companies. Last year it was 118 – 90 of which resulted in a house win, 23 of which saw a cash payout, one of which was closed without details, two of which were closed with entrants being refunded and two of which are still open. “Whether or not they’re good quality is another question,” says Dale. His job is just to post them.View image in fullscreenDunstan Low in front of his six bedroom manor house in Melling, Lancashire.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“The truth of it is that it’s a very long process,” says Mark, who attempted to sell a property on Raffall last year when his marriage ended. “Unless you’ve got a load of money to put into Google Ads.” For individual rafflers, the task is not just selling your house, but yourself. “We had some pretty nasty comments in the papers,” says Mark. “Opening yourself up to that, if you’re just a normal person, isn’t easy, and you don’t get any sort of briefing on it.” Months after his raffle failed to sell enough tickets, “all I want to do is sell it and get rid of it now”.Dunstan Low, a 45-year-old artist, was lucky enough to catch the raffle wave at the right time. Actually, he adopted the Omaze model – introducing free postal entries, so the raffle can be classed as a free draw and escape regulation by the Gambling Commission; donating a cut of the revenue to charity – before Omaze even arrived in the UK in 2020.Too good to be true? What it is really like to win a £3m dream homeRead moreLaunched in 2017, the raffle to win Low’s Grade II-listed Georgian manor in Lancashire netted £1m in ticket sales after he failed to sell it through an estate agent. A self-described “mortgage prisoner” who was up to his eyeballs in debt, Low had little choice but to get rid of it. “I would have been repossessed and probably divorced,” he says. “As it is, it wasn’t repossessed … though Iamdivorced.” Granted, his then-wife didn’t know that their house was up for raffle until the local paper was already on its way.The property raffle industry in the UK is largely unregulated: most raffles are classed as free draws or prize competitions, and do not come under the Gambling Act 2005. Free draws offer free postal entries alongside paid-for online tickets, while prize competitions involve entrants having to answer a question – one that’s sufficiently difficult to discourage people from entering – in the vein of daytime TV competitions. Neither require a licence to run.“Raffle sites are right on the border of gambling, really,” says Dale. Many would argue they’re no different. “It’s very difficult – you hear stories of people spending a lot of money on pay-to-enter sites,” he says. One entrant to Low’s competition bought £10,000 worth of tickets. “Say I spent £500 on a bingo site – that might get flagged up,” says Dale. “If I play on a competition site, it doesn’t. There’s a conflict there.”View image in fullscreenNatalie and Bradley Rowcroft with their children in Australia.Photograph: Courtesy of Natalie RowcroftRaffle companies themselves may have eyes on the prize, but the individuals who raffle their properties often do so with a desire to do good. Adam Thwaites, a 40-year-old accountant, raffled his three-bedroom family home in South Shields for £1-a-ticket on Raffall in the hope of raising £50,000 for children’s charity Grace House. While they only managed to raise £3,000 for the charity after ticket sales fell wide of their – admittedly ambitious – 200,000 mark, they decided to give away their house anyway. “Financially, it wasn’t worth it, but in the end we just said, ‘If we get enough to pay off what’s left on the mortgage, we’ll just let someone have it and it doesn’t matter,’” he says. They handed over the keys to a 27-year-old from Carlisle who was struggling to get on the property ladder. “We were going to move anyway,” he shrugs. At least when they work, property raffles can change lives.As for Natalie and Bradley, they’re settling nicely into life in Brisbane. “We’re just a normal family that followed their dream,” says Natalie. Would they do it again? “Never. Never in a million years.” They’ve kept the sign they had on the house advertising the raffle, though, just in case they change their minds: “It’s in the garage. I’m like: ‘Can we just burn it now?’ It’s embarrassing. But Brad won’t let me get rid of it.”Explore more on these topicsHomesHousingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Can we change this dynamic?Pamela Stephenson ConnollyTue 17 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 03.01 EDTShareMy wife and I have been together for seven years. I honestly can’t remember the last time we had sex– it’s been at least a few years. For most of our relationship, I’ve taken on the role of caretaker. She struggles with anxiety, was recently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)and often needs a lot of emotional hand-holding. Over time, it’s taken a toll on how I see our relationship. We also fell intoa habit of using silly, childish voices with each other. What started out as playful has ended up making me feel more like her mother than her wife. For a long time, I didn’t have much of a libido, and to her credit, she didn’t push the issue. But now that my sex drive has returned, it feelsas if it’s all I can think about– except I just can’t seem to feel that way about her any more. Every time I’m briefly tempted to initiate something, it gets snuffed out by the same patterns: the childish behaviour, the emotional neediness, the feeling of being needed more as a caretaker than a partner. Is it possible to break out of this dynamic? Or have we crossed a line that can’t be uncrossed?When one partner becomes a caregiver to the other, the erotic charge between them is very likely to be reduced. And when the childlike element you described creeps into the relationship, a sexual taboo arises. Your feeling of being mother to a child is most definitely not sexy; it connects your psyche with a deep and forbidden sense of incest that is never going to allow you to desire your partner. If you want to desire her again you will have to encourage the adult side of her to be present and engage with you as a competent individual in your lives together. It’s possible she may have developed some of the behaviours you dislike as a coping mechanism. If you do not want to spend your life mothering her you must refuse to support the childish behaviour, which is a form of control and passive-aggression. The first step would be to have a frank, adult, non-blaming conversation about the state of your union. Validate the parts of her that are mature and self-reliant, and gently let her know that you would be doing her a disservice to support her learned helplessness any longer.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

How do I make it nice and crisp?Anne, by email“Moisture is the enemy of crisp tofu,” says Emma Chung, author ofEasy Chinese Food Anyone Can Make, so the quest for cubes of bean curd that are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside starts by getting rid of as much excess water as possible (and choosing a tofu labelled “firm” or “extra-firm” in the first place). “I usually do this by wrapping the tofu in tea towels, placing it between two large plates and putting a heavy pot or pan on top,” Chung says. After 10 minutes, you “should have a nice and firm tofu that will have a lovely texture, and it will be a lot easier to crisp up”.Guardian columnist Ravinder Bhogal, meanwhile, pops her tofu on a wire rack set over a tray and covers it with kitchen paper or a clean cloth: “Put a weight on top and leave it for a couple of hours, and ideally overnight – that will squeeze out the excess moisture.” She then pats the tofu dry and coats it in corn, rice or potato flour before frying (or putting in an air fryer) for an “off-the-Richter crunch”. Chung is simpatico, coating her tofu pieces in a thin layer of cornflour to create a crust that “turns extra crisp when fried or baked”. Simply put the cubed tofu in a bowl, cover “generously” with cornflour and give everything a good toss. “If you’re using slices of tofu, dip them in a shallow plate of cornflour to make sure they’re evenly coated.”Kirk Haworth, chef and co-founder ofPlates, the UK’s first Michelin-starred vegan gaff, recommends hard-frying the coated tofu. Pour oil into a pan and, once that’s “really hot, whack in the tofu and fry, stirring constantly, for about three minutes”. Don’t overcrowd the pan, though, so fry it in batches, if need be, and transfer the cooked cubes to a paper-lined plate to drain. At this time of year, Haworth would then be inclined to toss those crisp cubes through a cold noodle salad, or pile them on to little gem lettuce leaves, while Chung prefers hers in a salad of chopped cucumber and cherry tomatoes. Either way, you’ll want a punchy sauce to go with it, because tofu is more a vehicle for flavour than a wonder in its own right: “Equal parts soy sauce, vinegar, tahini, a splash of sesame oil and chilli oil would be my basic go-to,” Chung says.Alternatively, dial up the heat withMeera Sodha’s chilli tofu. Fry bashed cumin seeds and diced onion in oil until soft, then add crushed garlic, grated ginger and green chilli. After five minutes, go in with some ground black pepper, tomato puree, soy sauce, sugar and salt, followed by sliced red and green peppers and a little water. Once the peppers are soft, add the crisp fried tofu to the pan to warm through, then add greens and chapatis to serve.And if you’re still struggling with that rubbery texture, Haworth recommends tempura-ing your tofu: “Marinate it in soy sauce, honey and chilli, leave it, then dip in tempura batter and fry,” he says. “Nowthat’sdefinitely going to be crisp – although probably a little less healthy.”Got a culinary dilemma?

In the UK, the season starts a bit later, around June, so we’ve got a bit more time yet to enjoy them. Still, the season is short, so I use these wonderful beans as much as I can, while I can. This is the kind of dish I’d make on a quiet afternoon: simple, full of flavour, nothing fancy. Just a nice way to enjoy what the season gives you, before it disappears again for another year.Broad bean and mint tortilla with a manchego crustPrep15 minCook30 minutesServes2-42 tbsp olive oil1 banana shallot, peeled and finely chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and finely sliced250g fresh broad bean pods, podded to yield 100-125g beans4 large free-range eggsSalt and black pepper2 mint sprigs, leaves stripped and chopped50g manchego, gratedHeat the oil in a small roughly 16cm nonstick frying pan, then gently saute the shallot for 10 minutes, until lovely and soft. Add the garlic, cook, stirring, for a minute more, then take off the heat.Bring a pan of water to a boil and blanch the broad beans for a minute or two, depending on their size. Drain and refresh in cold water, then slip each bean from its outer shell (discard the shells).Beat the eggs in a bowl and season generously. Add the beans, mint and half the manchego to the bowl, then, using a slotted spoon, lift the softened shallot out of the pan, leaving the oil behind, and stir it into the egg mix.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app, scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.Return the pan and oil to a medium-low heat, then, once it has heated up, pour in the egg mixture and swirl the pan until you see the egg starting to set around the sides. Leave to cook undisturbed for three to four minutes, until the bottom is set and the top is still quite juicy. Invert the pan on to a flat plate or board (don’t worry if it’s a bit oozy), so the tortilla is cooked side up, then quickly add the remaining cheese to the hot pan and turn up the heat a little. As soon as the cheese starts to melt and bubble, slide the tortilla back into the pan, uncooked side down on top of the layer of cheese.Use a spatula to tuck in the edges of the tortilla to create those classic round sides, and leave to cook for two to three minutes more. Use a spatula or fish slice to release the cheesy underside of the tortilla, then turn out on to a plate and serve with good bread and perhaps a nice salad.Explore more on these topicsSpanish food and drinkSummer food and drinkFoodEggsVegetablesCheeseMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

The West Midlands police warn that many criminals will be after car keys, so if you are not driving to your destination hide the keys in a safe, secure drawer or even take them with you. Putting them into a Faraday pouch (£6 at Halfords) will help prevent relay theft, whereby criminals use electronic devices to intercept the signal from key fobs and steal vehicles. Using a steering lock will also help.Avoid obvious signs that you are away by cancelling milk and newspaper deliveries, and don’t order anything online that may end up sitting on your doorstep. Secure the catflap closed, as long as the cat is also being looked after, and take all keys out of doors.View image in fullscreenDon’t order anything online that may end up sitting on your doorstep.Photograph: Radharc Images/AlamyUsing timers for lights (from£5.99 at Screwfix) will give the illusion that you are there in the evening. These plug into a socket and can turn on an attached table lamp at intervals set on the device.Motion sensor lights, usually used outside, can also deter criminals. Alex Parker-Walklate of the brokers Intelligent Insurance says they can also alert neighbours to suspicious activity.There is the potential for other nasty surprises as well as burglary. Turning off your water when you leave the house can prevent the threat of flood and water damage. Jonathan Cracknell from the insurer Aviva says this will also prevent huge bills from gushing water or undetected leaks. But if you have a fire sprinkler system installed, the water should be left on.Consider an upgradeHome alarm units are graded from one to four, the higher being the more secure. Grade two is appropriate for most homes, says Parker-Walklate, and will include motion detector sensors around the perimeter of the property. It is important that an alarm is accredited by the National Security Inspectorate (NSI) or the Security Systems and Alarms Inspection Board (SSAIB), he says.You should consider whether you want a monitored system, which contacts a key-holder or the police if there is a break-in, or an unmonitored one, which just sounds an alarm.View image in fullscreenIt is important that an alarm is accredited by the NSI or the SSAIB.Photograph: GregorBister/Getty Images/iStockphotoCriminals are more likely to abandon a burglary if motion sensors integrated into the system set off lights or an alarm. “If you do choose these security systems, it’s important to ensure these sensors are properly maintained, well positioned, and – in the case of smart systems – securely connected to your home network,” Parker-Walklate says.Front and back doors should each have a five-lever mortise deadlock or a multipoint locking system, which is the type found on modern UPVC or composite doors. These systems secure the door at a number of points and offer greater resistance against force.If you need to keep a spare key nearby, consider using a secure key safe instead of hiding itJonathan Cracknell, AvivaSmart doorbells and wifi-connected security cameras can act as a visible deterrent to criminals and can also provide footage if there is a break-in.When buying one, look for the best image quality, reliable night vision and a wide-angle lens. Cloud storage is also desirable so that recordings are retained.The Guardian’s Filter sitefound the Google Nest doorbell (priced at £178 on Amazon) was the most impressive all-rounder.If you do have a video doorbell or alarm connected to wifi, remember to keep your phone on and ensure push notifications are activated.Trust a friendView image in fullscreenLeave spare keys with a trusted friend or neighbour – not under a flower pot.Photograph: Cavan Images/AlamyNever leave your keys under a flowerpot or a doormat. As well as giving a burglar easy access, it will invalidate any insurance claim that you make when you return.“Spare keys should only be left with a friend, relative or trusted neighbour. If you need to keep a spare key nearby, consider using a secure key safe instead of hiding it,” says Cracknell.Tell a trusted person that you are going away. Ideally they will be able to go to the property if you become aware that something has happened, says Edouard Rekko of the alarm company Verisure. “If something suspicious happens, you’ll need a neighbour or friend nearby to check in since police often require an on-the-ground report before taking action – especially if the intruders have already left,” he says.If you are away for a long time, it is worth asking them to check in on the property. And if you have deliveries that arrive unexpectedly, ask them to pick them up from the doorstep.Alternatively you could get a house-sitter. This could be a friend or member of your family or someone you connect with through one of the many sites that link up homeowners with sitters. The service is often free in exchange for accommodation, although some sitters can charge depending on how much work is required, such as looking after pets.Avoid social mediaIf your property is left completely unoccupied, avoid posting pictures from the beach or of you having a beer in the sun. This can be a green light for burglars to break in, knowing that you are hundreds or thousands of miles away.An easy way around this is to simply wait and post when you return home. Or restrict the settings on your account so that only trusted friends and family can see the snaps.The Association of British Insurers says that, in general, you should still be covered if you post on socials and there is a problem, but it is best to check with your insurer beforehand to be absolutely sure that the posts won’t affect a claim.View image in fullscreenPosting holiday photos while your home is empty can give a green light to burglars.Photograph: Elizaveta Galitckaia/AlamyThink outside as well as inTidy around outside your home, putting tools away. Secure ladders so that burglars don’t have easy access to high windows. Cover BBQs and garden furniture so they are not in view. Move wheelie bins away from garages or low fences to make access more difficult for burglars.One in four homes has experienced attempts to break into sheds or outbuildings, according to Aviva. “If a thief can’t get into your house, they might try breaking into your shed or taking something from your garden instead,” says Cracknell.Thieves mostly target garden tools and bikes outside the home. Ensure that you shed is locked; it is worth securing your bike inside, preferably with a lock rated Sold Secure Gold.Battery-operated shed alarms cost between £20 and £30.Check your insuranceMost insurance policies state how long a property can be left empty for: typically it’s up to four weeks or 30 days. Your insurance policy will have the exact details. It is vital that you check before taking off on a long break as you may not be covered if your home is left uninhabited for longer.Most one- or two-week holidays don’t need to be declared to your insurer but if you plan to leave for a significant period of time, then you should let the company know.“[The insurance company] may offer an unoccupied home policy or suggest specific conditions, such as arranging for someone to check in periodically,” says Parker-Walklate.Explore more on these topicsPropertyMoney hacksConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I moved into the flat in 2020, and topped up my credit meter with £50 a month, as instructed by my housing association. I understood that this covered my gas and electricity use.In 2023, I received a demand for more than £2,700 from EDF, stating that I had not been paying my electricity bill.It has since had me on a payment plan of £108 a month. I’ve now beentold thatit should not have billed me for more than a year’s worth of arrears.I feel thatit is taking advantage of the fact that I don’t know how the system works.LRE,LondonIt’s hard to imagine how it must be for young people in care to be flung into the adult world as soon as they come of age without the support most of us take for granted.I established that your housing association flat is on a communal heating network, which means the costs of heating and hot water are divided among residents and included in the service charge. Those on low incomes can pay incrementally on a prepayment meter, which you have been doing.Unbeknownst to you, a second meter, supplied by EDF, recorded your electricity consumption. It is locked away and accessible only to the housing association and, since you didn’t know about it, you didn’t inform EDF that you had moved in.Backbilling rules mean suppliers can’t charge for more than 12 months’ supply if they haven’t previously sent bills.EDF tells me it did send bills addressed to the owner/occupier since it didn’t have your name. That means the backbilling rule does not apply and you are liable for the electricity you have used since 2020.EDF doesoffer grantsand deals to help customers on low incomes and it told me it would look into what support it could offer you.The meter was replaced with a smart meter in 2023 and it has now belatedly discovered that your actual consumption since then shows its previous estimates were too high.It’s therefore reduced your debt by £105 and moved you to a better tariff that reduces your monthly payments. You can’t access the smart meter, but you can track your consumption on the EDF app.Your housing association, Wandle, tells me it was unaware that you were vulnerable and that its support team will now be in touch with you. It also says that it will now produce an energy information sheet for new residents to prevent your situation recurring.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

As a muggy summer’s day began outside Shildon, Durham – rain threatening, bees drowsy in the hedgerows – I found myself standing on an embankment, surveying two rows of colossal stone teeth jutting through the earth. It looked as if someone had buried a sleeping giant.“You wouldn’t believe it by looking at it, but this is one of railway history’s most amazing feats,” my companion, rail expert Richie Starrs, said as we gazed down at the molars beneath our feet. A closer look revealed they were abandoned rail sleepers, laid out between the hawthorns and along which coal wagons were once pulled uphill by steam traction locomotives. “This is the Brusselton Incline, a section of the original Stockton and Darlington Railway. Nationally, it’s a story that’s not well known, but it’s one we’re rightly proud of.”Durham mapFor those interested in such rail history, this is a year like no other. Two hundred years ago, on 27 September 1825, the 26-mile Stockton and Darlington Railway opened as the world’s first public railway, making Shildon the world’s first railway town. And the lessons learned there helped the north-east, then Britain, Europe and the world grasp the importance of rail travel, first for transporting coal and lime, then, decisively, for passengers. It is “the railway that got the world on track”.A focal point of this year’s bicentennial celebrations throughout Britain (seeRailway 200for details on hundreds of events) is Durham’s new multi-useS&DR Trail of Discovery. Launching this month as part of the multi-artsS&DR200festival, the meandering greenway follows the original 26-mile route from Witton Park Colliery near Bishop Auckland to Stockton Riverside and will, its founders hope, stimulate interest in the region’s rail history – and give a shot in the arm to the “left behind” pit communities along the way. There is a buoyant mood around the anniversary, but that doesn’t dispel the melancholy that has lingered over much of the rail line since the coalfields were exhausted and the Shildon Wagon Works, once described as “the jewel in British Rail’s crown”, was closed.View image in fullscreenA replica of Locomotion No 1, the first steam-powered train to run on the Stockton and Darlington Railway.Photograph: Lonely Town Film & MediaThere would be some who find this all too trainspotterish, but not Starrs, S&DR200’s project manager, or Niall Hammond, volunteer chair of the Friends of the S&DR, both of whom joined me on the first completed section of the trail, a five-mile ramble from the Brusselton Incline to Heighington station, the world’s first train station, at Newton Aycliffe.The idea is to encourage travellers to walk, eat and stay on the trail for two to three days, but also spark wider regeneration for the areaOver the coming months, the trail – rich in history – will be transformed with 17 information boards and newly commissioned art murals, plus a podcast and augmented reality game, devised to add colour. Fittingly, you can also hop on a train between many of the milestones along the route.The idea, Niall told me, is to encourage travellers to walk, eat and stay on the trail for two to three days, but also spark wider regeneration for the area. According to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, Durham remains one of the most deprived areas in England. “This is more than history for people who like rail tracks and iron,” he told me. “The whole point is to make it count for locals. We’re doing up buildings, cleaning up areas and showing why the world was changed from here. It’s urban regeneration in action.”View image in fullscreenSkerne Bridge, the world’s oldest railway bridge in continuous use.Photograph: Mike MacEacheranOnce my eyes had learned to read the signs of rail history in the landscape, despite the absence of so much of it, it became easier to imagine how this tiny corner of Durham changed the world. Along a stretch of the reclaimed rail line through Shildon, impressions of former goods sheds, an iron warehouse, loading bays and an engine house appeared next to tired houses and an empty pub.We passed a coaling drop, admiring the handsome brickwork arches and columns that once saw wooden chutes rapidly unload coal into hoppers and a row of railway workers’ cottages, now memorials to those who dedicated their lives to the tracks. There was no whiff of engine oil, only bluebells and primrose.The newest part of Shildon’s compelling train story is atLocomotion, a museum that opened its £8m New Hall last year. It holds Europe’s largest indoor collection of historic locomotives (a mightily impressive 99 engines) and is the temporary home of a 150-year-old bronze statue of the great north-east rail engineer Robert Stephenson, after its removal from London Euston during construction works for HS2, Britain’s controversial high-speed railway. Alongside his influential father George, who designed the first locomotive for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, Robert shaped rail history, and taking pride of place inside is his world-renowned locomotive Rocket, built in 1829 and on loan from York’sNational Railway Museum.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The book, also part of the National Railway Museum’s collection, lists more peculiar novelties from the 1840s, including recipes for birch wine, English champagne, mince “pyes” and calf foot gilly, a pudding made by boiling a calf’s foot. Thankfully, that was not on the menu.Another good place to step through the looking-glass isHopetown Darlington, an eight-minute train journey from Heighington to North Road station, which unloads passengers beside another superlative: the Skerne Bridge, the world’s oldest railway bridge that has remained in continuous use. The open-air rail museum, with 3 hectares (7.5 acres) and an exhibition in a Victorian-era station, is an arsenal of detail, with a dust-free archive of 30,000 heritage artefacts.The trivia is half the fun. When a message was to be delivered from a moving train to a station, I learned, the note was tucked inside a slit potato and simply flung from the window. Amazingly, the story of the Stockton and Darlington Railway is on the Japanese school curriculum, but not in England.View image in fullscreenThe Opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, 1825 by John Dobbin.Photograph: Hopetown, DarlingtonIn its great engineering hall, I was reminded of the UK’s contribution to railways the world over. Robert Stephenson went on to help create the Grand Trunk Railway in Canada, as well as the first railroad in Egypt. His work directly influenced the Norwegian Trunk Railway and the first railway in Argentina.Rightly, all of this and more will be celebrated across the UK this summer – fromInspiration, Railway 200’s unique exhibition train, which is touring 60 stations (from 27 June), to the largest ever assembly of rolling stock at Derby Litchurch Lane Works, the country’s largest train factory (The Greatest Gathering, 1 to 3 August). Essentially, it is an education in the benefits of rail travel and the art of slowing down at home. Or, perhaps, it’s better to think of this as a story about people, communities and the tracks that help bring them together.S&DR 200runsto November 2025 acrossDurham and the Tees Valley.Railway 200runsto the end of the year, with eventsnationwide.

This will probably get me in trouble with my mother in a way that coming out as bisexual never did, because she believed that you should always be your authentic self, so long as you have good taste. Stomp clap music has often been the subject of much derision and a bit of a punchline. But despite the ridicule, I’m willing to defend my taste.View image in fullscreenSinging about not telling someone you love them out of fear … the Lumineers.Composite: Guardian Design;  Kevin Winter/WireImageThe genre, sometimes referred to as stomp and holler or indie folk, peaked in the 2000s, with bands such as the Lumineers, Of Monsters and Men and, of course, Mumford & Sons – think a lot of guitars, banjos, the odd fiddle, literal stomping and clapping, with the occasional rousing “hey!” in the background. It was largely associated with hipsters – the twirly moustached, braces and Henley-shirt-wearing kind – and with band members who all look like Sunday school preachers and youth pastors. I can’t stand the aesthetic, but the music is undeniable.So how did a black queer woman – raised on jazz and soul – end up loving these bands? Mostly through a lot of late nights on Tumblr – the mainstay of any teenager figuring themselves out in the 2010s. I was obsessed withthe Norwegian teen drama Skamand all its various iterations and adaptations. It’s an obsession that led me to Tumblr, where there were tonnes of fan edits (short video tributes to the show’s couples and characters), all set to an endless stream of stomp and clap such as the Lumineers’OpheliaorKing and Lionheartby Of Monsters And Men.View image in fullscreenNanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir performs with Of Monsters and Men in 2012.Photograph: Caitlin Mogridge/Redferns/Getty ImagesThough my music taste wasn’t limited, it definitely wasn’t cool (whatever that means). As my love for the genre grew, my friends, a small group of queer kids at a Catholic school, were very much live and let live with my choices – we were already on the outskirts anyway. It was never exactly something to bust out at a group sesh, though. I think the closest I could get wasEd Sheeran’s Nancy Mulligan, which we could all agree was good “straight white” music.Now 23, I am (nearly) past that phase, but at the time the music was always a comfort to me, as I wrestled with coming out.Against the joyful twang of the banjo, the music was melancholy, but never devastating – a contrast to the turmoil I felt inside. There was longing and regret and unrequited love, but also hope after heartbreak. Songs such asCleopatra by the Lumineersspoke to the lifelong regret of not telling someone you love them out of fear. Others, such asThe Night We Metby Lord Huron, portrayed the first intense heartache you feel after drifting out of a relationship, something that spoke to me as I drifted home, aged 16, after kissing a girl for the first time – not able yet to talk about it, music was my solace.My love for these bands (with the exception of Mumford & Sons,you know what you did) was as much about the self-discovery as it was the music. Growing up, I lovedemo indie bandsbecause my friends put me on to them, while jazz and soul were a part of my upbringing. My violin lessons are why you will find Beethoven next toCowboy Carteron my playlists. But indie folk was all mine, music discovered in an online community almost as an antidote to the catholic guilt and self-loathing I was battling through. So for me stomp and clap was the soundtrack of my coming out and I’m willing to make the case for its inclusion on all Pride playlists this year. (Hear me out: fiddles at Pride!)"

But all plants are living entities with specific care needs. Pale, floppy leaves usually indicate overwatering, inadequate sunlight, or poor drainage, which all cause the same problem: too much moisture in the soil. Aloe plants store water in their thick leaves, so any excess easily causes root rot and weak growth.Houseplant of the week: aloe veraRead morePrescriptionCheck the soil; if wet and dense, repot your aloe in fresh, free-draining compost mixed with perlite or pumice. Move it to a brighter location with indirect sunlight, as too little light will result in the soil being wetter for longer. It also causes weak, stretched growth. Finally, allow the soil to dry thoroughly between waterings.PreventionIdeally, plant your aloe in cacti and succulent soil in a pot with a drainage hole. Place it in a bright spot with indirect sunlight, and water sparingly. Your aloe should regain its sturdy, vibrant form. Green fingers crossed!Got a plant dilemma?

Composite: Save the ChildrenPhotographer Misan Harriman gave lessons and equipment to young people who have fled Gaza – and the pictures they took are funny, revealing and often heartbreakingByEmine SanerTue 17 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTShareAboy pulling a funny face, a sleeping pet, a grandfather in his chair – all ordinary scenes from life that many of us would take for granted. What makes these images special is they were taken by Palestinian children, refugees displaced to Egypt since Israel’s war inGaza, making sense of their new, if hopefully temporary, home and what they have escaped from.“It’s familial life, relationships, and although they’ve seen so much, you’re not seeing trauma, you’re not seeing the faces of people that have given up,” says the photographer Misan Harriman, an ambassador for Save theChildren. “Even though none of these kids know what the future brings and there’s huge uncertainty, they are living in the moment. They’re doing their best to thrive and learn.” The camera, he adds, is “a seemingly inanimate object that can help you find answers to a world that is confusing, and even more confusing for some of these children.”Harriman led a photography workshop in Cairo, run by Save the Children and the charity Choose Love, in which 10 Palestinian children from Gaza, between the ages of 11 and 13, were given a camera and taught how to use it. Over several weeks, they created their own images. It was fun and an outlet for creativity, but it was also about much more, says Harriman. These are children forced to leave their homeland. “They understand what bearing witness means,” he says. “They understand what preserving memories means, and hopefully taking pictures of friends, loved ones, possessions they love, it’s just a beautiful, maybe even cathartic experience for them.”View image in fullscreenMisan Harriman, centre, with some of the children involved in the project. Photograph: Anna Sass/Save the ChildrenThe children who took part in the project are the lucky few, he acknowledges. In Egypt, temporarilyhome to 100,000 Palestinians since October 2023, more than 2,000 children are on a waiting list to access Save the Children’s support services. In Gaza, aid agencies warn of almost total famine as Israel maintained its blockade, only recently and scantly eased. Harriman says: “More than 93% of all the children in Gaza are at critical risk of famine – that means 930,000 children are at risk of famine, disease and death, if nothing’s done.”Their images, and the portraits taken by Harriman, are about showing “the humanity of Palestinian families. I want us to re-transmit their right to thrive and learn and laugh and grow, and have siblings and parents in their lives to look after them. Those are basic rights, that the children of the occupied territories do not have.”Harriman started late in photography – he went on to document protests including those by Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion, shoot for British Vogue, and photograph Harry and Meghan, and was nominated for an Oscar for his short filmThe After– and he says he learned from the children, too. He saw how they didn’t tend to doubt themselves. “They press the shutter because they want to take that image, they want to freeze that decisive moment. I think that’s something that’s core to the essence of photography, and children have that inbuilt. We lose it as we get older.”He taught them about practicalities such as composition and light, which they picked up quickly, but he says his job was to “plant seeds for these kids to see that with a camera, there are limitless possibilities in how they can tell stories. And all of them have stories that deserve to be heard and seen.” Here, Harriman chooses some of his favourite images from the project.View image in fullscreenPortrait of her mother, by Rawan. All photographs: Save the ChildrenIt’s an extraordinary image, by someone who has never been formally trained in photography to understand composition and light. There are many people that have far more time and resources who wouldn’t necessarily be able to come out with a picture that is this honest, well-composed and a really good representation of what portraiture at its best should be. Palestinian mothers, to me, are deities – they have a strength that few mothers on this planet are forced to have. I see a daughter allowed to capture her love for her mother for eternity. Apart from it just being a good picture, you have a young Palestinian showing respect and recognising the sacrifice and the fortitude of what it means to be a Palestinian mother today.Rawan says:“This project enabled me to document my memories and enrich my skills. I was able to show what I hope to achieve one day. It meant a lot to me. My mother is my first supporter and witnessed my first steps. I was excited when I took a photo of her.”View image in fullscreenPortrait of his cat, by ShadiIt’s subversive in many ways. We have all these gender presumptions of boys, but he says his cat is his favourite thing, and I love the tenderness of that. His pet is what he loves and wants to look after, and it probably makes him feel safe and cosy, with the consideration of what he has been through. Pets are a big part of Palestinian culture and there are many stories of children, with what little food they have, feeding their pets first. The people of Palestine have always looked after the land and their animals. It’s nicely composed, with soft light falling on the cat. It’s a lovely picture.Shadi says:“All my photographs are special to me and each photo has its own significance. My favourite photo is the one of my cat, because she’s the most precious thing I own and I feel a great deal of responsibility towards her.”View image in fullscreenPortrait of his grandfather, by ShadiIt’s hard not to get emotional when you think of the generations that have been taken from Palestinian kids. What I love about this image is the grandfather’s hands. You think of the life those hands have seen – this is a man that’s probably old enough to have been a child during the Nakba in 1948 and he’s still with us, and lucky enough to be able to look down to his beautiful grandson. It’s a hopeful picture, but it’s also a picture to remind us of the generation of the Nakba who have had so much taken from them.Shadi says:“Owning a camera impacted my life positively. It made me notice and value all the things that I own. It made me see beauty in everything, and I hope I can continue my journey in photography.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPortrait of his sister, and family portrait, by AymanThe background – the hanging lanterns, the patterned rugs – gives a rich sense of place and the square of light frames her beautifully. This photo captures a sense of the trust and familiarity between the two siblings. The image of Ayman with his family is special simply because it’s sadly so rare to see a Palestinian family all together in one photograph in such a normal setting. They are still together, in spite of everything.View image in fullscreenSelf-portrait, by AymanHe’s being exactly what an 11-year-old boy is. That could be an image taken on any street or apartment in Britain. He just looks like a happy, cheeky boy. I think that’s what makes it a great portrait.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenHigh-rise building and self-portrait, by ToleenThe high-rise building with pure blue skies and Ramadan bunting gives a sense of her everyday life and place, but also a feeling of warmth and optimism, and shows how the month of Ramadan is one of real celebration. I love the selfie of Toleen in the mirror. She took this on the day of the workshop, possibly when she got back home and was playing around with the camera. She looks a little shy, but also happy, and it was heartwarming to see her growing in confidence.Toleen says: “I felt happy and excited during the project, because I was going through new experiences and learning how tosee things from a different perspective. It really had an impact on me. I see life now in a different, more beautiful way. Having a camera has become a part of my life and taught me to pay attention to the small details of the world around me.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenSelf-portrait reading the Qur’an, and self-portrait, by TaleenThere’s a lovely contrast between the two images which demonstrate Taleen’s connection to her faith – the quiet, contemplative moment as she read the Qur’an at home with beautiful soft lighting pouring down on her from a window above, versus the portrait of her in front of a glittery Ramadan decoration outside, which gives a real sense of the celebratory mood of that month. That spirituality, I think, has been increased in these kids because of what they’ve seen. Judging by the sense of strength that many of the young people have, I think their faith has been central to it, so it’s not surprising that many of them photographed prayer mats and beads, and Qur’ans.Taleen says:“My favourite photograph is the one of me while reading the Holy Qur’an because it makes me feel happiness, serenity and safety.”View image in fullscreenSelf-portrait, by MasaThis image of Masa in her keffiyeh is powerful as it shows her pride in her nationality and identity, and she stands resolutely in the middle of the frame. It feels quiet but strong – and giving the peace sign adds a powerful layer of meaning. The keffiyeh in particular is really meaningful in terms of identity. Many chose to photograph the keffiyeh, pictures of the Qur’an and breaking the fast at Ramadan, because these are all memories. They’re saying you cannot erase these images, and let that be the truth that the rest of the world sees, which I think is a really powerful thing.Masa says:“The keffiyeh is our national symbol. This project was a new, enjoyable experience for me. I learned a lot from it.Photographyhelps me to express my feelings in a beautiful way.”View image in fullscreenPortrait of teacher, by AdamThis image is of one of the teachers at Save the Children’s child-friendly space in Cairo. Many of the teachers and volunteers who run the programme are Palestinian. It gives a sense of the environment in which the group spends their days, and the responsibility she bears as teacher, bringing displaced Palestinian families together and providing them with a sense of belonging and unity in a new city and country.Names have been changed.

But he doesn’t address the real reason why a child of seven can solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle that broke the computers: we’re embodied animals and we live in the world.All living things are born to explore, and we do so with all our senses, from birth. That gives us a model of the world and everything in it. We can infer general truths from a few instances, which no computer can do.A simple example: to teach a large language model “cat”, you have to show it tens of thousands of individual images of cats – being the way they are, they may be up a tree, in a box, or hiding in a roll of carpet. And even then, if it comes upon a cat playing with a bath plug, it may fail to recognise it as a cat.A human child can be shown two or three cats, and from interacting with them, it will recognise any cat as a cat, for life.Apart from anything else, this embodied, evolved intelligence makes us incredibly energy-efficient compared with a computer. The computers that drive an autonomous car use anything upwards of a kilowatt of energy, while a human driver runs on twentysomething watts of renewable power – and we don’t need an extra bacon sandwich to remember a new route.At a time of climate emergency, the vast energy demands of this industry might perhaps lead us to recognise, and value, the extraordinary economy, versatility, plasticity, ingenuity and creativity of human intelligence – qualities that we all have simply by virtue of being alive.Sheila HaymanAdvisory board member, Minderoo Centre for Technology & Democracy, Cambridge UniversityIt comes as no surprise to me that Apple researchers have found “fundamental limitations” in cutting-edge artificial intelligence models (Advanced AI suffers ‘complete accuracy collapse’ in face of complex problems, study finds, 9 June). AI in the form of large reasoning models or large language models (LLMs) are far from being able to “reason”. This can be simply tested by asking ChatGPT or similar: “If 9 plus 10 is 18 what is 18 less 10?” The response today was 8. Other times, I’ve found that it provided no definitive answer.This highlights that AI does not reason – currently, it is a combination of brute force and logic routines to essentially reduce the brute force approach. A term that should be given more publicity is ANI – artificial narrow intelligence, which describes systems likeChatGPTthat are excellent at summarising pertinent information and rewording sentences, but are far from being able to reason.But note, the more times that LLMs are asked similar questions, the more likely it will provide a more reasonable response. Again, though, this is not reasoning, it is model training.Graham TaylorMona Vale, New South Wales, AustraliaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

While freedom of information requests inform about the universities that are catching AI cheating, the universities that are not doing so are the real problem.In 2023, a widely used assessment platform, Turnitin, released an AI indicator,reporting high reliability from huge-sample tests. However, many universities opted out of this indicator, without testing it. Noise about high “false positives” circulated, but independent research has debunked these concerns (Weber-Wulff et al 2023;Walters 2023;Perkins et al, 2024).The real motivation may be that institutions relying on high-fee-paying international cohorts would rather not know; the motto is “see no cheating, hear no cheating, lose no revenue”. The political economy of higher education is driving a scandal of unreliable degree-awarding and the deskilling of graduates on a mass scale. Institutions that are biting the bullet, like mine, will struggle with the costs of running rigorous assessments, but know the costs of not doing so will be far greater.If our pilots couldn’t fly planes themselves or our surgeons didn’t know our arses from our elbows, we’d be worried – but we surely want our lawyers, teachers, engineers, nurses, accountants, social workers etc to have real knowledge and skills too.A sector sea change is under way, with someinstitutions publicly adopting proper exams(maligned as old-fashioned, rote-learning, unrealistic etc) that test what students can actually do themselves. Institutions that are resistant to ripping off the plaster of convenient yet compromised assessments will, I’ll wager, have to some day explain themselves to a public inquiry.Dr Craig ReevesBirkbeck, University of LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, it is not just police use of this technology that needs a clear legal framework.Despite the scale and speed of its expansion, there is still no specific law providing a basis for live facial recognition or other emerging biometric technologies, whether these are used in the public or private sector.Biometric surveillance is expanding rapidly, not just in policing but across society: in train stations, schools and supermarkets. Newer biometric systems go further, claiming toinfer people’s emotional states, raising serious concerns about their accuracy, ethics and legality.In 2020, the court of appeal – in the UK’s only judgment on live facial recognition to date – found adeployment by South Wales policewas unlawful. It identified deficiencies in the legal framework and set out minimum standards for lawful use. Since then, a patchwork of voluntary guidance has emerged.New researchfrom the Ada Lovelace Institute has found this patchwork is inadequate in practice, creating legal uncertainty, putting fundamental rights at risk and undermining public trust.Crucially, we find that non-police uses, such as those in the private sector or involving inference, are subject to even fewer safeguards and so stand on far shakier legal ground. Governance is simply not keeping up with technological adoption and advancement.Policymakers must act. We urgently need new legislation to establish a comprehensive framework covering all forms of biometric surveillance and inference – not just police use – and an independent regulator to oversee and enforce it.Michael BirtwistleAssociate director, the Ada Lovelace InstituteExplore more on these topicsFacial recognitionArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingPoliceUK civil libertieslettersShareReuse this content"

They then tracked how long the daughters lived as adults.Archie said the team focused on female offspring because males often moved to other social groups as adults, making it difficult to track how long they live.The researchers found that female baboons who, during the first four years of their life, lived in the same group as their fathers for longer and spent more time grooming with them, lived two to four years longer as adults than those who experienced weaker relationships with their dads. If only one of the two occurred, an increase of about two to three years was found, Archie added.“A typical lifespan for a female baboon, if she reaches adulthood, [is] 18 years,” she said, noting that females tended to have offspring every 18 months or so. “So living two to three years longer would allow her time potentially to have another kid.”That, Archie added, might provide an incentive for fathers, given males were less able to fight others for mates as they get older.“They can no longer compete for females, but what they can do is help their daughters,” said Archie. “And if their daughters live a little bit longer, then the fathers will pass on more genes and have higher fitness because their daughters are living longer and having more kids.”The researchers found that strong relationships between young females and adult males in general, or with males who were not their fathers, was not associated with an increase in females’ survival as adults.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Fernández was the victim of an attempted assassination three years ago.In the ruling, the court said that Fernández “must remain at the registered address, an obligation that she may not break except in exceptional situations”.Far-right group discussed killing Argentina’s vice-president, court hearsRead moreLast week, Argentina’s highest court upheld Fernández’s sentence in a ruling that permanently banned her from public office over the corruption conviction that found she had directed state contracts to a friend while she was the first lady and president.The explosive ruling left Fernández, Argentina’s charismatic yet deeply divisive ex-leader, subject to arrest and sent her supporters pouring into the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina’s capital, and blocking major highways in protest.The ruling barred Fernández from running in this fall’s Buenos Aires legislative elections just days after she launched her campaign.Fernández, who dominated Argentinian politics for two decades and forged the country’s main leftwing populist movement known as Kirchnerism, after her and her husband, former president Néstor Kirchner, rejects the charges as politically motivated.During Fernández’s eight years in office (2007–2015), Argentina expanded cash payments to the poor and pioneered major social assistance programs. Her governments funded unbridled state spending by printing money, bringing Argentina notoriety for massive budget deficits and sky-high inflation.Critics blamed Argentina’s years of economic volatility on Fernández’s policies, and outrage over successive economic crises and the country’s bloated bureaucracy helped vault radical libertarian president Javier Milei to the presidency in late 2023.Fernández was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during her tenure. She wasconvicted in 2022 of corruptionin a case that centered on 51 public contracts for public works awarded to companies linked to Lázaro Báez, a convicted construction magnate and friend of the presidential couple, at prices 20% above the standard rate in a scheme that cost the state tens of millions of dollars.Fernández has questioned the impartiality of the judges. She claims her defense did not have access to much of the evidence and that it was gathered without regard to legal deadlines.She faces a series of other upcoming trials on corruption charges.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaCristina Fernández de KirchnerAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

There is broad consensus among analysts that Bolsonaro’s conviction is a foregone conclusion and the 70-year-old populist is expected to face arrest in the coming months once a supreme court trial concludes.The latest accusations relate to a two-year federal police investigation into suspicions that a “parallel” intelligence agency was set up during Bolsonaro’s 2019-23 administration in order to monitor those considered government foes.On Tuesday, police accused Bolsonaro’s alleged former spy chief, Alexandre Ramagem – who ran Brazil’s intelligence agency, Abin, from 2019 to 2022 – of running the clandestine operation and accused more than 30 others of being involved, including the president’s politician son Carlos Bolsonaro.The news website G1saidinvestigators had concluded that under Bolsonaro members of Abin “formed a criminal organization in order to monitor people and public authorities, invading mobile phones and computers”.Some of the information gathered was allegedly provided to a covert social media team that operated within the presidential palace and allegedly used illegally collected information as ammunition to launch online attacks.The targets reportedly included four supreme court ministers and powerful politicians including the former president of Brazil’s lower house, Arthur Lira, and the then governor of São Paulo, João Doria, a prominent rightwing rival to the president.Journalists and public servants were also reportedly spied on, including Hugo Loss, a respected member of the environmental agency, Ibama, who was on the front line of efforts to protect the Amazon at a time when illegal loggers and miners were emboldened by Bolsonaro’s anti-environment rhetoric and climate denial.Loss had worked closely with Bruno Pereira, the Indigenous expert and former government employee who wasmurdered in the rainforest regionthree years ago this month with the British journalist Dom Phillips.The newspaper O Globo said police believed the Bolsonarista spy network was created in order “to make it possible for Bolsonaro to remain in the presidential chair”.Bolsonaro and Ramagem made no immediate comment on the accusations but have previously denied such charges. Carlos Bolsonaro responded to the allegations on X, suggesting that they were the result of a political grudge against his father’s political movement. “Was anyone in any doubt that Lula’s PF [federal police] would do this to me?” he tweeted.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The dead include four police officers, one of whom was reportedly killed bydynamite which had been strapped to his body.Demonstrators have blockaded roads across the country since 2 June in response to rulings by the constitutional and electoral courts that barred Morales, 65, from seeking a fourth term in the 17 August election.Plotting a comeback, Bolivia’s ex-leader defies arrest warrant in jungle hideoutRead moreOn Sunday the protestersannounced a “humanitarian pause”at the blockades, but someremained in place, prolonging a two-week-long disruption in delivering food, medicine, and fuel.In response to the protests he called, Morales has himself become the target of a new“terrorism” investigation, announced by the government of current president Luis Arce, 61 – who served as finance minister under the former president and is now his main rival.Moraleshas been entrenchedsince October in the coca-growing region of Chapare, wherehundreds of coca farmersare preventing police and military forces fromexecuting an arrest warrantover allegations that Moralesfathered a child with a 15-year-old girlduring his presidency in 2016.“Democracy in our country is at risk,”said President Arcefollowing the killing of the four police officers.Three officers were shot dead by protesters last Wednesday in the mining town of Llallagua, where a 17-year-old student also died, reportedly beaten to death by protesters whoaccused him of being a police informant.The fourth officer was in a village in the Cochabamba department when, according to the government, he was “kidnapped by a mob” and killed with dynamite strapped to his chest. In the same village, a civilian was shot dead by what the government claims was gunfire from protesters.“[The officers] were Bolivians who gave their lives at a time when the country is under siege, facing the risk that elections might not be able to take place,”said Arce.The UN human rights office has called for an“impartial and thorough” investigationinto the deaths.Morales, who had defended “mobilisation and blockades” as “legitimate expressions of resistance,” later said he is an “enemy of protests” and claimed that“what happened in Llallagua was well staged”to incriminate his supporters.“It’s crazy for him to say that, because he is the ‘father’ of the blockades: he built his entire political career blocking roads,” said economic analyst Gonzalo Chávez Alvarez, a professor at the Universidad Católica Boliviana.Morales is barred from running by a constitutional court ruling that reaffirmed the constitution’s two-term presidential limit and by the electoral court, which argued that his party is not officially registered.Bolivia’s longest-serving leader governed from 2006 to 2019. After about a decade of prosperity driven by a natural gas boom, reserves had dwindled, and an economic crisis began.In 2019,he sought a fourth term; there was a blackout during the vote count, and when it resumed, it showed him as the winner. The countryerupted in violent protests, and Moralesfled to Mexicoand later to Argentina.After his protégé Arce won the presidency in 2020, Morales returned, butthe two soon fell out.Under Arce, the economy has deteriorated, and the country is now facing its worst economic crisis since the hyperinflation of 1985, withinflationand ashortage of US dollars and fuel.Deeply unpopular, the president reversed his decision to seek re-election and now backs his former interior minister, 36-year-old lawyer Eduardo del Castillo.Even within the left, he will face competition from the equally young senate president, 36-year-old Andrónico Rodríguez, once seen as Morales’s natural heir due to his Indigenous roots and leadership in the coca growers’ union, but now treated as a traitor by the former president.On the right, businessman Samuel Doria Medina, 66, and former president Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, 65, are polling well, and will try to oust the Movimiento al Socialismo (Mas) party after nearly two decades in power.Meanwhile, police and military forces have so far failed to execute the arrest warrant against Morales over the allegation of statutory rape.Last week, all other presidential candidates except him met in the capital, La Paz. At the end of the meeting, the head of the electoral court, Óscar Hassenteufel, pledged that elections wouldgo ahead “without fail” on 17 August.“Morales wants to enter the elections at all costs, and he won’t succeed,” said economist Alvarez. “So there’s uncertainty over whether the elections will really happen because it’s hard to say whether Morales will have enough strength to stop them.”Explore more on these topicsBoliviaAmericasEvo MoralesnewsShareReuse this content"

He was rushed into emergency surgery for bleeding in his brain on Monday morning, the hospital said, after undergoing another surgical procedure.“I’ve come out to again ask all Colombians, appealing to their good hearts, to the love they feel for Miguel, for my family and for Colombia, for us to hold a mass prayer. Today is crucial,” his wife, Maria Claudia Tarazona, told journalists outside the hospital.The shooting, which was caught on video, recalled a streak of candidate assassinations inColombiain the 1980s and 1990s, a time when fighting between armed guerrillas, paramilitary groups, drug traffickers and state security forces touched the lives of many Colombians.Marches were held on Sunday around the country to call for peace, and several vigils for Uribe’s health have taken place.Three suspects, including a 15-year-old alleged to be the shooter, are in custody. An adult man and woman are also being held. The man, Carlos Eduardo Mora, has been charged for alleged involvement in planning the attack, providing the gun and being in the vehicle where the shooter changed his clothes after the attack, according to the attorney general’s office.Though the government had floated a connection between them and the shooting, the main dissident faction of the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla group on Friday denied responsibility for the assassination attempt on Uribe, though it did accept responsibility for a series of unrelated bombings.Colombia: president says shot candidate had security detail cut on day of attackRead moreCampaigning for the 2026 election is just beginning for potential candidates who want to succeed leftist president Gustavo Petro, who has vowed to advance peace efforts through negotiations and surrender deals with little success.Uribe, a married father of one, is a senator for the right-wing Democratic Center party and announced his intention to run in the May 2026 presidential election last October.Senator Uribe comes from a prominent political family. His grandfather Julio Cesar Turbay was president from 1978 to 1982, and his mother, journalist Diana Turbay, was killed in 1991 in a botched rescue attempt after being kidnapped by an armed group led by drug lord Pablo Escobar.Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

That is nearly as many as Russia and the US currently have ready for use at short notice.Why nuclear war, not the climate crisis, is humanity’s biggest threat, according to one authorRead moreRussia and the US’s total inventories of weapons, which include both ready-to-use weapons and mothballed warheads, are far bigger. According to SIPRI’s research, Russia has 5,459 warheads while the US has 5,177. The two countries hold about 90% of the global stockpile.Last year, the USapproved a new nuclear strategythat is focused on the threat from China.China is thought to have 24 nuclear warheads that are already placed on missiles or located in bases with operational forces, meaning that they could be deployed at very short notice.Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has expanded the country’s nuclear arsenal faster than any other Chinese leader. Previous leaders, such as Deng Xiaoping, argued that China only needed modest reserves to act as a deterrent for potential adversaries.China’s nuclear capabilities are of particular concern toTaiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as part of its own territory. Beijing has resolved to “unify” Taiwan with the People’s Republic of China, using force if necessary. Chinese scholars have argued that having a powerful deterrent, such as nuclear weapons, could prevent any third party from intervening in a conflict. The threat of a US intervention in support of Taiwan is one of the factors that is keeping a war at bay.A new nuclear arms race is beginning. It will be far more dangerous than the last oneRead moreThe report’s authors noted fewer warheads are being dismantled each year, while the pace of deployment of new nuclear weapons is accelerating.Hans M. Kristensen, an associate senior fellow at SIPRI, said: “The era of reductions in the number of nuclear weapons in the world, which had lasted since the end of the cold war, is coming to an end”.Hundreds of facilities for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), long-range missiles used to deliver nuclear weapons, are being built in desert fields in the north of China. Three mountainous areas in the east of China also house ICBM silos, according to the report.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

But globally, those rights are under grave threat | Antonio ZappullaRead moreConcerns have been raised about press freedom in some Pacific countries in recent years, including in Solomon Islands, where the former prime minister Manasseh Sogavarereportedly threatened to ban foreign journalistsin 2022 if they were not “respectful” in stories about the country’s ties with China, and in Papua New Guinea where reporters have been suspended over theircoverage of certain political stories. Papua New Guinea is the lowest-ranked Pacific country – 91st in the world – when it comes to press freedom, according to the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index 2024.“It limits the ability of a journalist to report, knowing that if they enter into a legal suit, that might destroy the company, because they don’t have money to fight those legal suits which are very expensive,” Iroga said.“This is a critical moment for us in the Pacific,” he said. “Threats have slowly been creeping in, eroding the freedom of the press.”Among those facing legal action are Leilani Reklai, the publisher of Island Times newspaper in Palau, and the deputy chair of the Pacific Freedom Forum.She is being sued for defamation by Surangel and Sons Co, a company owned by the father of Palau’s president, Surangel Whipps Jr, for an article she published last year about the company’s tax affairs.The company alleged in a statement that Reklai’s article contained “false and unsubstantiated allegations against the company” constituting “negligence and defamation”. Reklai denies this.Reklai’s case is still in the discovery phase and so far she says it has cost her $10,000 in legal fees. She has been told her fees could end up being five times that amount. In Palau, the average salary for a journalist is approximately $9,500 a year before tax.To fund the suit, the local media community has engaged in fundraising for her, but she says her family and her clan may have to sell land to pay the rest of the bill.“It’s stressful financially and emotionally. But it’s not something that we can afford to just drop or compromise on,” she said. “Everybody’s watching this, reporters are watching this, our community as a whole is watching it to see what message is coming out at the end of the day.”Speaking generally about the challenges of reporting in the Pacific, Reklai said that because communities are often quite small and Pacific cultures often put a premium on respect for authority and reputation, there can be a tendency toward self-censorship.“[There is] a pressure to report only what is acceptable or not culturally or politically too sensitive. There is that sort of self-censorship… because we know everyone, we are related to everybody in this whole community,” she said.This concern for reputation was a key factor in the re-criminalising of defamation in Samoa in 2017, which means that someone found guilty of defamation could face up to three months in jail.A pig’s head and decapitated rats: a new era of intimidation dawns for journalists in IndonesiaRead moreLagi Keresoma, a veteran journalist at Talamua Media and the president of the Journalists Association of (Western) Samoa (JAWS), is now charged with criminal defamation for a story she wrote in May.Keresoma, who is due to appear in court later this month on the charges, says she will plead not guilty.“As the president of the media association here, I cannot bow down and set a bad example for others. If I have to go to jail on this one, I’ll take it, but I’m not going to apologise for something [when] I believe there was no wrong in it.”In Papua New Guinea defamation is also a criminal charge, carrying a penalty of up to 25 years.The Pacific Freedom Forum has launched a fundraising appeal to raise money for the defence of these – and other – Pacific journalists facing lawsuits.“It’s quite scary, because some of them, if they lose these court cases, it’s basically the end of their business and that will be very sad a chapter for the media industry in this region,” said Iroga.“Regardless of the challenges we face, we are determined across the region to defend press freedom, to defend democracy.”Explore more on these topicsPacific islandsPress freedomAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

All now rests on what he proposesMiddle East crisis – live updatesTue 17 Jun 2025 14.48 EDTFirst published on Tue 17 Jun 2025 09.11 EDTShareDiscussing the dilemma facing western diplomats in confronting Iran’s nuclear programme, Henry Kissinger wrote in 2006: “Diplomacy never operates in a vacuum. It persuades not by the eloquence of its practitioners but by assembling a balance of incentives and risks.”Rarely has the balance of incentives and risks been placed so starkly in front of Iran’s leaders as now.Donald Trump, either by design or by stumbling ad hoc towards a strategy, has left Iran with a stark choice: either return to the negotiating table and accept the offer of “a deal”, or see Israel – possibly with US support – pulp Iran’s security apparatus, nuclear programme and economy into the ground in what would be the ultimate exercise in maximum pressure, the term the US president gave to his first-term economic sanctions against Tehran. It is in Trump’s words a demand for unconditional surrender.Judging by his statements and actions over the past 48 hours, Trump is also trying to demonstrate that any deal is seen to be on his terms, and that he is sole decision-maker. It is an attempted display of raw power not just to Iran, but toEurope.Republican hawks vs Maga isolationists: the internal war that could decide Trump’s Iran responseRead moreIn a move designed to underline Europe’s irrelevance and indeed his contempt for the multilateralism symbolised by theG7, Trump abandoned the Canadian summit a day early. He has left such G7s early before, but never quite so dramatically.One senior diplomat, asked if Trump had flown to Washington essentially on a diplomatic mission to secure peace or to join the war against Iran, replied frankly: “We don’t know!”As Air Force One departed,Emmanuel Macron tried to shape the narrativeof the departure by saying that a ceasefire was in the offing, if not close. Trump then, in a tone of some relish, belittled the “the publicity-seeking” French leader in typically stark terms. “Whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong,” he posted on Truth Social. He was after something “much bigger” than a ceasefire, he said.Indeed US diplomats at the G7 had refused to countenance the call for a ceasefire appearing in the joint communique on the Iran-Israel crisis, the chief raison d’être for issuing a joint statement in the first place.In the interests of securing any kind of communique, the European leaders retreated, leaving a sparse eight sentences that in effect implicitly endorsed Israel’s actions by saying we “affirm that Israel has a right to defend itself. We reiterate our support for the security of Israel.”The day after Trump’s exit, the four European leaders left abandoned high in the Rocky Mountains reflected on Trump’s plan, and in so doing revealed differences.Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, expressed his utmost respect for the Israelis’ courage, saying they were doing the rest of the world’s dirty work. He added: “It would be good if this terrorist regime was brought to an end.” If Iran did not accept the complete destruction of its nuclear programme, it would be ended with the help of the US, he said.View image in fullscreenTrump with other leaders at the G7 summit in Canada, before his early departure.Photograph: Simon Dawson/No 10 Downing StreetKeir Starmer and Macron were both much more cautious, speaking of de-escalation, and worrying how this war would end. In the Commons the UK foreign secretary,David Lammy, said Iran’s nuclear programme had to be constrained, but added: “Fundamentally, no military action can put an end to Iran’s nuclear capabilities.” It was for Iran to choose its leaders, he said.The UK and France privately said it recognised Iran’s right to enrich limited stocks of uranium within Iran, the principle underlying the 2015 nuclear deal, and the sticking point in the US-Iran talks.Regardless it looks once again as though Europe has been left as the bystander to history, adept at drafting consensual communiques and declarations while the real events are shaped by unilateralists prepared to use destructive force. Rarely has the sword been so much mightier than the pen. Russia happily crowed it had always seen the G7, a club from which it was excluded for invading Crimea, as “pretty useless”.In fairness to Europe’s leaders, they have tried to play a part in securing a deal. Three European foreign ministers spoke to their Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, by phone at the request of the US.The kernel of the proposal that they relayed was that Iran should have to offer in effect an unconditional ceasefire, and end all talk of escalation. Threats by Tehran to remove all UN weapons inspectors needed to be rescinded.The idea of a motion to the Iranian parliament calling for Iran to leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, a precursor to acquiring a nuclear bomb, should be dropped. US assets in the region must not be attacked. De-escalation had to be the priority, since any escalation would lead to a catastrophic conflict, the consequences of which no one could control.Araghchi, sources said, reverted to his argument that Iran could hardly silence its guns without Israel doing the same.One western diplomat admitted they had been reduced to sending messages to the Iranians about a US-Israeli strategy about which they had not been consulted let alone approved.With many reasons to feel aggrieved – and also to be reviled – the Iranian regime appears to have been left with the choice between its destruction and its humiliation, including a complete end to its nuclear programme, once seen as a symbol of its sovereignty.Greatly diminished, Iran will have to decide if, in the interest of self-preservation, it has to abandon any right to draw red lines. A chastened Europe after this past few days may recognise some of Iran’s dilemma.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpG7IranEuropeMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelCanadaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Any contracts entered into from today would have to be wound up by 1 January 2026, but companies with pre-existing agreements have a final deadline of 1 January 2028.The proposal is facing a backlash from Hungary, Slovakia andAustria, but these countries are not thought to have enough support to block the plan from becoming EU law.View image in fullscreen‘Russia has weaponised energy against us’: Dan Jørgensen speaking in Strasbourg, France, on 17 June.Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPAJørgensen said plans to phase out Russian fossil fuels were not a response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “This is a ban that we introduce becauseRussiahas weaponised energy against us, because Russia has blackmailed member states in the EU, and therefore they are not a trading partner that can be trusted,” he said. “That also means that, irrespectively of whether there is a peace or not – which we all hope there will be of course – this ban will still stand.”EU importers will be required to provide customs officers with detailed information about the source of gas to prevent any attempts to sell Russian imports under a new flag.About 13% of EU gas imports is expected to come from Russia in 2025, compared with 45% in 2021. While Europe has cut supplies of pipeline gas from Russia, in 2024 itbought record amounts of Russian LNG, raising questions about the EU’s commitment to Ukraine and climate goals.The commission expressed confidence that European companies terminating long-term gas contracts would not be liable for damages. Jørgensen said the EU ban was beyond any individual company’s control. “It is not them who are breaking the contract, it is indeed force majeure.”graphThe EU also wants to end imports of Russian oil by 2028, compared with 3% today and 27% in 2021.But the latest proposal does not remove an exemption from the EU’s oil embargo granted to Hungary and Slovakia. When the EU agreed an oil import embargo in March 2023, the central European countriessecured an opt-outthat allowed them to continue to be supplied via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline. This carve-out, agreed under the EU’s sanctions regime, cannot be touched by this legislation, which has a different legal basis.Hungary and Slovakia have sharply criticised the EU plans to phase out fossil fuels. Péter Szíjjártó, the Hungarian foreign minister, claimed Hungarian consumers could pay four times more for utilities, and he posted avideo on social mediaon Monday in which he spoke over a dramatic action movie-style soundtrack. EU officials reject suggestions that prices would go up.In more muted criticism, Austria’s energy ministrytold the Financial Timesthat the EU should be open to resuming gas imports from Russia if there was a deal to end the war in Ukraine.However, Lena Schilling, an Austrian Green MEP and formerFridays for the Futureactivist, called the stance shortsighted and morally irresponsible. “Have we learned nothing from bombed hospitals, abducted children and a war of aggression in the heart of Europe?” she asked.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryOil and gas companiesEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionRussiaUkraineAustrianewsShareReuse this content"

It was not clear how many people had been inside the building when the missile hit and there were conflicting reports of death tolls.View image in fullscreenA residential building after a Russian missile hit in Kyiv, Ukraine.Photograph: Efrem Lukatsky/APAs dawn broke, hundreds of rescue workers were attempting to clear the rubble at the site and rescue those stuck in neighbouring apartments. Shops and buildings within a radius of two blocks also suffered damage and smashed windows.The interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, said: “A ballistic missile had a direct hit on a nine-storey apartment building, a section is destroyed, and is destroyed right down to the basement because it was a direct hit.”Wave after wave of drone attacks could be heard during the night, with the air raid siren active for several hours and thousands of Kyiv residents sheltering in metro stations. The sounds reverberated from buildings across the city as air defence units tried to fend off the attacks. As the city came back to life on Tuesday morning, there was a burning smell in the air of central Kyiv and a cloud of dark smoke hung over the outskirts.“Kyiv has faced one of the most horrific attacks,” Zelenskyy wrote on Facebook. “Right now in Kyiv, efforts are under way to rescue people from under the rubble of an ordinary residential building – it’s still unclear how many remain trapped.”Speaking at the G7 in Canada, the Ukrainian president said he had been kept in touch about the scale of the attack as he flew to the summit, where he had hoped to meet Donald Trump to make a direct appeal to the US president about the need to impose much deferred US sanctions on Russia.As he met the G7 host, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, Zelenskyy made no direct reference to Trump’s decision to leave the summit a day early, so avoiding a meeting with the Ukrainian leader. But, looking downbeat, he said: “We need the help of our allies for our soldiers to stay strong until Russia is ready for peace negotiations.”He stressed: “We are ready for an unconditional ceasefire.”Some Ukrainian diplomats are privately furious at Trump’s snub, even saying they are not sure it is worth the Ukrainian president turning up to the Nato summit in The Hague next week. One official said: “It is an occupational hazard thatUkraineis a victim of events and Trump’s attention span. Putin knows that, which is why there may have been such a large attack last night. There had been all sorts of promises, including new arms deliveries being offered.”View image in fullscreenSmoke rises over Kyiv after a Russian missile and drone strike.Photograph: Vladyslav Sodel/ReutersRussia has launched almost nightly attacks on Ukraine over more than three years of full-scale war, but direct hits on Kyiv are rare, as the capital is well protected by air defence systems. Moscow has launched a record number of drones and missiles in recent weeks, partly in apparent revenge for an audacious Ukrainian drone operation thattargeted long-range bombers stationed at bases deep inside Russia.Ukraine war briefing: Kyiv under Russian drone attack with apartment building hitRead moreOvernight, Russian drone strikes also struck the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa, killing one person and injuring 17 others, according to Oleh Kiper, the head of the regional administration.US-led attempts to start a peace process have largely failed, with Russia ignoring Trump’s demands to agree to a full ceasefire before talks begin. Direct talks in Istanbul have produced little in the way of progress and there is no sign that Russia is willing to abandon its maximalist war aims.Zelenskyy had been hoping that the G7 summit would represent a golden chance to apply collective western pressure on Trump to accept a cut in the oil cap from $60 a barrel to $45 in an effort to reduce Russian oil revenues. The oil price cap requiring complex enforcement was introduced by the G7 nations and it would need at least tacit US support to be reduced effectively.In discussions on Monday at the summit, Trump expressed his reluctance to impose any further sanctions on Russia, saying Europeans should “do it first” and that “sanctions cost us a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars”.Meanwhile, Russia is deepening its ties withNorth Korea, the secretive state that is emerging as one of Moscow’s main allies in its war on Ukraine.On Tuesday, Sergei Shoigu, Putin’s top security adviser, made his third visit in as many months to Pyongyang, where he announced that North Korea would send thousands of construction workers to help rebuild Russia’s Kursk region.The Russian state news agency, Tass, cited Shoigu as saying: “Chairman Kim Jong-un has decided to send 1,000 sappers to Russia to de-mine Russian territory, as well as 5,000 military construction workers to rebuild infrastructure facilities destroyed by the occupiers.”North Korea has previously sent more than 10,000 troops to support Russian efforts to retake the Kursk region, parts of which had been seized by Ukrainian forces. It has also transferred conventional weapons to aid Moscow’s war effort, while western intelligence believes Pyongyang may be seeking Russian technological assistance to advance its nuclear weapons programme.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeKyivNorth KoreanewsShareReuse this content"

She also noted that some of the power-generating companies paid to manage and absorb voltage surges had failed to do so.The catastrophic power loss,which left people in Spain and Portugal withouttrains, metros, traffic lights, ATMs, phone connections and internet access, led the government to commission the expert report.Aagesen said the blackout had a “multifactorial origin … In other words, it was caused by the confluence of a combination of factors. The cause of the zero [-power event] was a phenomenon of surging tensions [and] a chain reaction of control disconnections that cause further disconnections.”The expert investigations focused on what happened at 12.33pm on Monday 28 April when, for five seconds, 15GW of the energy being produced – equivalent to 60% of all the energy being used – suddenly disappeared.Aagesen said the research had uncovered “voltage instability” on the morning of the blackout and in the days leading up to it, followed by “oscillations” in the system between noon and 12.30pm that day.“A second phase saw power losses, and a third phase led to the peninsular collapse,” she added.The minister said the report’s key recommendations included strengthening supervision and compliance, and ensuring that Spain was properly protected against future voltage fluctuations.She defended the socialist-led government’s commitment to increased use of renewable energy, which some had sought to portray as the cause of the blackout.“We have a solid narrative of events and a verified explanation that allows us to reflect and to act as we surely will,” said Aagesen. “We believe in the energy transition and we know it’s not an ideological question but one of this country’s principal vectors of growth when it comes to re-industrialisation opportunities.”Aagesen and the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, have repeatedly rejected any suggestion that the blackout had been caused by the rush to abandon nuclear power in favour of renewables. “Those who link this incident to the lack of nuclear power are frankly lying or demonstrating their ignorance,”Sánchez said the day after the power cut, adding that nuclear power generation “was no more resilient” than other electricity sources.Aagesen had also previously said that Spain’s electricity on the day in question was generated from a tried-and-testedmix of different sources, with solar power accounting for almost 55% of the total, followed by 10% from wind power, 10% from nuclear power and almost 10% from hydro power.“The system has worked to perfection with a similar demand situation and with a similar energetic mix [in the past], so pointing the finger at renewables when the system has functioned perfectly in the same context doesn’t seem very appropriate,” she said at the time.The government and the president of Red Eléctrica have also denied media reports that the failure was caused by a governmentexperiment with renewable energy productionon the day of the blackout. “That’s entirely false,” the operator’s president, Beatriz Corredor,told La Vanguardia last month. “It’s a cathedral-sized piece of fake news.”The report’s publication comes as Sánchez struggles to contain the fallout from a series of corruption allegations that have engulfed his administration and his Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE).Last week, the prime minister apologised to voters but ruled out a snap election after a senior PSOE member resigned hours after a supreme court judge found“firm evidence” of his possible involvement in taking kickbackson public construction contracts.He has insisted he is doing all he can to tackle corruption and said there would be no return to the polls until the next scheduled general election, in 2027. “This isn’t about me or the socialist party or PSOE MPs; it’s about a political project that’s doing good things for the country,” he said last Thursday.He has also sought to contrast his approach to corruption with that of the opposition conservative People’s party,which he ousted from governmentwith a no-confidence motion after a major PP graft scandal eight years ago.Explore more on these topicsSpainPedro SánchezEuropeEnergy industryRenewable energynewsShareReuse this content"

Later he took to his own social media platform, Truth Social, to suggest that the US had Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in its bomb-sights, and could make an imminent decision to take offensive action.Trump demands Iran’s ‘unconditional surrender’ and says US won’t kill supreme leader ‘for now’ – latest updatesRead more“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there – We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump said. “But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.”In a post a few minutes later, Trump bluntly demanded “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER”.It was not just Trump’s all-caps threats that triggered speculation that the US might join offensive operations. They were accompanied by the sudden forward deployment of US military aircraft to Europe and the Middle East, amid a general consensus that Iran’s deeply buried uranium enrichment facilities could prove impregnable without huge bunker-busting bombs that only the US air force possesses.“If Iran does not back down, complete destruction of Iranian nuclear programme is on the agenda, which Israel cannot achieve alone,” German chancellor Friedrich Merz told ZDF television a day after meeting Trump at the G7 summit in Canada.But France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, urged restraint, saying: “We recognize Israel’s right to self-defense, but we do not support actions that threaten stability in the region. The biggest mistake that can be made today is to try to change the regime in Iran by military means – because that would lead to chaos.”Despite the US military deployments and Trump’s menacing comments, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, who was also at the G7 meeting, insisted the US was not about to join the Israeli bombing campaign.“There’s nothing the president said that suggests that he’s about to get involved in this conflict,” Starmer said. “On the contrary, the G7 statement was about de-escalation ... I was sitting right next to President Trump [at the dinner], so I’ve no doubt, in my mind, the level of agreement.”Trump left the Canadian summit a day earlyand flew back to Washington around midnight on Monday. On the way,he told journalists he was not seeking a ceasefire in Israel’s war on Iran but instead wanted to seea “complete give-up” by Iran, as well as “a real end” to Iran’s nuclear programme, with Tehran abandoning its uranium enrichment “entirely”.The vice president, JD Vance, also took to social media to discuss Trump’s options.“He may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president,” Vance wrote, before adding that “people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy”.The US president predicted Israel would not let up in its bombing campaign and suggested a decisive moment in that campaign was imminent, though he made clear he expected Israel to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities without US help.“You’re going to find out over the next two days … Nobody’s slowed up so far,” he told CBS News on the flight back to Washington, saying he was returning to the White House to focus on the conflict.Israel’s justification for its shock attack on Iran was called into question on Tuesday whenCNN cited US intelligence assessmentsas saying that when Iran was attacked, it had been “up to three years away from being able to produce and deliver [a nuclear bomb] to a target of its choosing”.The report echoed a public assessment in March by Trump’s own director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who told Congress “Iran is not building a nuclear weapon” and the supreme leader “has not authorised the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003”.On Tuesday, Trump shrugged off that assessment, siding instead with Israel’s claims that Tehran was on the brink of making a warhead.“I don’t care what she said,” Trump said. “I think they were very close to having it.”In freewheeling remarks to reporters on Air Force One, Trump also stressed that any Iranian attack on Americans or US bases, which Iran has threatened, would be met with overwhelming force, saying: “We’ll come down so hard, it’d be gloves off.”Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran was open to resuming talks with the US. “If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,” he said.View image in fullscreenRescuers at the site of an airstrike on a residential area in Tehran on Tuesday.Photograph: Iranian Red Crescent Society/EPABenjamin Netanyahu was also dismissive of the idea of diplomacy. “Of course they want to stop. They want to stop, and to keep producing the tools of death. We gave that a chance,” the Israeli prime minister said, laying out a new, expanded set of war aims.“We want three central results: eliminating the nuclear programme, eliminating the ability to produce ballistic missiles and eliminating the axis of terror.”He left vague what the third war aim would entail. Later on Tuesday, his foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, described it differently as a mission to “severely damage [the Iranians’] plan to eliminate the state of Israel”.Asked how that would be achieved, Sa’ar told the Guardian: “We are doing that gradually. First we cut the [tentacles] of the octopus, when we dealt with Hamas and Hezbollah. Now we are dealing with the head of the octopus.”“Regime change is not an objective of this war,” the minister insisted however, during a visit to a missile strike site in Rishon LeZion, east of Tel Aviv. He added that regime change “may be a result, but its not an objective” of the war.Israel’s choice of targets has broadened over the course of the campaign, in line with its rhetoric. In recent days it has bombed the Iranian capital,ordering the residents of a part of northern Tehran, a third of a million people, to leave their homes.View image in fullscreenIsraeli air defences intercept a missile fired from Iran over Tel Aviv on Monday night.Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPAThe Israeli evacuation order was modelled on those routinely issued to Palestinians in Gaza, where bombing by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has flattened entire residential neighbourhoods over the course of a 20-month conflict.Explosion could be heard in Tehran early on Wednesday after Israel announced a wave of fresh attacks. The IDF warned residents to evacuate from a neighbourhood south of Mehrabad International Airport, which includes residential areas, military installations, pharmaceutical companies and industrial firms.The Israeli ultimatum on Monday said the bombing of Tehran would be aimed at “military infrastructure”, but one of the targets hit was astate television station, killing three staff and ending live broadcasts. Israel has also been bombing Iran’s oil and gas installations, and Iran has retaliated with strikes on Haifa, damaging a power station and a refinery in the Mediterranean port.Israeli airstrikes killed at least 24 Iranians across the country on Tuesday morning, bringing the toll since Friday’s surprise attack to at least 224 people dead and more than 1,400 injured, Iran’s health ministry said. The scale of destruction and the threats from the IDF and Trump triggered an exodus of Tehranis, jamming the roads out of the capital overnight.View image in fullscreenHeavy traffic on the road leading out of Tehran as people try to flee the city.Photograph: Social Media/ReutersIn Israel, the death toll after four days was 24, with about 600 injured. Iran fired a total of 20 to 30 missiles on Tuesday morning, according to the IDF, lightly wounding five people, marking a significant drop in the tempo of its attack compared with the previous few days.‘There’s a smell of death in the air’: chaos in Tehran as residents try to flee or find shelterRead moreThe IDF said Iran had used 370 missiles in eight salvoes out of a US-estimated arsenal of 3,000 ballistic missiles. The IDF further claims to have destroyed 200 of Iran’s missile launchers, half the total.Israel has also struck a severe blow to Iran’s chain of command, killing at least 11 top generals and, in some cases, their replacements. On Tuesday the IDF said it had killed the acting armed forces commander, Maj Gen Ali Shadmani, who had been in the post for only four days, after his predecessor was targeted in the first wave of strikes on Friday morning.“Iran is completely naked and we have full freedom of action. This is an unprecedented achievement,” an IDF general staff officer told the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.Iran continued to threaten Israeli cities however, with its senior army commander echoing Israeli methods by calling for the residents of Haifa and Tel Aviv to evacuate immediately.If those threats prove empty and IDF claims of its dominance are borne out, it will leave Iran with few cards to play. The Iranian parliament has prepared a bill that would withdraw Iran from the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty, so that it would no longer be legally bound to forgo nuclear weapons, but the government insists it remains opposed to all weapons of mass destruction.View image in fullscreenA house destroyed by an Iranian ballistic missile in Bnei Brak, near Tel Aviv.Photograph: Matan Golan/Sopa Images/ShutterstockState TV has also aired calls from hardline politicians suggesting that Iran block the strategically important strait of Hormuz, potentially stopping the passage of more than 17m barrels of oil a day and producing a dramatic spike in world oil prices and global inflation.Iran and Israel crisis: what does it mean for the price of oil?Read moreOn Tuesday, the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that Israeli bombing sorties on the enrichment plant in Natanz had penetrated to its underground levels. But, as the war enters its sixth day, the focus of key decisions in Israel and the US is likely to be the underground facility at Fordow, near the religious centre of Qom, which houses Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium as well as an enrichment plant. However, Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, said its presence was not likely to be relevant to military calculations“Blowing up the stockpiles at Fordow would release a limited amount of radiation and chemical toxicity from the UF6, but it would be confined to the site,” Davenport said. “There may be a very slight risk that if Iran has enough 60 percent enriched uranium stored at the site, an explosion could trigger a chain reaction. But I would be very surprised if that is the reason Fordow is not being bombed. Israel knows it cannot destroy the site.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately too many people in the media don’t care to actually read what I said.”But as theTrump administrationnow appears closer than ever before to a strike on Iran, Gabbard has been left out of key decision-making discussions and her assessments that Iran is not close to a nuclear breakout has become decidedly inconvenient for an administration now mulling a pre-emptive strike.“UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” Trump wrote in a social media post on Tuesday. The US has dispatchedanother carrier group,KC-135 refueling tankers andadditional fighter jetsto the region. Those assets have been sent to give Trump “more options” for a direct intervention in the conflict, US media have reported.Deliberations over the intelligence regarding Iran’s breakout time to a nuclear weapon will be pored over if the US moves forward with a strike that initiates a new foreign conflict for the US that could potentially reshape the Middle East and redefine a Trump presidency that was supposed to end the US era of “forever wars”.Israel launched airstrikes last week in the wake of an International Atomic Energy Agency report that formally declared Iran in breach of itsnon-proliferation obligationsfor the first time in 20 years and said the country had enriched enough uranium to near weapons grade to potentially make nine nuclear bombs.Gen Michael Erik Kurilla, the head of US Central Command who has forcefully campaigned for a tougher stance on Iran, told members of the armed services committee in the House of Representatives last week that Iran could have enough weapons-grade uranium for “up to 10 nuclear weapons in three weeks”.Yet a CNN report on Tuesday challenged that claim. Four sources familiar with a US intelligence assessment said that Iran was “not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon” and that the country was “up to three years away from being able to produce and deliver one to a target of its choosing”.The skepticism over Iran’s potential for a nuclear breakout has also been reflected in Gabbard’s distancing from Trump’s inner circle. People often represent policy in theTrump administrationand those with unpopular views find themselves on the outside looking in.Trump last Sunday held a policy discussion with all the top members of his cabinet on national security. But Gabbard was not there. Her absence was taken as a sign that US policy was shifting in a direction against Iran.“Why was Gabbard not invited to the Camp David meeting all day?” asked Steve Bannon, a member of Trump’s Maga isolationist wing that has pushed against the US launching a direct strike against Iran.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it is with Iran that US policy appears to be changing rapidly and avowed opponents of foreign interventions appear to be falling in line in order to avoid losing clout in the Trump administration.Trump “may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment”, said the vice-president, JD Vance, who has publicly called on the US to avoid costly overseas interventions but has remained muted over Iran. “That decision ultimately belongs to the president.“But I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue,” he continued. “And having seen this up close and personal, I can assure you that he is only interested in using the American military to accomplish the American people’s goals. Whatever he does, that is his focus.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationIranDonald TrumpNuclear weaponsUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Military movements offer a clueDan SabbaghDefence and security editorRefuelling aircraft were tracked heading east, potentially to support B-2 jets carrying bunker-buster bombsTue 17 Jun 2025 11.20 EDTFirst published on Tue 17 Jun 2025 09.28 EDTShareThe US has stepped up its military presence in the Middle East since the weekend but has left certain details vague to preserve operational ambiguity for Donald Trump as he considers whether the US will intervene in the Israel-Iran war.Critically, there has been no new information about the deployment of B-2 bombers that would be used to attack Iran’s deep-lying nuclear enrichment site at Fordow with 13.6-tonne (30,000lb) bunker-buster bombs, designed to penetrate 60 metres of rock.On Monday night, the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said he had “directed the deployment of additional capabilities” to US Central Command in the Middle East, an exercise he said was “to enhance our defensive posture in the region”.Donald Trump, meanwhile, told reporters he waslooking for “a real end”to the conflict as the US president returned to Washington having cut short his trip to the G7 summit in Canada. “I’m not looking for a ceasefire, we’re looking at better than a ceasefire,” he said, without being more specific.Map of US bases hosting bomber unitsHowever, clues that the Pentagon is considering a long-range air raid came from the movement of more than 31 US Air Force refuelling aircraft. The planes, mostly KC-135 Stratotankers and KC-46 Pegasuses, were tracked by AirNav Systems, a flight-tracking website, as they headed east towards Europe on Sunday. There were further reports of some planes flying further east on Tuesday.US Air Force B-2 bombers have a long range, of about 6,000 miles without refuelling, but they usually operate from a limited number of bases: Whiteman in Missouri, Fairford in Oxfordshire and most notably the isolated base of Diego Garcia in the south Indian Ocean, now leased from Mauritius by the UK for the US.B-2 bombers attacked five underground Houthi weapon facilities from Whiteman, 8,000 miles away, last October. Diego Garcia is far closer to Fordow, a 3,200-mile trip each way, which would require refuelling on the return leg once a bombing run on Iran’s nuclear sites had been completed.Location of USS NimitzOnly the US is considered to have a bomb large enough – the GBU 57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator – to possibly destroy Fordow, one of Iran’s two main uranium enrichment sites, estimated to be 80-90 metres below a mountain. The only plane certified to carry the 6-metre weapon is the B-2.At one point in the middle of the last decade, the US was thought to have only 20 of the bombs, its largest non-nuclear weapon, but more recent estimates are higher.Though Israel appears to have achieved dominance over Iran’s skies since it launched its attack on the country on Friday, it attacked Fordow on only the first day of the operation. The IAEA nuclear watchdogsaid on Mondaythat no damage to the enrichment plant had been seen.View image in fullscreenA satellite image provided by Maxar Technologies of the Fordow fuel enrichment plant in central Iran on 14 June.Photograph: Maxar Technologies/AFP/Getty ImagesJustin Bronk, an aviation expert with the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said “multiple impacts” would almost certainly be required to destroy Fordow, “with the second bomb impacting inside the hole made by the first”.Though a B-2 can carry two bunker-busting bombs, a serious assault by the US designed to eliminate the facility would probably require the deployment of more than one bomber. Bronk said: “An attack would require redundancy since the weapons have to function and be delivered perfectly to get down into the facility and explode at the right depth to cause critical damage.”Satellite image of Fordow’s underground facilitiesSatellite imagery in May showed the presence ofsix B-2 bombers at Diego Garcia, about half the total number considered operational at any one time – the US has a total of 19 – but there has not been any more recent reporting. Several companies supplying commercial satellite imaging also work for the US government.According to a 2019 article in the New York Times, at some point a decade before, the US Pentagon constructed a replica of Fordow and test-bombed it with a 30,000lb device. A highly classified video of the attack was later shown by Leon Panetta, a defence secretary under Barack Obama’s presidency, to the Israeli politician Ehud Barak. “The bomb destroyed the mock-up in the desert,” the newspaper reported.Natanz graphic mapThe US may also consider attacking Iran’s other nuclear enrichment site, at Natanz. Though a smaller overground site was destroyed by bombing on Friday, a facility somewhere between 8 and 12 metres underground is said by the IAEA to be relatively undamaged, though the Israeli military has disputed this.An important question for the White House and the Pentagon is whether they believe, after five days of airstrikes by Israel, that there is any threat to US jets operating over Iran. But there is no shortage of military assets available if the US wants to mount an expanded attack targeting any remaining air defence and missile launch sites.A second aircraft carrier strike group, led by the USS Nimitz was sent from east Asia towards the Middle East earlier this week, where it will join the USS Carl Vinson carrier, which is already operating relatively close to Iran, around the Arabian Sea. At least three US destroyers are now also in the eastern Mediterranean.Explore more on these topicsIranTrump administrationIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

She is held in solitary confinement with access to the outside world strictly controlled and only rare supervised visits from her legal team.The videos, dated August and December 2022, show Aung San Suu Kyi appearing in a makeshift courtroom with deposed president Win Myint during military-run corruption trials that were condemned by the UN, US and EU as politically motivated. The cases contributed to her 33-year prison sentence.The footage and logs – shown to the Guardian by military defector group People’s Embrace – shed light on her condition and routine, amidconcerns from her family and supportersthat her health has seriously deteriorated and her life may be at risk.The logs cover a handful of days in January and February 2024 and detail a regimented life inside a specially built detention facility in Naypyidaw, the capital, in which she remains isolated from the outside world and the violent civil war engulfing her country.1:13Leaked footage shows Aung San Suu Kyi inside Myanmar courtroom – videoAMyanmarprison source, unaffiliated with the group, who last saw her in early 2024 confirmed the material.“Her voice and way of walking remained unchanged,” said the source. “She has stopped wearing flowers in her hair – partly because she doesn’t want to.”Medical concernsThe records raise concerns about Aung San Suu Kyi’s health and detail the medications she receives for a range of issues.Dr Aung Kyaw, 30, a former political prisoner jailed for treating anti-coup protesters, described her care as “rudimentary and basic”.“It addresses only the symptoms, not the root causes,” he said, adding that poor nutrition, lack of sunlight, and the risk of dehydration and heatstroke during central Myanmar’s sweltering summer could worsen her health. The records show that on at least one day the temperature in her room reached 31C.He added she might be especially vulnerable to Covid-19, tuberculosis and skin infections, which are common in Myanmar’s prisons.“The health implications of keeping someone who’s almost 80 in confined space and isolation, and cutting her connection with family and friends, can have a very heavy toll on her physical and mental health.”Meditation, reading, isolationLogs show her days as beginning at 4.30am and ending about 8.30pm. She meditates for over an hour each morning and walks around the room for evening exercise, using Buddhist prayer beads throughout the day.In one entry, she is recorded having a lunch of “two spoons of rice, chicken, fish balls soup, two pieces of chocolate, and a piece of dragon fruit” – her largest meal of the day.Meals in general are sparse: “two half-fried eggs” for breakfast; small portions of rice, meat or fish for lunch; soup and bread for dinner.Aung San Suu Kyi receives junta-controlled newspapers, providing some awareness of the civil war engulfing the country since 2021.Within days of her detention,peaceful protests erupted across Myanmar, but were violently suppressed by the military. In their wake emerged civilian resistance groups, some backed by ethnic armies that have fought for borderland autonomy for decades. The conflict has claimed thousands of lives, with the military accused of widespread atrocities.Aung San Suu Kyi has spent decades under some form of military detention; from 1989 to 2010 she was under house arrest at her family’s lakeside Yangon home because of her outspoken opposition to the military junta ruling Myanmar at that time.View image in fullscreenA policeman standing guard is surrounded by journalists outside the gate of the family house of detained Myanmar civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon on 5 February 2025.Photograph: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty ImagesDuring that period she maintained links with the outside world through radios on which she listened to the BBC World Service and Voice of America. In her current detention, Aung San Suu Kyi is not afforded the same privileges, however according to the source her legal team has managed to fulfil some of her requests for English-language books and French novels. The logs show she spends hours reading every day.Her son, Kim Aris, said his last contact with her was a letter “over two years ago” focused on “family matters”.“We know the military would censor everything. We don’t talk about anything political. I was filling her in with how my children are, and enquiring after her health, similar to what she does when she writes to me.”He said he would feel “so much happier” if she were in her Yangon home, where she had access to a doctor and some contact with the outside world. Since its coup, the military has made severalunsuccessful attempts to auction the property.“I am extremely concerned,” Aris said. “A lot of the world seems to think she’s under house arrest, and that’s just not the case. I don’t even know if she’s alive or not – there’s no way to confirm that.”Aris, who has been raising humanitarian funds for Myanmar, plans to run 80 kilometres over eight days ahead of her 80th birthday on 19 June.“She never wanted me to get involved in politics, but there are ways we can help,” he said. “I’ve never seen the situation in Burma this bad. It’s getting worse every day for everybody there.”The UN reported in January 2025 that nearly half of Myanmar’s population was living below the poverty line, with essential services crumbling and the economy in disarray.In June 2022, Aung San Suu Kyi’s legal team ordered a birthday cake featuring her photograph, according to a source familiar with the occasion. A small celebration was held after a court hearing, where she shared the cake with court staff and guards.Sean Turnell, an Australian economist who served as her adviser and was imprisoned in Myanmarbefore his release in November 2022, said she refused air conditioning because it was not available to other inmates.“They don’t mind us [high-profile prisoners] suffering, but they don’t want us to die,” he said. “It’s a dangerous game they’re playing.”He was sentenced in the same prefabricated courtroom shown in the videos, he said, located near the prison staff buildings within the compound in Naypyidaw.Turnell recalled when he last saw her after two years in detention she had “lost a hell of a lot of weight”, though her spirit remained “undiminished.”In April 2024, a junta spokesperson said Aung San Suu Kyi and Win Myint were moved to an unspecified site due to extreme heat – a claim the source believes may indicate transfer to a military compound.View image in fullscreenProtesters hold portraits of Aung San Suu Kyi and make three-finger salutes as Burmese people in Thailand gather outside the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok to mark two years since the military seized power from a democratically elected civilian government.Photograph: Peerapon Boonyakiat/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock‘Wait it out’On the military’s approach to Aung San Suu Kyi, Turnell said the junta appears content to “wait it out” – but warned of consequences if she were to die in custody.“There would be incredible anger in Burma,” he said, adding that her death could push non-aligned people into resistance.Inside Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi remains a revered figure – the daughter of independence hero Aung San and a symbol of the country’s pro-democracy struggle.Yet her international standing collapsed after 2017,when she defended Myanmar against genocide allegations at the international court of justiceover military atrocities against the Rohingya Muslim minority. Nearly a million Rohingya fled Myanmar to refugee camps in neighbouring Bangladesh.Democracy activist Nilar Thein, widow of dissident Ko Jimmy whose execution by the junta in 2022 caused international outrage, said the military fears Aung San Suu Kyi “because they know she would expose their wrongdoings” and “reinvigorate the resistance”.But, she added, the movement was not dependent on Aung San Suu Kyi’s release.“This is a popular uprising driven by the people themselves,” she said. “And it will continue to move forward.”The charges against the Nobel laureate – incitement, electoral fraud and corruption – have been dismissed by rights groups as a sham. In August 2023,the junta issued a partial pardon, reducing her sentence to 27 years – meaning she would be released aged 105.She is one of more than 29,200 people detained since the 2021 coup, according to monitoring group the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners.The junta did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsAung San Suu KyiMyanmarMyanmar coupSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The airline cited a combination of aircraft unavailability, technical snags, airspace restrictions, and extended safety checks.At least three other Dreamliner flights have been grounded or delayed in the past 48 hours, as India’s aviation regulator ordered rigorous pre-flight inspections across Air India’s fleet of 33 Dreamliners. A Boeing 777 operating the San Francisco-Mumbai route was also grounded because of a technical hitch.The disruption came as pressure mounted on Air India and Boeing as the investigation into India’s deadliest plane crash in decades continued. Investigators are pursuing multiple theories, including what some independent experts believe may have been a catastrophic – and extremely rare – dual engine failure.Offering a measure of relief for Air India late on Tuesday, India’s aviation regulator said it had found no major safety flaws in the airline’s Dreamliner fleet but warned of persistent maintenance shortcomings and coordination lapses that could undermine reliability.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which conducted in-depth inspections of 24 Dreamliners, raised concerns over delays linked to spare-part shortages and weak internal coordination between engineering, ground handling, and operations teams.Still, in a boost to theTataowned airline, which is facing intense scrutiny after the crash, the DGCA said all inspected Dreamliners were compliant with existing aviation safety standards. The wide-body jets form the backbone of Air India’s long-haul network.Flight AI171 issued a Mayday call moments after taking off from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel international airport on 12 June. It reached only 650 feet before crashing into a medical college complex, erupting into a fireball. Onlyone of the 242 people onboard survived, with at least 29 people on the ground also killed.By Tuesday, officials had matched the DNA of 135 victims and returned 101 bodies to relatives, though they said five of those individuals had not been listed on the flight manifest.The identification process has been slow and gruelling. Many victims were burned beyond recognition, and officials said the remains were being processed in small batches through genetic testing. The official death toll cannot be finalised until the meticulous process of DNA identification is complete.Dr Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent at Ahmedabad civil hospital, said “135 DNA samples have been matched, and 101 bodies have already been handed over to the respective families. Of these 101 deceased, five were not on board the flight.” He said he hoped DNA profiling would be completed by Wednesday.The sole survivor, a 40-year-old British national of Indian origin, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, described the horror of the crash: “Right in front of my eyes, I saw air hostesses, uncles, aunties dying,” said Ramesh, who lost his brother Ashok in the tragedy.On Tuesday, hundreds of people gathered in Mumbai to pay an emotional farewell at the funeral of the flight’s captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, whose final actions may have prevented even greater loss of life. A veteran pilot with more than 8,000 hours of experience, he has been praised for appearing to have steered the aircraft clear of a densely populated area.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau is leading the inquiry, supported by UK and US safety agencies. Investigators are examiningmultiple potential causes, from thrust-and-flap settings to fact that the landing gear did not appear to have retracted. Investigators, who haverecovered the cockpit voice and flight data recorders, are also looking at whether the aircraft lost thrust in both engines. “There was some sort of dual engine failure,” said Steve Scheibner, a former US navy pilot, commentator, and a retired American Airlines captain.The DGCA has asked Air India to submit records from recent inspections and detailed personnel files of the pilots and flight dispatcher, Reuters reported. It has also ordered safety drills in all airports and instructed flying schools to conduct compliance checks.The crash marks a pivotal moment for Air India. The tea-to-steel Tata Group, which acquired the carrier in 2022 after nearly 70 years of state ownership, has invested billions of dollars to modernise its ageing fleet and revive the brand’s image.Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chair of Tata Sons, said: “We need to use this incident as an act of force to build a safer airline. We’re going to get through this.”Boeing’s commercial chief, Stephanie Pope, met Chandrasekaran at Air India’s headquarters near Delhi on Tuesday. The tragedy involving Boeing’s most advanced aircraft in service has renewed scrutiny of the manufacturer’s controversial safety record. Boeing has said only that it was “focused on supporting the investigation”.Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaBoeingTataAirline industrySouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

He also offered psychic readings and life coaching. Both were alumni of the College of Psychic Studies.The couple were returning home after a 10-day wellness retreat. The couple captured the happy time they had in India in a series of social media posts, including getting henna tattoos, shopping for fine fabrics and other gifts and driving through chaotic traffic in a tuk-tuk.They arrived in Ahmedabad just a day before flying back. Fiongal had posted in a video: “So, it’s our last night in India and we’ve had a magical experience. Some mind-blowing things have happened. We are going to put all this together and create a vlog.

They were very good people. I can’t believe it’s happened.”Margi said she knew Avaiya, 27, and Patel, 28, through her husband, who had been travelling to Gatwick airport to collect the couple when he learned of the crash. She said: “My husband was on his way to pick them up yesterday from Gatwick but halfway he got the news.”Avaiya worked with Margi’s husband, where they had built a close friendship over several years, she said. “The couple were also active members of their local temple community, where they were known for their kindness and generosity,” she added.

They both had aspirations to be successful enough to roam around the world, tension-free. Along with their parents, they both had a proclivity towards modernisation without changing traditional values.“Both my sisters know what is right and what is wrong, thus whatever work they carried out, in academics or fashion, they always got success with no conflicts amongst peers or seniors.”Renjitha Gopakumaran NairRenjitha Gopakumaran Nair was returning to the UK after a holiday to see family in her home country. The nurse and mother had just left her job at Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth, Hampshire, and is thought to have been in the UK for a year.Her former colleagues at the NHS hospital said she was a “beautiful lady” who showed her patients and co-workers “so much love and care”.Gopakumaran, said to be in her 40s, “had the biggest heart and brightest smile”, one former colleague said.Arjunbhai PatoliyaArjunbhai Patoliya, 37, had travelled to India from London to scatter the ashes of his late wife, Bharatiben Patel, in a river in the village that they both grew up in. She had died just three weeks earlier from cancer.The pair are survived by their two daughters,eight and four years old. The children had been left with Patel’s sister while their father flew to Vadiya in Gujarat. A close friend and neighbour of Patoliya told the Telegraph: “He is just like my son. He was a nice person, a very nice person. It’s an accident. I don’t know what to say, I’m speechless – such a lovely neighbour. He was such a lovely character, he looked after me as well from time to time.”Patoliya was a furniture designer and was described by the neighbour as being a “family” person who was very active in the community.Sayedmiya and Nafisabanu Inayatali, and their son, Waqueeali, 25, and daughter, Taskin, 22Sayedmiya Inayatali, 48, had flown over to India to visit his 90-year-old mother with his wife, Nafisabanu, 46, and their children.Shahid Vhora, 52, a relative, had texted the family before the flight to let them know he would pick them up at Gatwick when they arrived.He told Metro: “I can’t believe this has happened. I was preparing to pick them up. They had been visiting Sayedmiya’s mother.“They took a picture as they were about to board. They were so happy to be coming home … When I received the news of the crash I was devastated. We are a very close family, we all live together. My life has been torn apart.”Sayedmiya was an IT programmer who lived in Wembley with his family. Vhora described the family as “perfect” and very hard-working, adding that Taskin was studying to be a doctor and Waqueeali had been working in IT like his father.He said: “Sayedmiya and myself did everything together. We have had so many happy times. Now I have to go to India to try to sort things out.”Adnan MasterAdnan Master, 30, was visiting relatives in India with his wife and child. It is understood he was travelling back to London by himself; his family live in Forest Hill.A friend of Master told the Telegraph that he was “probably one of the nicest guys you’d ever meet”. They added that he had two jobs, both as a delivery driver and working in a DIY shop in east London.They said: “He was just one of the hardest-working people you’d ever meet. He just didn’t stop, and everything he did was for his family. Everything he spoke about was for his family: ‘I want to make my child have a good life.’”Vijay RupaniVijay Rupani, a former chief minister of Gujarat who led the state until 2021, was killed in the crash. A tribute was made to the member of the governing BJP party by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, who remembered Rupani as “simple and gentle in nature” and “hard-working”.View image in fullscreenVijay Rupani.Photograph: Mint/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesRupani was travelling back to London, where his family had planneda Father’s Day and religious celebration.

It was his first-ever international flight.“Will they give him back to us in a closed box?” his father, Salim Ibrahim, told Al Jazeera over the phone.“I just … I cannot bear for anyone to see him like that. I want him to be brought home with dignity.”Gaurav Brahmbhatt and Kalyani Gaurav BrahmbhattFor many years Gaurav and Kalyani Brahmbhatt had lived in London before returning to Gandhinagar city in Gujarat nearly three years ago, according to local media reports.“They were extremely hard-working and very friendly, fun-loving, always motivated us to have big dreams,” a friend of the couple, Trupti Telrandhe, told the BBC.Harshit Patel and Pooja PatelHarshit, 30, had moved to Britain with Pooja, 28, who was studying for a master’s degree. The couple had returned to India to visit a doctor, according to the New York Times.“They were my everything, they were my support,” Harshit’s father, Anil Patel, said.Patel, 60, said they would video call each other daily, and on their visit, had sought to get him a passport so he could visit the couple in Leicester.“They bid goodbye and went happily,” he recalled of their airport exchange.Lawrence Daniel ChristianChristian had travelled to India to join his mother, Ravina, to perform the last rites of his father, who had died a fortnight earlier.Speaking to the Independent, Ravina said her son “only came for a few days. He was returning on 12 June. Just a short visit – only to honour his father.”She added: “My husband is gone. And now, so is my son. I have no one left to support me.”Lawrence had been working hard to create a better life for himself and his mother. “He always said, ‘Mummy, once I’ve paid off the loans on our apartment, I’ll bring you to London,’” she said. “That year will never come.”Khushboo RajpurohitKhushboo, 21, was travelling to begin her new life as a married woman in London. Her family travelled more than 310 miles to receive her remains. Investigators identified her by DNA testing.“She got married on 17 January this year and was awaiting visa clearance to travel to London and live with her husband,” her uncle Kishore Rajpurohit told the Independent.Her father travelled to see her off at the airport. “He waited till she boarded and had not even crossed Mehsana when we learnt of the crash.,” said her uncle.Abdhiben PatelPatel, a mother to an eight-year-old boy, was reluctant to travel due to fears of leaving her son behind for the first time, one of her colleagues told the Press Association.Patel, known as Abdhi, 40, had flown to India a fortnight before to take care of her elderly mother.“She didn’t want to go,” said Atif Karim, 45, Patel’s colleague and close friend at Zone Beauty Studio in Northampton. “She told me: ‘I just don’t like being away from him.’ It was her first time leaving him, and she was very nervous. She wasn’t excited. It was a sense of duty. Her mum was unwell, but you could tell it was weighing on her.”Originally from Gujarat, Patel moved to the UK in 2012 and joined the salon in 2016, where she had served as a manager for the last three years.“She was the most diligent, reliable worker I’ve ever had,” Karim said. “But more than that, she was our friend. She was bubbly, kind, always smiling – she had a way of putting people at ease and always took a genuine interest in their lives. She got on with everyone and left a real mark on the people she worked with and the customers she served.”After the crash, a fundraiser, with a target of £50,000, has been launched to support Patel’s husband and son, raising more than £4,000 in its first few days.Elcina Alpesh MakwanaMakwana, 42, is the first British national to die in the crash whose remains have been returned by authorities. Her family held a funeral on Sunday at Pensionpora cemetery in Vadodara, in Gujarat.Her uncle Joseph Patelia told the Telegraph that before the flight took off on Thursday she had called her father, Edwin Patelia, to reassure him that she had boarded safely and would call again once she had landed in London.“That call never came. She vanished just like that, leaving us in shock, in tears, unable to believe what we were hearing.“About 15 minutes after that call, her younger sister Anne saw the news of a plane crash. She ran to her father and said: ‘Please check if Elcina was on that flight.’ That’s when our nightmare began.”Makwana, who used to run a telecoms business with her husband, had visited India for dental treatment – because “it’s quite expensive in the UK” – and to spend time with her parents.Patelia added: “She’d been having frequent toothaches. She travelled alone, and her husband Alpesh and their two young children, an 11-year-old daughter and a seven-year-old son, arrived here just yesterday.”Patelia said Makwana was a “gentle soul” and was charitable, supporting poor children in India by funding their education.“She had struggled a lot in life, moving to London over 15 years ago, taking on part-time jobs to support her family there and her parents here in India. She had no brothers, so she took on every responsibility herself.“Her loss is devastating. She was the bond that held our entire family together.”Kirit PatelPatel was reportedly on his way to visit his son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren in the Somerset village of Pensford.Patel, who was originally from Lambhvel village in Gujarat, was well-known in Pensford as he spent most summers there, often helping out in the post office run by his son Umang Patel, theBristol Post said.Umang, his wife, Vaishali, and their two sons have reportedly travelled to India to be with family while they await formal identification of Patel’s body.Villagers in Pensford, south of Bristol, have raised nearly £10,000 online to support the family.Katrina Southgate, the organiser of the fundraiser, said: “We are fundraising to support Umang and Vaishali of Pensford Post Office to help after Umang’s father was a victim of the recent Air India crash.“The family are a core part of the Pensford community – villagers speak about their kindness and willingness to help others, and there is no greater reward after a hard day at school than a trip to the post office! So, let’s pay it back and show them how much the community supports them at this time.”Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

But only 600 people can sit the exam, which the GDC usually organises twice a year, though the body has put on extra sittings in recent months to try to tackle the backlog.At the same time the NHS in England had 2,749 vacancies for dentists in 2023-24 and 4.5 million people in England alone currently cannot access NHS dental care. About one in four of all dentists in the UK qualified abroad,GDC datashows.Ahmed, an overseas-trained dentist from Egypt, works both in McDonald’s and part-time as a dental nurse. “Despite holding a postgraduate masters degree in dental implantology and being a fully qualified Egyptian dentist, I am currently working at McDonald’s,” he said.“I am frustrated at the ORE system and have been trying since 2022 to complete the GDC registration to practice here in the UK.”Shoaib Saiyed, who is also struggling to get a place to do the ORE, said: “I am a fully trained dentist from India with 10 years experience but right now my title is ‘sandwich artist’. I have been making sandwiches at a Subway fast food outlet in Birmingham for over nine months.”Sayed Bilal Bukhara, another dentist from India, works in a care home and also as a dental hygienist. He added: “Once the ORE places open up on the system they are gone in just two minutes. A couple of my friends in the situation have given up and moved to Dubai.”Mark Dayan, an expert in dental care at the Nuffield Trust thinktank, said: “Barriers to overseas recruitment aren’t the only reason patients can’t get an appointment. Our creaking NHS system does a bad job of attracting the dentists who are already working here, with many preferring to practice privately.“But delays in the registration process for foreign recruits are something of an unforced error, stopping us from the kind of sharp expansion we have recently seen in so many other professions.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care said: “This government inherited a broken NHS dental system but we are getting on with fixing it through a strengthened workforce and the upcoming 10-year health plan.“We’ve already begun the rollout of 700,000 extra urgent dental appointments, a ‘golden hello’ scheme is under way to recruit dentists to areas with the most need and we are reforming the NHS dental contract, with a shift to focus on prevention and the retention of NHS dentists.”Explore more on these topicsDentistsNHSHealthEnglandFast foodnewsShareReuse this content"

But the lack of urgent action to come forward with a plan to address the fast-approaching cliff edge for under-pressure authorities would seem to suggest it is comfortable with the current state of affairs as normalised background noise.‘Ticking timebomb’: how Send spending could bankrupt English councilsRead more“Alarmingly, scrutiny of council finances can now provoke a sense of deja vu, with the same unfixed issues seen over and over.”Since 2021 councils have been able to keep high needs deficits off their balance sheets through a “statutory override” granted by the previous government. But the accounting manoeuvre expires in March 2026, the end of the current financial year.The inquiry said that the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the Treasury and the Department for Education “should work together to set out their solution for ensuring local authorities can achieve a sustainable financial position when the statutory override ends in March 2026. The solution must include how cumulative deficits will be treated.”Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said: “We expect the government to provide urgent clarity on how it plans to address high needs deficits, which are projected to rise to £5bn next year, as part of its forthcoming special educational needs and disabilities reforms.Ministers plan major changes to Send education in EnglandRead more“Over half of councils have warned us they will become insolvent next year when the statutory override flexibility ends and we continue to urge the government to write off these deficits.”The committee also accused the government of creating “significant uncertainty” over a string of promised reforms and reorganisations, including for funding, special needs provision and social care.Clifton-Brown said: “Aspirations for wide-ranging reforms seem to be unengaged with a reality in which local authorities do not have good and strong capacity to fundamentally change the way they work.”But Jim McMahon, minister of state for local government, said: “These claims are not supported by the evidence. From a standing start we have set out a clear plan to fix the foundations of local government and have wasted no time in taking action as part of our plan for change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

During still winter periods when freezing temperatures drive demand for energy higher, they can often request large fees to fire up their generators.In early January this year, two gas power plants in Hertfordshire and Flintshire, north Wales, werepaid a total of £17.8mto run their gas turbines between 4pm and 7pm when demand for electricity was forecast to reach its peak.The payouts, which were up to 100 times higher than normal market prices, ignited concerns within the industry that gas power plants were able tocommand excessive paymentsto generate power when renewable energy generation drops.They were particularly high because several generators extended their planned outages or scheduled new ones when demand was low during the mild Christmas period before a sharp turn in the weather drove demand up again.The higher number of gas plants available for the winter ahead does not necessarily mean that the power system will rely more heavily on gas power – or that record high payments will be paid to those which do run.The the NationalEnergySystem Operator (Neso) instructs which of the available power plants, batteries and renewable energy projects will generate on a given day in order to maintain a balance between supply and demand.In the winter ahead the UK will also have greater access to electricity imports after the launch of the Greenlink power cable connecting the UK grid to Ireland, and more battery power, according to the Neso.It said the extra power supply options would more than offset the expected rise in peak power demand forecast for the winter ahead compared to last year.Deborah Petterson, a director at Neso, said: “Our early view of the winter ahead shows a positive outlook with sufficient margins throughout the colder winter months.”The system operator is also confident about energy supplies in Europe, which it found would be “adequate” for the winter months.“We will continue to monitor developments in global energy markets, remaining vigilant in our preparations to ensure that the resilience and reliability of the electricity network is maintained,” Petterson said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He told journalists on the sidelines of an offshore wind industry conference that the target had “always been stretching and achievable – and it is absolutely achievable”.At the same event he warned that the government would “win this fight” against critics of Britain’s net zero plan, in part by creating more offshore wind jobs in the former industrial heartlands where Reform UK has gained support.He said: “The forces that want to take us backwards, the forces that oppose net zero, will have to reckon not just with the government.

Sacoolas was not arrested, even though the police had every power to do so. She fled the country, and they didn’t tell us. They mishandled vital evidence, including Harry’s clothing, which we now know was left in storage for years with his remains still on it.“These are failures no family should ever have to endure. I remain so angry at Adderley to this day.”View image in fullscreenHarry’s family – from left, his father, Tim Dunn; his stepfather, Bruce Charles; and mother, Charlotte Charles – ‘lost trust and confidence’ in Northamptonshire police, the review concluded.Photograph: Stephen Burke/The GuardianAdderley was laterdismissed for gross misconductafter it was found he had been wearing a Falklands war medal despite being 15 at the time of the conflict.Northamptonshire’s police, fire and crime commissioner, Danielle Stone, said: “Harry’s family were profoundly let down when they most needed to have trust in Northamptonshire police.“I have apologised to Harry’s family – I am dismayed by how they were treated, and I know that no words can make up for the harm caused. This report is clear and unflinching. Now it has been published, I will ask the chief constable for assurance that the recommendations are being implemented, so that no other family has the same experience as Harry Dunn’s.”Radd Seiger, a spokesperson for Dunn’s family, said the report “lays bare a series of grave errors” but praised the force for “putting transparency first”. He said: “It marks a real turning point compared to the disastrous and toxic Adderley regime.”James said: “I hope some good comes out of this. We have taken a deep look at ourselves and hope the transparent way we have identified failings of the past will go some way to rebuilding the confidence of Harry’s family and friends going forward as well as of the wider public at large.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceNorthamptonshireUK criminal justiceEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

While previous studies have linked cannabis use to cardiovascular problems, the scale of the risk has until now not been clear.This is an important gap in light of major changes in consumption, researchers at the University of Toulouse in France said.Sadiq Khan calls for partial decriminalisation of cannabis possessionRead moreTo strengthen the evidence base, they searched databases looking for large observational studies, published between 2016 and 2023, which explored cannabis use and cardiovascular outcomes.Twenty-four studies, involving about 200 million people, were included in a pooled data analysis of the results: 17 cross-sectional studies, six cohort studies, and one case-control study.Study participants were mostly aged between 19 and 59. And in those studies where sex was recorded, cannabis users tended to be mostly male and younger than non-users.The analysis revealed heightened risks for cannabis use: 29% higher for acute coronary syndrome; 20% higher for stroke; and a doubling in the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. The findings were published in the journalHeart.The researchers acknowledged several limitations to their systematic review and meta analysis. There was a moderate to high risk of bias in most of the included studies, largely because of lack of information on missing data and imprecise measures of cannabis exposure. Most of them were observational and several used the same data.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cannabis is now generally more potent and has diversified into a wide array of inhaled high potency cannabis concentrates, synthetic psychoactive cannabinoids, and edibles, they added.They wrote: “How these changes affect cardiovascular risk requires clarification, as does the proportion of risk attributable to cannabinoids themselves versus particulate matter, terpenes or other components of the exposure.“Cannabis needs to be incorporated into the framework for prevention of clinical cardiovascular disease. So too must cardiovascular disease prevention be incorporated into the regulation of cannabis markets. Effective product warnings and education on risks must be developed, required, and implemented.“Cardiovascular and other health risks must be considered in the regulation of allowable product and marketing design as the evidence base grows. Today that regulation is focused on establishing the legal market with woeful neglect of minimising health risks.“Specifically, cannabis should be treated like tobacco: not criminalised, but discouraged, with protection of bystanders from secondhand exposure.”Explore more on these topicsCannabisDrugsHealthHeart diseaseStrokenewsShareReuse this content"

Dixon alleges he was subjected to harassment and abuse by Perry while he “held direct control over his employment, compensation, and creative opportunities” and that he faced retaliation when he did not respond favorably to his advances.Perry, the billionaire star of the Madea film series, is one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood with his own massive film and TV studios in Atlanta and a partnership with the Oprah Winfrey Network. Major studios frequently film movies on his lot.He has denied the allegations and his lawyer described it as a “shakedown”.“This is an individual who got close to Tyler Perry for what now appears to be nothing more than setting up a scam,” Matthew Boyd, Perry’s attorney, said in a statement to media. “But Tyler will not be shaken down and we are confident these fabricated claims of harassment will fail.”The lawsuit alleges that Perry has “a troubling pattern of exploiting vulnerable male actors and employees” and that like “Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, R. Kelly, Sean “P-Diddy” Combs… Mr. Perry’s success has led him to believe that money and influence can get him whatever he wants.”“Tyler Perry has been using his power and influence to molest, abuse, and sexually assault impressionable and vulnerable employees and actors who look to him for guidance and mentorship,” the lawsuit states.The pair met in 2019 while Dixon, who was working for an events company, was at an opening party for Perry’s studio, according to the lawsuit. Perry allegedly “picked [Dixon] out of a crowd of employees present at the Party, and began asking [Dixon] questions about his employment status, and whether Plaintiff was an actor.” He began texting Dixon, first asking him about his goals and career aspirations, the suit states.He offered Dixon a job on one of his television shows with the promise that “it was a small role that could get a lot bigger,” according to the lawsuit, “thereby setting up the first stage in a series of escalating quid pro quo offers” .Shortly after his first acting job, Dixon was invited to Perry’s home where they drank and made conversation. Perry urged him not to drive home, according to the suit. “Dixon agreed and was escorted to a separate guest room, not knowing that this was a ruse to allow Perry to assault Dixon. Dixon was tired and did not have pajamas and so he got into bed only wearing underwear. Before he knew what was happening, Dixon felt someone else slip into bed behind him and start rubbing Dixon’s body around his inner thigh in a highly sexual and suggestive manner.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has previously been a nominee in other categories.Yao’s win comes as Los Angeles is reeling from a conflict with the Trump administration, with aggressive immigration raids, mass protests against the targeting of immigrants, and the deployment of thousands of national guard members and marines to the area.The targeting of immigrants has created deep sense of fear in the region, one that Yao said hits at the heart of its identity. “As the children of immigrants I’m sure many here can imagine a scenario where we couldn’t be here to celebrate this all together,” he said as he collected the award. “But we all deserve the freedom to pursue our dreams, to determine our own futures and to be treated with equal dignity and respect.Meanwhile a nightly curfew that was in place until Tuesday in a response to the upheaval has hit the restaurant industry hard. The curfew proved challenging for restaurants in downtown Los Angeles, including Kato, which reported significant declines in revenue. The restaurant saw a huge reduction in bookings and estimated $100,000 in losses because of the curfews, a co-owner toldSF Gate.Yao acknowledged his city was going through a “tough time” and said his win was bittersweet but that he was proud to be from Los Angeles and that it “shines a lot on our team, our community”.He encouraged his colleagues in the industry to use their voice and platform.“And everyone in this room tonight has the ability and voice to amplify that message through their own stories in their own communities. And I urge all of us to please use that voice and platform.”Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesRestaurantsFoodLos Angeles Ice protestsTrump administrationUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

That morning, he was at the federal building that morning for a scheduled briefing with US northern command’s General Gregory Guillot related to the president’s order to deploy US marines to the city in response to protests against immigration raids that left Latino communities shaken and afraid.Senator Alex Padilla handcuffed and forcibly removed from Kristi Noem’s LA press conferenceRead moreUpon his arrival, Padilla said that he was met at the building’s entrance by a national guardsman and an FBI agent. He was then escorted through a security screening and into the conference room where the briefing was set to take place.When he learned that Noem was holding a press conference “literally down the hall” – and that it was the reason his own briefing was delayed – Padilla said he asked to attend. He and his colleagues had numerous outstanding information requests regarding the department’s immigration enforcement tactics, and he thought he’d listen in to see if the secretary said anything that might “help us make sense of what was happening”.“I didn’t just stand up and go – I asked,” he said.According to Padilla, the guardsman and FBI agent then “escorted” him into the room where Noem was delivering remarks to reporters. “They opened the door for me. They accompanied me into the press briefing room, and they stood next to me as I stood there for a while listening,” he said.When Noem declared that the federal law enforcement and military personnel would “liberate” Los Angeles from its Democratic governor and mayor – what the senator denounced as an “un-American mission statement” – he said he could no longer remain silent.“I was compelled, both as a senator and as an American, to speak up,” Padilla said. “But before I could even get out my question, I was physically and aggressively forced out of the room, even as I repeatedly announced I was a United States senator, and I had a question for the secretary, and even as the national guardsmen and the FBI agent who served as my escorts brought me into that press briefing room, stood by silently, knowing full well who I was.”Padilla recalled being dragged into a hallway and forced onto the ground, Padilla recalled, his voice catching as he described being brought to his knees and then pressed chest-first against the floor. “I was handcuffed and marched down a hallway repeatedly asking, ‘Why am I being detained?’ Not once did they tell me why?” he said. “I pray you never have a moment like this.”As it was happening, Padilla said his thoughts turned to his family: “What will my wife think? What will our boys think?” And then to his constituents – those in a city already on edge, militarized against the wishes of the governor and local enforcement – how would they react when they saw the images of their US senator – the first Latino elected to the chamber fromCalifornia– in handcuffs.When asked about Padilla’s removal during the press conference, Noem said she didn’t recognize the two-term senator and claimed he hadn’t requested a meeting.According to DHS, Noem and Padilla met for for 15 minutes following the incident.The FBI has stated that its agents believed Padilla was an attacker and responded appropriately, while faulting the senator for not wearing a pin identifying him as a member of Congress. The Guardian’s requests for comment from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the National Guard and the Secret Service were not immediately returned.In a statement on Tuesday, the White House dismissed Padilla’s floor speech as a “temper tantrum”.“Alex ‘Pay Attention to Me’ Padilla is bouncing from one desperate ploy for attention to the next,” said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson, adding: “Whether or not Democrats like it, the American people support President Trump’s agenda to deport illegal aliens.”But Padilla, who noted he has never had a reputation as a “flame-thrower”, challenged his colleagues in both parties to consider what the episode revealed about the state of American democracy.“If you watched what unfolded last week and thought what happened is just about one politician and one press conference, you’re missing the point,” he said. Democrats and some Republicans condemned the incident. But administration officials – and many Republicans – blamed Padilla, with the House speaker Mike Johnson suggesting he should be censured for his actions.Padilla accused Trump of being a “tyrant” who had ordered National Guard troops and US marines into Los Angeles to “justify his undemocratic crackdowns and his authoritarian power grabs”. He said Trump was surrounded by “yes men” and a pliant Congress who refused to reign in the president tries everything to “test the boundaries of his power”.Padilla, the “proud” son of Mexican immigrants, warned that what is happening in his state could spread nationwide.“I refuse to let immigrants be political pawns on his path towards fascism,” he said. He described the situation in California as a “test case” for what could happen to “any American anywhere in the country”.As Padilla spoke in Washington, images emerged from New York where Brad Lander, the city’s comptroller and a candidate for mayor, had been arrested by masked federal agents as he visited an immigration court.“It’s time to wake up,” Padilla said, urging Americans to continue to peacefully protest the administration. “If this administration is this afraid of just one senator with a question … imagine what the voices of tens of billions of Americans peacefully protesting can do.”The Democrats in the chamber erupted in applause.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastUS politicsKristi NoemUS SenateTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Tuesday’s trip to an immigration court was Lander’s third over the last month.He was arrested,according to video footage of the incident, as he and his staff walked with an immigrant – who Lander later identified as “Edgardo” – who had their case dismissed pending appeal earlier in the day, perAMNY.Lander can be seen and heard in videos of the incident asking the immigration officials if they have a judicial warrant. Additional footage of the arrest shows Lander telling the officials: “I’m not obstructing. I’m standing right here in the hallway. I asked to see the judicial warrant.Lander appears to be holding on to Edgardo’s shoulder as the officials move him towards an elevator.“I will let go when you show me the judicial warrant,” says Lander. The officials, two of whom were wearing masks, then pinned Lander to a wall and put him in handcuffs.“You don’t have the authority to arrest US citizens asking for a judicial warrant,” Landercan be heard saying.Immigration lawyers told theNew York Timesthat officials do not need judicial warrants to make arrests in immigration courts because they are public spaces.Lander’s wife posted an update on her husband’s Twitter/X account less than an hour after the incident.“Hi, this is Meg Barnette, Brad’s wife,” she wrote, adding: “While escorting a defendant out of immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza, Brad was taken by masked agents and detained by ICE. This is still developing, and our team is monitoring the situation closely.”Ina news conferenceafter the arrest, Barnette said she was “extraordinarily proud” of her husband and called the ordeal “shocking and unacceptable”.Masked agents from several federal agencies were seen lining the halls of 26 Federal Plaza on Tuesday morning, including Ice, Enforcement and Removal Operations, the FBI and the treasury department, according to reporters on the scene fromthe City.Video and news of the arrest made the rounds on social media.Zohran Mamdani, a mayoral candidate who also cross-endorsed Lander,calledout the arrest on X: “This is fascism and all New Yorkers must speak in one voice. Release him now.”Julia Salazar, a New York state senator,calledthe arrest “more evidence that Ice agents are flagrantly breaking the law”.“[Lander] knows his rights, and he was speaking up for the rights of others. Ice agents responded by unlawfully arresting him and refusing to answer basic questions,” she said.Andrew Cuomo, former New York governor and Lander’s mayoral opponent,wrote on Xthat the arrest is “the latest example of the extreme thuggery of Trump’s ICE out of control – one can only imagine the fear families across our country feel when confronted with ICE. Fear of separation, fear of being taken from their schools, fear of being detained without just cause. This is not who we are. This must stop, and it must stop now.”Mamdani also appeared at the aforementioned pop-up press conference that Barnette spoke at, telling the crowd: “We have to be clear that, in [Lander’s] ask and in their response, we saw that Icehas no interest in the law, it has no interest in order.“[Ice] only has an interest in terrorizing people across this country. In this exact moment, New Yorkers and Americans are looking to leaders to meet this moment, to showcase the courage that is necessary,” he said, before adding:“This is not about an election. This is about ensuring that we protect the city and the country that we love. This is about ensuring that immigrant New Yorkers who come here for regular check-ins do not need to fear being separated from their families in the most brutal and cruel ways imaginable. We know that today’s arrest is but one example of what Ice is doing every single day across this country.”A demonstration broke out outside 26 Federal Plaza on Tuesday afternoon, with a crowd of supporters shouting “free Brad Lander”.Protesters held up placards saying “fascist minion” and “immigrants are New York” while surrounded by a tight cordon of police and metal barricades. Public entry to the building was closed despite it being a public building.New York’s governor,Kathy Hochul, called the arrest “bullshit” on social media and to reporters. She later said in a news conference that the charges against Lander had been dropped late on Tuesday afternoon.“To my knowledge, there are no charges. The charges have been dropped. He walked out of there a free man,” she said.Upon his release, Lander said at the same news conference that he was “just fine” and only “lost a button”. He went on to add that this was not the case for Edgardo, the man who’s arrest he was challenging.“Edgardo is in Ice detention and he’s not going to sleep in his bed tonight. So far as I know, he has no lawyer. He has been stripped of his due process rights,” Lander said, later adding: “We are normalizing family separation. We are normalizing due process rights violations. We are normalizing the destruction of constitutional democracy, and we’re not going to stand by and let it happen.”Lander’s arrest comes as federal immigration officials continue to make arrests outside immigration courtrooms across the US. As the Guardianreportedon Sunday, between early January, right beforethe inauguration, and June, there has been an 807% increase in the arrest of immigrants with no criminal record.The arrest also bore similarities to that of Alex Padilla, a Democratic California senator and vocal critic of theTrump administration’s immigration polices, who wasforcibly removedand handcuffed as he attempted to ask a question at a press conference held byKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, inLos Angeleslast week.Much like the criticism of Lander’s arrest, Padilla’s arrest was widely lambasted, with Kamala Harris, the former vice-president, calling the incident “a shameful and stunning abuse of power”.Lander’s arrest was also just one week before the Democratic primary for mayor. His opponents include Cuomo, Mamdani, Adrienne Adams, Scott Stringer, Michael Blake and others. Along with Mamdani, Hochul, Stringer, Blake and Adams showed up to support Lander at the site where he was arrested.Hochul was later seen inside 26 Federal Plaza seeking answers from Ice about the arrest.“How long is this going to take, I don’t think he has a long rap sheet,” shereportedlysaid to agents.Ed Pilkington contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsNew YorkUS immigrationUS politicsKathy HochulnewsShareReuse this content"

Sun had earned the recognition for buying $20m of thecryptomemecoin $Trump, ranking him first among 220 purchasers of the token who received dinner invitations.Trump’s much-hyped 22 May dinner and a White House tour the next day for 25 leading memecoin buyers were devised to spur sales of$Trumpand wound up raking in about $148m, much of it courtesy of anonymous and foreign buyers, for Trump and his partners.Memecoins are crypto tokens that are often based on online jokes but have no inherent value. They often prove risky investments as their prices can fluctuate wildly. The $Trump memecoin was launched days before Trump’s presidential inauguration, spurring a surge of buyers and yielding tens of millions of dollars for Trump and some partners.Trump’s private events on 22 May to reward the top purchasers of $Trump have sparked strong criticism of the president from ethics watchdogs, ex-prosecutors and scholars for exploiting his office for personal gain in unprecedented ways. But they fit in a broader pattern of how Trump has exploited the power and lure of his office to enrich himself and some top allies via cryptocurrencies.I have never seen such open corruption in any modern government anywhereSteven Levitsky of Harvard University“Self-enrichment is exactly what the founders feared most in a leader – that’s why they put two separate prohibitions on self-benefit into the constitution,” said former federal prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig. “Trump’s profiting from his presidential memecoin is a textbook example of what the framers wanted to avoid.”Scholars, too, offer a harsh analysis of Trump’s crypto dealings.“I have never seen such open corruption in any modern government anywhere,” said Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard University and an expert on authoritarian regimes who co-authored the book How Democracies Die.‘This is the looting of America’: Trump and Co’s extraordinary conflicts of interest in his second termRead moreSuch ethical and legal qualms don’t seem to have fazed Trump or Sun. The pair forged their ties well before the dinner as Sun invested $75m in another Trump crypto enterprise, World Liberty Financial (WLF), that Trump and his two older sons launched last fall and in which they boast a 60% stake.The Chinese-born Sun’s political and financial fortunes, as well as those of other crypto tycoons, have improved markedly since Trump took office and moved fast to loosen regulations of cryptocurrency ventures at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the justice department and other agencies to upend Joe Biden’s policies.As the SEC has eased regulations and paused or ended 12 cases involving cryptocurrency fraud, three Sun crypto companies that were charged with fraud by an SEC lawsuit in 2023 had their cases paused in February by the agency, which cited the “public interest” and reportedly has held settlement talks.Trump’s and Sun’s mutually beneficial crypto dealings symbolize how the US president has boosted his paper wealth by an estimated billions of dollars since he returned to office, and worked diligently to slash regulations fulfilling his pledges to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet” and end the “war on crypto”.After the 22 May dinner, Sun posted: “Thank you @POTUS for your unwavering support of our industry!”Although Trump’s crypto ventures are less than a year old, the State Democracy Defenders Fund watchdog group has estimated that as of mid-March they are worth about $2.9bn.In late March, Reuters revealed that WLF had raised more than $500m in recent months and that the Trump family receives about 75% of crypto token sales.Trump’s pursuit of crypto riches and deregulation represents a big shift from his comments to Fox News in 2021, when he said that bitcoin, a very popular crypto currency, “seems like a scam”.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks at a Bitcoin 2024 event in Nashville, Tennessee, on 27 July 2024.Photograph: Mark Humphrey/APIn July 2019, Trump posted that “Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade”, and noted that their value was “highly volatile and based on thin air”.Now, Trump’s new pro-crypto policies have benefited big campaign donors who lead crypto firms as well asElon Musk, the world’s richest person, who spent almost $300m to help elect Trump, and who boasts sizable crypto investments in bitcoin through his electric car firm Tesla and his other ventures. Though Trump and Musk have since fallen out, the mogul’s crypto fortunes seem to have improved due to the president’s deregulatory agenda.Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is a real estate billionaire who helped found WLF, in which he has a stake; Trump’s two oldest sons, Eric and Don Jr, and Witkoff’s son Zach have played key roles promoting WLF in the Middle East and other places.Trump’s use of his Oval Office perch to increase his wealth through his burgeoning crypto businesses while his administration rapidly eases regulations is unprecedented and smacks of corruption, say scholars, many congressional Democrats and some Republicans.“To me, Trump’s crypto dealings seem pretty explicit,” Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University professor who focuses on political history, told the Guardian. “Policy decisions are being made regarding parts of the financial industry that are being done not to benefit the nation, but his own financial interests … It’s hard to imagine what he’s doing benefits the nation.”Rosenzweig stressed that “not only do Trump’s extravagant crypto ventures benefit him personally as his administration slashes crypto regulations and takes pro-crypto steps at the SEC; they also benefit his tech bro backers who will take full advantage of the end of regulatory enforcement”.In Congress, leading Democrats, including Richard Blumenthal, a senator from Connecticut, and Jamie Raskin, a representative from Maryland, in May announced separate inquiries by key panels in which they are ranking members into Trump’s crypto dealings, and attacked Trump for using his office to enrich himself via his crypto operations.“With his pay-for-access dinner, Trump put presidential access and influence on the auction block,” Blumenthal told the Guardian. “The scope and scale of Trump’s corruption is staggering – I’ll continue to demand answers.”Trump’s crypto schemes are the Mount Everest of corruptionDemocratic senator Jeff MerkleyLast month, too, the Democratic senator Jeff Merkley, from Oregon, and the Senate minority leader,Chuck Schumer, introduced the “end crypto corruption” bill, which 22 other Democrats have endorsed.“Trump’s crypto schemes are the Mount Everest of corruption,” Merkley told the Guardian. “We must ban Trump-style crypto corruption so all elected federal officials – including the president, vice-president and members of Congress – cannot profit from shady crypto practices,” which his bill would curtail.Some former congressional Republicans are also incensed by Trump’s blatant use of his presidency to peddle $Trump. “Nobody should be allowed to use their public positions while in office to enrich themselves,” said ex-Republican congressman Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, who once chaired the House ethics panel. “A member of Congress would not be permitted to engage in the kind of memecoin activities which the president has been doing.”Trump and his family have dismissed critics concerns about the 22 May events and his other crypto ventures.Before the 22 May dinner, Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters that the president would attend his crypto gala in his “personal time” and it was not a White House event, but declined to release names of the many anonymous and foreign attendees.To allay criticism, the Trump Organization said in January that Trump’s business interests, including his assets and investments, would be placed in a trust his children would manage and that the president wouldn’t be involved in decision-making or daily operations. Trump’s family also hired a lawyer as an ethics adviser.But those commitments have been dwarfed by Trump’s public embrace of his crypto ventures and strong deregulatory agenda. In March, for instance, Trump hosted the first-ever “crypto summit” at the White House, which drew a couple dozen industry bigwigs who heard Trump promise to end Biden’s “war on crypto”.Trump’s crypto critics worry that the president’s strong push for less industry regulation may create big problems: the crypto industry has been battered by some major scandals including ones involving North Korean hackers and has been plagued by concerns about industry’s lack of transparency and risks.For instance, a report last December by leading research firm Chainalysis found that North Korean hackers had stolen $1.34bn of cryptocurrency in 2024, a record total and double what they stole the year before.The report concluded that US and foreign analysts believe the stolen funds were diverted in North Korea to “finance its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs”.Other crypto fraud schemes in the US have spurred loud alarms.In an annual report last September, the FBI revealed that fraud related to crypto businesses soared in 2023 with Americans suffering $5.6bn in losses, a 45% jump from the previous year.Sam Bankman-Fried, who founded the now bankrupt FTX crypto exchange, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March 2024 by a New York judge for bilking customers out of $8bn.Nonetheless, a justice department memo in April announced it was closing a national cryptocurrency enforcement team that was established in 2022, which had brought major crypto cases against North Korean hackers and other crypto criminals.The memo stressed that the justice department was not a “digital assets regulator” and tried to tar the Biden administration for a “reckless strategy of regulation by prosecution”. The memo stated that a pro-crypto Trump executive order in January spurred the justice department’s policy shift.Ex-prosecutors and ethics watchdogs worry increasingly that crypto scandals and conflicts of interest will worsen as theTrump administrationmoves fast to ease crypto oversight at the justice department, the SEC and other agencies.Some of WLF’s high-profile crypto deals have involved overseas crypto firms which have had recent regulatory and legal problems in the US, fueling new concerns, watchdogs and ex-prosecutors say.View image in fullscreenEric Trump with WLF co-founder Zach Witkoff and Justin Sun at the Token 2049 crypto event in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on 1 May 2025.Photograph: Altaf Qadri/APOne lucrative deal raised eyebrows when WLF was tapped to play a central role in a $2bn investment by Abu Dhabi financial fund MGX that is backed by theUnited Arab Emiratesin the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance.As part of the deal, the Abu Dhabi fund bought $2bn of a WLF stablecoin, dubbed USD1, to invest inBinance. Stablecoins are a popular type of cryptocurrency that are often pegged to the dollar.The WLF deal comes after Binance in 2023 pleaded guilty to violating US money-laundering laws and other violations and the justice department fined it a whopping $4bn.Furthermore, Binance’s ex-CEO and founder, Changpeng Zhao, pleaded guilty in the US to violating the Bank Secrecy Act and failing to maintain an effective anti-money-laundering program.Zhao, who still owns 90% of Binance, served a four-month jail term last year.WLF’s $2bn deal was announced at an Abu Dhabi crypto conference on 1 May that drewEric Trumptwo weeks before Trump’s visit to the UAE capital, sparking concerns of foreign influence and ethics issues.Increasing WLF’s ties further with Binance, the crypto exchange announced on 22 May that it had begun listing the stablecoin for trading purposes. Binance got some good news at the end of May, too, when the SEC announced the dismissal of a civil lawsuit it filed in 2023 against the exchange for misleading investors about surveillance controls and trading irregularities.Paul Pelletier, a former acting chief of the justice department’s fraud section, noted that SEC moves back in February “to emasculate its crypto enforcement efforts sent crypto fraudsters a welcome mat of impunity”.He added: “The recent dismissal of the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance for mishandling customer funds, days after it began listing the Trump family’s cryptocurrency on its exchange, seemed to be the natural consequence of such enforcement laxity. Victims be damned.”Other agency deregulatory moves that favor crypto interests can boost Trump’s own enterprises and his allies, but pose potential risks for ordinary investors, say legal scholars.Donald Trump has turned the presidency into a crypto cash machineDemocratic senator Elizabeth WarrenColumbia law professor Richard Briffault noted that as part of the Trump administration’s wide-ranging and risky crypto deregulatory agenda which can benefit Trump’s own crypto ventures, the Department of Labor in late May nixed a Biden-era “extreme care” warning about 401K plans investing in crypto.“[The labor department] has rescinded the red light from the Biden years for 401K retirement plans, which is another sign of the Trump administration’s embrace of crypto,” Briffault said.Briffault, an expert on government ethics, has told the Guardian more broadly that Trump’s crypto ventures and his 22 May memecoin bash are “unprecedented”.“I don’t think there’s been anything like this in American history,” he said. “Trump is marketing access to himself as a way to profit his memecoin. People are paying to meet Trump and he’s the regulator-in-chief. It’s doubly corrupt.”In late May, in a new crypto business twist, the Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent of Truth Social, said it had sealed a deal to raise $2.5bn to be used to buy bitcoin, creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency.Meanwhile, Trump’s stablecoin fortunes and those of many industry allies could get boosts soon from a Senate stablecoin bill, dubbed the “genius act”, that’s poised to pass the Senate on Tuesday but which critics have said loosens regulatory controls in dangerous ways unless amended with consumer protections and other safeguards.Senators Merkley andElizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, led unsuccessful efforts to amend the bill to thwart potential criminal abuses, protect consumers and prevent Trump from using his office to profit his crypto businesses.“The ‘genius act’ fails to prevent sanctions evasion and other illicit activity and lets big tech giants like Elon Musk’s X issue their own private money – all without the guardrails needed to keep Americans safe from scams, junk fees or another financial crash,” Warren told the Guardian.“Donald Trump has turned the presidency into a crypto cash machine,” Warren said. The Genius act, Warren stressed, should have “prohibited the President AND his family from profiting from any stablecoin project.”More broadly, Kedric Payne, the general counsel and ethics director at the Campaign Legal Center, said: “President Trump’s financial stakes in the crypto industry at the same time that he is determining how the government will regulate the industry is unprecedented in modern history. This is precisely the type of conflict of interest that ethics laws and norms are designed to stop.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationCryptocurrenciesEthicsDonald TrumpDonald Trump JrEric TrumpElon MuskfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Two-thirds of the world’s largest 65 banks increased their fossil fuel financing by $162bn from 2023 to 2024.Scientists have beenclearthat no new fossil fuel project can proceed if disastrous climate impacts are to be avoided, with last year the hottestever recordedamid a slew of disasters driven by global heating.However, many banks have recently watered down or ditched their own commitments to help reduce planet-heating emissions, amid a changing political dynamic that has seen the US again being led by Donald Trump, who has famously called climate science “a giant hoax” and “bullshit”. In February, the US treasurywithdrewfrom a global banking network that aims to increase green finance and reduce climate risk.Four of the five largest fossil fuel financiers last year were American companies, with JPMorgan Chase lending the most at $53.5bn. Bank of America was second, followed by Citigroup. The Japanese bank Mizuho Financial was fourth, withWells Fargoin fifth. The largest absolute increases in fossil fuel lending last year came from the top American institutions as well as Barclays, the British bank.In the decade since the world’s political leaders committed, in the landmark Paris climate agreement, to restrain dangerous global heating, the biggest banks have continued to pour lending towards drilling projects, pipelines and other fossil fuel activity. In total, banks have financed fossil fuels by $7.9tn since the Paris deal.“By injecting a staggering $869bn into fossil fuel financing in 2024 alone, the world’s largest banks fund the climate chaos that fossil fuel companies wreak on people and communities worldwide,” said David Tong, global industry campaign manager at Oil Change International and a co-author of the report.“Governments must step in and take urgent action to hold financial institutions accountable for their role in the climate crisis.”While most of the world’s top financial firms have pledged to abide by the Paris deal and help tackle the climate crisis, many of them have ignored or walked back these promises in the past yearwhile predicting catastrophic global temperature rises. Last year, six US senatorssaidthat JPMorgan Chase may have misled investors by backtracking on its climate commitments.Then, in January, shortly before the inauguration of Trump as US president, the six largest American banks – JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs –all withdrew from the net zero banking alliance.The alliance is a United Nations-sponsored initiative to spur banks to align their lending and investment portfolios with the Paris goals. It requires banks to set targets and reduce emissions associated with their investments.“This year, banks have shown their true colors – many have walked away from climate commitments and doubled down on financing fossil fuel expansion, even as global temperatures break records,” said Lucie Pinson, director and founder at Reclaim Finance, and another report co-author.“A few European banks may have inched forward, but for most, the lure of dirty money has proven too strong.”The Guardian contacted all of the top lenders to fossil fuels about the report, which is calledBankingon Climate Chaos. A Citi spokesperson said that it supports the “transition to a low-carbon economy and, in 2021, made a commitment to reach net-zero greenhouse gas financed emissions by 2050.“We work with our clients as they seek to decarbonize their businesses and support clean energy solutions as part of our $1tn sustainable finance goal. Our approach reflects the need to transition while also continuing to meet global needs for energy security, particularly in this time of increasing electricity demand.”A Barclays spokesperson said:“Barclays provides finance to meet consumer and businesses energy needs while financing the scaling of clean energy. Last year, we mobilised nearly $100bn more Sustainable and Transition Finance than in 2023 and continue to invest £500m in climate tech start-ups by 2027. These are significant interventions to support our clients to transition.” ENDSExplore more on these topicsBusinessBankingJP MorganWells FargoGoldman SachsFossil fuelsCoalnewsShareReuse this content"

The next day, Ice officialsreportedly told staffin an internal email to largely lay off raids and arrests in the agricultural, hotel and restaurant industries.But now, according to the Post, immigration hawks led by the deputy chief of staff,Stephen Miller, crushed the pause – after the agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, had secured the temporary reprieve amid industry pressure.By Sunday, Trump had publicly reversed course entirely, ordering agents via a Truth Social post to deliver what he called the “single largest Mass Deportation Program in History” – focusing particularly on America’s largest cities, almost all being run by Democrats.The administration desperately wants workplace raids to hit Miller’s target of 3,000 daily arrests.

The airline cited a combination of aircraft unavailability, technical snags, airspace restrictions, and extended safety checks.At least three other Dreamliner flights have been grounded or delayed in the past 48 hours, as India’s aviation regulator ordered rigorous pre-flight inspections across Air India’s fleet of 33 Dreamliners. A Boeing 777 operating the San Francisco-Mumbai route was also grounded because of a technical hitch.The disruption came as pressure mounted on Air India and Boeing as the investigation into India’s deadliest plane crash in decades continued. Investigators are pursuing multiple theories, including what some independent experts believe may have been a catastrophic – and extremely rare – dual engine failure.Offering a measure of relief for Air India late on Tuesday, India’s aviation regulator said it had found no major safety flaws in the airline’s Dreamliner fleet but warned of persistent maintenance shortcomings and coordination lapses that could undermine reliability.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which conducted in-depth inspections of 24 Dreamliners, raised concerns over delays linked to spare-part shortages and weak internal coordination between engineering, ground handling, and operations teams.Still, in a boost to theTataowned airline, which is facing intense scrutiny after the crash, the DGCA said all inspected Dreamliners were compliant with existing aviation safety standards. The wide-body jets form the backbone of Air India’s long-haul network.Flight AI171 issued a Mayday call moments after taking off from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel international airport on 12 June. It reached only 650 feet before crashing into a medical college complex, erupting into a fireball. Onlyone of the 242 people onboard survived, with at least 29 people on the ground also killed.By Tuesday, officials had matched the DNA of 135 victims and returned 101 bodies to relatives, though they said five of those individuals had not been listed on the flight manifest.The identification process has been slow and gruelling. Many victims were burned beyond recognition, and officials said the remains were being processed in small batches through genetic testing. The official death toll cannot be finalised until the meticulous process of DNA identification is complete.Dr Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent at Ahmedabad civil hospital, said “135 DNA samples have been matched, and 101 bodies have already been handed over to the respective families. Of these 101 deceased, five were not on board the flight.” He said he hoped DNA profiling would be completed by Wednesday.The sole survivor, a 40-year-old British national of Indian origin, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, described the horror of the crash: “Right in front of my eyes, I saw air hostesses, uncles, aunties dying,” said Ramesh, who lost his brother Ashok in the tragedy.On Tuesday, hundreds of people gathered in Mumbai to pay an emotional farewell at the funeral of the flight’s captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, whose final actions may have prevented even greater loss of life. A veteran pilot with more than 8,000 hours of experience, he has been praised for appearing to have steered the aircraft clear of a densely populated area.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau is leading the inquiry, supported by UK and US safety agencies. Investigators are examiningmultiple potential causes, from thrust-and-flap settings to fact that the landing gear did not appear to have retracted. Investigators, who haverecovered the cockpit voice and flight data recorders, are also looking at whether the aircraft lost thrust in both engines. “There was some sort of dual engine failure,” said Steve Scheibner, a former US navy pilot, commentator, and a retired American Airlines captain.The DGCA has asked Air India to submit records from recent inspections and detailed personnel files of the pilots and flight dispatcher, Reuters reported. It has also ordered safety drills in all airports and instructed flying schools to conduct compliance checks.The crash marks a pivotal moment for Air India. The tea-to-steel Tata Group, which acquired the carrier in 2022 after nearly 70 years of state ownership, has invested billions of dollars to modernise its ageing fleet and revive the brand’s image.Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chair of Tata Sons, said: “We need to use this incident as an act of force to build a safer airline. We’re going to get through this.”Boeing’s commercial chief, Stephanie Pope, met Chandrasekaran at Air India’s headquarters near Delhi on Tuesday. The tragedy involving Boeing’s most advanced aircraft in service has renewed scrutiny of the manufacturer’s controversial safety record. Boeing has said only that it was “focused on supporting the investigation”.Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaBoeingTataAirline industrySouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Any contracts entered into from today would have to be wound up by 1 January 2026, but companies with pre-existing agreements have a final deadline of 1 January 2028.The proposal is facing a backlash from Hungary, Slovakia andAustria, but these countries are not thought to have enough support to block the plan from becoming EU law.View image in fullscreen‘Russia has weaponised energy against us’: Dan Jørgensen speaking in Strasbourg, France, on 17 June.Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPAJørgensen said plans to phase out Russian fossil fuels were not a response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “This is a ban that we introduce becauseRussiahas weaponised energy against us, because Russia has blackmailed member states in the EU, and therefore they are not a trading partner that can be trusted,” he said. “That also means that, irrespectively of whether there is a peace or not – which we all hope there will be of course – this ban will still stand.”EU importers will be required to provide customs officers with detailed information about the source of gas to prevent any attempts to sell Russian imports under a new flag.About 13% of EU gas imports is expected to come from Russia in 2025, compared with 45% in 2021. While Europe has cut supplies of pipeline gas from Russia, in 2024 itbought record amounts of Russian LNG, raising questions about the EU’s commitment to Ukraine and climate goals.The commission expressed confidence that European companies terminating long-term gas contracts would not be liable for damages. Jørgensen said the EU ban was beyond any individual company’s control. “It is not them who are breaking the contract, it is indeed force majeure.”graphThe EU also wants to end imports of Russian oil by 2028, compared with 3% today and 27% in 2021.But the latest proposal does not remove an exemption from the EU’s oil embargo granted to Hungary and Slovakia. When the EU agreed an oil import embargo in March 2023, the central European countriessecured an opt-outthat allowed them to continue to be supplied via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline. This carve-out, agreed under the EU’s sanctions regime, cannot be touched by this legislation, which has a different legal basis.Hungary and Slovakia have sharply criticised the EU plans to phase out fossil fuels. Péter Szíjjártó, the Hungarian foreign minister, claimed Hungarian consumers could pay four times more for utilities, and he posted avideo on social mediaon Monday in which he spoke over a dramatic action movie-style soundtrack. EU officials reject suggestions that prices would go up.In more muted criticism, Austria’s energy ministrytold the Financial Timesthat the EU should be open to resuming gas imports from Russia if there was a deal to end the war in Ukraine.However, Lena Schilling, an Austrian Green MEP and formerFridays for the Futureactivist, called the stance shortsighted and morally irresponsible. “Have we learned nothing from bombed hospitals, abducted children and a war of aggression in the heart of Europe?” she asked.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryOil and gas companiesEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionRussiaUkraineAustrianewsShareReuse this content"

This means the shortage could be much higher, as datacentres often use vast amounts of water.Every five years, the EA puts out its water deficit projections, but it was difficult to do this year, the sources said, because of the growth in AI, which is one of the most significant changes to projected usage in recent years. The regulator added that the majority of datacentres were using the public water supply rather than alternative sources and that they did not want this to stop or transparency over their figures.At the moment, the EA does not have sufficient data to be able to understand both these centres current use and their needs.Datacentres for AI are a pivotal part of the government’s growth strategy, and Keir Starmer announced this year that he wouldhugely increase AIcapacity and reduce planning restrictions on companies that wanted to build datacentres by setting up “growth zones” with fewer constraints.AI datacentres use a large amount of water to prevent their servers overheating and shutting down. The centres have cooling towers and outside air systems, both of which need clean, fresh water. AIconsumes between 1.8 and 12 litres of water for each kilowatt hour of energyusage across Microsoft’s global datacentres. Onestudyestimates that global AI could account for up to 6.6bn cubic metres of water use by 2027 – the equivalent of nearlytwo-thirdsof England’s annual consumption.The EA chair, Alan Lovell, said: “The nation’s water resources are under huge and steadily increasing pressure. This deficit threatens not only the water from your tap but also economic growth and food production.“Taking water unsustainably from the environment will have a disastrous impact on our rivers and wildlife. We need to tackle these challenges head-on and strengthen work on coordinated action to preserve this precious resource and our current way of life.”Plans to increase supply, submitted by water companies, include nine desalination schemes, 10 reservoirs and seven water recycling schemes by 2050. Water bills for customers have risen, andwill continue to rise, to pay for this infrastructure.The government also plans to monitor individual household water use by rolling out smart meters, which charge based on the amount used and allow water companies and other agencies to track usage.Climate breakdown will further squeeze water supplies, the EA said, as hotter drier summers become more probable. Areas that rely mostly on surface water will therefore be more susceptible to drought, and it may not rain consistently enough for groundwater to recharge.Thames Water on Tuesday openeda statutory public consultationon a controversial drought scheme to pump millions more litres of treated sewage into the River Thames every day. Under the £300m project, Thames would extract 75m litres of water a dayfrom the river in south-west London during drought and replacing it with treated sewage from one of Europe’s largest treatment plants at Mogden.The plan has drawn objections from thousands of people, including the Liberal Democrat MP Munira Wilson, over concerns about the effect on river water quality, the impact of forever chemicals, and the adverse effect on the ecology. The EA has said ThamesWaterhas failed to show that the scheme is “feasible or environmentally acceptable”. Thames Water loses about 570m litres a day from leaks on its network, the most of all the privatised water companies.Ofwat’s chief executive, David Black, said: “Boosting supply through building critical water infrastructure is essential to safeguard supplies of drinking water. The way is now clear for the water industry to build on the success of the recently opened £5bn Thames Tideway project by stepping forward to deliver an expanded pipeline of 30 major projects we need in England and Wales.”Explore more on these topicsWaterArtificial intelligence (AI)Environment AgencyWater industryTechnology sectorEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The 22-year-old had also been aware of his presence at tournaments in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha in preceding weeks.Speaking after the incident, Raducanu told reporters: “I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like: ‘I don’t know how I’m going to finish.’ I literally couldn’t see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like: ‘I need to just take a breather.’ I’m always with someone and always being watched.”Raducanu, who shot to global fame when she won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021, said that her behaviour had changed since the incident in Dubai. “I’m obviously wary when I go out,” she said.“I try not to be careless about it because you only realise how much of a problem it is when you’re in that situation and I don’t necessarily want to be in that situation again.”Raducanu has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man given a five-year restraining order in 2022 after he walked 23 miles to her home.On Tuesday the British No 2, Katie Boulter, said that she hadreceived abuse and death threatson social media and had been followed around London by an unknown vehicle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were long lines at every vendor and even at the drinking fountains.”Another attender, Bryan González of Oakland, California, said that there were no additional water stations and that misting setups were consistently crowded throughout the game.“People were filling up their cups [with water] and throwing them all over each other’s back,” he said. “Luckily they had those misting stations by the bathroom area, so people were swarming under there, taking turns.”Celmins said that a contributing factor to the issues was that the Rose Bowl typically allows fans to bring in sealed water bottles into games, but did not on this occasion. The stadium’s policies as outlined on its website state that unopened or empty disposable water bottles are allowed, as are reusable water bottles so long as they are empty.The Rose Bowl website also states, however, that the regulations may change depending on the event, and in this case Fifa’s directives appear to be taking precedence.The Fifa Club World Cup code of conductsays that “empty, transparent, reusable plastic bottles” up to one liter may be brought in but explicitly bans all other types of bottles (aside from those needed for medicinal purposes or baby bottles).Intense traffic, tight crowds and long lines are nothing new at the Rose Bowl, which was opened in 1922. But those issues were exacerbated during a midday game in high heat, especially given that none of the seating bowl is covered and the vast majority of the concourse area outside the seats is on blacktop surrounding the stadium.Still, attenders told the Guardian that the experience was significantly worse than usual. Among other events, the Rose Bowl serves as the home venue for UCLA’s American football team, and routinely hosts other major college football games.“The stadium knows how to handle nearly 90,000 fans but today it struggled with 81,000 which I do not understand at all,” Celmins said. “I am much less likely to try and attend the World Cup after this poorly run experience.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionCelmin’s and González’s sentiments were echoed by a number of match-goers who made their feelings clear online. Underneath posts on the Rosebowl Instagram account one user described attending the match as the “worst mistake” of their life. “We’re sunburnt all over and everything hurts,” Khusan Madimov wrote.Another Instagram user, Val Wright, said: “Dangerous experience. It should have come as no surprise the weather was 90 [degrees] and there was going to be 90,000. 45min queue at every vendor for water. Lines so long there was gridlock between sections 13-20 before and during half-time. Even Pasadena fire dept taking away sun stroke victims struggled to get through. I’ve been to football matches all around the world and we [never] felt this unsafe. We left at half-time.”Fifa and the Rose Bowl Stadium organization were approached for comment on Monday but had not replied at time of writing. Last week sources close to the organisers told the Guardian that Fifa would be monitoring match conditions daily to ensure safety amid hot weather and would introduce measures to protect supporters if necessary.The Rose Bowl is due to host five more matches in the group stage of the Club World Cup, including one, Atlético Madrid v Botafogo on 23 June, that has a kick-off time of noon local time, like Atlético’s game v PSG. The stadium hosted the 1994 and 1999 World Cup finals, but is not a 2026 World Cup venue.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The British No 2 believes much of the abuse comes from gamblers who have lost money.Boulter, aiming for a hat-trick of victories at the Nottingham Open, opened her defence with a convincing 6-2, 6-2 win against the world No 44, Lulu Sun, but it was the grim catalogue of hate posted online that Boulter had earliermade public in an interview with BBC Sportwhich was the talk of the tournament.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.One message sent to the 28-year-old during the French Open, said: “Hope you get cancer”. Another told her: “Go to hell. I lost money my mother sent me.” While a third instructed her to buy “candles and a coffin for your entire family” and threatened to damage her “grandmother’s grave if she’s not dead by tomorrow”.After her victory in Nottingham, Boulter said she realised people simply did not know the extent to which tennis players were being abused. “I looked on my phone this morning and there were hundreds of messages of people reacting to it [the interview],” she said.“Every single person was telling me to disregard it and how much they loved me and how much they appreciated me bringing this subject to light. I don’t think people were aware of it. I don’t think people were aware how much it happens to players.“A lot of comments are very emotional responses. I wouldn’t say they are normal responses. They always seem to be during a match and a lot of them do reference gambling, saying you lost them a lot of money. We’re still all learning, but a lot of it’s from that.“I’m past the point of worrying what people actually say to me, it’s more about somehow finding a way to stop that from happening. My goal was to raise awareness. There’s a lot of it. It’s pretty hard to contain it.”Tennis authorities have been using an AI-led detection system called Threat Matrix since last year to try to prevent the worst of the abuse reaching the players.The WTA’s and ITF’s first report on the subject, which was published on Tuesday, outlined the scale of the problem, revealing 458 players were shown to have been subjected to direct abuse or threat. Signify Group, which runs the system, established that 40% of overall open-source social media abuse came from frustrated gamblers – a figure which rose to 77% for direct abuse towards players’ personal accounts.Boulter’s fiance, Alex de Minaur, praised her for highlighting the issue. “It’s good to kind of shine a light on everything that happens not only when you lose,” he said after his 6-4, 6-2 defeat against the Czech player Jiri Lehecka at Queen’s Club.“You’re feeling not in the best state emotionally [when you lose], but then you’ve also got to deal with everything that happens behind the scenes with angry gamblers. I haven’t gone on my social media yet, but I’m sure I’ll have a lot of people not too happy with my result today.”The WTA players’ council member Jessica Pegula called for the gambling industry and social media companies to take action. “Online abuse is unacceptable and something that no player should have to endure,” she said. “It’s time for the gambling industry and social media companies to tackle the problem at its source and act to protect everyone facing these threats.”Boulter’s next opponent in Nottingham, fellow Briton Sonay Kartal – who defeated the French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean 6-3, 6-4 – is another who has been on the receiving end. “Win or lose, that’s the stuff I get on my DMs or my Instagram,” she said. “It’s obviously not nice. If there’s anything I think is dangerous I’ll report it. It’s tough. I think it’s all sports. It is scary at times.”Fifteen cases have been passed on to law enforcement authorities for assessment and possible action since Threat Matrix was introduced.Harriet Dart, who lost against fellow Briton Fran Jones in straight sets, said abuse is simply part and parcel of life as a tennis player. “What’s quite scary is that we think this is normal. The amount of abuse we all get is pretty mind-blowing,” she said. “Some of them have full profiles and they’ve got a wife and kids – you just think this person’s nuts. They’d never say it to your face.“But clearly when they’re threatening your family it can be quite serious and you just report it. It’s a scary world we live in.”Dart called for social media companies to bring in mandatory identification for account holders. “We live in the 21st century. How we’re not ID’ing people on social media, and then they can be found … it’s pretty horrific.”Explore more on these topicsKatie BoulterTennisOnline abusenewsShareReuse this content"

He has since been charged with burglary. So on balance, and while an entirely tempting, innovative option, this is probably not the way to go.Pressure makes diamonds, as online graft-influencers like to say. But it also makes the average human yearn for a little quiet space. That same Tuesday morningTrent Alexander-Arnold, who could probably also do with a break from the white noise, was taking his second Real Madrid training session in the 32C (90F) heat of the Gardens North County District Park, a hundred miles south-east of Polk, and in a team where the entire experience can at times resemble an unceasing spousal argument.Messi drink launch affirms Spanish as new lingua franca at Club World Cup | Barney RonayRead moreMadrid are the most relentlessly exposed football club on the planet, huge even in a place where it feels at times as if nobody actually knows theClub World Cupis going on just up the road. Towards the end of the opening ceremony on Saturday a Fifa-branded wailing wall of hope was wheeled out on to the pitch at the Hard Rock Stadium, trailed by a gaggle of children, who then solemnly implanted 32 lighted bricks bearing the badges of every competing club.The big screen lingered on one badge only, the Madrid emblem, drawing huge, shrill cheers from a crowd that had to that point seemed interested only in Lionel Messi doing his Elvis in Vegas act. Welcome to the world, Trent, as we may now call him, a place where every moment is public, every second in the branded nylon out there to be hungrily consumed.The Hard Rock Stadium is also the venue for Madrid’s opening game against Al-Hilal on Wednesday in the brain-mangling heat of a (frankly insane) 3pm kick-off. Before then it is to be hoped there is space to take a few breaths, because this will surely be the most scrutinised pre-season debut any footballer has faced, globally streamed, instantly consumed and analysed. In America the sun rises every day, as Ronald Reagan pointed out, accurately. But it tends also to bring quite a bit of light and heat with it.There is something else, too. For all the hype and hopeful talk, one thing is true: the evidence is that he will probably fail. This is not a criticism, more an assessment of the balance of facts. There are also competing positives. Madrid have a huge wealth of talent plusa very good new manager. The early sessions with the team have been encouragingly moreish.The chat among the Spanish journalists who follow Madrid is that Trent has tended to trail after Jude Bellingham “like the new kid at school”, and there was something tender about the first glimpse of Alexander-Arnold in the rondo, out there surrounded by all those faces, Luka, Kylian, Vini, trying to control a ball on plastic grass, like some recurring anxiety nightmare.View image in fullscreenAlexander-Arnold has been trailing after Jude Bellingham ‘like the new kid at school’.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersBut his own verdict was encouragingly plain: “It’s high quality, the ball moves very fast. It’s a lot different to what I’m used to.” And the optics are good. He’s a proper athlete, not just a mobile passing brain, impressive physically, with a grace and power that aren’t always evident on TV. Trent in sleeveless Madrid training gear looks starry, handsome, easy in his movements.Speaking Spanish early on is also very smart, thehala Madrid-la stuff, the serviceable accent. The “rebranding” as Trent is a nice idea, a New Me, a post-breakup reinvention. Trent12 posing in front of Madrid’s massed European Cups looked disarmingly relaxed. He has already lifted that pot you know. He has already done terrible things to Barcelona. The new kid has moves too.But there is also one great unanswered question. Is Alexander‑Arnold actually a transferable commodity? He is both a very good player and a very strange one. This is not like bolting on an orthodox centre‑half or a goal-sniffing No 9. Alexander‑Arnold was brilliant for Liverpool in a highly specialised role. And there is so far no evidence, aged 26, that this can be transplanted.All of his professional success has been for one club under one manager: Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool, that system, three hard-running midfielders inside him, empowered to lean only into his strengths. The Arne Slot season was decent, so-so, a fudge. Either side Alexander‑Arnold has never played for any other club, never managed to succeed with England. He has only been his best self in one shirt, under one manager, at the club he grew up with.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold impressed by speaking Spanish at his Real Madrid unveiling.Photograph: Chema Moya/EPAIt is easy, from this starting point, to see only the darker clouds. Klopp drew extraordinary returns out of Alexander-Arnold’s creative, high-precision passing. But we remember also the tendency to switch off, the good, competent defending interspersed with moments of no defending at all. Some will suggest no Englishman has ever really succeeded at Madrid, aside from Steve McManaman, a different kind of player, and probably David Beckham,El Jefe de Miami.There is another more structural problem. Madrid don’t just have a new manager, they have an entirely newtypeof manager. In Xabi Alonso the club of vibes, energy, imperial freedoms, have appointed a hard systems coach. Basically, Kylian is going to have to do things now.

Alonso is not an aura-dad in the Carlo Ancelotti mould. He’s also not a pure number-wanging technocrat. He’s a blend of these personas, a super-cool systems guy, auraandnumbers. He’s got nice tailoring. He’s also got an iPad. For all that, two things are undeniably true.First, the Madrid squad is not instantly suited to replicating the Bayer Leverkusen style, which featured exceptionally disciplined pressing, learned patterns, brutal periods of running and resilient defence. And second, Alonso obviously knows this. He knows the club and the players. He knows the task here is not to go Full Amorim, to adapt and integrate.For all the pre-analysis nobody actually knows how Alonso is going to embrace this point of tension. Like Trent he faces the associated challenges of the step up to this stage, a manager who will basically spend his first few months trying to juggle a bowl of fruit while also putting out a minor kitchen fire and making soufflé for 500 paying guests.View image in fullscreenXabi Alonso has to find a way of getting the best out of Alexander-Arnold.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersBut there are also good points for Alexander-Arnold in this. Much has been made of Alonso’s Leverkusen formation. But at its best this was only ever really a starting point, an armature for a controlled fluidity, rotation, drilled overloads.And the fact is that wing-backs/full-backs were key to that success. Alonso drew his flank players into the central rotation. He had dribbling on one side, passing smarts on the other. Perhaps the best early model for Trent in Madrid is as a kind of right-sided Álex Grimaldo, freed up to use his creative passing, to spark the transitions, to move into the centre.It is clearly also a good thing that Mbappé will start on the left. Nobody has been able to make him run backwards. But perhaps Trent can make him go the other way, his excellent diagonal passing into the Mbappé channel an obvious point of interest.Madrid’s new No 12 is very, very good at providing creative direction for speedy players in front of him. Make the midfield work, make those players fit and understand their roles, and there is an opportunity for some pretty decent chemistry here.The only real issue is time. As in: you don’t get any. The same goes for margin for error, forgiveness, latitude, even when the urge to crawl off and hide in someone else’s bathtub is at its most profound. This why even the opening act in Miami feels vital, the first step in a high‑wire act, and a first chance to prove the Trent identity, always a little butterfly-ish, can flourish in that unforgiving heat.Explore more on these topicsTrent Alexander-ArnoldReal MadridClub World Cup 2025Club World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When they closed out the victory, it was the trigger for overwhelming happiness, although Levy said it had to be the foundation for further glories.“We’ve won a European trophy but it’s not enough,” he said. “It’s what we haven’t done that’s more important. We need to win the league. We want to win the Premier League. We want to win the Champions League. We want to win. I have very broad shoulders. Failure is not an option. The desire is to succeed. And because it’s so difficult I want to succeed even more.”“The pressure and the disappointment of not winning over a number of years … I just wanted it so desperately. Not just for me and my family but all the fans around the world. We deserved some luck. That last seven or so minutes was horrific. It felt like hours. So when that final whistle went that was just an amazing experience.”Levy spoke in a video uploaded to the club’s website alongside the new chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, who has come in, as he put it, to take “more of a lead day-to-day on operational matters on and off the pitch”. Spurs are set to confirm the sacking of the chief football officer, Scott Munn. Venkatesham has joined after spending 14 years at Arsenal in a variety of roles – mainly commercial.Levy said: “We’re very proud of our stadium but we need to make sure we win on the pitch. There’s no point having a wonderful stadium if you haven’t got a wonderful team and aren’t winning. The reason we do all these other events [at the stadium] is to provide additional financial resources to the club which, in turn, go back into the team. Everything is about the team. Everything.”View image in fullscreenDaniel Levy sacked Ange Postecoglou despite leading the club to the Europa League trophy.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAVenkatesham said Spurs had analysed “more than 30 candidates” to succeed Postecoglou before spending a lot of time on a shortlist. Frank was “absolutely the No 1” choice of the board. Venkatesham said: “One of the things I’m really excited about is that he is an outstanding developer of young players so I really look forward to seeing what he can do with the squad we have here.”On Postecoglou, Levy said: “I’m very grateful to Ange. I don’t regret appointing Ange. We were over the moon to win a trophy. But we need to compete in all competitions. I’ve got an excellent relationship with him. I told him that he’s always going to be part of our history. Himself and his family are always welcome back. It was a collective decision [to sack him]. Emotionally it was difficult but we believe we’ve made the right decision for the club.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guardiola was asked why he left Grealish off City’s bid to claim the inaugural 32-team cup, which begins against Wydad AC at Philadelphia’s Lincoln Financial Field on Wednesday at midday local time.Club World Cup is key for Guardiola as he plots Manchester City revivalRead more“He had a conversation with the club and [we] decided [what was for] the best,” said Guardiola. “Jack is an exceptional player. The only reason why he didn’t play last season is of course my decision. We decide that he has to play. The club was honest, he was honest. Incredible love and respect [for him] and we decide the best is to stay [behind] and have a place [at home] that he can feel like he can come back to be the player like he was in the year of the treble or all his career in Aston Villa.“Without him it would have been more difficult in the year of the treble [2022-2023]. The fact is in the last two seasons he didn’t play much minutes. He has to come back to play and have the butterflies in his stomach that he can play every three days and show again the quality he has.”Guardiola was asked if this meant away from City. “I don’t know,” the Catalan said. “Now we decide don’t come here and what happens I don’t know in the end. If we don’t find [another solution], he’s a player for Man City and he will be back.”Last season City’s captain,Kyle Walker, left on loan in January. Guardiola hinted this was one reason why he has decided a captaincy pool of Rodri, Ilkay Gundogan, Bernardo Silva and Ruben Dias for the tournament rather than letting the players vote on it as usual.“For the first time in my career I decided it would be my captain – I didn’t like what happened last season,” Guardiola said. “Sometimes I want to be the boss, and this season I decided to do it, so I chose the four captains and at the end of the season, this [Club] World Cup, maybe we will choose one or two more.”He said Erling Haaland will one day be the captain: “He’s so young. But he has to learn what it means to be a captain because he will hopefully be here for many years and sooner or later he will take that position.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My focus is solely on England. They [Arsenal] took me from a really dark place and gave me an opportunity but we achieved incredible things together, so let’s see what happens.”The former Arsenal youth player scored the winning goal when the Lionesses secured their European crown in 2022, and she added the club European title to her CV when Arsenal defeated Barcelona in Lisbon. Kelly said of the Champions League win: “It was an incredible moment for English sport and English women’s sport. It’s made us very excited [for] the Euros now.”“I feel like I’ve grown so much from being at Arsenal. Every day I was learning from a great manager in Renée [Slegers]. I learned so much on the pitch and off the pitch from her. She’s a great person and to come away with a Champions League is incredible. She gave me belief and confidence and I will always be grateful for her.”Kelly was speaking at the national football centre, St George’s Park, on England’s squad media day, two and a half weeks before their Euro 2025 Group D opener against France in Zurich. The Lionesses received positive news on Monday with the return to full training of Lauren James.The Chelsea forward, who sustained a hamstring injury in April, said: “I always had in my head that I was going to make it [to the European Championship]. I never really doubted myself, because I think as soon as you have a doubt in your head, then it’s always negative thoughts. Obviously I didn’t tell people that. I took it day by day.“Lucy [Bronze] and I always kept in touch. She always would say: ‘You’ll be there.’ Then obviously having that support, it always makes you kind of think: ‘Oh, yeah, I’ll be there as well.’I feel good.

Detailed negotiations with the WSL regarding the extra fixtures have yet to take place and it is unclear whether Sky will be asked to pay an additional rights fee for them, although it would be expected to cover production costs.As the contracts have been signed for a 132-game season, the WSL could theoretically put the rights for the extra games out to tender, although given the league’s close relationship with Sky it is unlikely to do so.Sky is offering more football to its subscribers every year, with its live Premier League schedule increasing from 128 to 215 games next season, on top of 1,059 matches from the English Football League and Carabao Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The relegation playoff to decide who falls into the Italian third tier rages on, with Sampdoria – whooriginally had been automatically relegatedfollowing a dismal season – given a late reprieve after Brescia were docked points for financial irregularities. Samp and playoff opponents Salernitana are now slugging it out for survival, which feels a little too accurate in the latter’s case now that the southern side have got aserious case of food poisoningafter a 2-0 first-leg defeat in Genoa on Sunday. Twenty-one of Salernitana’s players and staff have been struck down with illness, a large part requiring hospital treatment upon disembarking from their flight in Salerno. Salernitana have called for an investigation into the “causes of this widespread and serious episode”.“We are truly shocked by what happened and by the series of events that risk jeopardising Salernitana’s smooth and peaceful approach to the final and crucial minutes of the season,” said club suit Maurizio Milan, putting a smooth and peaceful shine on his side’s disastrous first-leg defeat. “Many players and staff, at the moment, are not even able to show up at the sports centre to resume training.” There is no suggestion of foul play or that it was a dodgy lasagne (no,not Kevin) that was to blame, but it does give us an opportunity to revisit the biggest food-poisoning scandal on English soil in recent years:lasagne-gate.Tottenham, shock, were the fall-guys on that occasion as almost the entire squad fell ill on the eve of their last game of the 2005-06 Premier League season at West Ham. Spurs’ depleted and deteriorating squad would lose 2-1 the following day, bitterly handing Big Cup qualification to arch-rivals Arsenal in perhaps the most famous example of St Totteringham’s Day. “While the gaffer [Martin Jol] was giving his team talk before the game, players were being sick in the toilets,” Jermaine Jenas later wrote. Spurs’ players had dined in a private room atthe five-star London Marriott West India Quay Hoteland sat down to a buffet of steak, chicken and pasta prepared by the hotel chef on the advice of the club’s nutritionist. By 5am many were ill with diarrhoea and vomiting, and club officials asked for the police to be called. However, after the hotel’s general manager said no other guests were affected and the kitchens and food preparation areas were given the all-clear, fan forums went into overdrive as to the cause of the food poisoning. “We had 10 players in bed,” sobbed Jol. “Then we asked the Premier League to postpone the kick-off for three hours until six o’clock and that wasn’t possible.”Serie B officials have acted with a little more compassion, granting Salernitana a postponement with Friday’s second leg now moved to Sunday after medical documents were produced by the club and a criminal complaint filed with prosecutors. Sure, Football Daily might have a soft spot for Sampdoria and obviously cannot confirm or deny that we were preparing sandwiches for a flight out of Genoa airport on Sunday, but we would absolutely hate to see another important Italian match influenced by off-pitch matters. Here’s hoping Salernitana’s players and staff make a full recovery.QUOTE OF THE DAY“There was no way to simply buy water. You could go to a beer-only stand but there were no water stands and no extra water stations” – John Celmins is one of a number of fans in Pasadenarecounting their grim experiences of water shortagesat Sunday’s game between PSG and Atlético, which kicked off at midday in brutally sweltering conditions and featured Fifa’s trademark directive on banning bottles with any contents taking precedence over the Rose Bowl’s usual rules.View image in fullscreenAh yes, Fifa.Photograph: Jose Breton/NurPhoto/ShutterstockFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSNice contrast regarding football management IQ inyesterday’s Football Daily. The Copa Gianni had PSG and Atlético kick off on Sunday at noon under the California sun. Meanwhile, six miles away, the Angel City (AKA Immigrant City) match on Saturday sensibly started at 7pm local time. Much better for the players, the supporters, and the game in general, no?” – Mike Wilner.Just a thought about the ongoing debate around the Club World Cup and player welfare. How about – borrowing from the format of Ryder Cup Sunday – every player has to play a certain amount of time (updated for each round)? It would be fascinating to watch each manager use their entire squad rather than rely on their first team, and ensure some rest for all” – Nick Hewat.I’m surprised that ‘Hugh Lloris’ is a goalkeeper for LAFC (yesterday’s News, Bits and Bobs, full email edition).

The Spaniard narrowly kept Hull in the Championship after his appointment last December.Rob Edwards poised for Middlesbrough manager’s job after impressing ownerRead moreWilder is believed to be deeply upset by the decision of COH Sports, the consortium that owns Sheffield United, to end his second spell in charge. He was contracted to 2028 and the delay in announcing his exit appears connected to negotiations over compensation.Despite starting the past season with atwo-point deductionfor financial irregularities, the Blades remained in strong contention for automatic promotion until almost the end beforelosing the playoff final2-1 against Sunderland.Although much of the fanbase appeared in favour of retaining the 57‑year‑old manager, who led the Blades from League One to the Premier League in successive seasons during his first stint, Wilder is understood to have disagreed with the owners’ enthusiasm for a heavily data-driven player recruitment system.COH Sportstook over last Decemberafter buying out Prince Abdullah and by the end of January were so impressed with Wilder they offered him a three-year contract extension.Sellés had brief spells in charge of Southampton and Reading after starting his coaching career in charge of Valencia University’s first XI.Despite a patchy managerial record, Sellés has won plenty of admirers since arriving in England and is noted as a skilled developer of young players.Explore more on these topicsSheffield UnitedHull CitynewsShareReuse this content"

But it wasn’t in a minute.”Organisers have gone out of their way to ensure there will be a heavy sprinkling of stardust in the mixed doubles by moving the event to qualifying week, and have been rewarded with the world No 1s, Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka, as well as grand slam winners such asNovak Djokovicand Iga Swiatek, opting to play.Alcaraz, who has already won five grand slam singles titles, could have had his pick of partners, but said he wanted to play with Raducanu, who won the US Open women’s singles as an 18-year-old qualifier in 2021.“She’s going to be the boss,” he said. “I’ve known Emma for a really long time and I have a really good relationship with her. We will try to win. But obviously it’s going to be really, really fun.”This is the most star-studded mixed doubles grand slam event for decades, with the US Open staging the matches on Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong courts on 19 and 20 August, before even the qualifying draw for the singles takes place.The scoring system has also been changed, with sets being played to four games. There will be a sudden-death deuce and a tie-break at 4-4, with a 10-point tie-break instead of the third set.The final will be the same, but with six-game sets, and thewinners will walk away with $1m(£740,000) – an increase of $800,000 from 2024.Sinner will play with the world No 9, Emma Navarro, while the British men’s No 1, Jack Draper, will partnerthe Olympic women’s singles champion, Zheng Qinwen. Djokovic has agreed to play with his Serbian compatriot Olga Danilovic.Speaking after his 6-3, 6-1 victory over Jenson Brooksby, Draper hinted that playing with Raducanu was never an option–because she had wanted to play with the Spaniard all along.View image in fullscreenJack Draper on his way to his 6-3, 6-1 victory over Jenson Brooksby at Queen’s Club.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA“A wise person once told me you should find the best partner, and that’s what she did in Alcaraz,” Draper said. “I don’t blame her at all for that. I think she will have a lot of fun playing with Carlos.“He’s obviously the best player in the world probably right now, along with Sinner. Great at doubles, as well. Saw that with Rafa [Nadal] at the Olympics. She’s gone about and chose the best partner, for sure. Hopefully they do well.”Draper said that the players backed the US Open’s decision to revamp the mixed doubles event. “I think it’s a good format for the players to get prepared for the US Open, having a shot at playing with another top player. Qinwen I know from the tour. I have seen her around. Obviously a great player herself and has a really good game,” he said.Eight pairs have earned entry based on their combined singles ranking, with the other eight pairs decided by the US Open’s wildcard committee. That has caused controversy among some doubles specialists, but Lew Sherr, the USTennisAssociation’s chief executive, said the new format allowed the world’s best men and women to compete with and against one another.“Seeing the teams that have already put their names on the entry list makes us all incredibly excited,” he said. “It shows that the players are behind what we are trying to do and we know that the fans will love it.”The tennis power coupleStefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosawill also compete together, but the Australia No 1, Alex de Minaur, said he and his British fiancee, Katie Boulter, had not been invited.“We are definitely keen to play if they allow us to do so,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS Open tennisTennisEmma RaducanuCarlos AlcarazJannik SinnerJack DraperNovak DjokovicnewsShareReuse this content"

De Minaur lacked sharpness in his first round match at the London ATP 500 event and Jiri Lehecka, a rising Czech with a big serve, took full advantage.The world No 30’s average serve, at 211kph, was the same as de Minaur’s fastest and he never looked in danger of dropping it as he won 6-4 6-2.But there was a much better outing for Alexei Popyrin, who has the tools and form to spring a surprise at the London grand slam, and enjoyed a very useful workout in beating compatriot Aleksandar Vukic in three tight sets.De Minaur made uncharacteristic errors on his forehand and his first serve percentage was below 60%.Lehecka had not played on grass for nearly two years, having missed the entirety of the 2024 grasscourt season with a back injury, but looked far more comfortable than de Minaur – a Queen’s finalist in 2023 and Wimbledon quarter-finalist last year – who won three of the last 15 points.“I understand [the need], the schedule is brutal, but it’s not the best time to take a break, between two slams,” said British former Australian Open finalist John Lloyd on the BBC. “You can see he’s flat. He needs matches, but he won’t get them if he plays like that.”De Minaur had not planned to play in either of the final warmups next week – Eastbourne on England’s south coast and Mallorca in Spain -– but may now rethink.Asked how he was feeling, he said: “Good question. I’m not too sure. Obviously [that] wasn’t the kind of result I was hoping for coming here to Queen’s.Katie Boulter reveals online abuse sent to her and other tennis playersRead more“So back to the drawing board, and we’re going to have to make some decisions.”De Minaur had told AAP at the weekend, “there might be a little bit of a difference or a conversation to be had if Queen’s doesn’t go well.”But he added: “I’ve got to start having a more of a mentality of a big player and start backing myself to not have to play so many tournaments, back myself to do well in those big tournaments.”There was also a shock main court appearance for Adam Walton, who was suddenly called up to face world No 2 Carlos Alcaraz as a lucky loser. That was because Alejandro Davidovich Fokina – who had come to England after getting married in Marbella, Spain, at the weekend – had withdrawn with illness.Walton, ranked 86, lost 6-4 7-6 (7-4) but acquitted himself well in his main draw Queen’s debut under a blazing sun on Andy Murray Arena.Explore more on these topicsTennisAlex de MinaurAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

If there is a better performance over a mile by a three‑year-old later on in the season, it feels long odds‑on that Field Of Gold will be the horse to produce it.John and Thady Gosden’s grey colt was one of three Classic winners in the field, though his winning performance was further evidence that, had Ruling Court not been allowed first run in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, the fast-finishing Field Of Gold would surely have taken that too. Ruling Court was only third here, nearly four lengths behind Henri Matisse, the French 2,000 Guineas winner, who was in turn three and a half adrift of Field Of Gold at the line.Royal Ascot 2025 day one updates: news, previews and more – liveRead moreKieran Shoemark shouldered the blame for Field Of Gold’s defeat at Newmarket and Colin Keane, newly appointed as the Juddmonte operation’s retained rider in Europe, enjoyed one of the smoothest rides of his career in his saddle on Tuesday.“Good horses make it look easy,” Keane said. “I don’t know when was the last time three Guineas winners clashed, but Field Of Gold was very good at the Curragh and very good again today. If anything, the leaders probably didn’t bring us far enough and we got there plenty soon, but he’s tough and genuine. I am fortunate enough to be riding him and, at this moment, he is the best horse I have sat on.”Gosden said afterwards that if Field Of Gold had not run in the Irish Guineas, a step up in trip in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown next month would have been a possibility, but his winner is more likely to wait for the Sussex Stakes, over a mile at Glorious Goodwood, for which he was cut to even-money favourite from around 4-1.“This year, he has been exemplary in everything he has done,” Gosden said. “He is a pleasure to train because he’s a pretty laid‑back character, which is very useful. It was never the plan to go to Ireland, it became the plan [after his defeat at Newmarket], so he’s had a trial, two Guineas and this. It’s a lot of racing and we’re not even beginning to be halfway through the season.“When they win like that, they make it look easy, but they are taking a lot out of themselves, so I wouldn’t want to be seen as someone trying to run him back in the Eclipse quick off this.”Royal Ascot stages three of its eight Group One races on the opening afternoon and, while the Juddmonte colours prevailed in the feature event, two trainers from outside the small group of powerhouse bloodstock operations celebrated landmark wins earlier in the day.View image in fullscreenDocklands, ridden by Mark Zahra (nearside), just beats Rosallion to win the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHarry Eustace’s Docklands, at 14-1, edged out the 5-2 favourite, Rosallion, by a nose in the opening Queen Anne Stakes, while American Affair, from Jim Goldie’s stable 20 miles south‑west of Glasgow, had a neck to spare over Frost At Dawn in the King Charles III Stakes. For both trainers, it was the first Group One success of their career.“I have lost my voice,” Eustace said after his win with Docklands, who was winning for the first time since taking the Britannia Handicap at this meeting in 2023. “That was pretty sweet. He has been an absolute legend for us and if ever there was a track where you’d want a horse that’s a specialist, it’s here because it’s the best racing.”American Affair’s latest win before Tuesday’s Group One success was in a handicap at York’s Dante meeting in May off a mark of 98. “I have trained the family for three generations, so it’s very sweet,” Goldie, who saddled his first runners in 1995, said.“I was quite confident he could do it today. He has the talent. I knew he was probably one of the fastest horses in the race, but it’s how you control that. We’ve come down a day early, got him relaxed and it all fell into place. It means a lot.”Hopes for a winner in the Royal colours were dashed later in the day as Willie Mullins’s Reaching High, the 11-4 favourite, finished ninth behind Henry de Bromhead’s Ascending (20‑1) in the Ascot Stakes Handicap after a tricky passage in the straight.The scarlet and purple silks will be on a likely favourite again on Wednesday when Rainbow’s Edge, a lightly raced four-year-old filly, goes to post for the Kensington Palace Stakes at 5.35pm.See The Fire a red-hot fancyJeff Smith, the owner of See The Fire, paid a £70,000 supplementary fee to get her into the Prince Of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot on Wednesday, and it can prove to be money well spent when his four-year-old filly goes to post for the feature event on day two of the meeting.See The Fire is a daughter of Arabian Queen, who won York’s International Stakes at 50-1 in Smith’s colours back in 2015, and showed glimpses of top-level ability in the autumn of her three-year-old season.She has looked much-improved with another winter behind her, however, and travelled like the best horse in the Gordon Richards Stakes at Sandown in April before lack of a run started to tell in the closing stages.See The Fire(4.20)then stepped up significantly for the outing in the Middleton Stakes at York, where she powered a remarkable 12 lengths clear of her field and stopped the clock in a time that backed up the visual impression of the form.A 3lb sex allowance from the market leaders, Los Angeles and Anmaat, is another plus and she is an attractive bet at around 5-1 to underline her improvement with a first Group One success on Wednesday.Royal Ascot 2.30A huge field of lightly-raced juvenile fillies includes seven unbeaten runners and 13 that won last time out, but Karl Burke’s Zelaina has dominated the market since running away with a Nottingham maiden earlier this month. She achieved no more or less than several rivals, however, and while American-trained challenger Lennilu is an obvious danger, the 12-1 on offer forStayacatches the eye too. George Scott’s filly travelled extremely well and then quickened impressively to win at Yarmouth first time up in a strong time.Royal Ascot 3.05This mile-and-three-quarter trip is at least two furlongs more than most of these three-year-olds have tried as yet, so plenty can be expected to progress for the experience and Francis-Henri Graffard’sAsmaranicould take the biggest step forward.

In her post-match press conference in Paris, Sabalenka had suggested that the result was more due to her own errors than to Gauff’s performance.“I think she won the match not because she played incredible,”Sabalenka said at the time. “Just because I made all of those mistakes, if you look from the outside, from kind of easy balls.”Stars align as Raducanu to pair with Alcaraz in mixed doubles at US OpenRead moreHowever, Sabalenka now says she regrets those remarks. “That was just completely unprofessional of me,” Sabalenka told Eurosport Germany. “I let my emotions get the better of me. I absolutely regret what I said back then. You know, we all make mistakes. I’m just a human being who’s still learning in life. I think we all have those days when we lose control. But what I also want to say is that I wrote to Coco afterward – not immediately, but recently.”Sabalenka hit 37 winners but finished the final with 70 unforced errors. Gauff had 30 winners and 30 unforced errors. The Belarusian, the world No 1, said she wrote to Gauff to apologise and “make sure she knew she absolutely deserved to win the tournament and that I respect her”.“I never intended to attack her,” Sabalanka added. “I was super-emotional and not very smart at that press conference. I’m not necessarily grateful for what I did. It took me a while to go back and think about it, to approach it with open eyes, and to understand. I realised a lot about myself. Why did I lose so many finals?”Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, also lost to Gauff inthe 2023 US Open final, where she also won the first set. “I kept getting so emotional,” Sabalenka said. “So I learned a lot. Above all, one thing: I’m the one who always treats my opponents with great respect, whether I win or lose. Without that respect, I wouldn’t be where I am today. So it was a tough but very valuable lesson for me.”Explore more on these topicsAryna SabalenkaCoco GauffFrench Open 2025French OpenUS sportsTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The university’s athletics department, a statewide source of pride that includes 36 varsity sports teams (from pistol shooting tocollege football’s reigning national champion), rivals some Fortune 500 companies for scale. In 2024 Ohio State spent $292.8m on its sports programs, more than every school in thewell-heeled Big Ten conferenceand every college in the country besides the University of Texas, while hoovering in more than $1.2bn in revenue over the past seven years. The Ohio State brand – flaunted through scarlet red block-O logos and buckeye tree iconography – is so synonymous with flush times inside and outside the lines that even now few really associate the university with one of most shocking and widespread sex abuse scandals in US history.‘Incredibly disturbing’: docuseries goes inside jaw-dropping LA mortuary scandalRead moreEva Orner – the Australian documentary director behind Netflix’s Bikram and the Oscar-winning Taxi to the Dark Side – got an up-close view years ago on her first flight from Los Angeles to Columbus, home of the Buckeyes and theOhioState campus. “We stopped somewhere,” she recalls. “There wasn’t a direct flight, and it was a game day weekend. When I got on to the connecting flight, everyone was in Buckeyes paraphernalia. I walked around the city, and everything was Buckeyes. I went to the game and watched the tailgating. It’s like a fever or a cult. It’s an incredible thing and a positive thing – but then when a story like this comes out, it can be very challenging.”Her latest documentary, Surviving Ohio State – which premiered at Tribeca and releases on HBO – unpicks one of the most overlooked scandals in sports: It trains a harsh, unflinching light on Richard Strauss, the once-respected physician who abused at least 177 male students while working in Ohio State’s athletics department and student health center from 1978 to 1998. According to Ohio State’s own campus crime data released in 2021, the school logged more than 2,800 instances of alleged sexual misconduct by Strauss – including more than 170 total allegations of rape. Many of the survivors were violated during routine checkups in a pattern of abuse that spanned at least 15 sports – from football to fencing. (Male student-athletes nicknamed Strauss “Jellypaws” and would warn one another to “watch your nuts” before exams.) An independent investigation concluded the university had been aware of complaints about Strauss’s conduct as early as 1979 – when the women’s fencing coach raised the issue. But the university didn’t take meaningful action against the doctor until 1996; that year, Strauss was finally suspended from clinical duties, but remained a tenured faculty member until his retirement in 1998 – at which point he wasstillgiven emeritus status.That would seem to make Strauss an even bigger scourge than Larry Nassar – the former Michigan State University and US women’s gymnastics team physician servinga de facto life sentencefor sexually assaulting at least 265 young women and girls under his treatment from 1996 to 2014. But where Rachael Denhollander, Maggie Nichols and the other elite gymnasts who blew the whistle on Nassar were celebrated as heroes, the men who came forward with their allegations against Strauss were greeted with skepticism and ridicule. “I don’t think we’re used to seeing men come out publicly about abuse,” says Orner, who spent 31/2-years on the documentary – or more than twice the time she typically dedicates to her projects. “When the OSU survivors came out, they were challenged by the university legally. It’s been going on for seven years. That’s had devastating effects on them all.”Orner’s film puts viewers in front of those survivors and challenges them to maintain their cynicism after hearing their experiences in explicit detail. Most prominent are Buckeyes such as Mike DiSabato (the Strauss whistleblower) and Mark Coleman (a former college champion turned mixed martial arts star) who fueled the success of Ohio State’s wrestling program and were held up as exemplars of a particular strain of flinty, midwestern toughness. Al Novakowski, a standout hockey player who left his native Canada to play for the Buckeyes, tells a horrifying story about one Strauss assault in which he alleges the doctor drugged and raped him after he went to see him about a muscle spasm. “I kept thinking, Who am I gonna tell?” he recalled. It’s one of many scenes that hammers home the disparity between Strauss – a former Navy officer who edited medical journals and issued early warnings about the dangers of steroid use – and the tough-guy students, who could lose their scholarship if he failed them on their physicals. Says Coleman: “We were powerless.”View image in fullscreenDan Ritchie in Surviving Ohio State.Photograph: HBOStrauss’s death by suicide in 2005, before the allegations against him came to light, robbed his survivors of their day in court. (“Most of the survivors didn’t know he had killed himself until 2018,” Orner says.) But that’s not to say there still isn’t guilt to go around. Russ Hellickson, the Buckeyes hall of fame wrestling coach, has conspicuously not supported his former students even as they allege he knew about Strauss’s perversions and didn’t stop them. The coach didn’t even object to the doctor having a locker in his team’s sacred space or showering next to his athletes. “What you’ll come to learn,” former Buckeyes wrestler Dan Ritchie says in the film, “is that this isn’t just happening with the wrestlers…”Significantly, Hellickson’s lead assistant during much of Strauss’s tenure was Jim Jordan – the two-time NCAA wrestling champion turned Freedom Caucus congressman and Donald Trump bootlick. While Jordan would register his share of on-the-record denials at the time, a number of former wrestlers say in the film that Jordan reached out to them privately and pushed them to change their stories in hopes of making the scandal, and the growing scrutiny onhim, go away.The story bookends a shocking testimonial from Frederick Feeney, a respected wrestling referee who alleges that Strauss pleasured himself as the ref was showering after officiating a meet decades ago. “The next thing I know, I’m feeling his hand on my butt,” Feeney says to camera, choking back the emotion. “It affected me so bad that I didn’t even respond to him, when I should’ve knocked him on his ass at that point. But I didn’t. As I’m walking out [of the locker room], Russ Hellickson and Jim Jordan were both standing there. I looked at both of them and said, Strauss was in there masturbating beside me in the shower. Jim Jordan looked at me straight in my face and said, ‘It’s Strauss. You know what he does.’”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: HBOBut where Michigan State went above and beyond most institutions while taking responsibility for the Nassar affair, agreeing to an historic $500m settlement that notably doesn’t further silence survivors under NDAs, Ohio State has only paid $60m and refused to own any legal liability. All the while the university, despite issuing a formal apology and revoking Strauss’s emeritus status, continues to reject the implication – derived from the independent investigation that it called for and funded – that it covered up Strauss’s misconduct. Strauss’s son releasing a statement on behalf of his familyendorsing the independent investigationonly makes the school look worse in the final analysis. “I had one off-the-record conversation with his son that I’m not allowed to disclose,” says Orner, the rare journalist who has spoken with the Strauss family. “And I think it’s OK to say that this was a complete shock to them when [the news] came out.”Given that this is thefourthsex abuse case to break out at a Big Ten school in the past 14 years, you have to wonder how many more college sports colossuses are sitting on similar scandals – or if there could ever be a case extreme enough to promptanyintervention from the NCAA, which I understand is charged with (checks notes)regulating college athletics. Ultimately, the film, affecting as it is, only gives Ohio State survivors an outlet to release their emotional trauma, raise awareness and remind the world how strong they always were.“It’s a lot of responsibility,” Orner says, recalling the anxiety she felt while screening the film for them for the first time at Tribeca. “There were a lot of tears, but it turned out to be a really cathartic thing for them, where they were sort of transformed after the screening and felt really proud and banded together as brothers.” It would be a nice ending if Ohio State didn’t still owe them and the remaining Strauss survivors a just one.Surviving Ohio State premieres on HBO on 17 June with UK and Australia dates to be announcedExplore more on these topicsDocumentarySexual abuse in sportOhioCollege footballCollege sportsFactual TVTelevisionUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it doesn’t resonate with young sports fans in the United States the way it once did.Fans of a sport – particularly, team sports - develop lifelong allegiances at an early age and often pass it on to their children. There was a time when fathers and sons in America sat down in front of a television set together and watched Gillette Friday Night Fightsor boxing on weekend afternoons. Now, if they sit down together at all, they watch football.Boxing’s proponents point to statistics that showthe average boxing fan in the United States is youngerthan the average fan of many other sports (including football and baseball). But they’re talking about fish in a much smaller pond. There are far fewer young boxing fans in America than there are young fans of any major sport. That means there are fewer young boxing fans who will grow up to be old ones, and pass down their passion to the next generation.Boxing, perhaps more than any other sport, cherishes and relies on its history to build a following. Young people today care less about the history of sports than earlier generations did. Boxing fans in America talk more about fights from years ago than about fights today. The sport’s most recognizable figures are old – Mike Tyson, Don King, Michael Buffer and, until recently,George Foreman.The nature of boxing also makes it difficult to build a young following. Children often become fans of a sport because they play it from an early age. They play baseball in the park, football in the street, and basketball in the schoolyard. Tennis and golf are more exclusive, but many children find a way to play them. Kids might get into an occasional fight. But virtually none of them box.Added to this, boxing is largely inaccessible to young fans as an in-person spectator sport. Adolescents root for their school teams. Going to a high school football or basketball game accentuates the feeling that they’re part of a group. There are no high school boxing teams. Very few young people have the opportunity to actually go to a fight.The powers that be in boxing have exacerbated these conditions by adopting an economic model that cuts off the sport’s flagship events and most popular fighters from potential fans. The NFL, NBA, and Major League Baseball prioritize reaching a large audience in their television and streaming deals. But there’s no easy access to big-time boxing in the United States today without paying for it. And young people don’t expect to pay – let alone, pay a lot - for online content.Equally troubling, the multitude of world sanctioning bodies and “championship” belts of dubious provenance means that young people (and older fans too) don’t know who the real champions are.And championships are important. Other sports culminate in the Super Bowl, World Series, NBA finals, Stanley Cup, Olympics, World Cup, US Open, NCAA tournaments, and other events that fire the imagination and produce legitimate champions.Too many of today’s boxing “champions” have been maneuvered to their titles by the payment of sanctioning fees and mismatches against weak opponents. The Los Angeles Lakers couldn’t go to NBA commissioner Adam Silver this year and say, “We just lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the play-offs. But LeBron James is a big name and we’ll pay you X amount of money if you sanction us to play against the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA finals.”Young people are particularly susceptible to suggestion. They can be coaxed into buying a lot of things through clever marketing. But they don’t buy sports that bore them. And too many of today’s fights – let’s be honest – are boring mismatches. College football fans tolerate Alabama v Louisiana-Monroe as the second game of the season because they know that, later in the year, the Crimson Tide will play Georgia, LSU, and Oklahoma. If 90% of college football games were on a par with Alabama v Louisiana-Monroe, college football would be far less popular than it is today.An unfair decision at the end of a fight sours viewers and makes watching the event a less satisfactory experience than would otherwise be the case. Incompetent and, in some instances, corrupt judging alienates boxing fans of all ages.Then there’s the difficulty of actually watching the fights. Today’s flagship bouts generally aren’t contested until close to midnight on the East Coast. Can you imagine an NFL game starting at midnight eastern time and costing $89.99 to watch? I didn’t think so.The facts speak for themselves. HBO, Showtime, and the four major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX) all played a significant role in boxing. Now they’ve all walked away from the sport.Former Showtime Sports president Stephen Espinoza says that boxing has traditional strength in Black and Latino households (which skew younger than the overall sports audience) and that, in recent years, boxing has seen a rise in the young white demographic. But these inroads with a new generation, Espinoza notes, “seem to be a function of influencer boxing with Jake Paul leading the charge.”An influencer like Paul standing out is unsurprising, and says a lot about boxing’s limited appeal. Young people understand who the great athletes are in other sports. Ask kids to name an active professional boxer today and they’re more likely to name Jake Paul thanTerence Crawford.That said; traditional promoters have reservations about fights involving Paul and his influencer brethren. Eddie Hearn jumpstarted social-media-influencer boxing in the United States in 2019 when he promoted Logan Paul v KSI on Dazn.“I made money but I hated it,” Hearn says, looking back on that venture. “The build-up was great. The numbers were great. But the product wasn’t.”Hearn also notes that college sports have a tiny audience in the UK but siphon off a huge amount of fan allegiance among young people in the United States, some of which would otherwise be devoted to boxing.Meanwhile, Frank Warren points a finger at American promoters and maintains, “We have a great young audience for boxing in the UK. That’s because we promote fighters in their home areas. We build their fan base among their contemporaries in pubs and wherever else they might be, and it spreads from there. It’s called promotion. When you do four-wall deals [events where the promoter moves into a venue but leaves the promoting largely to others] the way they’re done in America, people stop promoting.”View image in fullscreenAustralian heavyweight prospect Teremoana Samson Junior Leon Teremoana has a star quality that will never go out of style.Photograph: Adam Hunger/Getty ImagesMost pre-fight promotion for big fights in the United States is cookie-cutter and boring. There’s a formulaic kick-off press conference. Then the fighters disappear except for (maybe) a media workout and some tepid media releases from training camp. Fight week arrives. A “grand arrival” (which isn’t very grand) is followed by a formulaic final pre-press conference and phony weigh-in (the real weigh-in having been conducted hours earlier behind closed doors).The best way to reach young people is through the internet. A handful of individual fighters have capitalized on social media. And promoters like Matchroom, Queensberry, and Top Rank maintain an active social media presence. But there have been no effective social media campaigns on behalf of boxing as a whole because no one is looking out for the overall good of the sport in the way that the central governing authorities in other sports do.“There’s no cohesive strategy, no central organization coordinating the demographic information and outreach,” Espinoza says. “To do that, you’d need the major promoters to turn over their information to one entity, and that’s unlikely to happen.”And just because boxing is moving to streaming doesn’t mean that it will reach the youth market. When PBC signed its deal with Amazon in late-2023, the reaction was, “This will be big!” But there hasn’t been much of a marketing push from Amazon, and PBC’s fights have attracted a disappointingly small audience.But for all the sport’s flaws, walking into an arena on fight night and seeing a boxing ring illuminated beneath bright shining lights is akin to entering a magical kingdom. That’s what Reece Chapman, a 16-year-old from Helena, Montana, saw when he entered the Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night for Matchroom’s fight cardheadlined by Richardson Hitchens v George Kambosos.Montana isn’t known for boxing. The only fight of note to occur there took place more than a century ago (on 4 July 1923) when Jack Dempsey decisioned Tommy Gibbons in Shelby. The event was a financial disaster. Four local banks that backed the venture were forced into bankruptcy.Only two professional fight cards were contested in Montana in 2024, two in 2023, one in 2022, and none so far this year. Fights in Montana are regulated by the neighboring Wyoming Combat Sports Commission.Reece, then 13 years old, went to his first fight when Top Rank promoted an eight-bout card at the Hulu Theater on 30 October 2022. A word of disclosure here. I’m his great-uncle. I brought him. He was into the scene. (“It’s really cool; how fast the fighters’ hands are; how focused they are; the way they move around the ring”). And enthralled as the night wore on (“I’ve never seen anything like this … This is really really cool … Wow! Wow! Wow!”).This past week, Reece was in New York and had a more immersive boxing experience. With the help of Anthony Leaver (Matchroom’s head of US media), he was credentialed to attend fight week activities for the Hitchens-Kambosos card and the fights themselves.Reece watches Top Rank boxing on ESPN with his father. But Top Rank’s contract with the cable giant ends next month and won’t be renewed. There are a few active fighters who Reece knows of and likes. But not many. He can tell you who plays quarterback for his favorite college and pro football teams but came up short on naming Oleksandr Usyk as heavyweight champion of the world. His classmates in school are far more focused on MMA than boxing; in large part because of UFC’s social media outreach. Last year’s encounter betweenMike Tysonand Jake Paul was the first boxing match that his contemporaries were excited about. Reece watched it on Netflix and thought it was “stupid” but that the Katie Taylor v Armanda Serrano co-feature was “great.”On Thursday, Reece attended the final pre-fight press conference at Madison Square Garden and gave it a mixed review. He liked the glimpse it gave him of each fighter’s personality and particularly liked Australian heavyweight prospect Teremoana Samson Junior Leon Teremoana. Then Hitchens and Kambosos got into an ugly shoving match with the usual profanities. That struck Reece as (here’s that word again) “stupid”.Reece also attended the Friday weigh-in and arrived at MSG on fight night with a sense of anticipation.In terms of outcome, the fights went as expected. The fighters in the red corner were all (to use one of Hearn’s favorite words) “massive” underdogs. The favorite didn’t just win every fight. The favorite won every round.Reece was captivated by David Diamante, who has become part of Matchroom’s branding and (no disrespect to Michael Buffer) is his favorite ring announcer. He also noted, “Being at the fights makes me understand how hard the fighters hit and how much skill is involved.”The most impressive performances of the evening were turned in by Andy Cruz and Richardson Hitchens. But Teremoana, who fought in the fourth bout of the evening, was the fighter who most captured Reece’s attention.Teremoana is a former Olympian, 6ft 6in, 265lb, articulate, friendly, and charismatic. Reece had sat in on an interview with him after the Friday weigh-in and asked several questions. At the end of the interview, they posed for a photo together. Now Teremoana was facing 9-and-0 Aleem Whitfield, who looked grossly out-of-shape but can punch a bit.Matchroom had spent generously to build a giant video screen and runway to showcase the fighters’ ring entrances. The energy level in the arena picked up considerably when Teremoana danced his way to the ring, turning an often-banal ritual into a joyous celebratory occasion. He lit up the room. The crowd (which minutes earlier hadn’t known who he was) liked him.When the bell for round one rang, Reece leaned forward with heightened anticipation. This wasn’t television, which cosmetizes the violence of a prizefight. He could see the emotions on each fighter’s face and hear punches as they landed.“I’m nervous,” he said. “I feel like I’m watching a friend.”Not to worry.Teremoana kept Whitfield at bay with his jab and backed him into a corner. Then … WHACK!!!The damage started with a Teremoana left hook that landed flush up top. The battering that followed was reminiscent of Gerry Cooney hammering a defenseless Ken Norton at Madison Square Garden four decades ago. Referee David Fields halted the carnage as a barely-conscious Whitfield slid to the canvas two minutes 28 seconds into the first round.Teremoana has star quality. And he canpunch. What happens when he has to walk through the proverbial fire in a fight? When someone takes him into deep water, will he be able to swim? And how is his chin? It will be worth watching him again to find out. When fans go to the fights, they hope to take away at least one “Wow!” moment. Teremoana was a “Wow!” moment.What most attracts young sports fans? Stars.Heavyweights with personality who can punch are a magnetic attraction. If Teremoana proves to be good enough in the ring, he’s the type of fighter boxing could build a young fan base around.Explore more on these topicsBoxingMike TysonTerence CrawfordGeorge ForemanUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Oklahoma City led by as many as 18 late in the second quarter and carried a 59–45 advantage into half-time. But as they’ve done all postseason, the Pacers clawed back. Indiana, who have come back from double-digit deficits to win five times during their charmed playoff run, outscored the Thunder 34–28 in the third behind a surge from backup point guard TJ McConnell.McConnell scored 13 of his 18 points in just under seven minutes of the third period, helping the Pacers cut the deficit to five. Early in the fourth, Pascal Siakam, who finished with 28 points on 9-of-15 shooting, hit a pair of free throws to bring Indiana within four. A minute later, his three-pointer made it 95–93.But Oklahoma City responded with championship mettle. Gilgeous-Alexander drew contact to get to the line and knocked down key free throws, while Williams drilled a three and a mid-range jumper to extend the lead. Cason Wallace and Aaron Wiggins also contributed timely buckets off the bench. The Thunder outscored Indiana 25–14 over the next seven minutes to put the game out of reach.View image in fullscreenPacers guard Tyrese Haliburton drives past Thunder guard Luguentz Dort on Monday night during the second half of Game 5 of the NBA finals in Oklahoma City.Photograph: Kyle Phillips/APOklahoma City finished with 14 made threes and connected on over 43% of their attempts from beyond the arc while committing just 11 turnovers. Their defense forced 23 Pacers giveaways leading to 32 points, limiting Indiana to just 11-of-30 from deep.“That’s a really good team over there,” Williams said of the Pacers. “You just don’t trip into the finals.”Indiana’s hopes took a devastating hit in the form ofstar point guard Tyrese Haliburton, who appeared to aggravate a lingering lower leg injury in the first quarter. He briefly exited and returned with his calf wrapped, but was largely a non-factor offensively. He finished with four points, all on free throws, while missing all six of his shot attempts. It was the first time in his playoff career he was held scoreless in a half.Haliburton added seven rebounds and six assists in 34 minutes, but the Pacers never quite looked the same with their floor general hobbled. The Thunder defense, led by Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort and Isaiah Hartenstein, clamped down and turned missed shots into transition opportunities. Oklahoma City scored 17 fast-break points to Indiana’s 13.“It’s the finals,” Haliburton said after the game. “I’ve worked my whole life to be here and I want to be out there to compete, help my teammates any way I can. I was not great tonight by any means, but it’s not really a thought of mine to not play here. If I can walk, then I want to play.”Indiana have now lost back-to-back games for the first time since mid-March. It also marks the first time in these playoffs that the Pacers have trailed in a series, having defeated Milwaukee, Cleveland and New York without ever falling behind.The historical odds now favor Oklahoma City, whose first and only NBA title came in 1979, when the team was based in Seattle and known as the Supersonics.

It only confirmed the breach months after the infiltration started and once an employee saw the stolen data advertised for sale on the social media platform Reddit, according to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office – which levied the fine.The information commissioner, John Edwards, called the months-long incident across the summer of 2023 a “profoundly damaging breach”. The compromise of UK data was just a fraction of the wider losses, with the data of7 millionpeople affected.23andMe charges users £89 to have their DNA screened using a saliva-based kit, allowing them to discover where their distant ancestors came from in terms of their ethnicity and location. But many customers asked for their DNA data to be deleted from the company’s archives after the hack and it filed for bankruptcy protection in the US in March.The fine came as a $305m bid to buy the company led by its former chief executive, Anne Wojcicki,looked poisedto retake control of the company in a bankruptcy auction.Edwards said the data breach “exposed sensitive personal information, family histories and even health conditions of thousands of people in the UK”.“As one of those impacted told us: once this information is out there, it cannot be changed or reissued like a password or credit card number,” he said.23andMe failed to take basic steps to protect the information and their security systems were inadequate, the UK data protection regulator found. The breaches included failing to install tougher user authentication.The hacker exploited a common weakness caused by users reusing passwords that had already been stolen in other unrelated data breaches. Hackers then used automated tools to try these passwords in a tactic called “credential stuffing”.“The warning signs were there, and the company was slow to respond,” said Edwards, who carried out the investigation jointly with the privacy commissioner of Canada. “This left people’s most sensitive data vulnerable to exploitation and harm.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They said that as part of the deal to acquire 23andMe, Wojcicki’s non-profit, the TTAM Research Institute, has made “binding commitments to enhance protections for customer data and privacy, including allowing individuals to delete their account and opt out of research at any time” and “agreeing not to sell or transfer genetic data under a subsequent bankruptcy or change of control”, and offering customers two years of free identity theft monitoring.The fine is among several multimillion pound punishments meted out by the ICO in recent years for failure to protect data from hacks and ransomware attacks. In 2022, itfinedthe construction company Interserve £4.4m when staff data was compromised, including contact details, bank accounts, sexual orientation and health.In March this year itfinedan NHS IT supplier, Advanced Computer Software Group, nearly £3.1m for security failings that put the personal information of nearly 80,000 people at risk.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyGeneticsTechnology sectorPrivacyCybercrimenewsShareReuse this content"

He made good on that promise last week with a $15bn “AI superintelligence” team that would feature reported nine-figure salaries and a 49% investment in Scale AI. Meta also hired Scale’s 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, a former roommate of OpenAI’s Sam Altman.Before Meta’s investment, Scale counted most of the major players in AI among its clients, and some of them were less than thrilled with the development.Bloombergputs it succinctly: Scale AI’s Wang Brings to Meta Knowledge of What Everyone Else is Doing. Google, Scale’s largest customer, got scared. The tech giant told the startup that their working relationship would end in response to the deal,Reutersreported on Friday.My colleague Robert Booth has more:One Silicon Valley analyst described the announcement as the action of “a wartime CEO”.Superintelligence is described as a type of AI that can perform better than humans at all tasks. Currently AI cannot reach the same level as humans in all tasks, a state known as artificial general intelligence (AGI).Meta’s attempt to leapfrog the current state of progress and target superintelligence is seen by observers as an attempt by the company to regain the initiative over AI after significant advances by competitors including Sam Altman’s OpenAI and Google and after Meta’s huge investment in the concept of the Metaverse flopped.The financial magnitude of the move may seem like taking command of the AI race, but Meta is playing catchup. Its most recent AI models are less capable than those of rivals. In April, the company published a model designed with featurestailored to gaming a popular benchmark, a desperate move. With its mammoth investment and the formation of a new team, particularly one helmed by a key industry player, the tech giant is buying its way in.Read more about Meta’s superintelligence teamhere.The week in AI newsRevealed: Thousands of UK university students caught cheating using AIDisney and Universal sue AI image creator Midjourney, alleging copyright infringementHey AI! Can ChatGPT help you to manage your money?Researchers create AI-based tool that restores age-damaged artworks in hoursKeir Starmer says technology can create a ‘better future’ as he addresses AI fearsWikipedia, vital to AI, takes pains to highlight human contributionsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Blake MontgomeryLast week,Wikipediahalted a test of a new AI-powered article summarizer in response to a backlash from its editors, the volunteers who contribute new information to the online encyclopedia’s articles and evaluate the quality of others’ additions. The site had introduced summaries of articles, generated by artificial intelligence, that would appear at the top of those pages above the introduction to the subject, written by humans. The test ran for two weeks for about 10% users of the mobile version of Wikipedia who opted into it.The feedback was, in the words of Wikipedia’s nonprofit parent, “strongly negative”. One editor wrote in thepublic forum: “A truly ghastly idea.” Another: “Keep AI out of Wikipedia.” And: “I am going to join the chorus of editors saying that this is a uniquely bad idea.” Some argued in favor of the introduction of summaries by AI, making the point that technical articles on Wikipedia prioritize depth and complexity over accessibility. Most, though, argued that any hallucinations and mistakes would degrade Wikipedia’s reputation of reliability.The general sentiment among editors read thusly: “Yuck”.“We’re trying to figure out the balance between AI and Wikipedia. There are AI integrations that do happen on Wikipedia but are very minimal. Little things that make it easier for editors to do their work or readers to get the content they need,” said Pacita Rudder, executive director of Wikimedia New York City, a local chapter affiliated with the foundation. “‘Where’s the line between human output and robotic output?’ is a debate that’s constantly happening within the Wikipedia community. There are some people who are for it, some against it, but as with anything with Wikipedia, we have to come to a consensus.”Contrast Wikipedia’s deferential response with Reddit’s. The social network began charging for access to its application programming interface in 2023. Reddit’s library of posts is extremely valuable to AI companies, which need enormous collections of text written by contemporary human beings to train large language models like ChatGPT. Reddit execs intended to extract money from AI companies using the company’s library. They succeeded. They also rendered many users’ experiences worse by crippling popular extensions. In response, users, particularly forums’ volunteer moderators, revolted en masse, blacking out forums with tens of millions of members and demanding reversion. Executives refused. They chose dollars from AI companies over their users’ concerns, the opposite of Wikipedia. A coda to the story, though: two years later, Reddit largely functions as before.Several days after Wikipedia rolled back its AI test, the Wikimedia Foundation hosted an in-person “edit-a-thon” at the United Nations, an event dedicated to creating and updating pages about the history of the international body, complete with a work list. The conclave of information custodians – a 50/50 balance of new and experienced editors, according to Rudder – was part of the UN’s Open Source Week and occurred alongside an open source hackathon. It was in-person only.The edit-a-thon stands in contrast to the stereotypical tableau of curating Wikipedia articles: a single person online, communicating sterilely with others via a glaring white screen. At the event, though, editors convened in groups of five around a single laptop to converse excitedly and collaborate in as many languages throughout a large, buzzing auditorium. Italian and Sri Lankan envoys lionized the work of the editors in speeches, as well as the open source community at large. An executive from the Wikimedia Foundation thanked them for their work, as did the UN under-secretary-general for digital and emerging technologies. It was an energetic scene.Asked why she felt it was important to host an in-person-only event, Rudder said: “It’s community, right? There’s this misconception that a lot of Wikipedia editors are alone in their basements, typing away, but that’s not the case,” said Rudder. Wikimedia NYC hosted the event at the UN. Rudder said the chapter’s role is to bring editors and members of the online community together. She said she felt most energized by meeting new editors.As with Reddit, Wikipedia’s huge text corpus is part of the foundational training data for most, if not all, large language models. And like the white alien company, Wikipedia charges for smooth access to it, though less than Reddit, Rudder said. The organization launched Wikimedia Enterprise in 2021 with an eye towards corporate customers. Reddit is a for-profit business, whereas the Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit. Wikipedia’s data is free, but using it easily may cost you.Unlike Reddit, Wikipedia is emphasizing the human labor necessary to maintain its site and the content there by rolling back features in response to community outcry and convening editors in person.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The biggest announcement was a redesign of theiPhoneOperating System (iOS) nicknamed “liquid glass”. Virtual buttons on iPhone screens will appear transparent, with the images behind them passing through with a slight warp like a magnifying glass. The aesthetic recalls the colorful Macs of old, housed in translucent, whimsical plastic.The refreshed design is pretty! It is also boring. Machines arefabricating entire moviesandpredicting hurricanes. Who cares what color my phone’s controls are?There were other updates, of course.Appleis adding live translation to FaceTime calls, for instance. I can imagine many calls with distant family and friends that will run smoother with that feature. How nice.On the whole, though, the updates failed to inspire. For many years, updates to iPhones have seemed far more incremental than, for example, the addition of speedy 3G connectivity in 2008 with the second generation. Apple’s updates have failed to keep pace with the freewheeling Android ecosystem. I met a venture capitalist in San Francisco in 2019 whodid not know what version of the iPhone he was holdingin his hand as we spoke.Apple showcased little in the way of new AI features, unlike its peers. Google and Samsung are integrating AI into their mobile experiences at a breakneck pace. Case in point: live translation is a feature that has been part of the Android operating system for several years. Google’s Pixel Bud headphones can translate the speech of a person talking to you, which Airpods cannot do. Google seems to release a fascinating, if sometimes bizarre, AI feature every week. As recently as Friday, theVerge reported:Google says it is testing Audio Overviews for certain Search queries, available for Labs users in English in the US.After the demonstration,Gizmodo argued: Apple Knows AI Isn’t What People Really Want, but It Can’t Say That. Even if that is true, though – and ChatGPT’s 500m monthly users might disagree – the announcements showed little in the way of flair. If Apple wants users to stay within the iPhone’s ecosystem, it needs to offer them something equally appealing and enthralling or even more so.Google pushed a new, updated version of the operating system and last week. Samsung teased new features of the next version of its folding phone, perAndroid Central. Did you hear about them? It is axiomatic in tech journalism that stories about Apple and iPhones will always garner more clicks than stories about Android phones, though a far higher percentage of the world’s phones use Android. I have many guesses as to why that is, but it is a topic for another day. I only mention it because many fewer people spent the weekdiscussing the Android updatesas did Apple’s Liquid Glass interface. Apple’s change amounts to only a cosmetic upgrade – and it’s debatable whether it will be better at all – but itinspired many more jokes.Samsung’s seventh version of its folding phone, while novel, begs the question: as I complain about new iPhones’ lack of thrills, what do I want my phone to do? I do not need a folding phone. I had one, a Motorola Razr, and it did facilitate vital communication; however, that did not arise from the form factor.Google’s new AI features pose the same question. There may not be consensus on what the majority of users want from an AI-enhanced phone, but if you are not trying something new with technology, you are in decline. It doesn’t feel like Apple is offering surprising features that I would not have thought of. I may not need an audio summary feature for my Google search results, but I am intrigued by it. Also, what a gift to the visually impaired! Siri, by contrast, still struggles to control Spotify and botches notification summaries.I have used an iPhone as my primary device for about 15 years now. This inflection point would be the moment to switch to Android to try out its shiny toybox of new features, but I am enclosed in Apple’s ecosystem of hardware and apps, a walled garden that is starting to feel less like a bountiful Eden and more like a pen.The wider TechScapeAs big tech grows more involved in Gaza, Muslim workers are wrestling with a spiritual crisisTell us: what questions do you have about the impacts of smartphones on children?‘They went too far’: Musk says he regrets some of his posts about TrumpTrump Organization unveils $499 gold phone raising new concerns on conflicts of interest23andMe’s founder wins bid to regain control of bankrupt DNA testing firmEntrepreneur ‘humiliated’ after London Tech Week turns her and baby awayThe best Apple Watches in 2025: what’s worth buying and what’s not, according to our expertExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)TechScape newsletterMetaMark ZuckerbergWikipediaAppleiPhonenewslettersShareReuse this content"

Summer heatwaves are so frequent, they’re stretching the bounds of what we think of as summer. Hot-and-bothered home working and sweaty, sleepless nights are now alarmingly common.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Fans sell out when the mercury rises, so get ahead of the pack by ordering one in anticipation: there will always be another heatwave. Get a good fan, and you can also dodge the temptation of air conditioning. Air con is incredibly effective, but it uses a lot of electricity … and burning fossil fuels is how we got into this mess in the first place. Save money and carbon by opting for a great fan instead.Fans are much more energy efficient than air con. A typical portable air conditioner uses 1000W of electricity, which would cost about 26p an hour to run from 1 July, when theenergy price cap changes to 25.73p/kWh. The fans I tested used between 8W and 60W; my favourite, the AirCraft Lume, used 18W on its top setting. You could run it on max for 56 hours, and it would still use no more electricity (money, carbon) than a single air con unit going for an hour.I tested 14 fans of all shapes and sizes, so you can pick the best one for you. I tested them for size, noise, power use and, of course, how much they cool you down. I also tested a few “evaporative coolers”, which use water to cool the air blowing at you while using significantly less energy than air con.At a glanceBest fan overall:AirCraft Lume£129 at AirCraftBest budget fan and best desk fan:Devola desk fan£49.99 at DevolaBest tower fan:Dreo Cruiser TF518£89.99 at AmazonBest travel fan:Morphy Richards Air Flex USB fan£39.99 at Morphy RichardsBest evaporative cooler:Swan 5-litre Nordic air cooler£69.99 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI’m an award-winning consumer tech journalist with decades of experience testing gadgets. I’m also a menopausal woman in her 50s who honestly can’t remember the last time she felt cold: I think that might be why we gravitate towild swimmingin middle age. Oh, and I have a degree in engineering. So I’m triply qualified to put these fans through their paces, scientifically and subjectively.How I testedView image in fullscreenAn anemometer was used to measure the air speed each fan generates on its top setting.Photograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianI chose 14 fans, each from different brands, aiming for a mix of new and highly rated models plus a few stellar bargains. I wanted to make sure there was something for everyone before I put them through their paces.I used a power meter to measure how much electricity (and therefore money and carbon) the fans use, an anemometer to measure the air speed they generate on the top setting, and the Sound Meter app to measure the noise on the top setting (they were all too quiet to register on their lowest).I measured everything from 1m away, although in reality, you’ll probably position a tower or pedestal fan farther away and a desk fan closer to you. That means the noise a desk fan makes matters more.I also measured them myself, as sometimes the official specs can be misleading or wrong. For example, I measured a tower fan that was supposedly 17cm wide, only to find that wasn’t including the base. Here I’ve stuck with each fan’s largest dimensions, including their footprint.I used a thermometer to measure the impact of the evaporative coolers I tested, and took note of everything from how cooling each of the fans felt, how annoying the noise was and how good the controls were. I also considered how they looked and how small they packed away, as well as the price tag.All the fans that weren’t returned to the manufacturers were donated toFurnishing Futures, a charity that furnishes the empty social homes in which women and children are placed after domestic abuse.The best fans in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianBest fan overall:AirCraft LumeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£129 at AirCraft£119 at AOThis pedestal fan was hard to fault, with an elegant design that boasts a dimmable backlight (three brightness levels or you can turn it off, all with the remote control). It’s billed as height adjustable, but rather than scooting up and down, you can remove the bottom pole to convert it into a 63cm desk fan. There’s an LED display and touch controls on the front, and other features include a 12-hour timer and a sleep mode. In fact, of all the fans I tested, this one is probably the best for sleeping: alongside the sleep mode, it is the best for low noise relative to wind speed.Why we love itI loved the AirCraft for many reasons. It’s light but with a reassuringly heavy base, giving it Weeble-like stability: it’s difficult to knock over. It packs away pretty small for the winter because the pole comes apart. I also liked that the packaging is almost plastic-free.It oscillates both horizontally and vertically, so it can circulate air nicely around a whole room. Most importantly of all, this fan can really shift air – its 5.9m/s (metres a second) was the best on test, and you can really feel it. When the heatwave hits, this is what you want. All for a reasonable price, too.It’s a shame that …there’s nowhere to stow the remote control when it’s not in use.Style:pedestal (or desk)Dimensions:37 x 28 x 95cm (WDH)Number of speeds:12Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:55dBPower use on top setting:18WAir speed on top setting:5.9 metres per secondBest budget fan and best desk fan:DevoladeskfanView image in fullscreen£49.99 at Devola£49.99 at AirconCentreThis affordable desk fan punches well above its weight, with good features and powerful airflow. It has a display, touch controls, a remote, a timer and sleep mode. You can choose vertical oscillation (90 degrees), horizontal oscillation (80 degrees) or use both to circulate the air in a room. Not bad for a humble desk fan.Why we love itIt’s a bargain powerhouse, producing a substantial wind. I measured an air speed of 4m/s, which was one of the best on test. It certainly felt cooling.I couldn’t hear the Devola on the first three of its nine speeds, and even when the noise got louder on higher settings, it wasn’t too annoying.It’s a shame that …the display is on the base facing upwards, so you can’t see it unless you’re nearby. There was no instruction manual in the box, either, although I found it straightforward to use.Style:deskDimensions:30 x 21 x 31cm (WDH)Number of speeds:9Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:50dBPower use on top setting:16WAir speed on top setting:4.0m/sBest tower fan:Dreo Cruiser TF518View image in fullscreen£89.99 at Amazon£109.99 with wifi voice control at B&QThis tower fan is slim but striking in black. Features include 90-degree oscillation, a 0- to 12-hour timer, a sleep mode where the fan speed decreases gradually, and an auto mode that adapts the fan speed depending on the room temperature.Why we love itAt full blast, the Dreo felt positively windy and was definitely cooling on a hot day. On the two lowest settings, no sound was audible, but I could still feel a gentle breeze. I also liked the recess at the top-back that makes it easy to carry with one hand.It’s billed as a “25dB silent bladeless fan”, but I measured 60dB on top whack from a metre away. The sound wasn’t too annoying, though, and the fan’s powerful cooling made it forgivable.It’s a shame that …its energy consumption is relatively high. We’re talking pennies in electricity, but still, energy efficiency is good. Also, there’s nowhere to clip the remote control.Style:towerDimensions:32 x 32 x 106cm (WDH)Number of speeds:9Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:60dBPower use on top setting:29WAir speed on top setting:3.6m/sBest travel fan:Morphy Richards Air FlexUSBfanView image in fullscreen£39.99 at Morphy Richards£39.99 at RymanThis is the fan you can take with you anywhere. I don’t mean to fan yourself by hand: it folds down small and it’s cordless and USB rechargeable, so you can be the smuggest person on the train and a very happy camper on a hot day. It can also give you a breeze on a still day on the patio. The battery will last from four to 17 hours, depending on fan speed. And you can plug it into a laptop at your desk or even apower bankfor more juice.Why we love itThe 2.6m/s air speed can’t compete with the big fans on test – but it’s not trying to. It’s an electric fan that can go anywhere, folding down to a cylinder measuring 18 x 18 x 12cm. You can even hang it on the wall, if you wish.There’s no timer or sleep mode, but there’s a “nature mode” that varies the speed to mimic a breeze. And it does oscillate (to 90 degrees). It’s also quiet: I couldn’t hear it on the first of its three speeds, and it was never loud enough to be annoying.It’s a shame that …air speed dips slightly when it’s not plugged in, but only slightly (2.5m/s instead of 2.6m/s)Style:deskDimensions:18 x 18 x 22cm (WDH)Number of speeds:3Remote control?NoPeak noise level on test:35dBPower use on top setting:8WAir speed on top setting:2.6m/sBestevaporative cooler:Swan 5-litre Nordic air coolerView image in fullscreen£69.99 at Swan£69.99 at AmazonThe air speed may not be great, but this Swan model is still a good buy because it’s an evaporative cooler, meaning it uses water from its five-litre reservoir to cool the air it blows at you. It can be used as a regular fan, too. Evaporative coolers are much more energy-efficient than air conditioning, so they use much less power (and therefore less carbon, assuming you’re not on a renewable tariff or producing your own electricity).Why we love itOf the two evaporative coolers I tested, this worked the best. I could see the temperature on the thermometer go down: it cooled by more than 1C in less than 30 minutes. And it felt like a cooling breeze. In fact, it felt a bit like air con.I just filled it with water, but it comes with two ice packs that you can pre-freeze and throw into the reservoir for even colder results.The breeze felt wide, rather than focused. This is a question of personal taste: some people want a powerful fan that’s focused to blast just them, while others prefer a room-filling breeze. In oscillating mode, it’s wider still, as the grille at the front rotates, which is a bit hypnotic. It’s good-looking, too, in a coffee-coloured oatmeal or grey finish. It’s light and on casters, so easy to move around, and its modes include normal, natural, sleep and timer.It’s a shame that …you can hear the water in the pipes: it sounded like a leak. You might even find yourself needing the loo.Style:towerDimensions:29 x 24 x 71cm (WDH)Number of speeds:24Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:45dBPower use on top setting:26WAir speed on top setting:0.9m/sThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianLevoit classic tower fanView image in fullscreen£71.99 at AmazonBest for:a quieter tower fanThis produces a narrow beam of air, so you need to point it at you just right or set it to oscillate (90 degrees). It’s billed as a “20dB silent tower fan”, and it’s inaudible on the lowest four of its 12 speeds, but it was considerably louder at top whack.It’s good-looking, and I liked the space in the back to stow the remote control. There’s a 12-hour timer and a sleep mode, too.It didn’t make the final cut because …for the same price, the Dreo is more powerful, which is what you need on a really hot day.Style:tower;dimensions:29 x 29 x 92cm (WDH);number of speeds:12;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:50dB;power use on top setting:40W;air speed on top setting:1.7m/sVortex Air Pro PlusView image in fullscreen£159.99 from Vortex AirBest for:style, and its all-in-one heater and fan designVortex Air bladeless fans look modern, very Dyson-esque, and this one comes in 10 colour combos. It’s useful year-round, too, doubling as a fan heater. But it’s hard to categorise: too short for a tower fan, too tall for a desk fan.There’s a timer and it oscillates horizontally (71 degrees) and vertically (180 degrees), though it’s hard to imagine why you’d want to point it completely down. The touch controls are at the base, which isn’t very practical if it’s on the floor, and the display was a bit hard to see.It didn’t make the final cut because …I found the noise a bit annoying; I could hear it at levels 2-10.Style:tower;dimensions:25 x 24 x 65cm (WDH);number of speeds:10;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:35dB;power use on top setting:28W;air speed on top setting:2.9m/sHoneywell10-litre evaporative air coolerView image in fullscreen£74.99 from AirconCentre£79.99 at B&Qskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Its swing mode moves horizontally, and you can manually move the grilles to angle the air up or down. It’s on casters, too.I liked its large (10-litre) water capacity and how quiet it was, but the fan wasn’t strong enough, and the evaporative mode wasn’t cold enough. I tried it several times, and in half an hour, it never managed to cool the area in front by a degree.It didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t cool the room down enough.Style:tower;dimensions:31 x 30 x 75cm (WDH);number of speeds:3;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:30dB;power use on top setting:39W;air speed on top setting:1.8m/sShark TurboBlade TF200SUKView image in fullscreen£249.99 at Shark£250 at ArgosBest for:pointing in two directions at onceThis bladeless fan’s unusual T-shaped design has arms that stick out left and right, each putting out air, or you can turn them by 90 degrees for a tall, thin fan. You can angle each arm independently, good for pointing at two people. It’s height-adjustable and can oscillate (180 degrees) horizontally too. I liked that the remote attaches to the top with a strong magnet.It’s powerful, but the sound is very annoying: it sounds like a vacuum cleaner, and I wanted it to stop. It also used the most power on test; even still, a 60W fan costs less than 2p an hour to run at the current energy price cap, so it’s pennies compared with air con.It didn’t make the final cut because …I hated the noise it makes.Style:pedestal;dimensions:80 x 30 x 78-95cm (WDH), or 124 x 30 x 114-130cm in vertical mode;number of speeds:10;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:35dB;power use on top setting:60W;air speed on top setting:3.1m/sDuux Whisper Flex 2View image in fullscreen£179.99 at Duux£179.99 at AmazonBest for:smart controlsThis took quite a bit of assembly, but it’s good-looking, can be converted into a 54cm-high desk fan by removing a pole, and the tech is clever too. You can control it with an app or by voice (Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant) to set up to seven schedules. There’s an optional battery and charging dock to make it cordless.It’s fairly quiet and oscillates well, vertically and horizontally, but I found the standard controls annoying. The display on the base points upwards, so it’s hard to see from across the room, and you have to point the remote very accurately at it.I did like the compostable packaging. But unusually, it drew far too much power (2W) on standby. Less than 1W is the norm.It didn’t make the final cut because …of the annoying controls.Style:pedestal;dimensions:34 x 34 x 92cm (WDH);number of speeds:30;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:40dB;power use on top setting:9W;air speed on top setting:3.1m/sVonHaus air circulator desk fanView image in fullscreen£49.99 at VonHaus£64.99 at The RangeBest for:room-filling breezeThis desk fan has a display and touch controls on the front. And it oscillates well: it turns 90 degrees vertically, 80 degrees horizontally or both together to create a room-filling breeze. I couldn’t hear the lowest five of its 12 speeds, either.It looks good, and the controls are easy to use. Features include a one to 12-hour timer and a sleep mode that decreases fan speed every 30 minutes through the night.It didn’t make the final cut because …I liked the Devola desk fan even more, but this is a solid buy too.Style:desk;dimensions:30 x 21 x 36cm (WDH);number of speeds:12;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:45dB;power use on top setting:13W;air speed on top setting:2.7m/sDyson Cool CF1View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£249 at John Lewis£249.99 at DysonBest for:looks and designYou can see a lot of thought has gone into the CF1’s design. Not just its simple, circular air multiplier, but every single detail. The display is small but very readable. The oscillation (15, 40 or 70 degrees) works well. The magnetic storage on top for the remote control is clever. The controls work well and let you easily set the timer and sleep mode.I couldn’t hear this bladeless fan on the first six of its 10 speeds, and I found the noise easy to live with even at higher speeds.It didn’t make the final cut because …the price is hard to justify. Money no object? Go for it!Style:desk;dimensions:36 x 16 x 55cm (WDH);number of speeds:10;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:35dB;power use on top setting:20W;air speed on top setting:2.9m/sMeaco Sefte 8in portable air circulatorView image in fullscreen£79.99 at MeacoBest for:acordless fanThis is an impressive, new cordless desk fan with a battery life of four to 17 hours, depending on fan speed. I couldn’t hear the first seven of its 12 speeds. It oscillates and you can manually point it up or down, and features include a timer, night and eco modes. Its three-year warranty is a bonus, too (most have two).Overall, I liked it. It’s good-looking and pretty strong, although it’s weaker when cordless; for example, air speed dropped from an impressive 4.6m/s to 3.1m/s when I unplugged it. Still, if you want a desk fan that can sometimes be cordless, it’s a good buy.It didn’t make the final cut because …the USB-powered Morphy Richards is even handier.Style:desk;dimensions:26 x 20 x 38cm (WDH);number of speeds:12;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:55dB;power use on top setting:10W;air speed on top setting:4.6m/sBlueair ComfortPure 3-in-1 T20iView image in fullscreen£299 at AmazonBest for:hay fever and allergy sufferersThis is also a fan heater (so it’s useful all year round) and an air purifier (ideal for allergy sufferers). It cleans the air in a room in 12.5 minutes or a small house in an hour, removing airborne particles such as pollen, odours, dust and smoke.On test, it created a good breeze, even though the anemometer only read 0.8m/s. And on cooler days, it can send purified air upwards instead, circulating air in the room as well as cleaning it.The controls and display are on top, making them hard to see from across the room. But there’s an app and Alexa control as well as a remote. The three-year warranty is nice, too.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s expensive as a fan (but great as an air purifier).Style:tower;dimensions:24 x 24 x 50cm (WDH);number of speeds:4;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:35dB;power use on top setting:21W;air speed on top setting:0.8m/sWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenFor personal comfort, simply point a fan towards you.Photograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianWhatis a bladeless fan?Bladeless fans aren’t magic; they just don’t have visible blades. The work is done inside the body of the fan, and then air is pushed out of a nozzle. The Dyson, Vortex Air and Shark above are all bladeless. They look modern and are easy to clean. And there are no moving parts on show, so zero chance of getting your hair caught.What does oscillation mean?Most fans oscillate (move back and forth) by swivelling on their base, and some let you select how wide an the angle you want. If it’s just for you, pick a narrow angle; if you’re cooling the whole office, go wide. Some fans achieve the same effect in other ways, such as by moving louvres. And some oscillate up and down too, so the fan can circulate air all over the room to create a gentle breeze.What’s sleep mode?Most fans have a sleep mode, where every 30 or 60 minutes the fan lowers its setting until it reaches a certain point. This is a good compromise that helps you get to sleep without wasting energy, minimising the risk of waking up in the middle of the night suddenly cold.Start by lowering the fan speed to the point where you don’t find it annoying. In fact, some people find the white noise of a fan helpful at bedtime. Then use sleep mode.The best sleep aids recommended by experts: from blue light-blockers to apps to help you napRead moreWhere is the best place to position a fan?For personal comfort, simply point it towards you. The cooling feeling is because the moving air from the fan displaces the warm, humid air near your skin, which in turn helps your sweat evaporate, cooling your body down. It’s like a breeze rather than a still day. Or why it feels colder swimming in a river than in a lake, even if the water temperature is the same. Evaporative coolers, of which I’ve included two above, use water to actively cool the air.Never place a fan up against a wall because there needs to be air flowing into the back. If the air’s cooler outside, put the fan in front of an open window or door to bring in the cooler air.How much does a fan cost to use?I’ll set out the maths. For each fan here, I’ve measured its power use on the top setting, in watts (W). Electricity costs are in kilowatt hours (kWh). If, for example, you were using a 30W fan for five hours, it would use 150Wh. Divide by 1,000 to convert it to kilowatt hours: 0.150kWh.The energy price cap for 1 July to 30 September 2025 is 25.73 pence per kWh. Multiply this by the last figure and you’ll discover it will cost just under 4p to run that fan for five hours. Or £14 to run it for five hours every day for a year.Running fans is pretty cheap, then, and a good fan will keep you cool enough to dodge buying any kind of air conditioning. An evaporative cooler is a good alternative to air con. The two I tested used 26W (Swan) and 39W (Honeywell), so they use less than 3% of the electricity of a typical portable air conditioner (1000W). The effect isn’t the same: you can’t turn your bedroom into a fridge. But you can cool the air enough to make a big difference when there’s a heatwave.Do I need air conditioning?If you’re in the UK, honestly, no. It’s tempting to turn your bedroom into a walk-in fridge on a hot day, but fans are great and use much less electricity (and therefore money and carbon) than air con. Unless you’re on a renewable tariff, electricity use accelerates climate breakdown.Caramel Quin is ajournalist specialising in consumer technology.

The debut trailer featured eerie, futuristic imagery, an astronaut, and a blond-haired little girl, but there was nothing concrete or clear about its content. And when it missed its 2022 release window and was“paused indefinitely”in 2023, it wasn’t clear if Pragmata would ever come to be.That all changed on 4 June, when a brand-new trailer was broadcast during aPlayStationshowcase. The blond-haired little girl turns out to be a weaponised android, accompanying an astronaut called Hugh (of course) through space-station shootouts. I played about 20 minutes of the game during Summer Game Fest the following weekend. A lengthy, troubled development cycle is usually a bad omen, but my time with it was promising.Pragmata begins with the aforementioned astronaut, Hugh Williams, unconscious and lying prone amid metallic detritus, his suit is blaring a repeat warning: “integrity compromised”. A child with long, unkept blond hair wearing an oversized blue jacket and nothing else (a bizarre choice, if I’m being honest) runs past Hugh and struggles to tip over a large case nearby. When she finally knocks it on its side, she opens it up to reveal a device that emits lunafilament nanoweave, a material that absorbs and copies any information it is exposed to. She uses it to repair his suit, which in turn heals his wounds, and he’s on his feet (though confused) in no time.Pragmata trailerWe learn they ,are on a moon-based space station, to which Hugh was dispatched after an earthquake. This facility appears to have an autonomous robotic security system that considers Hugh an intruder, however, which means it’s time to fight. And I was not ready for how much fun fighting is.The robot adversaries in Pragmataall have powerful shields, which means Hugh’s arsenal of weapons (which you can add to by finding different firearms around the map) is essentially useless. Thankfully, the barefoot little girl, whom we now call Diana, can hack these enemies to make them vulnerable – you’ll just have to do itwhilethey’re attacking you, and she’s riding on your shoulder.With the face buttons on your controller, you’ll have to navigate through the robot’s mainframe, depicted as several rows and columns of tiles, until you get to a green tile, which will temporarily disarm its shield. You have to do thisfast, however, often while dodging their strikes, and failing these hacks and starting over made for some incredibly tense (and fun) combat.Pragmata’s hacking feels like when you call in a Helldivers 2 stratagem and have to swiftly but purposefully push buttons while under extreme pressure. It turns every firefight into a white-knuckle moment: different robot types require different hacks, and messing up will set you back. In the brief time I spent with Pragmata, there was a pleasing variety of enemies and weapons already.I was engrossed in combat by the time someone tapped me on the shoulder and told me the demo time was over (right before a big boss fight, boo). Despite five-plus years in development, it feels fresh.Pragmata will be out in 2026 forXbox, PlayStation, and PC.Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsFighting gamesXboxPlayStationPCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet as the industrialised world urgesde-escalationin the Middle East, the devastation continues. On Tuesday morning, witnessesdescribedIsraeli forces firing towards a crowd waiting for trucks loaded with flour, leaving more than 50 dead. These are not stray bullets in wartime chaos, they are the outcome of a system that makes relief deadly.As Médecins Sans Frontièresdeclaredthis week, what is unfolding in Gaza is “the calculated evisceration of the very systems that sustain life”. That includes homes, markets, water networks and hospitals – with healthcare continually under attack. Last week, aUN commissionfound that more than 90% of the Gaza Strip’s schools and universities have been damaged or destroyed by Israeli forces using airstrikes, burning, shelling and controlled demolitions. What’s happening is not the collateral damage of military necessity, it is a programme of civic annihilation.In such circumstances, words without action are worse than meaningless. Western powers cannot decry war crimes and genocide while supplying the arms that cause them elsewhere. If they believe in international law, countries such as the UK should act to uphold it. The law is not law if no one enforces it. Israel is theoccupyingpower in Gaza and has a clear duty under thefourth Geneva conventionto ensure the population’s access to food, water and medical care.Instead, it has imposed a blockade and driven out UN humanitarian operations. In their place, it has backed the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private aid scheme coordinated with its military and guarded by US mercenaries. Citing unproven claims of Hamas infiltration, Israel scrapped 400 UN-backed aid sites for just four GHF-run, militarised hubs. In a few weeks, around300Palestinians have reportedly died trying to access these food sites. UN officials are right to say the GHF scheme is “engineered scarcity” that has made aid distribution “a death trap”. The US-basedCenter for Constitutional Rightshas also warned that the GHF may be prosecuted for aiding “war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide”. Yet Donald Trump’s state department ismullinga $500m grant.In the UK, ministers sayallegationsof genocide are for courts to decide upon, while government lawyers in court assert that there is no genocide. This is not just moral evasiveness but tactical contradiction, designed to sustain arms sales and diplomatic cover. This hypocrisy has consequences. By shielding Israel from accountability in Gaza, and now endorsing its illegal strike on Iran, western governments are not merely complicit – they are dismantling the legal order they claim to defend. They are falling in line with Mr Trump’s attempts to undermine institutions designed to hold powerful actors accountable, replacing legal norms with political cover.As the former USAID official Jeremy Konyndyk hassaid, if GHF were a genuine humanitarian project it would have halted a model that produces daily massacres. According to the Carnegie Endowment’sKatherine Wilkens, GHF imposes severe limits on food, subjects civilians to invasive biometric vetting and hands out aid at gunpoint under Israeli control – in clear breach of international law. What is collapsing in Gaza is not just infrastructure. It is the principle that even war has rules. When those rules are waived for allies, no one is safe.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Nowadays, that could lead to some very awkward conversationsTue 17 Jun 2025 13.07 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 20.06 EDTShareSarah Jessica Parker, the Sex and the City star andBooker prize judge, has a nifty trick for getting out of taking selfies with her fans. “I did this for a really, really long time and it worked for ever,” Parker said in aninterview with Howard Stern. “I used to say, ‘I can’t, because of the government,’ and I’d do this,” Parker said, pointing up to the sky. “It really confused people. This was through different administrations, so it wasn’t political.”It is not entirely clear why Parker – who has saidshe refuses to take selfiesand would rather “have a conversation” instead because “it’s much more meaningful” – stopped using this brilliant excuse. But one does have to wonder whether it is because the US has become a nation ofconspiracy theorists. Rather than backing away from the weird “the government is watching” woman, perhaps fans started to excitedly engage her with theories about how Bill Gates has implanted us all with mind-controlling microchips. Or maybe she just got tired of the joke. I don’t know. But I’m sure someone out there (the government) does.Conspiracy theories have become so mainstream that they are even prompting nonsensical legislation. Earlier this month, Louisiana lawmakers sent a bill to the state’s governor seeking to ban “chemtrails” – which don’t actually exist. They are a longstanding conspiracy which posits that the white lines sometimes left behind by aircraft aren’t just due to condensed water vapour but are far more sinister. Somepeople believethat the government is spraying toxic metals to reduce populations; others believe they are evidence that dark forces are trying to control the weather or people’s minds.Lawmakers inat least 11 otherstates are trying to advance similar “chemtrail” bans. “Every bill like this is kind of symbolic, or is introduced to appease a very vocal group, but it can still cause real harm by signalling that these conspiracies deserve this level of legal attention,” a member of the National Association for Media Literacy Educationtold the Associated Press.Also causing real harm in the US with his obsession with imaginary problems is health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. The vaccine sceptic recently firedevery single memberof a critical advisory committee on immunisation practices. He has replaced them with people who reportedly have very little vaccine expertise and areaccused of spreading misinformation. The ousted members of the vaccine committee have said that the shake-up may “impact people’s access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses.”RFK Jr is also fixated on conspiracy theories about fluoride,which he calls “a dangerous neurotoxin”. There are, to be clear, valid concerns about ingesting too much fluoride, including its effects on IQ as well as potential tooth discoloration. But experts are pretty unanimous that fluoride in drinking water is a great public health achievement that has done wonders forpreventing tooth decay. There are worries that RFK Jr’s meddling will cause a significant increase in dental cavities,especially among childrenin lower-income groups.Anyway, I’ve got a good idea for Parker. Since acting like a conspiracy theorist no longer seems to ward off unwanted attention, why not try engaging selfie-seeking fans with a rational fact-based discussion? Increasingly large numbers of Americans seem allergic to that; some fans will immediately run a mile. I have some other thoughts too but I’m afraid I can’t elaborate any more on this issue for top secret reasons. But here’s a hint: it’s because of the government.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If he intervenes, he’ll undermine his own foreign policyTue 17 Jun 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 12.41 EDTShareDuring his three presidential campaigns,Donald Trumpran as an opponent of serial military interventions and wars of “regime change” à la Iraq and Libya, which neoconservatives and liberal internationalists alike had embraced after the end of the cold war. He correctly sensed that many Americans had tired of “forever wars”.Benjamin Netanyahu’s attack on Iran is a watershed moment for Trump. It will force him to reveal whether he truly represents a clean break with the foreign policy establishment, often referred to as “the blob”, or is in fact a continuation of it. It all depends on whether he decides to join Israel’s attacks on Iran.Trump faces a tough choice. Israel has strong, longstanding, deep and variegated support in the US, and Netanyahu may seek substantial American military engagement, even military intervention. He’s already begun setting the stage. In a flattery-filledbirthday missive, he gushed that Trump has “done great things for Israel” and that “we’re dealing with something that will threaten all of us sooner or later. Our victory will be your victory”.Netanyahu bombed Iran when Washington and Tehran were still negotiating the future of its nuclear enrichment program, andreportedly despite hearing from the USthat an attack could jeopardise the talks. Netanyahu opposed any agreement because of two firmly held beliefs. First: a nuclear-armed Iran can be prevented only by destroying its entire enrichment infrastructure. Second: Iran’s threat to Israel isn’t limited to nuclear weapons; the Islamic Republic’s ideology rejects the very existence of a Jewish state in historic Palestine. These two convictions explain why Netanyahu has not only targeted Iran’s nuclear installationsbut also urged Iraniansto overthrow their government.Trump must decide whether he wants to join a war guided by these two goals. If he jumps in, he’ll reveal himself to be no different from the blob; if he doesn’t, he risks running afoul of Israel’s most fervent American allies – not just Jewish organisations, but also voting blocs such as evangelical Christians. There has been much debate about whether Netanyahu sandbagged Trump, or whether Trump greenlighted the war from the outset because, despite his self-presentation as a foreign policy maverick, he, like Joe Biden – whom he loves to malign – is in fact an unalloyed supporter ofIsrael.Regardless of which theory is accurate, Trump confronts a hard decision. He can either back Netanyahu’s war or tell him that having started it unilaterally, he’s on his own. Trump could try to split the difference by limiting himself to what he isalready doing: helping to intercept Israel-bound Iranian drones and missiles, while steering clear of a military clash with Iran.Yet if Iran’s missile barrages intensify and Israel experiences far more death and destruction than it has so far, that gambit could fail. Trump will face intense pressure to enter the fray to defend Israel. But prominent members of the Maga movement’s isolationist-oriented wing will oppose a war with Iran. One of them, Tucker Carlson, has already accused the president of being “complicit” in Israel’s war on Iran and betraying his “America first” foreign policy pledge, and his sentiments have wider purchase.Netanyahu has put Trump in a bind – unnecessarily.Irandid not attack Israel. Nor was it preparing to, which means that Netanyahu’s attack was not a pre-emptive one necessitated by the imperative of beating an adversary to the punch. Both variants of self-defence-based war have a basis in international law and military ethics. Netanyahu’s war doesn’t belong to either genre. It is a preventive war comparable to George W Bush’s attack on Iraq and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Both were justified by invoking a hypothetical threat; neither was necessitated by a clear and present danger.Netanyahu has beenwarningabout a nuclear-equipped Iransince 1992, when he predicted that Tehran would build the bomb in three to five years. If an Iran with nuclear weapons is Netanyahu’s nightmare, he should have applauded, notlambasted, the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) that the Obama administration and Iran signed in 2015. Once Trump was elected, Netanyahu convinced him to defenestrate that deal. The JCPOA’s provisions – some extended to 13 years, others to 15 – eliminated 98% of Iran’s enriched uranium stocks, capped uranium enrichment at 3.67%, dismantled about two-thirds of its centrifuges, placed stringent limits on heavy water production, and incorporated extensiveverification measures.Netanyahu launched the war to scuttle the US-Iran talks and, if possible, bring down the Islamic Republic. Iraq 2003 and Ukraine 2022 prove that “preventive” wars should never be legitimised; they allow leaders excessive, needless and dangerous leeway. Trump therefore has strong grounds to oppose Israel’s attack on Iran. At a press conference at the G7 summit in Canada, he refused to comment when asked whether he would join Israel, but noted that “the United States has always supported Israel”, that Iran wasn’t winning, that Israel “was doing very well”, and that Iran brought the war on itself by spurning his 60-day deadline to sign an agreement and now wanted to talk.Trump reportedly resisted putting his name to a draft statement calling for de-escalation, produced by the other G7 members, before eventually signing. On the other hand, after Netanyahusaid he hadn’t ruled outkilling Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, several news outlets, citing American officials,reported that Trump“vetoed” that step, no doubt realising that it could make the confrontation careen out of control.Even assuming that Trump didn’t want Israel to attack when it did, he has manoeuvred to turn events to his advantage, suggesting that the war will compel Iran to sign a deal on his terms. The president’s problem is that this war could continue for days, even weeks. And the longer it lasts, the harder it will be to finesse direct questions with ambiguous replies and to avoid hard decisions, especially if Israel needs direct US help. At some point, Israel’s American supporters and the anti-intervention camp within the US may each ask: “Will the real Donald Trump please stand up?”Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace StudiesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionBenjamin NetanyahuUS foreign policyIsraelIrancommentShareReuse this content"

No, me neitherTue 17 Jun 2025 08.53 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 16.01 EDTShareWhenever I need to leave a boring party, I always get my press secretary to tweet the apologies, and so it was that White House spokesmonster Karoline Leavittinformed X usersin the dead of night that Donald Trump had ditched the G7 after barely 24 hours of mid-price hotel drabness, thus avoiding the possibility of getting cornered by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the kitchen. Trump later said he had to leave the summit “for obvious reasons”, though failed to elaborate whether he meant he’d been expected to talkwithleaders, notatthem, or simply that the trouser press in his room was broken.You probably can’t call it a French exit if the French president then claims you left early to work on a ceasefire. But you can definitely up the stakes on Le Bumptious by calling him “publicity-seeking”, someone who “always gets it wrong”, and adding – almost by way of an afterthought – that all Iranians should “immediately evacuate” Tehran. (Population: 9.8 million.)Incidentally, how are your tension headaches these days? I woke up at 2am with a blinder and nothing to do in the small hours but diagnostic detective work. Had I slept in a draught? Ground my teeth? Was I dehydrated? No, no and no. Once you have eliminated the impossible, I suppose you just have to face it: the less-improbable-by-the-day threat of total conflagration might just be the explanation.But look, hopefully this is all just the relaxing buildup to Iran signing a nuclear deal? If so, someone should tell Trump’s beloved stock market, which doesn’t love the increased tensions in the Middle East since Israel began striking nuclear and military targets in Iran on Friday. Furthermore, it has yet to alight on either a fight or flight reflex following Trump’s delphic pronouncement – probably posted in the middle of the night while on the Air Force One toilet – that something “much bigger” is coming. Nor can it ignore the fact that Trump’s wasn’t even the first evacuation order for Tehran in the past day, with Israel havingalready issued oneon Monday afternoon.The US president has made clear his impatient incredulity that Iran did not sign a deal to largely dismantle its nuclear programme in the various forms it has been on the table. Then again, it was only five incredibly long years ago that Trump thought Israel and Palestine should sign his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s “deal of the century”, which the two sides somehow resisted, no doubt leaving present-day Kushner staring into one of his many infinity pools and sighing: “I could have made it SO easy for them.”As for who could next give statecraft a whirl, anyone underwhelmed by the thought of Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff meeting Iranian leaders should prepare for an even bigger tension headache at the prospect of Trump’s other floated idea – that he mightsend vice-president JD Vanceto meet them. That would certainly be a face-off for the age, given how well all of Vance’s other forays into the art of international diplomacy have gone. Nato, Ukraine, Greenland – he’ll have enough for a greatest shits album soon.But back to theG7, which today is somehow trying to carry on without its central character – a bit like The Office did after Steve Carell left. It’s hard when you’ve spent days of buildup reading that a G7 in the age of second-term Trump is effectively The Donald Show. He is the centre of gravity, everything revolves around him – pick your physics metaphor, basically, then try to imagine a post-physics G7/G6/G-also-rans/Gee why don’t we just sack the whole thing off and go hiking in the Rockies.The Iranian people were starting to win their battle for liberty and prosperity. Then Israel attacked | Esfandyar BatmanghelidjRead moreYou just know that all the other leaders are relieved that it’s Emmanuel Macron, and not them, getting it right in the truth-socials. It was barely two weeks ago that Macron was the beneficiary of one of Trump’s lethal expressions of support, with the president breaking off from his farewell-to-Elon-Musk press conference to reassure reporters that despite poor old Macronappearing to have been shovedby his wife on his presidential plane, “he’s fine”.The one thing Trump did have time for was signing the much-vauntedUS-UK trade deal, which he unveiled to the media at a photocall with grateful supplicant Keir Starmer, before dropping the papers all over the floor. The UK prime minister promptly scrabbled around to pick up what he could, which should in no way be regarded as a metaphor for the fact he is celebrating having a 10% tariff on car exports that didn’t exist a few months ago, on the basis that it isno longer 27.5%. Trump made zero attempt to help pick up the mess he’d made, which apparently should also not be regarded as a metaphor. And there was precisely nothing on lifting the 25% steel tariff, much less that the next stage of the deal will include Tata Steel. Forget metaphors here – that would be simply and literally bad.As for the rather bigger story of the day, we’re probably at the stage of wondering which lucky journalist will be accidentally added to the group chat ahead of any US military strike inIran, and get all the juicy operational details and high-end bitching in real time.

The key is whom the public blames for clashesTue 17 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 11.32 EDTShareOn 6 June, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) conducted aggressive raids in Los Angeles, sweeping up gainfully employed workers with no criminal record. This led todemonstrationsoutside the Los Angeles federal building. During these protests, David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) of California, was arrested alongside more than 100 others – leading to even larger demonstrations the next day.Donald Trump responded on 7 June bysending federal troopsto Los Angeles to quell the protests without consulting Gavin Newsom, and, in fact, in defiance of the California governor’s wishes. This dramatic federal response, paired withincreasingly aggressive tacticsby local police, led to the protests growing larger and escalating in their intensity. They’vebegun spreadingto other major cities, too.Cue the culture war.On the right, the response was predictable: the federal clampdown was largely praised. Hyperbolic narratives about the protests and the protesters were uncritically amplified and affirmed. On the left, the response was no less predictable. There is a constellation of academic and media personalities who breathlessly root for all protests to escalate into violent revolution while another faction claims to support all the causesin principlebut somehow never encounters an actual protest movement that they outright support.For my part, as I watchedWaymo cars burningas Mexican flags fluttered behind them, I couldn’t help but be reminded of sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. In the documentarySociology Is a Martial Art,he emphasized: “I don’t think it’s a problem that young people are burning cars. I want them to be able to burn cars for a purpose.”It is, indeed, possible for burning cars to serve a purpose. However, it matters immensely who is perceived to have lit the fuse.Violence is coming to define American political life | Stephen MarcheRead moreIt’s uncomfortable to talk about, but all major successful social movements realized their goalswith and through direct conflict. There’s never been a case where people just held hands and sang Kumbaya, provoking those in power to nod and declare, “I never thought of it that way,” and then voluntarily make difficult concessions without any threats or coercion needed. Attempts at persuasion are typically necessary for a movement’s success, but they’re rarely sufficient. Actual or anticipated violence, destruction and chaos also have their role to play.Civil rights leaders in the 1950s, for instance,went out of their wayto provoke high-profile, violent and disproportionate responses from those who supported segregation. Leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr had an intuitive understanding of what empirical social science now affirms: what matters isn’t the presence or absence of violence but, rather, who gets blamed for any escalations that occur.The current anti-Ice protests have included clashes with police andoccasional property damage. Melees, looting and destruction are perennially unpopular. Then again, so were civil rights-erabus boycotts, diner sit-ins and marches. In truth, the public rarely supportsanyform of social protest.Something similar holds for elite opinion-makers. In the civil rights era,as now, many who claimed to support social justice causes also described virtuallyanydisruptive action taken in the service of those causes ascounterproductive, whether it was violent or not. As I describe in mybook, civil rights leaders across the board described these “supporters” as the primary stumbling block for achieving equality.The simple truth is that most stakeholders in society – elites and normies alike, and across ideological lines – would prefer to stick with asuboptimal status quothan to embrace disruption in the service of an uncertain future state. Due to this widespread impulse, most successful social movements are deeply unpopular untilaftertheir victory is apparent. Insofar as they notch successes, it is often in defiance of public opinion.For instance, protests on US campuses against Israel’s campaign of destruction in Gaza weredeeply unpopular. However, for all theirflawsandlimitations, the demonstrations, and the broader cultural discussion around the protests,didget more people paying attention to what was happening in the Middle East. And as more people looked intoIsrael’s disastrous campaign in Gaza, American support plummeted. Among Democrats, independents and Republicans alike, sympathy for Israelis over Palestinians issignificantly lower todaythan before 7 October 2023. These patterns are not just evident in the US but also acrosswestern Europeandbeyond.Conflict can help shift public opinion in favor of political causes, but it can also lead to blowback against those causesThe Palestinian author Omar el-Akkadnotesthat when atrocities become widely recognized, everyone belatedly claims to have always been against them – even if they actively facilitated or denied the crimes while they were being carried out. Successful social movements function the opposite way: once they succeed, everyone paints themselves as having always been for them, even if the movements in question were deeply unpopular at the time.Martin Luther King Jr, for instance, waswidely vilifiedtowards the end of his life. Today, he has a federal holiday named after him. The lesson? Contemporaneous public polls about demonstrations tell us very little about the impact they’ll ultimately have.So, howcanwe predict the likely impact of social movements?The best picture we have from empirical social science research is that conflict can help shift public opinion in favor of political causes, but it can also lead to blowback against those causes. The rule seems to be thatwhoever is perceived to have initiated violence loses: if the protesters are seen as sparking violence, citizens sour on the cause and support state crackdowns. If the government is seen as having provoked chaos through inept or overly aggressive action, the public grows more sympathetic to the protesters’ cause (even if they continue to hold negative opinions about the protesters and the protests themselves).The 1992 Rodney King riots in Los Angeles are an instructive example. They arose after King was unjustly beaten by law enforcement and the state failed to hold the perpetrators to account. In public opinion, the government was held liable for these legitimate grievances and outrage. As a result, the subsequent unrest seemed togenerate further sympathyfor police reform (even though most Americansfrownedon the unrest itself).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it was also widely understood that the conflict was, itself, a response to law enforcement raids on gay bars. Gay and trans people were being aggressively surveilled and harassed by the state, and beganpushing back more forcefullyfor respect, privacy and autonomy. The government was the perceived aggressor, and this worked to the benefit of the cause. Hence, today, the Stonewall uprising is celebrated as a pivotal moment in civil rights history despite being characterized in auniformly negative fashionat the time.This is not the way social movements always play out. If the protests come to be seen as being motivated primarily by animus, resentment or revenge (rather than positive or noble ideals), the public tends to grow more supportive of a crackdown against the movement. Likewise, if demonstrators seem pre-committed to violence, destruction and chaos, people who might otherwise be sympathetic to the cause tend to rapidlydisassociatewith the protesters and their stated objectives.The 6 January 2021 raid on the Capitol building, for instance, led tolower levels of affiliationwith the GOP. Politicians who subsequently justified the insurrectionperformed especially poorlyin the 2022 midterms (with negative spillover effects to Republican peers).The protests that followed George Floyd’s murder were a mixed bag: in areas where demonstrations did not spiral into chaos or violence, the protests increased support formany police reformsand, incidentally, theDemocratic party. In contexts where violence, looting, crime increases and extremist claims were more prevalent – where protesters seemed more focused on condemning, punishing or razing society rather than fixing it – trends moved in theopposite direction.Yet, although the Floyd-era protests themselves had an ambivalent effect on public support for criminal justice reform, the outcome of Trump’s clampdown on the demonstrations was unambiguous: itled to a rapid erosionin GOP support amongwhiteAmericans–likely costing Trump the2020 election. Why? Because the president came off as an aggressor.Trump did not push for a crackdown reluctantly, after all other options were exhausted. He appeared to be hungry for conflict and eager to see the situation escalate. He seemed to relish norm violations and inflicting harm on his opponents. These perceptions were politically disastrous for him in 2020. They appear to be just as disastrous today.Right now, the public isspliton whether the ongoing demonstrations in support of immigrants’ rights are peaceful. Yet, broadly, Americansdisapproveof these protests, just as they disapprove of most others. Critically, however, mostalsodisapprove of Trump’s decisions to deploy thenational guardand themarinesto Los Angeles. The federal agency at the heart of these protests, Ice,is not populareither. Americans broadly reject the agency’s tactics of conducting arrests in plain clothes, stuffing people in unmarked vehicles and wearing masks to shield their identities. The public alsodisagreeswith deporting undocumented immigrants who were brought over as children, alongside policies that separate families, or actions that deny due process.Employers, meanwhile, havelobbied the White Houseto revise its policies, which seem to primarily target longstanding and gainfully employed workers rather than criminals or people free-riding on government benefits – to the detriment of core US industries.Even before the protests began,there were signsthat Americans were souring on Trump’s draconian approach to immigration, and public support hasdeclined rapidlysince the protests started on 6 June.Whether the demonstrations ultimately lead to still moreerosion of public support for Trump or continued declines inpublic support for immigrationwill likely depend less on whether the demonstrations continue to escalate than on whom the public ultimately blames for any escalation that occurs.At present, it’s not looking good for the White House.Musa al-Gharbi is a sociologist in the School of Communication and Journalism at Stony Brook University.

Communities across the country have had enough.Theprotests in Los Angeleshave invited a long overdue conversation about the true nature of the US immigration system. While the immediate catalysts for the protests were ramped upIce raidsattempting to meet Donald Trump’s arbitrary deportationquotas, the protests spring from a deeper history.In reality, the protests reflect decades-long frustrations with an abusive immigration system designed to dehumanize immigrants, weaken workers and keep wealth flowing upward. Ice’s recent tactics were only the last straw.Excellent articles have shed light on why Los Angeles in particular, with generations ofimmigrant communitiesand ahistory of immigrant rightsmovements, has emerged as an epicenter of resistance. Whether immigrants themselves, or families, neighbors, coworkers, or friends of immigrants, people in these communities have long experienced the trauma of a system that renders people “illegal” just for doing basic things like getting a job. Similar statements could be made for other major sites of protest such asNew Jersey,New York,Chicago,DenverandHouston.How would recent events in America appear if they happened elsewhere? | Moira DoneganRead moreWhile much of the news coverage has turned toward the US president’s mobilization of themilitaryand what that means for his growingauthoritariantendencies, this is only half the story. To fully understand what is at stake in the protests, we can’t lose sight of the thing that drove people to protest in the first place: a violently unfair immigration system that is an affront to us all.It is worth noting that this immigration system is not an original component of US governance. Whereas the first government under the US constitution formed in 1789, there were no federal immigration laws until the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and even this law was limited in the sense that it banned a specific class of immigrants. The US did not have closed borders until the Immigration Act of 1924, which established national origins quotas across the board.The primary justifications for these early immigration laws were xenophobia, eugenics, and overt racism. By the 1990s, however, multinational corporations understood that closed borders – especially combined with free trade agreements freeing multinational companies to shop around for “cheap” workers, while at the same time constraining the options of workers to move around and look for better jobs – were a powerful weapon in their arsenal to squeeze ever more profit out of global supply chains. While cleverly hidden behind discourses of “security” and “sovereignty,” our immigration system is actually a scam rigged to guarantee an upward flow of wealth at the cost of human rights.The North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) illustrates this dynamic. Signed in 1992, Nafta created a free trade zone among Mexico, Canada and the US, specifically making it easier for goods, capital and corporations to move freely while conspicuously ignoring the movement of workers. Far from an oversight, as the scholarBill Ong Hing has written, this was the whole point of the agreement.While no US labor unions or other human rights representatives had a seat at the table, the US advisory committee for trade and negotiations – composed almost entirely of representatives of multinational corporations – led the negotiations, ensuring that the agreement followed corporate interests. The drafters wanted easier access to cheaper Mexican labor, but they understood that if Mexicans had the same rights as companies to cross borders in search of better opportunities, then the “invisible hand” of supply and demand might make this labor less cheap. Accordingly, immigration restrictions helped to rig the game. In line with these interests, the Clinton administration, in power when the agreement took effect in 1994, not only went along with the plan to leave immigrants out of the deal, but also doubled down on closed borders with harsh new measures to restrict immigration through the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996.Ultimately, Nafta and the IIRIRA worked hand-in-hand to trap Mexican workers and give artificial negotiating advantages to multinational corporations. The mechanism made sure that Mexicans would have to either stay put on their side of the border and tolerate whatever working conditions were available, or live without legal status if they did “vote with their feet” to seek better opportunities in the US. In either case, they were far more vulnerable to exploitation. Unsurprisingly, thisharmed workersall around, especially Mexicans, leading tostagnant wages,harsh workingconditions, and irregular migration that forced people into an exploitative informal economy, even asproductivityand corporate profits soared.Significantly,Naftawas not an isolated case, but rather an embodiment of how the US immigration system enshrines this major power imbalance between labor and capital. In fact, the same Clinton administration and private sector advisory committee that oversaw the implementation Nafta also played a key role in creating the World Trade Organization in 1995 following similar principles. Today, multinational corporations continue to move freely around the world, while people seeking a better life continue to face restrictive borders enforced by state violence.The Guardian view on Trump and deportation protests: the king of confected emergencies | EditorialRead moreAt the same time, we as taxpayers pay increasingly absurd sums of money for the violent border security measures that keep this system in place. TheAmerican Immigration Councilhas calculated that since 1994, the annual budget for the US Border Patrol has risen from $400m dollars to more than $7bn in 2024 – an increase of over 700% even when factoring in inflation. They further estimate that since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, the federal government has spent more than $400bn dollars on the various agencies that carry out immigration enforcement.Under the current Trump administration, these numbers are set to soar even further. In the same “big, beautiful” spending bill that is already facing backlash for slashing public programs while offering enormous tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, a massive increase in spending for Trump’s signature deportation plan is included. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that this will add $168bn to the deficit over the next five years – already an extreme amount – though theCato Institutehas noted that the CBO calculation left out key variables. In fact, Cato finds that the number could actually be closer to $1tn.In short, our immigration system is a massive grift. It divides communities, separates families, hurts workers, and subjects people to state violence for doing normal things like working at anItalian restaurantor going to church onMother’s Day. And we as taxpayers subsidize the companies profiting on this abusive system.As I have previously written, the Trump administration has distinguished itself from previous governments by intentionally targetinglegal immigrants. However, as protesters flood the streets with signs saying “No One is Illegal,” the deeper significance of this protest movement becomes clear. The message is that someone’s right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness shouldn’t depend on their immigration status. And it certainly shouldn’t depend on the whims of multinational corporations who have essentially coopted violent border enforcement for their own profits.As a final thought, I think people are also tired of all the gaslighting. Despite the barrage ofofficial rhetoricclaiming that tough immigration measures are for our own good – that they make ourcommunities safer, that theyprotect jobs, that we shouldn’t feel bad because immigrants don’t deserve to be treated as we would want to be treated ourselves – we know from both academic analysis and our lived experiences that these are all vicious lies, and the policies that spring from these lies havedeadlyconsequences for real human beings. For me, the recent protests demonstrate that communities across the country are standing up to reject these lies.As I think about the significance of this movement, I am reminded of a passage from Karla Cornejo Villavicencio’s 2020 bookThe Undocumented Americans. Reflecting on the power of storytelling as a counterweight to the deluge of dehumanizing assaults immigrants face on a daily basis, she concludes: “What if this is how, in the face of so much sacrilege and slander, we reclaim our dead?”People are protesting because they are fed up. And they are right to be.Daniel Mendiola is a professor of Latin American history and migration studies at Vassar CollegeExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionNaftaUS domestic policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpBill ClintonUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But it doesn’t resonate with young sports fans in the United States the way it once did.Fans of a sport – particularly, team sports - develop lifelong allegiances at an early age and often pass it on to their children. There was a time when fathers and sons in America sat down in front of a television set together and watched Gillette Friday Night Fightsor boxing on weekend afternoons. Now, if they sit down together at all, they watch football.Boxing’s proponents point to statistics that showthe average boxing fan in the United States is youngerthan the average fan of many other sports (including football and baseball). But they’re talking about fish in a much smaller pond. There are far fewer young boxing fans in America than there are young fans of any major sport. That means there are fewer young boxing fans who will grow up to be old ones, and pass down their passion to the next generation.Boxing, perhaps more than any other sport, cherishes and relies on its history to build a following. Young people today care less about the history of sports than earlier generations did. Boxing fans in America talk more about fights from years ago than about fights today. The sport’s most recognizable figures are old – Mike Tyson, Don King, Michael Buffer and, until recently,George Foreman.The nature of boxing also makes it difficult to build a young following. Children often become fans of a sport because they play it from an early age. They play baseball in the park, football in the street, and basketball in the schoolyard. Tennis and golf are more exclusive, but many children find a way to play them. Kids might get into an occasional fight. But virtually none of them box.Added to this, boxing is largely inaccessible to young fans as an in-person spectator sport. Adolescents root for their school teams. Going to a high school football or basketball game accentuates the feeling that they’re part of a group. There are no high school boxing teams. Very few young people have the opportunity to actually go to a fight.The powers that be in boxing have exacerbated these conditions by adopting an economic model that cuts off the sport’s flagship events and most popular fighters from potential fans. The NFL, NBA, and Major League Baseball prioritize reaching a large audience in their television and streaming deals. But there’s no easy access to big-time boxing in the United States today without paying for it. And young people don’t expect to pay – let alone, pay a lot - for online content.Equally troubling, the multitude of world sanctioning bodies and “championship” belts of dubious provenance means that young people (and older fans too) don’t know who the real champions are.And championships are important. Other sports culminate in the Super Bowl, World Series, NBA finals, Stanley Cup, Olympics, World Cup, US Open, NCAA tournaments, and other events that fire the imagination and produce legitimate champions.Too many of today’s boxing “champions” have been maneuvered to their titles by the payment of sanctioning fees and mismatches against weak opponents. The Los Angeles Lakers couldn’t go to NBA commissioner Adam Silver this year and say, “We just lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the play-offs. But LeBron James is a big name and we’ll pay you X amount of money if you sanction us to play against the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA finals.”Young people are particularly susceptible to suggestion. They can be coaxed into buying a lot of things through clever marketing. But they don’t buy sports that bore them. And too many of today’s fights – let’s be honest – are boring mismatches. College football fans tolerate Alabama v Louisiana-Monroe as the second game of the season because they know that, later in the year, the Crimson Tide will play Georgia, LSU, and Oklahoma. If 90% of college football games were on a par with Alabama v Louisiana-Monroe, college football would be far less popular than it is today.An unfair decision at the end of a fight sours viewers and makes watching the event a less satisfactory experience than would otherwise be the case. Incompetent and, in some instances, corrupt judging alienates boxing fans of all ages.Then there’s the difficulty of actually watching the fights. Today’s flagship bouts generally aren’t contested until close to midnight on the East Coast. Can you imagine an NFL game starting at midnight eastern time and costing $89.99 to watch? I didn’t think so.The facts speak for themselves. HBO, Showtime, and the four major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX) all played a significant role in boxing. Now they’ve all walked away from the sport.Former Showtime Sports president Stephen Espinoza says that boxing has traditional strength in Black and Latino households (which skew younger than the overall sports audience) and that, in recent years, boxing has seen a rise in the young white demographic. But these inroads with a new generation, Espinoza notes, “seem to be a function of influencer boxing with Jake Paul leading the charge.”An influencer like Paul standing out is unsurprising, and says a lot about boxing’s limited appeal. Young people understand who the great athletes are in other sports. Ask kids to name an active professional boxer today and they’re more likely to name Jake Paul thanTerence Crawford.That said; traditional promoters have reservations about fights involving Paul and his influencer brethren. Eddie Hearn jumpstarted social-media-influencer boxing in the United States in 2019 when he promoted Logan Paul v KSI on Dazn.“I made money but I hated it,” Hearn says, looking back on that venture. “The build-up was great. The numbers were great. But the product wasn’t.”Hearn also notes that college sports have a tiny audience in the UK but siphon off a huge amount of fan allegiance among young people in the United States, some of which would otherwise be devoted to boxing.Meanwhile, Frank Warren points a finger at American promoters and maintains, “We have a great young audience for boxing in the UK. That’s because we promote fighters in their home areas. We build their fan base among their contemporaries in pubs and wherever else they might be, and it spreads from there. It’s called promotion. When you do four-wall deals [events where the promoter moves into a venue but leaves the promoting largely to others] the way they’re done in America, people stop promoting.”View image in fullscreenAustralian heavyweight prospect Teremoana Samson Junior Leon Teremoana has a star quality that will never go out of style.Photograph: Adam Hunger/Getty ImagesMost pre-fight promotion for big fights in the United States is cookie-cutter and boring. There’s a formulaic kick-off press conference. Then the fighters disappear except for (maybe) a media workout and some tepid media releases from training camp. Fight week arrives. A “grand arrival” (which isn’t very grand) is followed by a formulaic final pre-press conference and phony weigh-in (the real weigh-in having been conducted hours earlier behind closed doors).The best way to reach young people is through the internet. A handful of individual fighters have capitalized on social media. And promoters like Matchroom, Queensberry, and Top Rank maintain an active social media presence. But there have been no effective social media campaigns on behalf of boxing as a whole because no one is looking out for the overall good of the sport in the way that the central governing authorities in other sports do.“There’s no cohesive strategy, no central organization coordinating the demographic information and outreach,” Espinoza says. “To do that, you’d need the major promoters to turn over their information to one entity, and that’s unlikely to happen.”And just because boxing is moving to streaming doesn’t mean that it will reach the youth market. When PBC signed its deal with Amazon in late-2023, the reaction was, “This will be big!” But there hasn’t been much of a marketing push from Amazon, and PBC’s fights have attracted a disappointingly small audience.But for all the sport’s flaws, walking into an arena on fight night and seeing a boxing ring illuminated beneath bright shining lights is akin to entering a magical kingdom. That’s what Reece Chapman, a 16-year-old from Helena, Montana, saw when he entered the Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night for Matchroom’s fight cardheadlined by Richardson Hitchens v George Kambosos.Montana isn’t known for boxing. The only fight of note to occur there took place more than a century ago (on 4 July 1923) when Jack Dempsey decisioned Tommy Gibbons in Shelby. The event was a financial disaster. Four local banks that backed the venture were forced into bankruptcy.Only two professional fight cards were contested in Montana in 2024, two in 2023, one in 2022, and none so far this year. Fights in Montana are regulated by the neighboring Wyoming Combat Sports Commission.Reece, then 13 years old, went to his first fight when Top Rank promoted an eight-bout card at the Hulu Theater on 30 October 2022. A word of disclosure here. I’m his great-uncle. I brought him. He was into the scene. (“It’s really cool; how fast the fighters’ hands are; how focused they are; the way they move around the ring”). And enthralled as the night wore on (“I’ve never seen anything like this … This is really really cool … Wow! Wow! Wow!”).This past week, Reece was in New York and had a more immersive boxing experience. With the help of Anthony Leaver (Matchroom’s head of US media), he was credentialed to attend fight week activities for the Hitchens-Kambosos card and the fights themselves.Reece watches Top Rank boxing on ESPN with his father. But Top Rank’s contract with the cable giant ends next month and won’t be renewed. There are a few active fighters who Reece knows of and likes. But not many. He can tell you who plays quarterback for his favorite college and pro football teams but came up short on naming Oleksandr Usyk as heavyweight champion of the world. His classmates in school are far more focused on MMA than boxing; in large part because of UFC’s social media outreach. Last year’s encounter betweenMike Tysonand Jake Paul was the first boxing match that his contemporaries were excited about. Reece watched it on Netflix and thought it was “stupid” but that the Katie Taylor v Armanda Serrano co-feature was “great.”On Thursday, Reece attended the final pre-fight press conference at Madison Square Garden and gave it a mixed review. He liked the glimpse it gave him of each fighter’s personality and particularly liked Australian heavyweight prospect Teremoana Samson Junior Leon Teremoana. Then Hitchens and Kambosos got into an ugly shoving match with the usual profanities. That struck Reece as (here’s that word again) “stupid”.Reece also attended the Friday weigh-in and arrived at MSG on fight night with a sense of anticipation.In terms of outcome, the fights went as expected. The fighters in the red corner were all (to use one of Hearn’s favorite words) “massive” underdogs. The favorite didn’t just win every fight. The favorite won every round.Reece was captivated by David Diamante, who has become part of Matchroom’s branding and (no disrespect to Michael Buffer) is his favorite ring announcer. He also noted, “Being at the fights makes me understand how hard the fighters hit and how much skill is involved.”The most impressive performances of the evening were turned in by Andy Cruz and Richardson Hitchens. But Teremoana, who fought in the fourth bout of the evening, was the fighter who most captured Reece’s attention.Teremoana is a former Olympian, 6ft 6in, 265lb, articulate, friendly, and charismatic. Reece had sat in on an interview with him after the Friday weigh-in and asked several questions. At the end of the interview, they posed for a photo together. Now Teremoana was facing 9-and-0 Aleem Whitfield, who looked grossly out-of-shape but can punch a bit.Matchroom had spent generously to build a giant video screen and runway to showcase the fighters’ ring entrances. The energy level in the arena picked up considerably when Teremoana danced his way to the ring, turning an often-banal ritual into a joyous celebratory occasion. He lit up the room. The crowd (which minutes earlier hadn’t known who he was) liked him.When the bell for round one rang, Reece leaned forward with heightened anticipation. This wasn’t television, which cosmetizes the violence of a prizefight. He could see the emotions on each fighter’s face and hear punches as they landed.“I’m nervous,” he said. “I feel like I’m watching a friend.”Not to worry.Teremoana kept Whitfield at bay with his jab and backed him into a corner. Then … WHACK!!!The damage started with a Teremoana left hook that landed flush up top. The battering that followed was reminiscent of Gerry Cooney hammering a defenseless Ken Norton at Madison Square Garden four decades ago. Referee David Fields halted the carnage as a barely-conscious Whitfield slid to the canvas two minutes 28 seconds into the first round.Teremoana has star quality. And he canpunch. What happens when he has to walk through the proverbial fire in a fight? When someone takes him into deep water, will he be able to swim? And how is his chin? It will be worth watching him again to find out. When fans go to the fights, they hope to take away at least one “Wow!” moment. Teremoana was a “Wow!” moment.What most attracts young sports fans? Stars.Heavyweights with personality who can punch are a magnetic attraction. If Teremoana proves to be good enough in the ring, he’s the type of fighter boxing could build a young fan base around.Explore more on these topicsBoxingMike TysonTerence CrawfordGeorge ForemanUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Not only in confronting the horrific crimes committed against vulnerable girls in towns such as Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford and Telford, but in deciding how we respond to them as a country.The Casey reviewoffers a sobering account of institutional failure. These girls were not simply let down. They were failed by systems and individuals tasked with their protection. That must never happen again. Justice, accountability and reform are essential.I write to you as a British Muslim, a third-generation British Pakistani woman, and someone who has worked with communities across the country, to express deep concern about how this issue is being spoken about and misrepresented.You asked Lady Casey to examine ethnicity alongside “cultural and social drivers”. The review identifies disproportionate numbers of Asian men among suspects in Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. At the same time, it stresses that national data is incomplete and inconsistent. These findings are in tension. Yet the media and political response has amplified a simplified message: that there was a cover-up and that ethnicity itself was the cause.Louise Casey is right: children must be saved from grooming gangs. But the culture warriors must be ignored | Polly ToynbeeRead moreIn areas where British Pakistani communities are more populous, over-representation may reflect local demographics, not cultural traits. Without that context, statistics are easily distorted. Crime patterns often follow social conditions. They do not reveal cultural predisposition.The way this has been framed has caused widespread fear and alarm. Over the past few days, I have received messages from friends and colleagues anxious about the direction of the national conversation. Terms like “Pakistani rape gangs” or “Asian grooming gangs” have dominated headlines. Social media are awash with commentators calling for the death penalty and a ban on Pakistani migration, while asitting MP has called for deportationsin the “many, many thousands”. A complex issue is being reduced to harmful generalisations.The claim that British Pakistani culture itself is to blame for these crimes is not only untrue – it is a dangerous distortion,when child sexual exploitation and abuse affects the entire country. There is no credible evidence to suggest that ethnicity or religion are driving factors in this form of abuse. Turning this into a question of identity rather than accountability shifts attention away from the very systems that failed to protect vulnerable girls. It allows prejudice to masquerade as policy, and that cannot go unchallenged.When culture is invoked without evidence or definition, it does more than obscure the facts – it casts entire groups of people under suspicion. This has real consequences for people like me, my family and neighbours, who are being viewed not as citizens, but as potential threats. The risk now is that prejudice is embedded into policy. Institutional failures in safeguarding and accountability thus become repurposed to legitimise the collective blame of British Muslims.We have already seen what this kind of framing can provoke. Last summer,riots eruptedin cities across England and Northern Ireland, stoked by misinformation and inflammatory rhetoric.Mosques and community centres were attacked. Vehicles were stopped because drivers “looked Asian”. Just days ago, in Ballymena, there were racially motivated attacks on foreigners that “left families cowering in their homes”,according to the police, after days of disorder that left communities in fear and distress. Even in Liverpool, after a car was driven into fans gathered for a football parade, police were quick to confirm the suspect’s ethnicity, a reflection of how heightened the atmosphere has become, and the fear that misinformation could spark race-related unrest. This is the climate in which any government intervention now sits. The need for not just reason and calm but a principled defence of minority communities, of fairness and proportion, is urgent.The pain of the survivors must remain at the centre of this conversation. Justice for them is non-negotiable. We must also not forget that some victims came from the very minority communities that are now under scrutiny. Their experiences are often erased. The perpetrators did not care who their victims were. Their motives were abuse, control and exploitation.The Casey review presents an opportunity to strengthen safeguarding and rebuild trust. We can only do that if we stay grounded in evidence, not prejudice, and in responsibility, not rhetoric.The forthcoming inquiry must examine how these crimes were allowed to happen, how institutions failed to respond and how to prevent such abuse in future. It must not allow the story to become one of racialised suspicion. That path leads not to justice, but to division.British Muslims, like all citizens, want justice and safety. We want our institutions to act fairly and with integrity. What we do not want is to be made to feel complicit in crimes we did not commit.Criminals must face the law, whoever they are.Zara Mohammed is former secretary-general of the Muslim Council of BritainDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Beads of sweat form over her forehead. Her burning ears might warm my still-cold fingers. But most notable is her expression, changing from composed to flustered in a split second. She is like a defeated firefighter, battling to bring the conflagration under control before resorting to simply biding her time.“Sorry about that,” she grimaces.My patient’s cancer was curable but for years she endured painful sex. This story is all too familiar | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreGoing by the clock at the bottom of my screen, the “event” takes two minutes from start to finish. In that time I have had a front seat to a dramatic version of the adverse effect that oncologists often mention in passing to breast cancer patients using anti-oestrogen therapy.“How often do you experience this?”“A dozen times on a good day,” she shrugs.Roughly three-quarters of breast cancers are oestrogen-receptor positive, which means the cancer cells are stimulated by oestrogen. Women with this type of cancer benefit from oestrogen suppression, achieved via different methods including a pill, an injection and removal of the ovaries. This induces menopause in younger women and more complete oestrogen suppression in the already menopausal.With more than 20,000 Australian women and 2 million women worldwide diagnosed with breast cancer every year, anti-oestrogen medication is akin to the penicillin of oncology. Each week, I write, renew and replace multiple scripts.But while every prescriber mentions the anticipated side-effect of hot flushes, it strikes me that no one (including me) quite explains the living horror that many patients go on to experience.Why is that?Women who have concluded an arduous trek of chemotherapy and radiation for early breast cancer express the hope of “never having to go through this again”.Women with metastatic breast cancer harbour the hope that their cancer, while not curable, may remain at bay for years.Every woman’s risk profile warrants a tailored conversation but, broadly speaking, imagine giving this advice: “There is an effective medication to reduce recurrence risk and improve survival. Over the many years you will be on it, youcould experiencehot flushes, stiff joints, disturbed sleep, low mood, weight gain and sexual dysfunction.”If it sounds like punishment served at the end of a punishing diagnosis, it is. However, when a drug works, oncologists want to encourage adherence and hope that the side-effects either don’t occur or can be managed.“Vasomotor symptoms”, the medical term for hot flushes, affect up to 90% of women with breast cancer and are often severe. Up to half of all women prescribed anti-oestrogen medication stop taking the drug – and they are just the ones who tell us. Every oncologist knows the heart-sink moment when a high-risk patient declines treatment. But we also know all too well the toll that led them to do so.Given the ubiquitous nature of hot flushes, the lack of good treatments is frustrating. Of the panoply of advertised options such as cognitive behavioural therapy, acupuncture, hypnosis, diet, exercise and off-label use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants, none has been shown to help in a meaningful way.Then there is the irony of taking one medication to counter the side-effect of another and gaining weight and its associated complications in the process.As a result, most women just put up with the trailing cost of having breast cancer.Now, there is hope. In arandomised controlled trialof drug versus placebo, a once-daily pill meaningfully reduced hot flushes in women taking anti-oestrogen therapy for breast cancer.Elinzanetantworks by affecting the brain signals involved in temperature regulation.At baseline, women experienced a mean of a dozen daily episodes. By one month, 61% of women on active treatment reported a reduction of at least 50% in the daily frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flushes compared with 27% on placebo. Sleep quality improved, as did overall quality of life. Crossover from placebo to the active drug resulted in similar findings.No drug is without side-effects. More than 60% of women in each group reported at least one mild adverse event but severe ones were rare. Somnolence, fatigue and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in the active therapy group but they can also be caused by cancer therapy. More than 90% of women who completed one year of treatment chose to continue for an optional two years, suggesting a high rate of acceptability.The experts: oncologists on the simple, doable, everyday things they do to try to prevent cancerRead moreThe drug is yet unapproved and oncologists will seek more details before widespread prescribing.Breast cancer outcomes are poorer in non-white women but 88% of the participants were white. Will this drug be effective in, and tolerable for, all eligible patients.Does taking the “remedy” drug improve adherence to the primary one that reduces cancer risk? This would be the point of prescribing it.Finally, patients on clinical trials are strictly selected and heavily monitored. Will the real-world experience match the clinical trial experience? We know that it rarely does.On the way out, I commend my patient’s determination to persevere with difficult treatment, and she smiles gratefully at the acknowledgement.She is only two years into treatment. I allow myself to envision a day when there will be room for reprieve.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

But one of those connections – ceremonial medicine known ashayakwaska– is now marketed as a mystical shortcut to healing and enlightenment. Behind the scenes of these “healing retreats” lies a deeper story of cultural erasure, linguistic distortion and ongoing colonisation masked as wellness.The global popularity of “ayahuasca” has given rise to a new form of spiritual tourism that romanticises and distorts Indigenous cultures. This growing industry fuels the exoticisation of Indigenous peoples, turning our languages, practices and identities into consumable fantasies for outsiders. Sacred rituals are stripped of context, spiritual roles are commercialised, and even the names of the plants are misused, reducing complex cultural systems into simplified, marketable experiences.Ayameans the soul of a dead person, skeleton, or corpse. The term ayahuasca is a modern invention, largely used in spiritual tourism. In our language, we say “hayakata upina” when referring to drinking hayakwaska.Hayakis a short form of hayakwaska and directly means bitter, so the translation means drinking the “bitter vine”. In contrast, “ayata upina” would mean “to drink the soul of a dead person”, which no one would say. For this reason, I will use the correct term: hayakwaska.The ancient psychedelics myth: ‘People tell tourists the stories they think are interesting for them’Read moreEven the name of the medicine has been distorted. To understand it properly, one must understand our society, its structure, language and deep ties to the land. Unlike English or Spanish, Indigenous languages such as our Runashimi (Kichwa) are rooted in place. Like modern science, our knowledge is based on observation, but through relationships. We live through a social-emotional relationship with the land. In the rainforest, all beings, including humans and the more-than-human world, have roles and responsibilities.Although ouryachaks(traditional healers) may treat individuals, their true role is to maintain balance within the community and among relationships between people, forests and all beings. Healing, in our worldview, is collective because we are all interconnected. Whenyachaksfocus only on “ayahuasca” tourism for profit, abandoning this sacred responsibility, we must ask: what have they become? Tourist-oriented healing centres often prioritise individual experiences, personal growth, ego work and private revelations, detached from community, land and reciprocity. When healing is stripped of its collective foundation, it no longer nourishes true awakening. Instead, it risks becoming a performance that elevates the self, not the whole, opposing the very essence of Indigenous healing, which is rooted in relationship, humility and shared wellbeing.It is not just sad, it is dangerous. When spiritual practices are altered to please outsiders, it shifts the very meaning ofhayakand the relationship we have with it. These changes reshape how younger generations understand our traditions, not through lived experience or guidance from elders, but through performances tailored for tourism. What was once sacred, genuine and real becomes scripted. The danger lies not only in losing the essence of our ceremonies but in distorting our collective memory, values and roles. When healing becomes entertainment, and culture becomes spectacle, the spiritual thread that holds our community together begins to fray.Hayakwaska tourism is also a driver of illegal hunting practices. Traditional hunting is rooted in respect and reciprocity, but today commercial demand for animal parts threatens both species and Indigenous ways of life, and this growing tourism industry not only distorts culture but also fuels threats to biodiversity.Recent research highlights how jaguars,already a near threatened species, are being exploited to meet tourist demand. Items such as jaguar-tooth pendants and skin bracelets are sold as mystical enhancers of the ayahuasca experience, endangering both wildlife and sacred balance.View image in fullscreenNina Gualinga in the Guardian documentary, Waska.Photograph: Nina Gualinga/The GuardianUsing Indigenous knowledge and medicine carries deep social and environmental responsibility. Without that responsibility, it becomes nothing more than extractivism, another form of colonialism dressed in spiritual language. The real question is: How are “ayahuasca tourists” giving back? Are they supporting Indigenous rights, protecting ancestral lands, and standing with the people who safeguard this wisdom, often at great personal risk? Too many seek healing from Indigenous medicines while ignoring the lived realities of those who protect the plants, the knowledge, and the territories they come from. These communities continue their struggle amid threats from mining, oil extraction and agribusiness.If there is to be any true healing, it must include justice, reciprocity and solidarity with the people and the land from which this medicine grows.Inspired by their stories and our experiences, I, Nina, createdWaska: The Forest is My Family. The film explores the exploitation of Indigenous peoples and the forest. As the granddaughter of a yachak, I wanted to share what it means to live connected to hayakwaska and the land.Nina Gualinga and Eli Virkina are both Indigenous women of the Ecuadorian Amazon, storytellers and land defendersDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I’ve marched against apartheid, wasarrested for defendingExtinction Rebellion’s right to peacefully protest, have campaigned for warm homes with Friends of the Earth, worked with peace-builders in war-torn northern Uganda and more. I’ve spent my life fighting for a fairer, greener world.And today, as a member of parliament andGreen partyco-leadership candidate alongside Adrian Ramsay, I’m more convinced than ever that the power and hope of activism must go hand in hand with electoral nous to win the change we need at the heart of our politics.Because the stakes couldn’t be higher.We face an accelerating climate and nature crisis, soaring inequality in everything from health to housing, and a government complicit in genocide. Disillusionment with politicsis at record levels.After years of Conservative chaos, people hoped Labour would bring real change. Instead, it’s doubling down on the damage: cutting support to the most vulnerable, refusing to tax extreme wealth, rowing back on climate action andtrashing protections for the natural world. They may not call it austerity, but it feels the same.It’s no wonder Nigel Farage and Reform UK are exploiting this opportunity, sowing division and channelling justified anger at inequality into misdirected hate. And it’s more urgent than ever that we step up with credible solutions.This is the defining political battle of our time: hope v fear. The Green party can and must lead a hopeful fightback, offering a genuine alternative and a home for voters who feel abandoned by Labour and the Tories.People trust the Greens – polling shows we now havehigher favourability ratingsthan any other party. Under the leadership of Carla Denyer and Adrian, we’ve had our most successful electoral period,quadrupling our number of MPsand almost doubling our number of councillors. We’ve built the foundation. Now it’s time to build the transformation.View image in fullscreenEllie Chowns and Adrian RamsayAdrian and I are standing to be co-leaders of the Green party with one simple aim: to win enough Green MPs to be able to shape government policy after the next general election. In our skewed electoral system, that means building a broad coalition of voters – reaching out well beyond our traditional base, not just preaching to the choir. And that’s exactly what Adrian and I know how to do.We’ve been campaigners all our lives. Adrian joined the Greens at 16 and became one of the youngest councillors in the UK. He played a key part in creating the party’s “target to win” strategy that has transformed our electoral fortunes.I joined in 2015, compelled by the rise of Farage’s politics of division. I couldn’t bear to see his brand of political poison seeping into the lifeblood of my country. And in July last year, I overturned a Conservative majority of almost 25,000 to become MP for North Herefordshire –one of the biggest electoral swingsin UK history.Let’s be clear: it’s entirely possible that Greens at Westminster could play a pivotal role in a hung parliament and help shape the next government. Green parties around the world – in Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland and Finland – have successfully grown their vote and won real power in government.We need to be laser-focused on our goal: to convert the support we have in the community into leverage at the centre of political power. For that, we need leadership with the experience and credibility to win new voters over, and then convert that mandate into policy wins.As MPs, Adrian and I are already speaking out in parliament every day, challenging injustice and bringing the voice of grassroots campaigns into the parliamentary system. We’re insurgents with integrity, campaigners with a platform in the Commons.Our leadership campaign is about turning protest into political change: empowering local teams, raising national ambition, and growing a party that’s ready for power in parliament and in councils, communities and coalitions across the country.We believe the Green party can and must take on Reform and win. Not by aping the divisive “populist” rhetoric of Farage, but by connecting with the broadest possible range of people and showing that Green policies embody their aspirations for a fairer country and a livable future.And that’s where our record matters. Adrian and I have won multiple first-past-the-post elections by inspiring huge teams of activists. We know what it takes to win in, and then to transform, our broken political system.Again and again, we’ve found that our values correspond with deep wellsprings of compassion and solidarity among people in every community and demographic. That’s why we know that we can grow the Green party even faster.So to every Green party member considering this election, I say: let’s not walk away from the success that we’ve built and the trust that we’ve won.As other parties react to the crises we face by sliding ever deeper into magical thinking and empty rhetoric, we need a Green leadership that’s firmly rooted in our values, unafraid to speak truth and ready to act on it. Divisive populist politics is a recipe for chaos and failure. By turning widely shared green values into many more Green votes, the Green party can and must be the antidote.Ellie Chowns is the MP for North HerefordshireExplore more on these topicsGreen partyOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

So do countries. And over the past few days, Israel’s attacks have dramatically changed Iran’s trajectory.Some believe that Iran was already on a downward spiral and that Israel’s actions will simply accelerate the descent. In anop-ed published on Monday, several of Iran’s most prominent civil society figures, including Nobel peace prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, declared that the “only credible path to safeguard [Iran] and its people is the resignation of the current leadership”. In this view, the war could be construed as a deliverance – Israeli officials areopenly suggestingthat their operations could lead to regime change in Iran. But if Iran’s decline was already precipitous, why are ordinary Iranians terrified by the outbreak of war? Why have they not welcomed Benjamin Netanyahu as the saviour he imagines himself to be?The answer is that Israel is harming, not improving Iran’s trajectory, the arc of which had recentlybeen bent upwards through the persistent efforts of the Iranian people.Iranhas long undershot its potential, held back by a sclerotic and oppressive government that has failed to undertake necessary reforms. Yet despite many headwinds, the country has been experiencing slow but steady improvements in its political, economic and social conditions over the past few years. Iran’s people have been successfully pushing back against the authoritarian tendencies of the leaders in Tehran. Now they have been thrust into a war devised by an authoritarian leader in Jerusalem.When the hardliner presidentEbrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crasha little over a year ago, Iran’s political establishment reconsidered whether the authoritarian consolidation that had taken place during his term had been worthwhile. Manipulation of elections and brutal suppression of protests had left Iran’s ruling elite distrusted and unpopular. Iran’s current president, Masoud Pezeshkian, was elected to repair Iran’s social contract. Hisfirst speechas president included an important admission. “We make promises, and we fail to fulfil them,” he said, acknowledging the degraded legitimacy of the Islamic Republic. Less than a year into his tenure, and until the fateful events of the last few days, Pezeshkian had made some modest progress in trying to regain the trust of the electorate.Iran’s leaders have had to acknowledge the power and perseverance of Iranian women, who mobilised during theWomen, Life, Freedom movementin 2022 and never looked back. When the Iranian parliament passed a draconian mandatory veiling law late last year, Pezeshkiandescribed itas an “unjust law”, a confession that the Islamic Republic will itself remain unjust so long as it fails to protect the rights of women. No longer a fringe issue, women’s rights are now at the forefront of the fight for political renewal in Iran.Pezeshkian had also presided over a modest economic recovery, though he does not deserve credit for it. Despite the pressure of US sanctions, Iran’s economy had returned to growth, owing to the resourcefulness of the managerial class and resilience of the workforce. But in recent months, inflation rebounded, and the country was rocked by major protests over controversial fuel subsidy reforms, underscoring the need for better management of the economy. On Monday, Iran’s parliament confirmed Seyed Ali Madanizadeh, a young economist trained at Stanford University and the University of Chicago, would become economy minister. In aninterview last week, Madanizadeh stated that economic reforms “are not something that can happen without bringing people on board and opening up a dialogue with the public”.But it is in the space of foreign policy that Iran’s course has altered most dramatically. Six years of intensive dialogue with regional neighbours, especially the UAE and Saudi Arabia, has led to renewed ties. In just the last few months, Tehran hosted the emir of Qatar, the diplomatic adviser to the president of the UAE, and the defence minister of Saudi Arabia. The new regional policywas summed upby the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, when he stated: “Our neighbours are our priority.”Even Iran’s relationships with its proxies have changed. Iranmoderated its support for the Houthisas part of a deal reached with Saudi Arabia in March 2023. More recently, the fall of Bashar al-Assad and Israel’s hobbling of Hamas and Hezbollah were strategic setbacks for Iran. But these events also gave rise to arobust debateamong Iran’s national security leaders about whether the “forward defence” strategy, rather than making Iran more secure, had given rise to anti-Iranian sentiment across the region, while still leaving Iran vulnerable to attack.Finally, and most consequentially, Iran was negotiating a nuclear deal with the US. The seriousness of these negotiations should be underlined. President Donald Trumptore up the nuclear deal in 2018at a time whenIran was in full compliancewith its commitments. He reimposed sanctions, pushed Iran’s economy back into steep recession, and brought the region to the brink of war byassassinating Gen Qassem Suleimaniin January 2020.Not long after Trump was inaugurated for his second term, Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, callednegotiations with the United States “unwise”. But senior officials, including Pezeshkian, Araghchi and parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, pushed back. They may have done so because of personal convictions, but they probably recognised that the Iranian people aretired of enmity with the US, which has left Iran isolated and embattled.The first round of negotiations took place on 12 April. Four subsequent rounds were conducted in just two months – the progress was evident enough that even Israeli officials werebriefing journaliststhat a deal between Iran and the US was “likely”. A sixth round of negotiations was slated to take place on Sunday in Oman. Those talks were cancelled after Israel’s attacks, which Trump cheered.The Iranian people have struggled for over a century against forces of authoritarianism, which can seem endemic in the Middle East. At numerous junctures, foreign intervention has undermined their efforts. In 1911, a constitutional revolution was crushed with the intervention of Russian troops. In 1953, Iran’s elected government was ousted in a coupengineered by the CIA and MI6. In 1980, the course of the Islamic Revolution was altered when Saddam Hussein invaded Iran. In 2018, Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, dooming Iran’s once influential and popular reformist movement, which had staked so much on the promise of sanctions relief.With each of these setbacks, ordinary Iranians persisted. Until a few days ago, something was shifting in Iran. Tentatively but noticeably, the country was moving in a better direction, pushed and pulled by 90 million souls yearning for greater security, prosperity and liberty.Seen in this context, Israel’s attacks demonstrate a contempt not just for life – thecivilian death tollin Iran is mounting – but also a contempt for the agency and aspirations of the Iranian people. They did not want this war and they werepushing their leaders to avoid it, but Israel chose to attack to prevent a new nuclear agreement between the US and Iran.The Iranian people are no longer in control of their futures, and they find themselves watching the trajectories of ballistic missiles, wondering what could have been.Esfandyar Batmanghelidj is the founder of the Bourse & Bazaar Foundation thinktankExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionIsraelMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

The “social” part of this refers to homes rented out by public housing departments and not-for-profit community housing providers to very low-income Australians, usually at 25% of the tenant’s income.But,as highlighted by Guardian Australia, the growing class of “affordable rental housing” is less clearly defined. In general terms, it is a product that targets the growing population of low-to-moderate-income workers earning above the rock bottom income eligibility thresholds for a social tenancy, but who are hard-pressed to find a suitable home in the private market.The main problem this product seeks to solve is that our private rental sector has been “going upmarket” for decades. That is, generating fewer and fewer homes affordable to people in the lowest two-fifths of the income spectrum – including those in the second income quintile, ineligible for social housing.Wealthy Australians are worried we might realise how rigged the system is in their favour | Greg JerichoRead moreCensus-based evidenceshows that, as a result, Australia’s national shortfall of affordable and available private rental dwellings for renters in the second income quintile almost doubled in the 15 years to 2021 – up from 87,000 dwellings to 152,000 dwellings.The problem has been exacerbated by a quarter of a century of negligible social housing growth, even as need for such accommodation has shot up thanks to rising population and inequality. Thus, as a share of our national housing stock, social housinghas declinedfrom more than 6% in the 1990s to barely 4% today.LiveHow did Australia's housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing's fault? – videoState and territory governments have been rationing remaining tenanciesever more tightlyas a result, more or less restricting these to households reliant on social security payments.This is why the low-income workers essential to the operation of the modern urban economy nowadays have next to no chance of a public or community housing tenancy. It is also one reason that Australian governments have taken a growing interest in enabling an “affordable rental housing” product that could make it possible for people in this situation to live reasonably near their work.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAt a big picture level, this is a problem that, according toconventional wisdom, can be tackled by expanding overall housing supply. But it is doubtful that “building our way out of housing unaffordability”is even possible. And, without major complementary actions, it is unimaginable that such a strategy could significantly moderate market rents in the short-to-medium-term future.At least in the meantime, there is a case for governments to enable affordable rental housing construction as well as invest in expanding social housing. They can do this in one of two ways. The first is by directly subsidising housebuilding – such as under federal programs, including the Housing Australia Future Fund (Haff), which promises20,000 new affordable rental homes by 2029.The second approach is the deployment of land-use planning or tax powers to require or incentivise private providers to include affordable rental units within market-price housing developments. TheNew South WalesandVictorianstate governments, for example, have recently introduced or beefed up “density bonus” schemes allowing developers to build higher and bigger, provided that projects include units renting at below-market prices. Using tax powers, the federal governmenthas adopted a similar approachfor Build to Rent projects.Under schemes of this type, affordable rents are typically defined relative to comparable market rents – often capped at 75-80% of local norms. When operated inhigh price areas like Sydney’s Bondi, such a formula of course produces rents that sound outrageous outside that local context.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is it possible?Read moreSuch homes might possibly assist the junior teachers, nurses and police officers so beloved of ministerial media statements, and there is an arguable case for policymaker attention to such housing needs. But this model is liable to produce rents far out of reach for low-income essential workers. And such units are, anyway, often required to be made available for only 10-15 years.But while it would be hard to justify directly funding “affordable housing” of this kind, such homes are, in fact, generally produced through planning or tax concessions that represent only indirect government support.It is to be hoped that, on equity grounds, the directly subsidised affordable rental housing to be generated under the Haff and other ongoing federal programs will be subsidised sufficiently to produce units genuinely affordable to the low-income worker (or second income quintile) cohort.Equally, equity considerations dictate that the bulk of government financial support for social and affordable housing should be devoted to the former. It is only through expanding our minimal remaining stock of deeply subsidised housing that we can similarly expand access to secure and affordable homes for the most disadvantaged Australians.The bigger picture here is that, despite the expanded social and affordable housing investment committed under the Albanese government, Australia is still spending nowhere near enough to decisively reverse decades of neglect in this area. The case for phasing down private landlord tax breaks,with the resulting additional revenue redirectedto expanding such investment, remains compelling.Hal Pawson is a professor of housing research and policy at the University of NSW and associate director of the UNSW City Futures Research Centre.

Every element stirs up a particular political bile, from those pathetically vulnerable girls and their vile exploiters, to those well-chosen cases weaponised by the Tories and Faragists with no record of concern for the general plight of children in care.It’s odd that the Tories should wade in so strenuously when they were in power for the vast majority of this sorry saga, provoking a stream of inquiries, which they mostly ignored. Labour thought the seven years and£187mof Alexis Jay’s second inquiry quite enough. So did she, echoing Keir Starmer’s preference for “action not words”, and for avoiding yet more of the analysis paralysis of the Grenfell years, the infected blood scandal and ongoing Covid inquiries, which satisfy few.A series of five local investigations was planned, starting in Oldham. Starmer sent Louise Casey to do an audit, and she has returned suggesting a novel format, with a national umbrella body to oversee local inquiries with statutory teeth to compel witnesses to come forward. “Gotcha! U-turn!” shout Reform, the Tories and their favourable front pages, fighting in the political playground regardless of the substance. U-turns, second thoughts, listening to critics and responding to new facts are usually a good thing in governments: we could do with a few more.As for U-turns, let’s not forget Boris Johnson, who called spending money on investigating child sex abuse “spaffing money up the wall”. The Tories later made him prime minister.Casey was given a free hand to “uncover the nature, scale and profile” of group child sexual exploitation, to root out evidence on offenders and their ethnicity. No surprise that she found plentiful cases where authorities had turned away, some for fear of being called racist.Last week’s trialof seven Rochdale men of Pakistani origin told the same story: of groomers raping and drugging very young girls, and showing “no remorse for their unforgivable actions”, while officialdom also treated these children as trash. Social workers dismissed witness girl B as “a prostitute”, aged 10.Blame spreads far and wide. Those seeking a culture war weapon will find it turned back on them. Atimeline in Casey’s reportfollowing some 10 inquiries makes grim reading on foot-dragging police and authorities who scorned girls’ stories: why was so little followed up?Labour has picked report recommendations to act upon: home secretary Yvette Cooper’s order to check prematurely closed cases has already re-opened more than 800. She is asking the National Crime Agency to trace missing perpetrators and toughen local police investigations. She is wiping out child victims’criminal records for prostitution, while her “Hillsborough law” gives public bodies a duty of candour, with the threat of criminal sanctions if they obstruct investigations. So-called consent by under-16s will not absolve men from rape. Children will get files linking fragmented information from the healthcare system, schools and social workers.The shadow home secretary, Chris Philp,tells Sky that“hundreds of people in positions of authority over the years deliberately covered this up. I think they are guilty of that criminal offence and frankly should be going to prison.” But who was the minister for crime and policing in the last government? He was. Kemi Badenoch was minister for children. Starmer stands by his accusation that politicians with new zeal for an inquiry are “jumping on a far-right bandwagon”: that it’s only the race element that stirs them. Cases cross Tory and Labour councils, there have been failings all round. Every minute of Starmer’s time as director of public prosecutions has been turned over, but it onlyshows his recordas the rapid accelerator of prosecutions.The bizarre intervention of Elon Musk ignited this pile-on, with his accusation that Starmer was “deeply complicit in the mass rapes in exchange for votes”,and calling Jess Phillips a “rape genocide apologist”. Musk was fired up by Labour voting down a Badenoch amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill, calling for another inquiry: a move specifically designed to make Labour’s refusal look shifty. Playing the opportunistic Westminster game, hers was a wrecking amendment to kill the whole bill – never mind that it would have knocked out astring of protections for children in care.Facts matter, but we need more of them. Casey finds that British-Pakistani men are much over-represented in some of the regional statistics that do exist for these crimes –but she also says: “The ethnicity data collected for victims and perpetrators of group-based child sexual exploitation is not sufficient to allow any conclusions to be drawn at the national level.” Both Casey and Cooper regard the figures as badly incomplete; ethnicity data was only recorded in a third of cases inthe Hydrant programme, which collates police data on perpetrators and victims.That’s inadequate, but here’s the latest from thedata that has been recorded: 83% of suspects are white, 7% Asian, 5% black. When on a radio phone-in I hear someone say this crime is “predominantly” Pakistani, they are only repeating the kind of misinformation written byRod Liddle in the Sunday Timesthis week: he calls grooming abuse “almost exclusively Muslim (and usually Pakistani) men preying almost exclusively on young white girls”.Keir Starmer bows to pressure to launch new grooming gangs investigationRead moreIndeed, men of Pakistani origin in available statistics about the perpetrators, but Richard Fewkes, the director of Hydrant,says offenders broadly reflectthe ethnic mix of the UK population: “In very general terms, what we see across all group-based offending is that no particular ethnicity stands out based on population data.” He may amend that in time, but those on the frontline worry that false facts draw attention away from wheremost child group sex abuse happens: 57% in institutions, 26% by group sex abusers within families, and 48% by other children.Be clear what is happening here. Abuse of the most vulnerable people is a matter for us all, but race is what excites the culture warriors. They show little interest in the plight of children in care. In the Tory years, the number of children in care rose from 64,400 in 2010 to 83,630 in the latest figures. Cuts to social workers, health visitors and district nurses, the loss of Sure Start and the axing of child benefits have pushed families over the edge and children into the unkind arms of the state. Can it have been anything but irony when Tories branded their children in care programme “Stable Homes, Built on Love”? The outcomes for these children are dismal and their futures bleak, after multiple placements and rapid ejection at the age of 16, alone into isolated flats. Takejust one official figure: 44% of those registered as “children in need” are persistently absent from school. Where are they? In the clutches of bad men offering drugs and fake affection?The spending review’s extra money for children in care and the children’s bill’s boost for kinship and foster carers will help, with strengthened support for care leavers, and a challenge to the astronomical profits made by private companies offering bad care. But will it be enough to lift the blight that has forever branded these children as no-hopers?Too early to say. But in the meantime, beware those politicians who are newly exercised by the plight of abused children – but only if the abusers are, say, Pakistani. Beware also the synthetic pity of so many who have until now ignored the state’s appalling treatment of the most vulnerable children in its care. Too many are opportunists seeking grotesque advantage.

So am IFatma AydemirWe’re surrounded by news images of death and violence. Why do Florentina Holzinger’s visceral stage productions still have such impact?Tue 17 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 12.15 EDTShareWhat would you do if the world was to end tomorrow? The premise itself may be both timeless and timely at this moment when authoritarianism is on the rise globally. But that’s not really what causes the nail-biting excitement at the doorstep of Volksbühne theatre in Berlin. On a chilly June evening, a predominantly female and queer crowd of all ages gathers here to see, or rather experience, A Year Without Summer, the newest play by the infamous Austrian choreographerFlorentina Holzinger. It’s the anticipation of Holzinger’s trademark body horrorthat unsettles and attracts us, the crowd. And the question: how much can we take?“Europe’s hottest director”, as theGuardian described39-year-old Holzinger last year, is not only known for her work at the Volksbühne but mesmerises and shocks audiences all over the world. Her all female-assigned cast of different ages, origins and abilities dances, bleeds, defecates and swallows swords on stage, naked.Nudity has a solid tradition in the performance arts context, and is anything but radical. But informed bysocial media, our contemporary visual habits confine the naked body to porn. If the body doesn’t belong to a cisgender man, it is an object to be censored and regulated. Seeing Holzinger on stage, however, we look at it as a weapon, a tool and sometimes a joke.A scandal arose last year, when Holzinger staged her operaSanctain Stuttgart, with rollerskating naked nuns having lesbian sex on stage. Eighteen audience members had to be treated forsevere nausea. The subsequent headlines in the international press were a badge of honour to Holzinger; she wears them printed in black letters on herwhite T-shirtwhen talking to the press: “Went to the opera, vomited.”Protests by Christian fundamentalists against Holzinger’s works have only added to the hype. All Berlin performances of A Year without Summer were sold out within minutes of its announcement. Holzinger’s shows have enormous budgets and are always co-productions involving several institutions around the globe. Her latest co-producers include Factory International, in Manchester, and Rising Melbourne, where the piece will be shown at a later time.But what is this fascination all about? How can we obsess over bleeding dancers when we seem collectively desensitised by news images of war and death? Why do we pay to see naked people taking a shit on a theatre stage? And will they do it again?What I instantly notice about the sets of A Year Without Summer is the absence of the wasteful extravagance usually associated with Holzinger. On-stage swimming pools, helicopters flying in the auditorium – the decadence of Holzinger’s previous productions is no doubt silently frowned upon by many of her colleagues. Especially in times of drastic austerity that are driving so many artists into poverty, or out of Berlin to more affordable European cities. But also, in terms of sustainability, I wonder if thousands of gallons of water in two giant tanks were really necessary to honour the mother of all water corpses, as the choreographer did in her 2022 playOphelia’s Got Talent. Necessary, maybe not. But possible, if Holzinger’s profitable name is involved.The scenery of A Year Without Summer consists, in strong contrast, of only a glass box, two trampolines, an inflatable torso and a lot of thick haze. Holzinger’s new minimalism sharpens the focus on her narrative. The story unfolds in 1816, the year after a volcano erupted in today’s Indonesia and changed the global climate for years to come. Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein, so we are told, under the ashy sky of that very first year without summer. The blend of an apocalyptic atmosphere and the creation of artificial humans is a perfect backdrop to what Holzinger and her team seem most interested in: grotesque interventions in the body.We witness butchering doctors, a fake birth out of Holzinger’s own cut-open thigh (“It’s a musical!”) and an ultimate facelift performed on a dancer hung by meat hooks piercing through their cheeks and temples. All of this is undeniably hard to watch, but also beautifully staged, like a Renaissance painting. Personal hospital stories told by cast members are merged with musical performances about racist medical science and eugenics. Immortality as the main goal of future medicine is discussed as both a conviction and salvation. Even Freud comes on stage to perform his trashy horror of the vagina, examining and declaring it as a wound caused by castration. There is really nothing subtle about that. The omnipresent question still remains compelling enough: aren’t we all monsters anyway?But then there is also tenderness, which is new to Holzinger’s work and makes this play especially intriguing. This time, the undressing of the cast is part of the performance. The imminent apocalypse at the beginning of the story gives way to a very long romantic intro, with couples dancing slowly, cuddling, making out, until they finally lie on top of each other naked and simulate an orgy. If the world was to end tomorrow, the play suggests, we should come close and warm each other.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The wild visions of Florentina HolzingerRead moreParticularly when the caresses are not of an erotic nature, they deliver much-needed utopian moments, between all the splatter and jokey scenes. Several cast members are elderly people in wheelchairs, who towards the end of the show are being cared for affectionately by other dancers, whose props indicate they are nurses and doctors. This quite extensive scene of generosity and gratitude gets suspiciously heartwarming, until the patients start defecating in streams and turn this idyllic moment of compassion into a horror depiction of plain humanness. The mere presence of brown fluids instantly makes us uncomfortable. The nurses start vomiting the same liquid (out of oxygen tubes filled with paint) and get all tangled up while trying to clean up the mess. Tissues of fake faeces are thrown at the audience. Few spectators leave the room. Most are in awe of this incarnation of the contradictory nature of vulnerability: it’s lovable and disgusting and horrifying and banal at the same time.What follows this mess is a very touching climax, the end that says “No End” on two big screens. All lights stay on. The ambivalent immortality theme is embodied by the 82-year-old former ballerinaBeatrice Cordua, who sits in a wheelchair now and has told the audience earlier in the show that she will soon die from lung cancer and how sad she is about it. For the applause, Holzinger pushes Cordua’s wheelchair to the front. A teary-eyed audience gives the terminally ill ballerina a last standing ovation. She blows a kiss at us and leaves, while an ice skater turns endless pirouettes on a small square of ice.We’re not monsters, I think to myself. We are just mortal and fascinated by how ambiguous that feels.Fatma Aydemir is a Berlin-based author, novelist, playwright and a GuardianEuropecolumnistExplore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionGermanycommentShareReuse this content"

But what are those fake eyelashes doing in there?Charlotte JansenTue 17 Jun 2025 11.05 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 15.16 EDTShareIn 2016, almost by accident, the US artist Taryn Simon ended up making a video work about the most important moment in recent British political history. While scouting for a location for another work, she visited Alexandra Palace in London just as a rehearsal for theBrexitballot-counting was taking place. “I immediately asked if I could come back and film the actual count,” says Simon, whose request was approved, making her the only person in the world permitted to record a Brexit count.She’s speaking with me from Paris, where the video has just gone on show. Presented on two screens, it is at first unremarkable: one view shows a wide frame of the historic Great Hall of the palace, with count staff seated at tables covered with black tablecloths and scattered with paper. A second screen offers a closeup view of two count staff in their official burgundy T-shirts, sorting papers into “Leave” and “Remain”. The tension mounts as each stack grows, but no climax is reached.“It’s a basic picture of the act,” says Simon, who was up until 4am filming the vote count. “I was thinking about the things that trigger these decisions: how the process of counting up desires – and the fervour for change – happens literally in our sleep, deep in the night.”1:16Brexit votes pile up in an excerpt from Taryn Simon's film Haringey Ballot Count  – videoThe undramatic and sober view of this monumental event becomes increasingly chilling with the endless, repetitive sound of paper-sorting, leading towards the outcome we all now know. “Ultimately, it’s just paper,” says Simon, “but it has such a heavy outcome for so many people.” Simon sees the papers as “surrogates” for citizens, the near weightlessness of the material at odds with the gravity of the decision. “I remember sitting there in extreme shock as they were calling out the results and being amazed how something could turn so quickly. It felt unreal.”Simon, 50, is best known for her minimalist, index-like photographs, densely researched still lifes and portraits of things that are hidden – or so familiar they usually pass you by. Working with a large-format camera, she has often gone to extremes, to the edges of society. She has photographed Saddam Hussein’s son Uday’s body double, a nuclear waste storage facility in Washington State, a cryopreservation unit where bodies are frozen just after death, and the Church of Scientology.View image in fullscreen‘They are actually directions we are following’ … Taryn Simon.Photograph: Eli Baden-Lasar/© Taryn Simon, courtesy of the Artist and Almine RechThe Brexit video is part of The Game, a new exhibition of Simon’s work at the Almine Rech gallery in Paris. The Game deals with the everyday objects and events that influence electoral outcomes, right down to a cat from Ohio called Miss Sassy. Alongside the Brexit video, Simon has installed artefact-like photographs, printed and framed in bright colours, chosen to catch your attention as if they’re playful “distractions”. However, as she points out, “They are actually directions we’re following – whether by force, ignorance, or both.”Each image is related to the 2024 presidential election in the US, where Simon lives. She travelled the country photographing things such as a Fox News microphone, Capitol police riot gear, McDonald’s fries, and balloons on standby at a Republican National Convention. She also photographed Miss Sassy, the cat who was at the centre of a media maelstrom last year after her owner accused her Haitian immigrant neighbours in Springfield, Ohio, of abducting her. By the timeDonald Trump got hold of the story, Haitians were accused of eating her.“It’s just a cat,” says Simon. “She had no idea what narrative she was part of, nor did she have any active participation. But she became this emblem ofparanoia and conspiracy theorythat consumed a town and created incredible discord. The cat was later found alive in her owner’s basement – but the outcome doesn’t matter. The story kept going. You can hang your hat on the lie and that’s quite scary.”Simon turns Miss Sassy back into a straightforward image of a cat, but one that is now also a symbol of the disease and the proliferation of misinformation. It recalls one of her early, groundbreaking projects in the early 00s, The Innocents, in which the artist documented people who had been wrongfully convicted and imprisoned for violent crimes. She photographed many of them at the crime scenes after they’d been released – places they had no association with or had never been to. “The fiction takes over, the story consumes, even when there’s so much evidence of the opposite.”View image in fullscreenAt the centre of another storm … Representative Jasmine Crockett’s Eyelashes.Photograph: Maris Hutchinson/© Taryn Simon, courtesy of the artist and Almine RechAnother photograph is of false eyelashes worn by the Democratic politicianJasmine Crockett. Enshrined in their white and pink case, they are eerie and unseeing. “I could have gone to CVS to buy a pair,” Simon says, “but that’s the horror of my work – I never fake it.” She photographed them aftera fiery showdown– that later went viral – during a US House Committee meeting in 2024, triggered by Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene telling Crockett: “I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you’re reading.” She hit back with comments about Greene’s bleached blonde hair. Crockett’s office were somewhat taken aback by Simon’s request to photograph her eyelashes, but agreed. “Sometimes, these quieter things that stand outside and fly by are actually the crux of the story.”The Game sees Simon – who had a solo exhibition at London’s Tate Modern in 2011, aged 36 – returning to the kind of photographic work she made her name with, after years focusing on performance and installation work. “Obviously, the photographic document can generate or reinscribe certainties that are wrong, but it’s also an important tool for pushing against error. It can be that mushy. I don’t think photography has to be clear. I think of photographs as their own creatures who help us see things we can’t or don’t see. They stop time and let you look, make you pause. That’s incredibly valuable, even if I can’t get them to answer.”The show also pays homage to Simon’s father, an inventor of arcade and video games. “He made pinball machines, air hockey tables, skeeball. I spent my whole childhood in arcades. I always wanted to make a game but I never found the thing that aligned with what I do.” But now she has – and it takes the form of her reimagining the kleroterion – an ancient Athenian device for randomly selecting male citizens for public roles.“Only fragments of it exist,” she says animatedly, “and no one really knows how it worked. It had hundreds of slots and any male citizen could insert a chip and have a chance at being chosen for public office or jury duty.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s fun to play a game’ … a detail of Simon’s Kleroterion.Photograph: Maris Hutchinson/© Taryn Simon, courtesy of the artist and Almine RechThe kleroterion highlights an important and under-appreciated element of Simon’s often hard-hitting work: humour. In the gallery in Paris, she has installed a red and blue Vegas-esque carpet. “A weird collision,” she jokes, “between the UN and a cruise ship.” Her work revels in life’s more laughable absurdities – even if, in the past, it has been hard to see because of the gravity of her themes. For now, at least, she is happy to sit back and enjoy it. “It’s fun to watch people enter a serious gallery space and have to play a game.”‘A very old political trope’: the racist US history behind Trump’s Haitian pet eater claimRead moreSimon’s kleroterion is an interactive sculpture that looks like a tall cabinet, with five slots for tokens arranged vertically, and another five horizontally – intended to reflect average family sizes, globally. It encourages us to think about how decision-making happens at a domestic and national level. It took a few years for Simon to figure out the engineering. “The only way to really get a random result is by error,” she says, “which was an interesting thought.”Simon’s father was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s soon after she decided to make the work. “That’s the sadness of it. He’s been part of literally every single thing I’ve done, and now he’s not totally present. But he loves it in his own way.” The work isn’t just a tribute to her father – it could herald another career shift. “I wouldn’t mind quitting,” she says, “and going into arcading.”Taryn Simon: The Game is atAlmine Rech, Paris, until 26 July.Explore more on these topicsArt and designPhotographyExhibitionsArtSculptureBrexitDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He remembers the making of Smile, Surf’s Up and moreAs told toDave SimpsonTue 17 Jun 2025 09.49 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 09.50 EDTShareIt was the Beatles’ publicist Derek Taylor – who I met backstage at their first concert at the Hollywood Bowl – who first declared “Brian Wilson is a genius” as part of a [1966] publicity campaign. I knew that word would come back to haunt Brian and it did: from then on he was competing in a world of heightened expectations, but he did that very bravely all his life. He was basically forever competing against a previous version of himself, but as the great American beat poet Lewis MacAdams said: “If it’s not impossible, I’m not interested.” As for lyrics, you can’t beat “I’m a cork on the ocean” [in Til I Die] for a redux of thought from a Beach Boy. I will call that genius and I think the word does apply to Brian.The things he could do with a piano, bass and a couple of guitars were like him entering a dark room and breathing light and life into itHe had so many gifts. One of them was mutual empowerment. He brought out the best in everyone around him. In the studio, under great tensile strength, the things he could do with a piano, bass, and maybe a couple of guitars were like him entering a dark room and breathing light and life into it. He was a celebratory spirit with a dark coda on his life: the burden of some psychosis. I don’t believe that was caused by drugs. I think it was in his genes, but he had the ability to dig deep. He had a disciplined spiritual force and had sat on church pews and had learned musical lingos, had loved and absorbed everything from barbershop quartets to calypso to composers to Gershwin, was growing up when they coined the expression “Americana” and configured all this into a new kind of pop.Equally, he was a positive social force while Rome was burning and certainly Vietnam was. People were being hosed down in Selma [Alabama, on civil rights marches] and there was panic and apprehension and assassinations, but against that backdrop we got the tonic of Brian Wilson’s music. I’m glad he didn’t see a state senator shot down to the ground this weekend.In mid-1960s Laurel Canyon, I was very active and had played on stuff like the Byrds’ Fifth Dimension. David Crosby encouraged me to become a Byrd but I wasn’t strong enough to be that, but they were wonderful people and Roger McGuinn was a great lyricist. I did everything in my power to surround myself with superior talents and really found one in Brian. I can’t remember whether it was David or [Byrds’ producer] Terry Melcher or [talent agent] Loren Schwartz who introduced us, but I went over when they were working on Good Vibrations. I suggested the cello parts with triplets playedarco[with a bow] that became part of the song’s signature, like the ruby slippers in The Wizard of Oz. I thought I might get taken on as an arranger or rather a musician trying to become an arranger, but that wasn’t the job Brian had for me at all. Suddenly I was a lyricist.At that time, I knew nothing about Brian Wilson – I was a Beatles fan – and lyrics weren’t really my background. It’s possible that he’d heard my song High Coin [first recorded in 1965 by Rick Jarrard], which [psychedelic band] the Charlatans had done in San Francisco to very minor impact.When I rode up to Brian’s poolside mansion in Beverly Hills on a motorcycle I was pulled over by a cop who asked me what I was doing in such a neighbourhood. He didn’t believe me so accompanied me to Brian’s front door. When Brian answered it turned out that the cop’s sister went out with Dennis [Wilson]. It was all smoothed over, but Brian asked me what I needed that would draw less attention. At the time, a Volvo was the safest car built. The next day I got a cheque with no conditions for $5,000, to buy myself a Volvo. I hardly knew this man, but sometimes good things happen on trust.We wrote songs right there in his living room. The first was Heroes and Villains. Brian was the leader and came up with the melody and with it the required number of syllables. I started “I’ve been in this town so long that back in the city / I’ve been taken for lost and gone and unknown for a long long time / Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl from the Spanish and Indian home / home of the heroes and villains …” and never changed a syllable. I envisaged a country and western ballad – a story, kind of. It was a beautiful experience, one of the “eureka” moments of my relationship with Brian Wilson.We came up with Surf’s Up in one night. We talked about how classical music had died and was being replaced by something else, and there were things to be discovered. I sat there with Brian as we were reinventing the song form. One of the things he did then was record in modular fragments – sections which would then be put together – as opposed to whole songs, a bit like the way people like Robert Altman were making movies.I don’t know how much Brian consciously was trying to top Pet Sounds [1966] but he wanted out of the box. Placing his piano in a sand-box in his living room wasn’t an example of his craziness. It was both a pop art statement and his fantastic sense of humour. He’d wanted to drop the surfboard and progress so I mischievously suggested the title Surf’s Up. It was naughty … but how could his cousin Mike Love [Beach Boys singer/co-lyricist, who famously wasn’t always receptive to Wilson and Parks’s experimentation] argue with a title like Surf’s Up? I wanted to help Brian have a moment he deserved.The lyrics were inspired by an artist called Frank Holmes, whose pictures interested me so I tried to adhere to them. “Columnated ruins domino, canvas the town and brush the backdrop / Are you sleeping?” The lyrics are inadvertently about a man who attends a concert and has an epiphany. We did a whole bunch of songs and Frank [who subsequently did the cover art] can testify that I suggested the title Smile for the album.During the recording sessions Brian dominated the piano. Musicians would come and go, but Carol Kaye [bass] was very important. Elegant and swell, the only female on that set and she played on so much stuff. Dennis [Wilson] was nice to me and Carl [Wilson] knew what Brian was up against so was inclined to promote his brother’s search for freedom, but Brian had to fight to make an album at his own expense and the group felt threatened or diminished, maybe. I walked away. [Wilson pulled Smile, which – although some tracks emerged – became a “legendary lost album”. He withdrew further into drug use.]A few years later I was in a Warner Brothers meeting about the Beach Boys’ Holland album [1973], which they said was unreleasable without Brian. Mo Ostin [chief executive] said to me: “Can you get Brian?” I went over to his place with my cassette recorder and came up with a few notes, the words “Sail on, sail on sailor” and the title Sail On Sailor. It got him outta bed. We sent the tape to the Beach Boys [who recorded it for Holland]. I take no further credit for the song, which was sweet, desperate and elevating, but it put me in the position of being an effective agitator.‘The joy shot out of his voice’: Ray Davies, Graham Nash and others on Brian Wilson’s songwriting geniusRead moreWe reunited again for [Parks’s 1995 solo album] Orange Crate Art, which reignited Brian’s recording career. It was my last record for Warners and I was infatuated with the word “orange”, because of its associations with Florida and California. He was sitting in a beach home, looking at a television that wasn’t on, but I so wanted him to sing the word “orange”. He came to the studio and when I got him in front of a microphone he suddenly asked me: “Why aren’t you singing this song?” I said: “Quite frankly Brian, I just don’t like the sound of my own voice,” and quick as a flash he said: “I don’t blame you.” That was Brian: dry as bones. When he became lead vocalist it was different to the 1960s because of whatever had happened to him and he was singing parts that I dictated. It sank without a trace, but it was a step forward – he realised he could get out of the tomb.Working together again on Brian Wilson Presents Smile [2004, the album as it was originally intended] was more of a long-distance love. I didn’t have the chance to socialise with him at that time, but did some audio intervals, played some parts and so on. I went to the triumphant Royal Festival Hall show [2004] where he performed the Smile songs and my only regret is that my parents weren’t alive to see the joy those songs generated.Brian and I stayed in touch. My wife Sally and I were close to Brian and both of his wives. Our friendship spanned decades and his various associations and casts of characters. Losing him is so tough and leaves a vacuum, but Brian bloomed where he was planted and his music documented an America that no longer exists. He moved mountains. He changed the language. He treated me kindly when he didn’t need to and when people say his music is astonishing, I agree.Explore more on these topicsMusicBrian WilsonPop and rockBeach BoysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The biting play about a pivotal, forgotten momentIt was a turning point in the push for African independence – and it took place in Chorlton-on-Medlock Town Hall. We meet the writer of a play about the fifth Pan-African CongressAnya RyanTue 17 Jun 2025 10.12 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 15.16 EDTShareOn the facade of the building that once housed Chorlton-on-Medlock Town Hall in Manchester sits a plaque commemorating a turning point in the push for African independence. The fifth Pan-African Congress in October 1945 was attended by future global leaders as well as activists and scholars from acrossAfricaand its diaspora. But despite the event’s international importance, it has been largely overlooked by mainstream British history.Now a biting new play is set to remedy this.“I think a lot of Mancunians don’t know it happened,” says playwright Ntombizodwa Nyoni, who lectures in the same building, now part of Manchester Metropolitan University. “But it’s like: you’re part of such a phenomenal moment in history.” Eighty years later, her dramatisation of the event, Liberation, is about to receive its world premiere atManchester international festival.“Quite early on, I was interested in how leaders are made,” Nyoni explains when we meet, post-rehearsal. She started working on Liberation in 2019, spending the first year and a half “getting to know” the 200 delegates through extensive reading and tracing their individual timelines. Then came the task of bringing the attendees to life, showing the people behind their legacies. “I think we have this idea around activists … that they are these extraordinary people. But actually they were all normal people who did extraordinary things,” she says.View image in fullscreenThe cost of activism … Leonie Elliott in rehearsals.Photograph: Ella Mayamothi SommeilNyoni set out to write a play that dug underneath the scant history already available, and focused on the social dynamics between the delegates and the sacrifices they’d have to make to bring about global change. The play zooms in on the attendees’ specific motivations. The congress organiser, George Padmore, is reckoning with his mortality as he considers whom to pass the baton on to, while Jamaican social worker Alma La Badie sometimes feels “like she’s a footnote in history”. “I was looking for who the person is. Because just summarising them through their actions doesn’t tell the full story,” Nyoni explains.The death of George Floyd in May 2020 was, she says, “a pivotal moment” for her writing. “Even in the midst of a pandemic, we were seeing brutality on Black bodies,” she says. “By struggling with my own sense of hope and hopelessness, it made me look at the play very differently.” Liberation morphed into a piece about “survival”, and the cost of activism on “your mental health, your spirituality and your physical health”.“I knew the 80th anniversary was coming,” Nyoni continues, “and I was thinking, ‘OK, actually, how much of what they were talking about at the congress has changed?’” Liberation bridges the gap between past and presentby drawing parallels between the anticolonial struggles of the 1940s, the ongoing fight against systemic racism, and the psychological toll of activism today.Staged at the in-the-roundRoyal Exchangetheatre, director Monique Touko’s production pulls the audience of 2025 into the drama, making them feel like “delegates, active in the conversation”. “We are rebranding Congress. The vision hasn’t been actualised, so we have to go again,” Touko says. She hopes audiences will leave feeling “charged”. “We want history to feel relatable and not so distant. That it still exists in the everyday,” adds Nyoni.View image in fullscreen‘Making the audience feel active in the conversation’ … delegates at the 1945 conference.Photograph: John Deakin/Getty ImagesThe writer-director duo see Liberation as a form of activism in itself. “As a writer, this ismyactivism,” Nyoni says. “I want people to participate in the conversation, and figure out: ‘What is yours?’” The play paints the fight for change as “a marathon” that continues from one generation to the next. “So much of what they were asking for hasn’t come into fruition,” Nyoni continues. “The characters end up doing more than speaking to where they were in 1945 … they are speaking to where we’re at today: it is an ongoing conversation.”Sonically, the play draws on then and now, too. Ife Ogunjobi, from the Brit award-winningEzra Collective, composed a score directly from Nyoni’s own writing playlist, which had music “from across Africa, the Caribbean and across Europe” up until the end of 1945. “Ife took all of that, and he did a beautiful thing with the new and old and fused the worlds together,” says Nyoni. He joins a creative team including choreographer Kloe Dean, who has worked with Little Simz, and costume designer Sunny Dolat. “A lot of people have come from outside theatre … it brings a new energy,” Touko says.The play that changed my life: ‘Daniel Kaluuya winked at me and my mum – and said he acted better for us’Read moreThe significance of Liberation being staged in Manchester on this anniversary feels deeply meaningful – although Touko is careful to credit the grassroots organisations that have previously worked to commemorate the congress in the city. But it is clear that for Nyoni, the play existed before she even wrote it, in Manchester’s very air. When she walks through the old Chorlton Town Hall building she says she feels “the ghosts of people walking around” her. “It is engraved in stone,” Nyoni says.Liberationis at the Royal Exchange theatre, Manchester, from 3 to 19 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal ExchangeEzra CollectiveBlack British cultureColonialismAfricaRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Earlier this year, opposing theatres in Charing Cross Road displayed “sold out” signs for their shows. Both of them –Stranger Things: The First ShadowandKyoto– were co-directed by Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin. “It was surreal,” says Martin. “Someone sent me a photo and I thought: I’m keeping that. As a little Australian, I’m still surprised to make a living out of this crazy career.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Kyoto had a limited run butStranger Thingshas been going for 18 months and has “the noisiest audience I’ve ever heard”, Martin reports. “I think the stat is that 60% of [them] have never been to a play before. So they eat popcorn throughout and just respond in a really natural way. If it’s boring, they leave. If they’re frightened, they really scream and gasp. It’s very live but, if you’re used to traditional theatre, it’s weird.”Jodie Comer to reprise Prima Facie role ‘one last time’ for a tourRead moreMartin has had a centre seat for the modern evolution of theatregoing. As a solo director, he staged Suzie Miller’sPrima Facie, a horrifying monologue by a barrister who is a survivor of rape, with Jodie Comer winning Olivier and Tony awards in London and New York. Uniquely for a stage play, it also twice topped the UK cinema box office when screened by NT Live. For Martin, that felt as unlikely an achievement as having double hits in London.“I think a lot of it was Jodie,” he reflects. “But also the subject matter of the play: that people wanted to be part of that conversation about relationships and consent. With a new play, you never know what you’ve got until it meets the audience. The first preview of Prima Facie, the audience was almost all women and I’d placedStephen Daldryin the middle of the stalls to give me notes. And, even as the final music cue played, all the women in the theatre leaped to their feet with such energy and passion. And that was pretty much repeated everywhere.”Martin and Daldry intermittently fantasise about creating templates for sellout shows that can be copied around the world by assistants who occasionally check in by Zoom with the creators on their yachts. “Sadly,” he laughs, “we don’t seem to have achieved that. We have to be around a lot for every run.”View image in fullscreen‘They really scream and gasp’ … Stranger Things: The First Shadow on Broadway.Photograph: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman/APJust back from working with Daldry to open Stranger Things on Broadway, Martin will next year direct Comer again in a UK and Ireland tour of Prima Facie. Next month, he makes a National Theatre debut withMiller’s new play. Whereas the earlier work took its title from the Latin legal phrase meaning “at first sight”, Inter Alia borrows the lawyers’ term for “among other things”. And, after the barrister’s monologue of Prima Facie, Inter Alia is a sort of double soliloquy, for a high court judge, Jessica Parks (Rosamund Pike), who delivers both her public and private thoughts as a family crisis tests, inter alia, her judiciousness.“In conversation” is a favourite term of Martin’s for how culture works and Inter Alia has a lot to say toAdolescence, the Netflix mega-hit, as the judge becomes involved in the case of a young man accused of an assault on a classmate.“They’re definitely related,” Martin agrees. “Both Inter Alia and Adolescence are talking about what everyone’s talking about, which is how to bring up boys with an understanding of women and consent. What interested me about Adolescence was the response: get rid of mobile phones, get rid of social media. And you think: that’s one of the things but there are other issues about our complicity in the society we’ve created. Rosamund’s character in our play is trying to bring up a feminist son. And what does that mean? Suzie’s play is wrestling with how to bring up boys.”The Adolescence overlap is another example of a phenomenon that fascinates Martin: how plays are changed by the surrounding context. Kyoto by Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson – known to Martin and Daldry as “the Joes”, having previously written for themThe Jungle, the 2017 immersive drama about a refugee camp at Calais –premiered in summer 2024by the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford-upon-Avon and transferred to London this year.View image in fullscreenKyoto by ‘the Joes’ Murphy and Robertson at the Playhouse, London, in 2018.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian“What was amazing about that play,” says Martin, “is that we changed it a little bit between the two productions but the world had changed a huge amount.” He means the election of Donald Trump, which made the audience even more unnerved about an American lobbyist, Don Pearlman (played by Stephen Kunken), trying to sabotage the 1997 international agreement in Japan to reduce global warming.“If you do stuff about what’s going on now, which is what I like to do, then it’s exciting when the context changes the play. Because of Trump, the play’s discussion of the divisiveness of America had a different focus.”Kunken was, pantomime-like, regularly booed at curtain calls. But Martin has deep experience of theatre bumping into current affairs. In 2013, when Margaret Thatcher died, he was assistant director to Daldry on two West End shows in which the contentious former prime minister was satirised: Lee Hall and Elton John’s musical Billy Elliot and Peter Morgan’s Westminster bio-dramaThe Audience.“We thought: hang on, these shows become about something different tonight. Stephen held anaudience voteat Billy Elliot about whether the song fantasising about Thatcher’s death should be included. [It was.] And Peter and I went on stage before The Audience and talked to the, er, audience about whether the Thatcher scene should be included. [It was.] But, when it gets like that, it’s really exciting. WhenHaydn Gwynne, who was playing Thatcher, came on, the audience all went deeply quiet as if: are we allowed to do this tonight? But then she did her deep curtsey to the queen and everyone laughed and it was as if there was permission to be in conversation with what had just happened. It was electric.”Martin was working as “resident director” (day-to-day show-running) on the Australian production of Billy Elliot when he first encountered Daldry and moved up, via assistant and associate director, to co-director (on The Jungle, Kyoto and Stranger Things). Some duos who use that term sit side by side at desks during rehearsals, but not Daldry/Martin: “We divide up the show and then come back together to look at what the other has done. Every director runs out of ideas in a rehearsal room so it’s great to have someone who can pick it up and run with it.”Together and separately, a trait of their productions is pace. Without ever dropping a word, Comer in Prima Facie gave a sense of a racing brain and body. Kyoto, a hefty two-act play, felt much shorter than its running length.Martin nods: “I love it when a play is just ahead of the audience and they’re trying to catch it. With a monologue, it’s someone’s inner thoughts and people think so quickly so it has to go: boom, boom, boom. When I started on Prima Facie, it wasn’t quite coming alive and I rang up the friend who did it in Australia and she said with monologues you have to go at a rapid pace because of the speed of thought. I think pace is everything. Although it can be a fight now because a lot of actors try to actbetween the lines.That’s the influence of screen work where it’s in the pause, it’s in the look. But in theatre you have to acton the line. It’s an oral medium; if you’re not hearing it, there’s nothing going on. Stephen and I are notorious for saying to actors: if you’re doing nothing, then nothing is happening.”‘The courtroom is not fit for purpose’: the hard truths behind sexual assault drama Prima FacieRead moreMartin is one of a group of Australian directors – Simon Stone, Benedict Andrews, Kip Williams – who have worked prominently in London. “I came over chasing a partner who had moved here and I just found it was the place I wanted to work,” he says. He is pleased that Inter Alia is scheduled for NT Live. “For someone living across the world from where my parents are, it’s a way of connecting … But, more importantly, it’s democratised theatre.”All his big shows have been new – including The Fear of 13 with Adrien Brody – but do producers ring up and offer The Cherry Orchard or Richard III? “Yep.” And he says no? “Yep. Until I find my own way into a classic the way Stephen did to An Inspector Calls, where you feel the play is turned on its head.”After Inter Alia he is planning to complete a trilogy with Miller: “We have a third one with another Latin legal title that I can’t say for the moment.” While Martin insists that collaboration must remain sub judice for now, his track record suggests audiences are unlikely to be in absentia.Inter Alia is at theNational Theatre, London, 10 July-13 September, and in cinemas as part ofNT Livefrom 4 September. Stranger Things: The First Shadow is at thePhoenix theatre, London.Explore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndJodie ComerStranger ThingsNational TheatreStephen DaldryRoyal Shakespeare CompanyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

In late February 2020, days before Covid-19 lockdowns started being implemented around the world, the Yorkshire metalcore band released their breakthrough single, Keep Your Distance. It was a melee of growls and beatdowns that propelled them to new heights – in part thanks to a title that foresaw the next year of government messaging.“It was completely by coincidence,” guitarist and vocalist Konan Hall tells me on a video call from his home inSheffield. “But everyone started tagging us in signs saying ‘Keep your distance because of Covid’.” Lead singer Alex Taylor can’t help but laugh, joining the call from his place just up the road. “It was free marketing!”The song amassed millions of streams by the time restrictions were lifted, and that momentum has only been built on in the years since, as the band toured with scene megastars such as Lamb of God and Trivium. Their impact on live crowds is now as famed as their high-octane music: footage of a venue-wide circle pit that they incited at the Hammersmith Apollo went viral in 2023, and last year they set a new record for crowd-surfers at Derbyshire’s Bloodstock festival, scoring 901. There was pandemonium when they played a secret set at Download festival last weekend: “Make these security guards fucking work!”, Taylor told the crowd. But their music isn’t just mindless mayhem, reflecting as it does on mental health struggles and online hatred.Thanks to its heaviness and richness, their upcoming album Where Only the Truth is Spoken is one of the most anticipated heavy releases of the year. Much of it was made at the California studio of vaunted metal producer Josh Wilbur (Korn, Gojira, Avenged Sevenfold), while its drums were recorded at Dave Grohl’s Studio 606 in California. “We used the same console Fleetwood Mac used for Rumours,” Hall says. “There was a Nirvana Nevermind drum kit photo on the desk. Going from being a kid, loving those bands, to using the same gear was a dream come true.”Malevolence were already well over a decade into their career when the pandemic hit. Co-guitarist Josh Baines, bassist Wilkie Robinson and drummer Charlie Thorpe have been playing shows since they were 11, and they started jamming with Hall in the mid-2000s, when he was 15. Taylor completed the lineup in 2010, and Hall calls the five-piece’s early days gigging in the north of England “some of the best years of our lives. We’d play for free beer.”The members had to balance their touring schedule with full-time careers, and they still take the occasional outside job to this day. “Konan’s done a bit of building work, I’ve done security, Josh was working in bars,” Taylor says. He adds that the jobs were “a means to an end to allow us to go on, like, two-week European tours in our friend’s Vauxhall Zafira”.In April 2020 they released the ballad The Other Side, which was about the trauma of a serious break-up and featured melodic vocals from Hall. Performing it at Download festival the following year, Taylor told the audience “It’s OK to not be OK”, and talked candidly about losing loved ones to addiction and suicide. The singer later revealed that four of his friends took their own lives within a two-month span during the pandemic.View image in fullscreenAlex Taylor performing in 2023.Photograph: Katja Ogrin/RedfernsHe tells me that that experience inspired him to open up lyrically. “All I’d ever really known was the band,” he says. “You kind of have this thing where you have your band life, your personal life and your work life, and it’s almost expected to keep them in separate boxes. But, having such sad things happen, it made me realise: this is all entwined.”As a result, Where Only the Truth Is Spoken exposes more of the vulnerabilities behind this barrel-chested band. Through its acoustic verses and climactic choruses, Salt the Wound is about the question, in Taylor’s words, of “how far do you expect the people around you to fix your problems before it then becomes an issue for them and drags them down?”Meanwhile, hardcore rager If It’s All the Same to You is about the singer cutting ties with people close to him “who’ve had their minds warped by what they’ve read on the internet. I just don’t have the time for people who just repeat and recycle the same old racist bullshit. It’s very much a song of: you keep that energy well away from me. You get people who are like, ‘Oh, he’s just stuck in his ways. He’s always been like that.’ I’m like: well, no, that’s not acceptable any more.”In November, Malevolence will play their biggest-ever headline shows in London and Manchester. Taylor wants Where Only the Truth Is Spoken to crack the UK Top 10, while Hall wants to headline Download one day: “You can’t get bigger than that!”But there’s a larger goal: the band hope their honesty regarding mental health and real-life struggles will guide fans through their own challenges. “That’s way more important to me than, like, playing a bigger room,” says Taylor. “It’s about bridging that gap [between artist and audience] and hopefully helping people through whatever it is that they’re going through in life, whether it be mental health struggles, loneliness, anger or sadness.”Where Only the Truth is Spoken is released 20 June on Nuclear Blast RecordsIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Composite: Save the ChildrenPhotographer Misan Harriman gave lessons and equipment to young people who have fled Gaza – and the pictures they took are funny, revealing and often heartbreakingByEmine SanerTue 17 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTShareAboy pulling a funny face, a sleeping pet, a grandfather in his chair – all ordinary scenes from life that many of us would take for granted. What makes these images special is they were taken by Palestinian children, refugees displaced to Egypt since Israel’s war inGaza, making sense of their new, if hopefully temporary, home and what they have escaped from.“It’s familial life, relationships, and although they’ve seen so much, you’re not seeing trauma, you’re not seeing the faces of people that have given up,” says the photographer Misan Harriman, an ambassador for Save theChildren. “Even though none of these kids know what the future brings and there’s huge uncertainty, they are living in the moment. They’re doing their best to thrive and learn.” The camera, he adds, is “a seemingly inanimate object that can help you find answers to a world that is confusing, and even more confusing for some of these children.”Harriman led a photography workshop in Cairo, run by Save the Children and the charity Choose Love, in which 10 Palestinian children from Gaza, between the ages of 11 and 13, were given a camera and taught how to use it. Over several weeks, they created their own images. It was fun and an outlet for creativity, but it was also about much more, says Harriman. These are children forced to leave their homeland. “They understand what bearing witness means,” he says. “They understand what preserving memories means, and hopefully taking pictures of friends, loved ones, possessions they love, it’s just a beautiful, maybe even cathartic experience for them.”View image in fullscreenMisan Harriman, centre, with some of the children involved in the project. Photograph: Anna Sass/Save the ChildrenThe children who took part in the project are the lucky few, he acknowledges. In Egypt, temporarilyhome to 100,000 Palestinians since October 2023, more than 2,000 children are on a waiting list to access Save the Children’s support services. In Gaza, aid agencies warn of almost total famine as Israel maintained its blockade, only recently and scantly eased. Harriman says: “More than 93% of all the children in Gaza are at critical risk of famine – that means 930,000 children are at risk of famine, disease and death, if nothing’s done.”Their images, and the portraits taken by Harriman, are about showing “the humanity of Palestinian families. I want us to re-transmit their right to thrive and learn and laugh and grow, and have siblings and parents in their lives to look after them. Those are basic rights, that the children of the occupied territories do not have.”Harriman started late in photography – he went on to document protests including those by Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion, shoot for British Vogue, and photograph Harry and Meghan, and was nominated for an Oscar for his short filmThe After– and he says he learned from the children, too. He saw how they didn’t tend to doubt themselves. “They press the shutter because they want to take that image, they want to freeze that decisive moment. I think that’s something that’s core to the essence of photography, and children have that inbuilt. We lose it as we get older.”He taught them about practicalities such as composition and light, which they picked up quickly, but he says his job was to “plant seeds for these kids to see that with a camera, there are limitless possibilities in how they can tell stories. And all of them have stories that deserve to be heard and seen.” Here, Harriman chooses some of his favourite images from the project.View image in fullscreenPortrait of her mother, by Rawan. All photographs: Save the ChildrenIt’s an extraordinary image, by someone who has never been formally trained in photography to understand composition and light. There are many people that have far more time and resources who wouldn’t necessarily be able to come out with a picture that is this honest, well-composed and a really good representation of what portraiture at its best should be. Palestinian mothers, to me, are deities – they have a strength that few mothers on this planet are forced to have. I see a daughter allowed to capture her love for her mother for eternity. Apart from it just being a good picture, you have a young Palestinian showing respect and recognising the sacrifice and the fortitude of what it means to be a Palestinian mother today.Rawan says:“This project enabled me to document my memories and enrich my skills. I was able to show what I hope to achieve one day. It meant a lot to me. My mother is my first supporter and witnessed my first steps. I was excited when I took a photo of her.”View image in fullscreenPortrait of his cat, by ShadiIt’s subversive in many ways. We have all these gender presumptions of boys, but he says his cat is his favourite thing, and I love the tenderness of that. His pet is what he loves and wants to look after, and it probably makes him feel safe and cosy, with the consideration of what he has been through. Pets are a big part of Palestinian culture and there are many stories of children, with what little food they have, feeding their pets first. The people of Palestine have always looked after the land and their animals. It’s nicely composed, with soft light falling on the cat. It’s a lovely picture.Shadi says:“All my photographs are special to me and each photo has its own significance. My favourite photo is the one of my cat, because she’s the most precious thing I own and I feel a great deal of responsibility towards her.”View image in fullscreenPortrait of his grandfather, by ShadiIt’s hard not to get emotional when you think of the generations that have been taken from Palestinian kids. What I love about this image is the grandfather’s hands. You think of the life those hands have seen – this is a man that’s probably old enough to have been a child during the Nakba in 1948 and he’s still with us, and lucky enough to be able to look down to his beautiful grandson. It’s a hopeful picture, but it’s also a picture to remind us of the generation of the Nakba who have had so much taken from them.Shadi says:“Owning a camera impacted my life positively. It made me notice and value all the things that I own. It made me see beauty in everything, and I hope I can continue my journey in photography.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPortrait of his sister, and family portrait, by AymanThe background – the hanging lanterns, the patterned rugs – gives a rich sense of place and the square of light frames her beautifully. This photo captures a sense of the trust and familiarity between the two siblings. The image of Ayman with his family is special simply because it’s sadly so rare to see a Palestinian family all together in one photograph in such a normal setting. They are still together, in spite of everything.View image in fullscreenSelf-portrait, by AymanHe’s being exactly what an 11-year-old boy is. That could be an image taken on any street or apartment in Britain. He just looks like a happy, cheeky boy. I think that’s what makes it a great portrait.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenHigh-rise building and self-portrait, by ToleenThe high-rise building with pure blue skies and Ramadan bunting gives a sense of her everyday life and place, but also a feeling of warmth and optimism, and shows how the month of Ramadan is one of real celebration. I love the selfie of Toleen in the mirror. She took this on the day of the workshop, possibly when she got back home and was playing around with the camera. She looks a little shy, but also happy, and it was heartwarming to see her growing in confidence.Toleen says: “I felt happy and excited during the project, because I was going through new experiences and learning how tosee things from a different perspective. It really had an impact on me. I see life now in a different, more beautiful way. Having a camera has become a part of my life and taught me to pay attention to the small details of the world around me.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenSelf-portrait reading the Qur’an, and self-portrait, by TaleenThere’s a lovely contrast between the two images which demonstrate Taleen’s connection to her faith – the quiet, contemplative moment as she read the Qur’an at home with beautiful soft lighting pouring down on her from a window above, versus the portrait of her in front of a glittery Ramadan decoration outside, which gives a real sense of the celebratory mood of that month. That spirituality, I think, has been increased in these kids because of what they’ve seen. Judging by the sense of strength that many of the young people have, I think their faith has been central to it, so it’s not surprising that many of them photographed prayer mats and beads, and Qur’ans.Taleen says:“My favourite photograph is the one of me while reading the Holy Qur’an because it makes me feel happiness, serenity and safety.”View image in fullscreenSelf-portrait, by MasaThis image of Masa in her keffiyeh is powerful as it shows her pride in her nationality and identity, and she stands resolutely in the middle of the frame. It feels quiet but strong – and giving the peace sign adds a powerful layer of meaning. The keffiyeh in particular is really meaningful in terms of identity. Many chose to photograph the keffiyeh, pictures of the Qur’an and breaking the fast at Ramadan, because these are all memories. They’re saying you cannot erase these images, and let that be the truth that the rest of the world sees, which I think is a really powerful thing.Masa says:“The keffiyeh is our national symbol. This project was a new, enjoyable experience for me. I learned a lot from it.Photographyhelps me to express my feelings in a beautiful way.”View image in fullscreenPortrait of teacher, by AdamThis image is of one of the teachers at Save the Children’s child-friendly space in Cairo.

Affordable ticket prices and starry lineups mean it has acquired a reputation as Europe’s premier music event with a social conscience, with 210,000 people from more than 80 countries attending in 2024.On Friday, however, Exit’s organisers announced that its 25th anniversary edition from 10 to 13 July this year “will be the last to take place” in Serbia, citing “undemocratic pressures” from the government of the president, Aleksandar Vučić.Calls grow in Serbia for investigation into claims ‘sound cannon’ targeted protestersRead moreNovi Sad has emerged as the hub of theprotests that have swept the Balkan statesince a concrete canopy collapsed on to a busy pavement at the city’s central station last year, killing 14 people. On its social media channels, Exit has endorsed the demands of student protesters, calling for the resignation of the responsible minister and a full investigation into the disaster.The festival has donated food and sleeping bags to protesters blocking access to universities and municipal buildings, and plans to give student activists their own stage at this year’s festival.The festival’s outspoken stance appears to have drawn the ire of the government, with authorities withholding about €1.5m in national and regional tourism grants and some sponsors dropping out.“The only way we could continue the festival beyond this year is if we decided not to be free from political influence,” said Exit’s founder, Dušan Kovačević, explaining that his festival needs about 15% direct government funding to remain affordable but usually brings approximately €25m into the Serbian economy every year. “And we cannot be threatened.”Authorities say their “strategic repositioning” is not politically motivated, blaming financial pressures for being unable to provide support.“They are trying to govern by fear,” Kovačević said. “That’s not the way to go, especially in a country with a political history like Serbia’s.”Kovačević said he was in talks to hold “Exit in exile” iterations of the festival from 2026 after receiving invitations to hold musical events in Germany and several countries in the Balkans, as well as in Egypt. “We may do it for one year, or maybe two or maybe five,” he added.This year’s festival has a lineup that includes the Prodigy, Sex Pistols, the French producer DJ Snake and the Russian singer Nina Kraviz.Asked whether Exit would leave its home country permanently, the festival’s organisers said: “It remains too early to say if or under what conditions the festival will return to Serbia.”The government has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsSerbiaEuropeFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is also a remarkable engagement with the real-life conflict in the Middle EastTanjil RashidSharp edges of bitter history keep jutting through Wes Anderson’s whimsical intrigues that turn international tragedy into light comedyTue 17 Jun 2025 04.24 EDTLast modified on Tue 17 Jun 2025 04.30 EDTShareThe Phoenician Scheme, Wes Anderson’s makebelieve treatment of the war-ravaged near east, reimagines the region as a sunlit Levantine fantasia of cypress trees, fez hats, camel-riders and kitsch hotels, all photographed with the lustre of an Ottolenghi cookbook. Meanwhile, livestreamed daily to our news feeds, the warlords of the Holy Land exhibit for us an equally spectacular dystopia of cities pummelled into sawdust, of skies scarred with scorching white phosphorus and gun-toting paragliders.How could these images be of the same place? What does it mean that they have been produced at the same time, and that we are consuming them alongside each other?The filmis set in the Middle East of a parallel universe. It’s 1950, but decolonisation, the Holocaust, the world wars – none appear to have taken place; history has stalled in a kind of perpetual belle époque, leaving only a pastiche of the orient in its imperial heyday, meticulously reconstructed in the film’s geography and production design, its storylines and characters.In place of the warring states unleashed by Europe’s botched withdrawal from its imperial mandates, the entire Levant forms a single nominally sovereign territory known as Modern Greater Independent Phoenicia, named after the ancient civilisation once inhabiting what would now be Lebanon, Palestine andIsrael. Those national demarcations don’t exist in the film, as you can see from all the quaintly displayed trademark Wes Anderson cartography, the whole region pristinely undivided – as it was before the first world war.All the sectarian squabbles are magically replaced by a peaceable patchwork of aristocratic familiesAll the ethnic and sectarian squabbles that beleaguer these lands in the real world are magically replaced by a peaceable patchwork of aristocratic families, each with their respective toeholds. Their inflated titles mean nothing, their names allusions to the toothless dynasties once patronised by imperial overlords.The film’s King Hussein refers to more than one Hashemite monarch installed by Britain and Prince Farouk to Egypt’s last king. The fact that a svelte Riz Ahmed has been cast to play a character, whose real-life inspiration, King Farouk, was a worldwide celebrity infamous for his fatness, tells us everything we need to know about the distorting mirror through which Anderson reflects the history of empire.Above all, the colonial order is represented by the film’s devious protagonist Anatole “Zsa-Zsa” Korda and his visionary scheme to build railways, tunnels, canals and dams across Phoenicia. The significance of infrastructure in colonial mythology cannot be overstated. Anderson says Korda was inspired by his father-in-law, the Lebanese construction magnate Fouad Maalouf, also the film’s dedicatee. But Korda is as much an empire-builder in the mould of Cecil Rhodes or Ferdinand de Lesseps.View image in fullscreenVisionary schemer … Benicio del Toro and Mia Threapleton in The Phoenician Scheme.Photograph: Courtesy of TPS Productions/Focus FeaturesWith his African mines and railways, Rhodes brought to heel the better part of a continent. In building the Suez canal, a waterway in the deserted sands between Africa and Asia, De Lesseps performed Moses’ miracle in reverse. Such magnificent infrastructure projects, said to be beyond the wit of the native, were the glory of empire and still feature in reappraisals of it (“What about the railways?”). It’s in this context that Korda’s Phoenician scheme must be understood: a plot to re-engineer the Middle East in his image.This is the east as a career, in Disraeli’s famous words. And through such a career, the Palestinian literary critic Edward Said wrote, “one could remake and restore not only the Orient but also oneself”. That sums up Korda, who is as motivated by megalomania as money.There’s always been something grippingly cinematic about that. It was another Korda – the Hungarian Jewish émigré film director Zoltan Korda – who more than anyone demonstrated that, in colonial adventure films that he made with his brother Alexander in the 1930s, relating heroic adventures in a timeless orient under eternal British rule. In naming his hero Korda, Anderson proudly acknowledges his debt to a controversial narrative tradition.In its most pointed contrast with reality, its greatest hallucination about empire, The Phoenician Scheme unfolds in a cosmopolitan world that is, for all its lying and cheating and double-dealing, completely free of racism. Imperial cosmopolitanism is symbolised, of all things, in headwear. The fez is absolutely ubiquitous in the film, as it was among colonial elites, Muslim, Christian and Jewish. (There are photos of Israel’s founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, as a fez-hatted law student in Istanbul.) It fell out of fashion in the postcolonial Middle East, becoming a symbol of colonial nostalgia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Korda appears to be Armenian (judging by the script on his birth certificate) but in a bizarre twist Korda dons the distinctive white fez and robes of Lebanon’s Druze sect, just as pharaonic imagery strangely adorns Phoenician hotels: all part of the pastiche.This is history stylised beyond all proportion. It’s meant to evoke the urbane world that existed under imperial rule, before the emergence of violent ethno-nationalism. The state of Israel is absent from the film, but Zionism, interestingly, isn’t. One corner of Phoenicia, visited by Korda, has a kibbutz, replete with Hebrew signage, quotations from the Old Testament and the suggestive imagery of “making the desert bloom”, palm trees sprouting from the barren earth. It has its own visionary founder, a rival of Korda’s, played by Scarlett Johansson, working the land in khaki shorts, like the pioneer kibbutzniks portrayed in early Zionist posters.Crucially, though, it’s labelled a “private utopian outpost”. Nationalism is such an anathema to the ethos of the film that Zionism is reduced to the personal enterprise of another one of those visionaries making a career in the east. It has no aspirations to statehood. Such nonpolitical strains of Zionism were originally favoured by followers of the movement, including Einstein and Kafka, and one suspects it’s the kind most palatable to Anderson. But this sanitised, fantasy vision of Zionism is of a piece with Anderson’s fantasy of empire. Historically in both, violence and racism were always simmering.The Phoenician Scheme may at once be Anderson’s worst and most profound film, a beautifully textured engagement with the past, and an almost morally repugnant retreat from the present. Its transformation of tragedy into comedy feels perverse. To watch The Phoenician Scheme amid the devastation of Gaza – during which it was also filmed – is to see two images of history, two maps of our time, disorientingly superimposed over each other: the sweet fantasy of a much-promised land, and the bitter, bloody reality of how it’s turning out.Explore more on these topicsWes AndersonMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelcommentShareReuse this content"

I had loving parents, but I had to find things out for myself.”He studied piano and composition until he was 16,thereafter he was largely self-taught. Aged 17 he gave his first public recital in Graz with works by Bach, Brahms and Liszt on the programme, one of the encores was his own composition – a sonata with a double fugue. The teenage Brendel was also an author and an exhibited painter, but in 1949 he won fourth prize in the prestigious Busoni competition, which launched his career as a performing musician.His concert and recording career lasted more than 60 years with performances at the world’s most important musical centres and festivals alongside the leading orchestras and conductors. He became particularly associated with the music of Beethoven, and made the first complete recording of the composer’s entire piano music. He took a prominent role in highlighting Haydn’s importance as a composer,in establishingSchubert’s Sonatas and Schoenberg’s Concerto in the repertoire, and rekindling interest in Liszt’s piano music. He moved to London in 1971, and made his home in Hampstead, his second marriage brought three children (his son,Adrian is an acclaimed cellist, his daughter by his first,Doris, is a pop and rock singer). His final publicconcert was in Vienna in 2008but in the succeeding years he published poetry and essays, lectured and continued to teach and give masterclasses.View image in fullscreenInspirational and uncompromising: Alfred Brendel.Photograph: Benjamin Ealovega“I don’t feel guilty about being ‘intellectual’ if that means thinking about the structure and character and humour in a piece of music,”he told the Guardian in 2010on the occasion of receiving Gramophone magazine’s Lifetime Achievement award. “But I’m not talking about dry analysis, which is relatively easy if you know how. I do the opposite. I familiarise myself with a piece and wait for it to tell me what it’s about, and what makes it a masterpiece. That’s what fascinates.”Widely regarded by colleagues as the “musicians’ musician” as well as the “pianists’ mentor”: Brendel’s pupils include Paul Lewis, Imogen Cooper, Kit Armstrong and Till Fellner and he devoted a significant part of his time to sharing his experiences as a musician with younger artists.“Alfred Brendel was my guide, mentor and an endless source of inspiration for more than 30 years, and his passing is an enormous loss not only for music, but on a personal level for those of us who were fortunate enough to be guided and touched by his wisdom and insight, of which he gave so generously and selflessly,” said Lewis. “[He] was unique in the pantheon of great pianists – inspirational and uncompromising, with a formidable knowledge of literature and art as well as of music. His playing was intense and visionary, his teaching no less so – but dry humour was never far,” added Cooper.Brendel received 23 honorary degrees from universities including Weimar, Cambridge, Oxford, Yale and The Juilliard School, the Honorary Vice-Presidency of the Royal Academy of Music and a number of prestigious awards such as honorary membership in the Vienna Philharmonic, the Sonning and Siemens prizes and the Praemium Imperiale in Japan.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicAlfred BrendelnewsShareReuse this content"

One fan said on social media that they “go to the theatre to share the same space with a performer”, while another said: “Sorry, are you saying I’ve paid £350 for 2 tickets and she’s singing the biggest number outside at people who haven’t paid?”But others have argued that the outdoor performancereinforces key themes in Evita, such as spectacle and political theatre.Chris Peterson, the founder of OnStage Blog, wrote: “This isn’t just clever staging or a viral moment for social media, although it’s certainly generating buzz. It’s a reimagined theatrical gesture that reframes everything we think we know about Eva Perón.

The judge said on Friday that he found “several inconsistencies” in the juror’s statements.Combs’s legal team opposed the juror’s removal, arguing that Combs would be“severely prejudiced”if Juror 6,who is a Black man, were removed. Juror 6 was one of two Black men on the jury, according toCombs’s lawyers.The alternate juror who will replace him is a white man from Westchester,New York.Entering itssixth week, the trial continued on Monday with prosecutors showing jurors, for the first time, video excerpts of the sex sessions at the center of the case against the 55-year-old music mogul – referred to as “freak-offs”. Previously, jurors had only been shown still images pulled from the footage.A paralegal from the US attorney’s office also walked jurors through evidence, including text messages and call logs, and the prosecution presented text messages to the jury, as well as travel records linked to a male escort they say was hired to participate in the sex sessions with Combs and his former girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura,who testified earlierin the trial.Combs wasarrested in Septemberand is facing charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty.Prosecutors are expected to rest their case later this week, after which the defense will begin calling witnesses.The trial is expected to continue for a few more weeks. If convicted, Combs faces up to life in prison.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsNew YorkUS crimeHip-hopRapnewsShareReuse this content"

During the resistance, schoolchildren wrote letters addressed to the tree, and Igwe uses these as a starting point to explore radical protests dating back to the 17th century.View image in fullscreenWhat home means … Morgan Quaintance’s Available Light (2024)Also firmly on the road isMachine Boys, a 2024 film by the Hamburg-based Karimah Ashadu that delves into the macho world of motorcycle taxi drivers in Nigeria’s largest city. We hear the riders discuss their philosophy around death and rebellion amid the noise of revving engines and thick clouds of dust.Elsewhere on the shortlist are artist, writer and musician Morgan Quaintance, whose 2024 filmAvailable Lightuses interviews with people renting in both Tokyo and London in order to explore what the idea of home means in a big city, and George Finlay Ramsay, the Scottish film-maker behind 2024’s Flesh, Wax and Glass II: The Age of the Son, which focuses on a grieving Calabrian lorry driver performing a bloody ritual during Holy Week.Named after pioneering film-makerDerek Jarman, the prize is known for spotting talent in the UK art scene. Now in its 18th year, previously shortlisted artists include Heather Phillipson, Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Monster Chetwynd, Luke Fowler, Imran Perretta, Charlotte Prodger, Laure Prouvost, Sin Wai Kin and Project Art Works – all of whom went on to be shortlisted for, or to win, the Turner prize.Making up this year’s shortlist are Manchester film-maker and researcher Hope Strickland and the artist duo Arwa Aburawa and Turab Shah. The former’s 2024 film, a river holds a perfect memory, traverses water from the Martha Brae River to Falmouth lagoon in Jamaica while subjects discuss concepts such as ancestral memory; the latter artists’ And still, it remains (2023) takes us to the remote Algerian village of Mertoutek to study the lasting impact of the Reggane series of nuclear testing carried out by the French during the final stages of the Algerian war in the early 1960s.View image in fullscreen‘Voice and vision’ … Hope Strickland’s a river holds a perfect memory (2024)Last year,Maryam Tafakory was awarded the prizefor works that had been inspired by her watching 417 films made in post-revolution Iran. She will be a member of this year’s jury, who said in a statement that this year’s shortlist “is a powerful reflection of the richness and diversity of moving image practice in the UK today. The nominees each bring a distinct voice and vision, pushing the boundaries of form, storytelling, and experimentation. From intimate explorations of identity to bold political commentary, the works demonstrate an exceptional standard of creativity and innovation, reaffirming the vital role of artists’ film in contemporary culture.”The winner of theJarman awardwill be announced in late November at a ceremony in London. In the lead-up to that announcement, work of the shortlisted artists will be going on tour across cultural venues in the UK. They will also be presented as an exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery, London, from 18 November until 14 December 2025.Explore more on these topicsJarman awardnewsShareReuse this content"

Kim was an incredibly kind, caring, charismatic and strong person.“Her husband, Peter, is heartbroken at the loss of his soulmate. We are so proud of the amazing things Kim achieved in her life and career. We kindly ask that Kim’s husband and close friends are given the time and privacy they need to grieve. We will not be releasing any further details.”Woodburn was selected as one of the hosts of Channel 4’s 2003 housework-based reality show, How Clean Is Your House? while working as a professional cleaner. It was a career she had begun aged 16, as a live-in cleaner for a laundrette-owning family that saw her earn £2.10 a week –a role she described to the Guardian as“I was just a piece of flesh.”Upon being teamed with journalist Aggie Mackenzie, their reality series – in which they tackled dirty homes while treating their inhabitants to catty comments – proved a surprise hit. It earned 4 million viewers, matching Big Brother’s ratings. As the show’s “dirt detective”, Woodburn once treated The Guardian offices to barbed comments as part of a publicity tourwhere she inspected its cleanliness and announced of its state: “It’s sheer laziness!

Following the book’s serialisation, Merseyside police announced they were considering whether to take legal action – only to not do so.TV presenter Lizzie Cundie, who appeared alongside Woodburn as a talking head on Big Brother-analysis show, Bit on the Side, was among those to pay tribute.“Very sad to hear Kim Woodburn has passed away.

That was the year the late Rob Ford, then mayor of Toronto, was reported to have beenfilmed smoking crack cocaine. He denied it, twisting the allegations into what he suggested was a smear campaign by an untrustworthy, left-leaning mainstream media. A few months later, the city’s chief of police, Bill Blair, held a press conference in which he announced that the police had the video in question, and it showed Ford smoking a glass pipe. The mayor was defiant. “I have no reason to resign,” he said. He didn’t.Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem manages to squash the chaos of Ford’s many scandals into an appropriately hectic 49 minutes of documentary. (The fact that the police reporting the existence of a crack pipe video is only one of these scandals is telling: a reporter here vividly likens the number of controversies surrounding Ford to “sweat off a runner”.) It provides a brief account of his entry into politics, and viewers with an interest in the psyche of “controversial” politicians will be amazed and astonished to learn that, like Donald Trump, Ford was probably motivated by wanting to impress his tough millionaire businessman father, who had been a bellicose politician himself.Ford won Toronto’s mayoral race by a landslide in 2010. He was straight-talking, rightwing, and positioned himself as being on the outside of a wasteful and excessively bureaucratic system; he was appealing, says one observer, to both “bankers and bus drivers”. There were initial reports of earlier controversies, yet to blossom into full-blown scandals: prior drug- and alcohol-related arrests, accounts of him disappearing from official duties to coach a local high school football team. They rippled to the surface and dissipated quickly. Ford said he was only human, and his supporters lapped it up.By 2013, however, reporters and journalists began to hear more stories. Ford’s chief of staff, Mark Towhey, recalls a military gala where Ford arrived dishevelled and inebriated, eventually getting Towhey in a headlock. It opened the floodgates to reports of the existence of the first crack-pipe video. The subsequent circus of controversy and chaos turned Ford into an international figure, and, many argue, a punchline. Even so, half of Toronto’s residents still thought the video had been fabricated. Towhey says that when he confronted his boss about it, he was troubled that Ford said, “There is no video,” rather than, “I didn’t do it.”Reporters and staff members recall their time in the Ford family whirlwind with varying degrees of amusement, exasperation and even fondness. It is this cocktail of reactions that makes the story so tempting to view as a model for the populist wave to come. It is easy to transpose Ford’s tactics on to Trump’s electoral successes, for example. He sowed the seeds of doubt when it came to institutions offering checks and balances on his power. He bamboozled observers, supporters and detractors by repeatedly transgressing boundaries. All of this made it difficult for the electorate to know what to believe. This version of politics as spectacle, no matter what it is that the spectacle is comprised of, has become mainstream in many western nations. There’s no such thing as bad publicity, indeed.The tragedy of this zippy documentary is that what was shocking back in 2013 has become relatively ordinary. Ford is shown repeatedly jostling with crowds of reporters. He makes outrageous statements. He admits to smoking crack, and blames being in a “drunken stupor” for his poor decisions. Still, he doesn’t resign. The idea of a public becoming numb to boundary-busting behaviour is floated, very briefly, though there is nowhere near enough time to get into the thick of it. Neither is there space to address the fact that, while this is a story of politics, it is also a story about drugs and alcohol and addiction. At the end, there is the briefest suggestion that Ford had a good side and a bad side, and that he did good, and bad, things for the city. It feels tacked on and trite, and the opportunity to go further is thrown away.But this is jaw-dropping, and provocative, and a reminder of how certain parts of the western world got to where we are. The firstTrainwreck, in 2022, was about the horrors of theWoodstock 99 music festival, which descended into a soup of greed, violence and riots. It used its three episodes wisely. Mayor of Mayhem is a frantic, surface retelling of a much more complex, and much more intriguing, story.Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionPolitics pastCanadareviewsShareReuse this content"

Some authors avoid it entirely; even those who have been called great can come a cropper. Which is why I want to start this review by saying that the sex scenes in Ordinary Love are some of the best I have read this year, and that Marie Rutkoski has a facility for writing physical intimacy that can elude even some of our most gifted authors. Her voice has been compared to that of Sally Rooney. I don’t see much of that in this novel beyond a Rooneyesque ability to write sex well, but that is a talent worth noting.Ordinary Love is a queer romance that tells the story of Emily and Gen, teenage sweethearts who break up in college and reunite in their 30s, their paths having diverged dramatically. Emily marries Jack, who is wealthy and emotionally abusive. When she sees Gen again, she is in the process of leaving him for the second time (the novel opens with a scene vividly depicting the dealbreaker: it is violence against a child that finally does it). Gen, meanwhile, has become an Olympic athlete and serial womaniser. Both are carrying the wounds of their adolescent relationship, which is recounted in flashback, and the homophobia they faced, particularly from Emily’s father. In one particularly moving scene, Gen’s grandmother – who raised her after her mother died from opioid addiction – counters his bigotry by making a toast: “To my granddaughter. I love you. I love everything about you. I am so proud.”It’s in her exploration of the intricacies of family, as well as romantic relationships, that Rutkoski is at her most impressiveIt is in her exploration of the intricacies of family, as well as romantic relationships, that Rutkoski is at her most impressive. Parenthood and childhood are explored, but so are kinship care and the notion of surrogate family – Gen’s grandmother offers kindness to Emily where her own parents have fallen short. The relationship between Emily and her emotionally distant mother is particularly well rendered. As for Emily and Jack’s marriage, we soon realise that Emily is in the grip of coercive control. This is done subtly; what Rutkoski doesn’t say is as important as what she does. With great economy she conveys how Emily tiptoes around the threat of Jack’s displeasure, as well as his facility for manipulation as a way of wielding power (when she feeds the baby formula, his response, before he hits her with a verbal sledgehammer, is “bewildered, disappointed, yet with the expression of someone trying to be gentle”).I have heard it remarked of American fiction that too often the protagonists don’t seem to have any friends. This is not the case here: Ordinary Love is replete with friends, and some of the best writing comes in the novel’s exploration of how they try to save Emily from Jack, only for him to isolate her almost completely. Emily’s regret, and her attempts to repair these friendships, are so richly written that they almost overshadow the central romance between Emily and Gen, which despite the various stumbling blocks to happiness is somehow more straightforward, and less nuanced, than these female friendships. Perhaps it is because we see little of Gen’s interior life in comparison with Emily’s, although it should be noted that we do get to meet her friends, too.Ordinary Love never sags. Rutkoski has written a page-turner, and her prose is generally good. However, every few pages there is a turn of phrase or a metaphor that makes my teeth itch. The first I highlighted was “snow scalloped into drifts like thoughts that start small and then amount to something”. That’s not too bad, you might think, but then we have “[it] felt like the architectural expression of PTSD, where things vanished like bad memories”, and (the unintentionally comical) “She made Emily feel like an egg without its shell”, and “Gen felt distant now, like a half-finished daydream, as did Emily’s youth”. Perhaps most egregious of all: “Emily wanted Gen so badly it was like how people want what they can never have.”How much you enjoy this book will depend on your tolerance for this sort of thing. Mine is generally low, but I pressed on. The plot zipped along and the clumsy metaphors seemed to drop off by the second half, I suspect owing to an editor’s guillotine. To quote the text: “The past was done, over; it isn’t a novel you can revise until you get it right.” One more round of revision in this case would have been no bad thing. Saying that, Ordinary Love is still superior to the vast majority of books in a similar vein, and it has much to recommend it – not least the fact that the sex is very good indeed.Ordinary Love by Marie Rutkoski (Little, Brown Book Group, £16.99).

It is the 1950s, she is a young teen, and the highlight of her week is going to the Saturday morning “flicks” with a neighbour’s slightly older daughter. One particular movie scene has stayed with her: it involves a man dressed in a vaguely historical costume who is fleeing for his life. Face contorted with terror, he makes it as far as the door of a cathedral, whereupon he knocks loudly and cries “Sanctuary!” The door opens a crack, the man slides inside, and the Saturday morning audience breaths a collective sigh of relief. Even if the plot points remain hazy – is Robin Hood somehow involved? – the underlying principle needs no explaining. The fugitive has invoked the ancient right by gaining entrance to a designated sacred space. As long as he stays put his pursuers can’t touch him.From these hyper-local beginnings, Warner sets out to explore and expand what “sanctuary” means in an age when millions are on the move around the world, chased out of their homes by environmental disaster, economic collapse, war and political oppression.It is in these grim circumstances that she proposes a new concept of sanctuary, one built not from bricks and mortar or even tents and blankets, but by tales and their telling. Over the past 50 years of her distinguished career as a cultural historian, Warner has immersed herself in liminal literature, tracing the way that fairytales, playground chants, lullabies, fables, patter and ditties manage to evade the censor, slip under the radar, and slide into conversations without attracting too much attention. Now she suggests putting these folk forms to work, using them to build bridges and forge connections between arrivants (a term she prefers to “migrants”) and their often hostile hosts.It is at this point that sceptics might ask how Warner’s proposed “commons of wonder”, filled with stories of myth and magic, can possibly help with the practical needs of displaced people more likely to be worried about clean water, healthcare, a job and, above all, the legal right to remain.This is a challenge that she knows well and has spent her career confronting. Her earliest books on the Virgin Mary (1976), Joan of Arc (1981) and, especially, female statuary (the magnificent Monuments and Maidens, 1985), all made the case for allegorical forms having a powerful conditioning effect on the way that people understand and experience their own lives. She got critical flak for it, as well as a great deal of praise. Decades on she shows no signs of being abashed, insisting as strongly as ever that storytelling can function as a “binding agent” between strangers, creating spaces for concepts of justice and coexistence to develop. As back-up she deploys the British anthropologist Alfred Gell’s useful phrase “art as agency” to underscore her belief that telling stories has real-world consequences.This won’t be enough to convince everyone, yet even the most literal-minded critic must admire Warner’s commitment to making things happen. In 2015 she won the prestigious Holberg prize and used her £380,000 winnings to help set upStories in Transit, a project designed to facilitate the exchange of stories between the young people, mostly men, who daily arrive in Sicily from the Middle East, the Maghreb, Bangladesh, Pakistan and the eastern Mediterranean. What might emerge, Warner wanted to know, if these travellers and their tales were encouraged to mix and mingle?Din from Guinea, where civil strife has destroyed his family, arrived in Sicily after a two-year trek by foot across the Sahara followed by a journey across the Mediterranean in a boat. During a Stories in Transit workshop he tells a traditional tale from home called The Huntsman, the King’s Son and the Enchanted Deer, a spirited mashup of politics and magic, comedy and sorrow, with one tale nestled inside another in the manner of One Thousand and One Nights. What strikes the comparatist in Warner is the way that this Guinean tale echoes animal stories from both the medieval Arab world and the even older Aesop’s Fables. Still, it is not where a story has come from that concerns her so much as where it is going. Over the course of several sessions, The Huntsman, the King’s Son and the Enchanted Deer develops into a promenade piece, complete with puppetry, song and animated film. From here another arrivant, this time from Gambia, takes the spirit of Din’s story and turns it into something quite distinct, a comic parable with music called One for You and One for Me.Sceptics once again might worry that this privileging of fantastical and shape-shifting narratives strikes the wrong note in a world where truth has become slippery and facts are optional. But Warner is ready for them, pointing out that the world in which the arrivants live is already fictional. Rhetorically marshalled into “hordes” or “swarms”, these “aliens” are routinely denigrated as “scroungers” and even “criminals”. The official maps that tell them where they have come from and where they should go are also imaginary, continually redrawn in the wake of colonial and nationalistic carve-ups that frequently take little account of linguistic, cultural and ethnic affinities.There is another reason Warner feels strongly about encouraging the arrivants to play fast and loose with the materials to hand. At every stage in their hazardous journey they have been required to narrate their life stories to officials in particular ways if they are to be allowed to proceed to the next stage in their search for sanctuary. The dates must be right, the dangers consistent, and motives must be pure, involving escape from tyranny rather than desire for a better job. To deviate from the first telling of an account is to risk deportation. As a result, suggests Warner, in an exquisitely attuned reading of the situation, arrivants are sealed into versions of themselves that take no account of their changing feelings and experience. It is in this context that making up stories becomes vital in ensuring a form of survival that is as psychically healthy as it is physically safe.Sanctuary: Ways of Telling, Ways of Dwelling by Marina Warner is published by William Collins (£22).

Along with a lot of enjoyable hokum about the old guy mentoring the rookie hothead (a plot it broadly shares withPixar’s 2006 adventure Cars), F1 the Movie gives you the corporate sheen, real-life race footage with Brad as the star in an unreasonably priced car, the tech fetish of the cars themselves (almost making you forget how amazingly ugly they are) with brand names speckling every square inch of every surface, the simulation graphics writ large, and the bizarre occult spectacle of motor racing itself.This is a movie which (like Barbie) has been licensed by the brand, with Lewis Hamilton credited as a producer; he gets a stately walk-on and plenty of big names are glimpsed. At one stage, Brad noticesMax Verstappenout there on the track: “Damn, he’s good!” he mutters. Oh sure, yes, Max Verstappen is good, but is he a reckless, intuitive risk-taker and old-school motor race romantic who might get himself killed chasing some undefinable something out there on the burning, shimmering tarmac? We may never know.Pitt plays Sonny Hayes, a supercool driver who lost his way after a near-fatal crash 30 years ago, got himself back together after a stint in the wilderness as a professional gambler and New York City taxi driver (no flashbacks to that sadly) and now freelances as a race-car hombre, drifting around in his campervan, signing up for races where he can, wowing the young kids with his crazy attack strategies and wily cunning. His old driving buddy Ruben (Javier Bardem), now an owner, is in desperate need of some special old-school magic to revivify his failing team and offers Sonny a slot, to the nervous disapproval of pointy-headed board member and duplicitous creep Banning (Tobias Menzies) and the open disdain of mercurial young driving star Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris) who refers to him as “old man”. Is Sonny going to exasperate and yet excite Ruben by breaking all the rules? Oh but yes.Rangy, good-humoured Sonny soon works his cheeky magic with everyone, especially the technical director Kate McKenna; this is a really good performance from Kerry Condon who stamps hard on the relatability pedal and without whomBrad Pittand his finite range of expressions might have been floundering. And so we follow Sonny and the team as they compete all over the world from London to Abu Dhabi, each event prefaced with videogame-style graphics of the track and plenty of huge sans-serif titles saying things like “LAP 14”. The arcana of racing is lovingly reproduced, particularly the (to me, baffling) convention of the team meeting where everyone is wearing headphones and headset mics; can they not hear each other without them? Don’t other people at equally large conference tables manage without all this?Motor racing is a sport in which constituent team members seem to be competing against each other as much as against the opposition, and so it ought to be an ideal subject for a movie treatment. There’s a fair bit of macho silliness here, but the panache with which director Joseph Kosinski puts it together is very entertaining. Condon is a vital fuel ingredient and to a F1 non-believer like me, the result is surreal and spectacular.F1 the Movie is out on 25 June in the UK; 26 June in Australia; 27 June in the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFormula OneLewis HamiltonMax VerstappenFerrariMotor sportreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are co-director credits for Pixar stalwarts Adrian Molina (who was the co-director and co-screenwriter ofCoco) and feature first-timer Madeline Sharafian, and Pixar will be hoping for a handsome return here to match the success of its recent box office champInside Out 2.Elio may well indeed do the business. It has charm, likability and that potent ingredient: childhood loneliness and vulnerability. Its opening act is set aboard a military base where an ambitious young officer has postponed or even abandoned her dream of being astronaut to look after her orphaned nephew. But once the film leaves planet Earth and its recognisably real, lump-in-the-throat emotional world and inhabits the goofy multi-voiced arena of space aliens, it loses, for me, a little (though not all) of its charge. There is occasionally something a little formulaic, a bit programmatic and … well … which two letters of the alphabet sum it up?The film takes place in the present day, though references to “ham radios” might confuse you a little. Yonas Kibreab voices Elio, a little boy with a tousled short haircut, like Barry who opens the door to the aliens in Close Encounters, or Alfred E Neuman on the front of Mad magazine. He is deeply traumatised and depressed by the death of his mum and dad and now lives on the base with his aunt Olga, voiced byZoe Saldaña, a smart, squared-away young unmarried officer who is now his legal guardian. She is at her wit’s end, utterly at a loss as to how to get through to him.A visit to the space-exploration museum turns things around. Elio is thrilled by the exhibit dedicated to Nasa’s Voyager 1 space probe which launched in 1977, sending out a message of peace to any life forms in outer space. So he starts transmitting poignant pleas to any intergalactic life form to abduct him because no one loves him down here on Earth. (Here, the movie surely missed a trick in not usingthe Carpenters’ version of Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Crafton the soundtrack.) Due to a bizarre quirk of events, Elio finds himself being mistaken for Earth’s official ambassador by a benign, UN-style outer space assembly called the Communiverse, and asked to negotiate on their behalf with the aggressive alien Lord Grigon (voiced by Brad Garrett) who wants to take everything over. Elio fatefully makes contact with Grigon’s troubled, peaceful son Glordon (Remy Edgerly).View image in fullscreenA bizarre turn of events … Elio.Photograph: PixarThere are plenty of nice touches. Before starting negotiations with the terrifying Lord Grigon, Elio has schooled himself in what can only be called the art of the deal, and reminds himself: “Start from a position of power.” Whoever can have inspired screenwriters Julia Cho, Mark Hammer and Mike Jones on this? And given that the film was ready in 2023, could it be that they considered this person a harmless figure of fun, apt for marginal humour and safely confined to the dustbin of history?Maybe. The cosmic crisis continues, complicating Elio’s relationship with Glordon – leading to a very Spielbergian near-death incident – and with his ersatz mother. Plot developments mean, perhaps oddly, that Elio has to wear a blue eyepatch for much of the movie, a contrivance that facilitates an identity reveal. Overall, it’s an entertaining bit of summer fun.Elio is out on 19 June in Australia, and on 20 June in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmScience fiction and fantasy filmsFamily filmsPixarZoe SaldañareviewsShareReuse this content"

That means the makers are free to turn a beloved character into a murderous man-beast psychopath, with theWinnie-the-Pooh derived Blood and Honey franchisea prime example.Meanwhile, the moment black-and-white cartoon Steamboat Willie, the 1928 debut of Mickey Mouse, entered the public domain, almost half a dozen Mickey-themed slasher pics were born, like spores released from a fruiting body. In a very low-bar environment, I Heart Willie is perhaps a tick better than previous public domain horrors, or maybe we have reached the film critic’s equivalent of Stockholm syndrome, with our defences worn down by shoddy production values, originality deficits and lame performances.At least I Heart Willie offers a somewhat unusual backdrop: it is set in Michoacán, a western state ofMexico, where four teenagers, who mostly speak English even though three of them are locals, set out looking for trouble, as kids are wont to do in these films. They’ve heard of a house in the area haunted by a dead German mouse-boy named Willie; turns out rumours of his death are somewhat exaggerated as he’s still there and quite buff (and is played by the film’s screenwriter David Vaughn), although half of his skin is covered in mutilated latex and he wears a homemade mouse mask most of the time.Willie spends his time mutilating randoms who wander on to his property while blasting aptly public domain recordings such as Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries. Inevitably, nearly every member of the crew gets picked off, but there’s a twist, with one of the party not exactly who they seem to be. Final girl Maya Luna stars as Nora, a seemingly prim-in-pink type who displays an impressive acting range. Her charisma and commitment to this nonsense elevates the material just enough to make the marketing push behind this seem justified. That said, let’s not let the film’s tedious sadism and crappy dialogue off the hook.I Heart Willie is on digital platforms from 23 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsMexicoWalt Disney CompanyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, in his cheerfully celebratory and slightly corporate-promo way, he has made a film about Irish viticulture and drink in general, which means not simply wineries, breweries and distilleries actually in Ireland, but also abroad: this is about drinks producers with an Irish background, such as Hennessy brandy, which has an obvious Irish ancestry.It’s what this film calls “an Irish drink in a French terroir” – or, in fact, a terroir anywhere in the world, meaning places in Europe, the US and occasionally Australia and New Zealand. The film even jauntily insists that Ireland invented whiskey before Scotland. Prince Albert II of Monaco is interviewed about his love of Irish viticulture and the importance of his mother, Grace Kelly, one of the Kellys of County Mayo. The chief interviewee, however, is the amiableOz Clarke, himself of Irish heritage, who beamingly descants on how great Irish wine is.View image in fullscreenThe Baileys ‘ladies’ … A Sip of IrishThis is a film that is genially untroubled and unproblematic in its approach; the issue of, say, the homogenisation and industrialisation of wine production that, a generation ago, worriedfilm-maker Jonathan Nossiter in his 2004 film Mondovino, is absent. Mannion and his interviewees are content to simply find a range of nuances and differences, although the garrulous tone of Mannion’s film is not so far from Rossiter’s. The most startling moments of the film come when he visits the Baileys farm in County Wicklow, whose proprietor talks about the cows who produce the raw material for Baileys Irish Cream: his 230 “ladies”. This will be an acquired taste, perhaps.A Sip of Irish is in UK and Irish cinemas from 20 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsIrelandWineFoodWhiskyreviewsShareReuse this content"

This will probably get me in trouble with my mother in a way that coming out as bisexual never did, because she believed that you should always be your authentic self, so long as you have good taste. Stomp clap music has often been the subject of much derision and a bit of a punchline. But despite the ridicule, I’m willing to defend my taste.View image in fullscreenSinging about not telling someone you love them out of fear … the Lumineers.Composite: Guardian Design;  Kevin Winter/WireImageThe genre, sometimes referred to as stomp and holler or indie folk, peaked in the 2000s, with bands such as the Lumineers, Of Monsters and Men and, of course, Mumford & Sons – think a lot of guitars, banjos, the odd fiddle, literal stomping and clapping, with the occasional rousing “hey!” in the background. It was largely associated with hipsters – the twirly moustached, braces and Henley-shirt-wearing kind – and with band members who all look like Sunday school preachers and youth pastors. I can’t stand the aesthetic, but the music is undeniable.So how did a black queer woman – raised on jazz and soul – end up loving these bands? Mostly through a lot of late nights on Tumblr – the mainstay of any teenager figuring themselves out in the 2010s. I was obsessed withthe Norwegian teen drama Skamand all its various iterations and adaptations. It’s an obsession that led me to Tumblr, where there were tonnes of fan edits (short video tributes to the show’s couples and characters), all set to an endless stream of stomp and clap such as the Lumineers’OpheliaorKing and Lionheartby Of Monsters And Men.View image in fullscreenNanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir performs with Of Monsters and Men in 2012.Photograph: Caitlin Mogridge/Redferns/Getty ImagesThough my music taste wasn’t limited, it definitely wasn’t cool (whatever that means). As my love for the genre grew, my friends, a small group of queer kids at a Catholic school, were very much live and let live with my choices – we were already on the outskirts anyway. It was never exactly something to bust out at a group sesh, though. I think the closest I could get wasEd Sheeran’s Nancy Mulligan, which we could all agree was good “straight white” music.Now 23, I am (nearly) past that phase, but at the time the music was always a comfort to me, as I wrestled with coming out.Against the joyful twang of the banjo, the music was melancholy, but never devastating – a contrast to the turmoil I felt inside. There was longing and regret and unrequited love, but also hope after heartbreak. Songs such asCleopatra by the Lumineersspoke to the lifelong regret of not telling someone you love them out of fear. Others, such asThe Night We Metby Lord Huron, portrayed the first intense heartache you feel after drifting out of a relationship, something that spoke to me as I drifted home, aged 16, after kissing a girl for the first time – not able yet to talk about it, music was my solace.My love for these bands (with the exception of Mumford & Sons,you know what you did) was as much about the self-discovery as it was the music. Growing up, I lovedemo indie bandsbecause my friends put me on to them, while jazz and soul were a part of my upbringing. My violin lessons are why you will find Beethoven next toCowboy Carteron my playlists. But indie folk was all mine, music discovered in an online community almost as an antidote to the catholic guilt and self-loathing I was battling through. So for me stomp and clap was the soundtrack of my coming out and I’m willing to make the case for its inclusion on all Pride playlists this year. (Hear me out: fiddles at Pride!)"

Yet regard for his playing was never by any means universal; what his many admirers found as searching, considered and profound in his interpretations, others heard as colourless and lacking in spontaneity. But Brendel’s lasting popularity is evidenced by his recorded legacy, which is certainly extensive enough for generations to come to make their own assessment of his stature. In a recording career that stretched well over half a century, he made more than 100 albums, which included three complete cycles of the Beethoven sonatas.As his career burgeoned, Beethoven, and the other great composers of the Austro-German tradition - Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Brahms - were increasingly the focus of Brendel’s recital repertory, but a glance at a chronology of his recordings reveals how wide his musical interests really were. If it is Brendel’s discs of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert that will be treasured above all, there is much else to be discovered among the myriad recordings he left us. The recordings that follow, therefore, are very much a personal choice; another day, it might be entirely different.Busoni: Fantasia Contrappuntistica (1953)Busoni was a composer who fascinated Brendel, but he recorded very little of the piano music, with the exception of this early performance of the Italian musician’s most challenging solo work.Mussorgsky, Balakirev and Stravinsky (1955)A sampler from early in his career of some of the Russian repertoire with which Brendel was never associated later in his life.Liszt: Opera Transcriptions (1958)Liszt, especially the great B minor Sonata, remained part of Brendel’s repertory for much of his career, but early on he spread his net much wider, as this collection shows.Schumann: Works for oboe (1980)Brendel recorded relatively little chamber music, but he did make some discs as an accompanist, including a Winterreise with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and this jewel-like collection in which he partnered the greatest oboist of the age, Heinz Holliger.Mozart: The Piano Concertos (1980s)The cycle of the Mozart piano concertos that Brendel recorded with Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields was one of landmark discs of the 1980s.Haydn: 11 Sonatas (1986)The essence of Brendel’s Viennese style, utterly lacking in affectation and mannerisms.Schubert: Piano Sonatas D958, 959 & 960 (1988)Schubert’s late sonatas always seem to bring the best out of Brendel, his intellectual rigour, his sense of lyricism and sometimes sheer fun.Brahms: Piano Concerto No 1 (1987)In later years especially, Brendel did not play much of Brahms’s solo piano music, but he performed the concertos, as this magnificent account of the First, with Claudio Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic shows.Beethoven Piano Concerto No 5 (1988)A majestic, live performance of the Emperor Concerto, with Kurt Masur conducting.Beethoven: Diabelli Variations (1990)As masterly as all his Beethoven performances were, it often seemed as if the Diabelli Variations brought the very best out of Brendel, with their quickfire changes of mood, moments of introspection and wicked humour.Beethoven: Piano Sonatas Opp 90, 101, 106,109, 110, 111 (1993)A compilation from the second of Brendel’s three Beethoven sonata cycles, released just as he was about to begin a third, digital cycle for Philips.Schoenberg: Piano Concerto (1996)After the early years Brendel played very little 20th-century music, but Schoenberg’s concerto did remain part of his repertory; this recording, with Michael Gielen conducting, is one of at least two that he made.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicAlfred BrendelShareReuse this content"

As a muggy summer’s day began outside Shildon, Durham – rain threatening, bees drowsy in the hedgerows – I found myself standing on an embankment, surveying two rows of colossal stone teeth jutting through the earth. It looked as if someone had buried a sleeping giant.“You wouldn’t believe it by looking at it, but this is one of railway history’s most amazing feats,” my companion, rail expert Richie Starrs, said as we gazed down at the molars beneath our feet. A closer look revealed they were abandoned rail sleepers, laid out between the hawthorns and along which coal wagons were once pulled uphill by steam traction locomotives. “This is the Brusselton Incline, a section of the original Stockton and Darlington Railway. Nationally, it’s a story that’s not well known, but it’s one we’re rightly proud of.”Durham mapFor those interested in such rail history, this is a year like no other. Two hundred years ago, on 27 September 1825, the 26-mile Stockton and Darlington Railway opened as the world’s first public railway, making Shildon the world’s first railway town. And the lessons learned there helped the north-east, then Britain, Europe and the world grasp the importance of rail travel, first for transporting coal and lime, then, decisively, for passengers. It is “the railway that got the world on track”.A focal point of this year’s bicentennial celebrations throughout Britain (seeRailway 200for details on hundreds of events) is Durham’s new multi-useS&DR Trail of Discovery. Launching this month as part of the multi-artsS&DR200festival, the meandering greenway follows the original 26-mile route from Witton Park Colliery near Bishop Auckland to Stockton Riverside and will, its founders hope, stimulate interest in the region’s rail history – and give a shot in the arm to the “left behind” pit communities along the way. There is a buoyant mood around the anniversary, but that doesn’t dispel the melancholy that has lingered over much of the rail line since the coalfields were exhausted and the Shildon Wagon Works, once described as “the jewel in British Rail’s crown”, was closed.View image in fullscreenA replica of Locomotion No 1, the first steam-powered train to run on the Stockton and Darlington Railway.Photograph: Lonely Town Film & MediaThere would be some who find this all too trainspotterish, but not Starrs, S&DR200’s project manager, or Niall Hammond, volunteer chair of the Friends of the S&DR, both of whom joined me on the first completed section of the trail, a five-mile ramble from the Brusselton Incline to Heighington station, the world’s first train station, at Newton Aycliffe.The idea is to encourage travellers to walk, eat and stay on the trail for two to three days, but also spark wider regeneration for the areaOver the coming months, the trail – rich in history – will be transformed with 17 information boards and newly commissioned art murals, plus a podcast and augmented reality game, devised to add colour. Fittingly, you can also hop on a train between many of the milestones along the route.The idea, Niall told me, is to encourage travellers to walk, eat and stay on the trail for two to three days, but also spark wider regeneration for the area. According to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, Durham remains one of the most deprived areas in England. “This is more than history for people who like rail tracks and iron,” he told me. “The whole point is to make it count for locals. We’re doing up buildings, cleaning up areas and showing why the world was changed from here. It’s urban regeneration in action.”View image in fullscreenSkerne Bridge, the world’s oldest railway bridge in continuous use.Photograph: Mike MacEacheranOnce my eyes had learned to read the signs of rail history in the landscape, despite the absence of so much of it, it became easier to imagine how this tiny corner of Durham changed the world. Along a stretch of the reclaimed rail line through Shildon, impressions of former goods sheds, an iron warehouse, loading bays and an engine house appeared next to tired houses and an empty pub.We passed a coaling drop, admiring the handsome brickwork arches and columns that once saw wooden chutes rapidly unload coal into hoppers and a row of railway workers’ cottages, now memorials to those who dedicated their lives to the tracks. There was no whiff of engine oil, only bluebells and primrose.The newest part of Shildon’s compelling train story is atLocomotion, a museum that opened its £8m New Hall last year. It holds Europe’s largest indoor collection of historic locomotives (a mightily impressive 99 engines) and is the temporary home of a 150-year-old bronze statue of the great north-east rail engineer Robert Stephenson, after its removal from London Euston during construction works for HS2, Britain’s controversial high-speed railway. Alongside his influential father George, who designed the first locomotive for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, Robert shaped rail history, and taking pride of place inside is his world-renowned locomotive Rocket, built in 1829 and on loan from York’sNational Railway Museum.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thankfully, that was not on the menu.Another good place to step through the looking-glass isHopetown Darlington, an eight-minute train journey from Heighington to North Road station, which unloads passengers beside another superlative: the Skerne Bridge, the world’s oldest railway bridge that has remained in continuous use. The open-air rail museum, with 3 hectares (7.5 acres) and an exhibition in a Victorian-era station, is an arsenal of detail, with a dust-free archive of 30,000 heritage artefacts.The trivia is half the fun. When a message was to be delivered from a moving train to a station, I learned, the note was tucked inside a slit potato and simply flung from the window. Amazingly, the story of the Stockton and Darlington Railway is on the Japanese school curriculum, but not in England.View image in fullscreenThe Opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, 1825 by John Dobbin.Photograph: Hopetown, DarlingtonIn its great engineering hall, I was reminded of the UK’s contribution to railways the world over. Robert Stephenson went on to help create the Grand Trunk Railway in Canada, as well as the first railroad in Egypt. His work directly influenced the Norwegian Trunk Railway and the first railway in Argentina.Rightly, all of this and more will be celebrated across the UK this summer – fromInspiration, Railway 200’s unique exhibition train, which is touring 60 stations (from 27 June), to the largest ever assembly of rolling stock at Derby Litchurch Lane Works, the country’s largest train factory (The Greatest Gathering, 1 to 3 August). Essentially, it is an education in the benefits of rail travel and the art of slowing down at home. Or, perhaps, it’s better to think of this as a story about people, communities and the tracks that help bring them together.S&DR 200runsto November 2025 acrossDurham and the Tees Valley.Railway 200runsto the end of the year, with eventsnationwide.

How do I make it nice and crisp?Anne, by email“Moisture is the enemy of crisp tofu,” says Emma Chung, author ofEasy Chinese Food Anyone Can Make, so the quest for cubes of bean curd that are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside starts by getting rid of as much excess water as possible (and choosing a tofu labelled “firm” or “extra-firm” in the first place). “I usually do this by wrapping the tofu in tea towels, placing it between two large plates and putting a heavy pot or pan on top,” Chung says. After 10 minutes, you “should have a nice and firm tofu that will have a lovely texture, and it will be a lot easier to crisp up”.Guardian columnist Ravinder Bhogal, meanwhile, pops her tofu on a wire rack set over a tray and covers it with kitchen paper or a clean cloth: “Put a weight on top and leave it for a couple of hours, and ideally overnight – that will squeeze out the excess moisture.” She then pats the tofu dry and coats it in corn, rice or potato flour before frying (or putting in an air fryer) for an “off-the-Richter crunch”. Chung is simpatico, coating her tofu pieces in a thin layer of cornflour to create a crust that “turns extra crisp when fried or baked”. Simply put the cubed tofu in a bowl, cover “generously” with cornflour and give everything a good toss. “If you’re using slices of tofu, dip them in a shallow plate of cornflour to make sure they’re evenly coated.”Kirk Haworth, chef and co-founder ofPlates, the UK’s first Michelin-starred vegan gaff, recommends hard-frying the coated tofu. Pour oil into a pan and, once that’s “really hot, whack in the tofu and fry, stirring constantly, for about three minutes”. Don’t overcrowd the pan, though, so fry it in batches, if need be, and transfer the cooked cubes to a paper-lined plate to drain. At this time of year, Haworth would then be inclined to toss those crisp cubes through a cold noodle salad, or pile them on to little gem lettuce leaves, while Chung prefers hers in a salad of chopped cucumber and cherry tomatoes. Either way, you’ll want a punchy sauce to go with it, because tofu is more a vehicle for flavour than a wonder in its own right: “Equal parts soy sauce, vinegar, tahini, a splash of sesame oil and chilli oil would be my basic go-to,” Chung says.Alternatively, dial up the heat withMeera Sodha’s chilli tofu. Fry bashed cumin seeds and diced onion in oil until soft, then add crushed garlic, grated ginger and green chilli. After five minutes, go in with some ground black pepper, tomato puree, soy sauce, sugar and salt, followed by sliced red and green peppers and a little water. Once the peppers are soft, add the crisp fried tofu to the pan to warm through, then add greens and chapatis to serve.And if you’re still struggling with that rubbery texture, Haworth recommends tempura-ing your tofu: “Marinate it in soy sauce, honey and chilli, leave it, then dip in tempura batter and fry,” he says. “Nowthat’sdefinitely going to be crisp – although probably a little less healthy.”Got a culinary dilemma?

In the UK, the season starts a bit later, around June, so we’ve got a bit more time yet to enjoy them. Still, the season is short, so I use these wonderful beans as much as I can, while I can. This is the kind of dish I’d make on a quiet afternoon: simple, full of flavour, nothing fancy. Just a nice way to enjoy what the season gives you, before it disappears again for another year.Broad bean and mint tortilla with a manchego crustPrep15 minCook30 minutesServes2-42 tbsp olive oil1 banana shallot, peeled and finely chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and finely sliced250g fresh broad bean pods, podded to yield 100-125g beans4 large free-range eggsSalt and black pepper2 mint sprigs, leaves stripped and chopped50g manchego, gratedHeat the oil in a small roughly 16cm nonstick frying pan, then gently saute the shallot for 10 minutes, until lovely and soft. Add the garlic, cook, stirring, for a minute more, then take off the heat.Bring a pan of water to a boil and blanch the broad beans for a minute or two, depending on their size. Drain and refresh in cold water, then slip each bean from its outer shell (discard the shells).Beat the eggs in a bowl and season generously. Add the beans, mint and half the manchego to the bowl, then, using a slotted spoon, lift the softened shallot out of the pan, leaving the oil behind, and stir it into the egg mix.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app, scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.Return the pan and oil to a medium-low heat, then, once it has heated up, pour in the egg mixture and swirl the pan until you see the egg starting to set around the sides. Leave to cook undisturbed for three to four minutes, until the bottom is set and the top is still quite juicy. Invert the pan on to a flat plate or board (don’t worry if it’s a bit oozy), so the tortilla is cooked side up, then quickly add the remaining cheese to the hot pan and turn up the heat a little. As soon as the cheese starts to melt and bubble, slide the tortilla back into the pan, uncooked side down on top of the layer of cheese.Use a spatula to tuck in the edges of the tortilla to create those classic round sides, and leave to cook for two to three minutes more. Use a spatula or fish slice to release the cheesy underside of the tortilla, then turn out on to a plate and serve with good bread and perhaps a nice salad.Explore more on these topicsSpanish food and drinkSummer food and drinkFoodEggsVegetablesCheeseMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"
