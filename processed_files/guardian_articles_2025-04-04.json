The tariffs “clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth,” said the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva.China’s retaliation came after Trump imposed 34% tariffs on Chinese goods, which were already subject to a 20% levy, taking the total levy to 54%. He also imposed hefty tariffs on neighbouring countries in south-east Asia including Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, through which billions of dollars of Chinese exports are processed on their way to the US.Trump responded on his social media platform Truth Social on Friday. He said: “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!”The UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said ministers would continue to negotiate with Washington, in the hope that the 10% levy on UK exports could be lifted. The UK is offering a series of concessions, including a cut to the £1bn-a-year digital services tax for some of the biggest tech firms.“We want to do everything in our power, and we’ll continue to do everything in our power to get the best possible deal for British industry, working closely with them to protect prosperity and jobs here in the UK,” she said.Trump tariff timelineFinancial markets are now pricing in a further three interest cuts from the Bank of England by the end of this year, as they weigh up the risks of weaker growth, as some analysts warned that a slowdown could force Reeves to raise taxes in her autumn budget.“I would have thought the central expectation now must be that if she is sticking to her fiscal rules, she’ll need to increase taxes in the autumn by possibly some significant amount,” said Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Downing Street says Trump’s tariffs signal ‘new era’ in global economicsRead moreOn Wall Street, the tech-focused Nasdaq index entered bear market territory – meaning it has lost more than 20% of its value since the sell-off began. It was down 5.8% on Friday alone. The S&P 500 fell 9.1%, its worst five-day trading stretch since March 2020.Oil prices also declined sharply, as experts reassessed their projections for global growth, with Brent crude down 7% at about $65 a barrel.FTSE 100 chartGeorgieva appealed for calm. “It is important to avoid steps that could further harm the world economy. We appeal to the US and its trading partners to work constructively to resolve trade tensions and reduce uncertainty.”There was little sign of such moderation in China’s trenchant response to theTrump tariffs, however. The country’s state council tariff commission said the US approach was “not in line with international trade rules, seriously undermines China’s legitimate rights and interests, and is a typical unilateral bullying practice”.Despite fears his trade war will send prices higher for Americans, Trump also called on the independent Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, urging Powell, “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!”Countries exporting the most goods to the US chartIn a speech in Arlington, Virginia, on Friday, however, Powell suggested the outlook was still too uncertain to make decisions about the direction of monetary policy. “It is too soon to say what the appropriate policy stance should be. I understand the uncertainty that people feel, but it’s a process that we are going through.”But he gave a blunt assessment of the likely effects of Trump’s policies. “While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,” he said. “The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.”‘In economic terms, Trump’s tariffs make no sense at all’Read moreThe president has promised voters his “liberation day” policies will bring jobs and investment pouring back into the US. But investors fear the higher prices that are likely to result will depress consumer demand in the US, and put the brakes on export-dependent economies worldwide.The market meltdown has also been fuelled by Trump’s unpredictability, which makes it impossible to forecast whether he will negotiate away some of the tariffs in exchange for concessions – or double down.Trump’s chart of tariffsOn Friday alone, Trump posted a message insisting “MY POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE,” followed four hours later by another statement in which he said he had had “a very productive call” with the Vietnamese leader, To Lam, who Trump claimed had offered to reduce that country’s tariffs.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, shrugged off the chaos on Wall Street on Friday, appearing to suggest it was all part of the administration’s plan for reshaping the US economy.“Markets are crashing because markets are based on the stock value of companies who today are embedded in modes of production that are bad for the US,” he claimed.Still, in the UK, some economists suggested the tariffs may have only a modest impact. James Smith, an economist at the analysts ING, said: “The overall hit from tariffs on Britain’s GDP is perhaps only 0.2% or so. Certainly not enough to decisively change the outlook for UK growth. And remember there are some decent tailwinds for growth this year, notably from government spending.”The investment bank JP Morgan said it now sees a 60% chance of the global economy entering recession by the year-end, up from 40% previously.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsGlobal economyDonald TrumpChinaEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Support is also available by contacting the independent charity Rape Crisis.”The Met said detectives had begun investigations after receiving a number of allegations, which followed reporting by Channel 4’s Dispatches and the Sunday Times.Brand has previously denied allegations of rape, assault and emotional abuse that have been made against him. And in a video posted on Instagram released later on Friday, he said that he had “never engaged in non-consensual activity” and was “grateful” for the chance to defend himself in court.The Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement that it had authorised the police to charge Brand with a number of sexual offences.Jaswant Narwal, a barrister and prosecutor at the CPS, said: “We carefully reviewed the evidence after a police investigation into allegations made following the broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023.“We have concluded that Russell Brand should be charged with offences including rape, sexual assault and indecent assault.Narwal added: “The Crown Prosecution Service reminds everyone that criminal proceedings are active, and the defendant has the right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.”Brand is believed to have moved to the US, claiming he is being “attacked” and “shut down” by the British authorities. He interviewed Donald Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, last year in Florida.The decision to authorise charges follows the confirmation in November 2024 by the CPS that detectives had passed on an evidence file regarding sexual offence allegations against Brand.Channel 4 and the production company Banijay UK also announced they had launched separate internal investigations into his conduct, after the allegations in 2023, with the BBC also reviewing Brand’s time at the corporation.In the Dispatches programme, four women alleged assaults had taken place between 2006 and 2013, a period in which Brand was working for the BBC and Channel 4, as well as starring in Hollywood films.An investigation, launched by Banijay UK – which bought the company that produced some of the Channel 4 shows Brand worked on – found that informally raised concerns about the comedian and actor’s behaviour while he worked on several of the channel’s programmes were “not properly escalated or adequately addressed”.The Channel 4 investigation found “no evidence” that staff were aware of accusations about the comedian and actor contained in the Dispatches programme. A BBC review, which was published in January, found a number of people “felt unable to raise” concerns about the presenter.Brand, who presented a BBC Radio 2 show between 2006 and 2008, left the role after his on-air prank that became known as Sachsgate, when he left a voicemail for the Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter.The entertainer, who was born in Essex and started a career in entertainment as a standup comedian, became famous in Britain as the host of the television programme Big Brother’s Big Mouth.He went on to star in Hollywood films such as St Trinian’s and the remake of Arthur. He also delved into politics, endorsing Ed Miliband in the 2015 British general election, but has now emerged as a fervent backer of Donald Trump and has appeared alongside a range of hard-right political commentators.In recent years he has focused on podcasting and cultivating followers on video platforms. He has reinvented himself as a Christian, after being baptised in the River Thames in 2024 during a ceremony that also involved the adventurer and broadcaster Bear Grylls.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

For example, the duke sends a letter to the president for his birthday each year.”His statement, made in May 2024, said Andrew “must surely be a valuable communication point with China”. “Whilst I think China would prefer a different royal, the reality is, to this day, that if the UK government or the palace said that someone needs to see the Chinese president and talk to him, I think the duke would be able to do that, whereas I don’t think anyone else could do so as simply.”Hampshire said that, having known Andrew for nearly 20 years, and worked closely with him for five, he believed he was “deeply trusted” within the palace at “the highest level”. He said he had had two meetings in six months last year with Andrew and the king “to discuss what the duke can do moving forward in a way that is acceptable to his majesty”.Hampshire said the Eurasia Fund was discussed with the king at these meetings. The Eurasia Fund was an investment vehicle, involving Andrew and Yang, which intended to use Chinese funds for renewable energy projects in Africa but never got off the ground.Buckingham Palace said of Hampshire’s meetings with the king: “While his majesty met the duke and his adviser to hear outline proposals for independent funding over the past year, the individual known as H6 [Yang] was not mentioned at any time or in any way as part of these discussions.”It is understood that while Andrew may have mentioned a number of proposals including the Eurasia Fund, it was not discussed in any level of detail with the king, nor did the king or his advisers give approval to this business relationship or opportunity.Hampshire said Andrew’s reputation was “irrecoverable” after his BBC Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis about his relationship with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. “This was a common feeling within the royal household, despite what the duke thought may happen. It was very clear internally within the royal household that we would have to look at options for the duke’s future away from royal duties.”He said the duke’s Pitch@Palace initiative, set up to support entrepreneurs, was one of Andrew’s “indisputable successes” and there were hopes it would continue internationally. He added that Yang, who was the founder-partner of Pitch@Palace China, had not deserted the duke after the interview even while UK sponsors and supporters of Andrew’s initiative were “falling away”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But because of the work on Pitch he had succeeded in building up his personal brand and reputation in China.“He was well regarded in senior circles and in Chinese media perception. After the Maitlis interview, the duke’s reputation in China was terrible.”Hampshire said he was summonsed by the late queen’s private secretary, Sir Edward Young, and asked if he knew Yang, who had come to the attention of the security services. Hampshire said in his statement he told Young: “Chris is pretty much our only avenue for the duke moving forward and arguably the only light at the end of the tunnel for him. Do you have a plan B? Sir Edward said he did not.”In the five years he had known Yang, Hampshire said there had “never been one single red flag in my head” about him, and in the “limited contact” Andrew had, the duke was “of the same opinion”. He added that Yang “categorically does not have a close relationship with the duke”.After the documents were made public on Friday, Hampshire said he left the royal household in 2022 and no longer provided advice to Andrew. He said Andrew “fully complied” with advice to end all contact with Yang.“For the record, as soon as the Duke of York was advised to cease all contact with Mr Yang, he fully complied,” Hampshire said in a statement. “He did not receive a penny in funding or support, directly or indirectly, from any Chinese individual or entity.”Yang has previously said he intends to appeal against the decision upholding his ban from entering the UK.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewChinaUK security and counter-terrorismImmigration and asylumMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

That is what happened in this case.”When cross-examined, she added that when judging the public interest of a story there were formal systems in place and that she sought to take any “emotion out of it”.The Guardian’s deputy editor, Owen Gibson, told the high court that GNM’s ownership structure ensured that there was no commercial or proprietorial pressure to publish the results of an investigation.He confirmed that concerns that Clarke and his business partner, Jason Maza, were contacting witnesses and “could cause further intimidation or distress to sources or other women, as well as potentially deterring sources from speaking to us or going on the record” had been a consideration in the timing of the first article.“We have to look after our sources and I considered that to be a legitimate factor when considering the timing of publication,” he said.Anna Kaiser, a German film director, was the final witness in GNM’s defence. She told the court that she had been an intern on the film Doghouse in 2008 in which Clarke had played a leading role.She said: “When he arrived in the morning or when I first saw him each day, he would greet me and, on several occasions, try to pull me in with an arm before going in to peck me on the lips.“As I recall, I pulled away every time and I can’t remember if he ever actually succeeded at kissing me this way. I think this happened around a handful of times. At first it was cheeky but persistent, but it became less playful and his attitude became less friendly after I avoided it each time. My reaction each time, though I didn’t say it in so many words, was ‘oh, not this again’”.When asked by Clarke’s barrister whether this was not simply standard behaviour on such an intimate and friendly film set, Kaiser noted that none of the other men on the set had greeted female colleagues by kissing them on the lips.The closing submissions in the trial will be heard on Friday before a written judgment by Mrs Justice Steyn.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeGuardian Media GroupThe GuardiannewsShareReuse this content"

Is this the sameLabourparty that accepted the defections of then Conservative MPs Christian Wakeford and Natalie Elphicke?”The Labour study of candidate nominations for the local elections in May shows more than 60 Reform council candidates across Britain have served as councillors, candidates or activists for the Tories.Reform’s parliamentary candidate for the byelection in Runcorn and Helsby, triggered by the resignation of the Labour MP Mike Amesbury after a criminal conviction, is Sarah Pochin, a former Tory councillor for Cheshire East.In social media posts that have been deleted since Pochin became a Reform candidate, she described her “absolute pleasure” posing in 2019 with the then levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, while she was a Conservative councillor, before describing her meeting with Liz Truss’s business secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg, as “inspiring”.Nineteen of the 23 councils up for election this May are run by the Conservatives. There will be mayoral elections in the West ofEngland, and Peterborough and Cambridgeshire, and inaugural mayoral contests in Hull and East Yorkshire, and Greater Lincolnshire.A Labour spokesperson said: “A snake might shed its skin but at the end of the day it’s still a snake.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the targets were Hamas control centres.View image in fullscreenThe search continues for survivors of an Israeli airstrike on Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, early on Friday.Photograph: Mariam Dagga/APAccording to the UN, 280,000 people have been forced to leave their homes or shelters since Israel decided to abandon a two-month-old ceasefire withHamas, cutting off aid and fuel on 2 March and resuming large-scale bombing two weeks later.Ground troops have since re-entered the strip’s southernmost city of Rafah and the Netzarim corridor that cuts offGazaCity from the rest of the territory. On Friday, the IDF said troops were advancing in Shuja’iya, a northern suburb of Gaza City.Israeli officials vowed this week toseize large swathes of the stripas security zones and establish a new military corridor between Rafah and Khan Younis, exacerbating Palestinian fears of permanent displacement and annexation.Friday also saw escalations on other fronts in the regional conflagration set in motion by Hamas’s October 2023 attack on southern Israel. Israel says 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians, were killed and a further 250 taken captive in the attack; all but 59 have since been released in hostage and detainee swaps. Israel’s retaliatory military campaign on Gaza has killed at least 50,600 people, most of them civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.In Lebanon on Friday, the Israeli military said it had killed Hassan Farhat, a senior Hamas commander, in an airstrike on the southern city of Sidon, a move that threatens to upset the fragile truce signed in November with the Hamas-allied Lebanese militant groupHezbollah.View image in fullscreenFirefighters tackle a blaze at an apartment block in Sidon, Lebanon, after an airstrike by Israeli forces.Photograph: Mohammad Abushama/Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe bombing came after Israel targeted what it said were Hezbollah facilities in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, last weekfor the first time since the ceasefirewent into effect. That attack was launched in response to rocket fire aimed at northern Israel, which neither Hamas nor Hezbollah claimed responsibility for.Tensions between Israel and the new transitional government inSyriaare also rising after a wave of Israeli airstrikes across the country and a deepening Israeli ground incursion in the Daraa border area on Thursday, in which 13 people were killed.Israel has long targeted Hezbollah and Iranian assets in Syria but has continued its bombing campaign since Islamist-led rebel groups forced the dictator Bashar al-Assad to flee the country in December. It has also seized land in southern Syria and warned that Islamist groups must stay away from Israeli territory.Hakan Fidan, the foreign minister of Turkey, which backs the new regime in Damascus, on Friday accused Israel of fuelling regional instability.“Israel is taking out, one by one, all these capabilities that a new state can use against Isis and other terrorist threats,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of a Nato summit in Brussels. “What Israel is doing in Syria is not only threatening the security of Syria, but also is paving the way for future instability of the region.”Also on Friday, the Israeli army confirmed troops killed a Palestinian teenager after shooting at a group of boys and young men throwing stones near the occupied West Bank village of Husan the night before. Palestinian officials gave his name as Yusef Zaoul, 17. The IDF did not comment on the deceased’s name or age.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelPalestinian territoriesHamasLebanonnewsShareReuse this content"

This is thesecond timethe president will have delayed the ban or sale of the social media app, and will punt the deadline to 75 days from now.The TikTok deal “requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed”, Trumpannouncedon his Truth Social platform on Friday.ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, issued a statement in response to the executive order: “ByteDance has been in discussion with the US government regarding a potential solution forTikTokUS. An agreement has not been executed. There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law.”China put a possible deal on hold this week after Trump announced his sweeping tariffs, according to Reuters.Congresspassed a law last yearforcing TikTok to either divest or sell its assets in the US. The law stemmed from concerns that the app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, could use the social media platform to manipulate Americans. The first deadline to ban or force the sale of the app was 19 January. But, on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to delay that decision to 5 April. Now the new deadline will be in mid-June.Earlier this week, the president met with potential buyers for TikTok and said his administration is“very close” to a deal. Among those who’ve reportedly thrown in bids are a consortium of investors led by the software giant Oracle, asset manager Blackstone, Amazon, Walmart, billionaire Frank McCourt, a crypto foundation, and the founder of the adult website OnlyFans.TikTok is a tremendously popular social media app with 170 million users in the US. Investors and corporations see huge appeal with owning the app and its secretive algorithm.ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok and in previous court filings said a divestiture “is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally”.After announcingsweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, Trump hinted on Thursday aboard Air Force One that he might lessen the trade penalties onChinaif ByteDance were to approve a sale. The country faces a 54% tariff on goods imported to the US.“We have a situation withTikTokwhere China will probably say we’ll approve a deal, but will you do something on the tariffs.

That’s why we’ve seen consumers pursuing ‘set-jetting’, or visiting the filming locations of these programmes.“For most consumers, though, such trips are out of reach, but sampling the cuisine of those locations is a lot easier. Takeaway and other cuisine exploration of the foods enjoyed by TV characters gives consumers a tangible way to connect with their favourite shows without needing to leave their sofas,” she said.The ritual, nicknamed “White Lotus Mondays” (or Sundays, for US viewers), has gone viral on social media, with fans posting videos of their Thai food orders in front of the TV. One video showing a user’s table covered in Thai food, captioned: “I saw this idea and will be doing it every week from now on,” has more than 959.1k views and 90.2k likes.Trish Caddy, Mintel’s associate director of foodservice, added: “Mintel research finds that 58% of UK diners who recently ordered or are open to trying south-east Asian cuisine [such as] Thai food, show strong enthusiasm for its bold flavours.“Cultural influences continue to redefine what we eat and how we connect with global cuisine.”Explore more on these topicsDramaFood & drink industryTV comedyTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

We are already embracing that new era and ready to tackle it.”Ministers have said they are still optimistic they can agree a trade deal with the US in the coming weeks that would avoid the worst of the direct impact of the tariffs. It is hoped negotiations will restart next week.The broad outlines of a deal have been drawn up and include concessions across a range of areas, including a lower digital services tax on US tech companies and reduced tariffs on some agricultural products. The government has not denied reports that the deal includes a commitment to review enforcement of the UK’s online safety and digital competition regulations.Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the business and trade select committee, warned ministers against making too many concessions. “President Trump’s tariffs could hit our economy so hard that we stand to lose billions and billions in tax revenues. So, yes, we should be flexible – but there are limits,” he said.“We’re not trying to become the 51st state of America. Sacrificing high standards or strong competition rules would make us riskier, weaker and less productive. Crucially, any deal with the US must be matched by a bolder strategy to deepen ties with many, many like-minded free-trading nations around the world – starting with our closest neighbours in the EU.”Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee, cautioned the government against giving away too much on agricultural and food policy.“The previous government gave away a lot but they gave it away in markets that didn’t matter so much. America is a market that matters, and if you give it up, you’ll never get it back,” he said. “We have really high animal welfare and environmental standards and America works with very different rules.”Chi Onwurah, the Labour chair of the science and technology select committee, said that while successful trade talks were critical, “tech adoption is dependent on public trust as well as investment and it is important that the British people know tech policy is made in Britain for the benefit of Britain”.Trump’s tariff war – a timeline of key announcements and eventsEconomists say the likely slowdown in the global economy caused by tariffs will have such a significant impact on the UK – with or without a US trade deal – that it will force the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to raise taxes in the autumn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Johnson added: “The one upside for Reeves is that it’s now going to be quite easy to make the argument that the world has changed.”Treasury sources say it is too early to start planning this year’s budget, but they stressed on Friday that Reeves intended to stick to her borrowing rules. “Our broader economic strategy remains the same – we need to offer stability to make the UK an attractive place to invest,” one Whitehall official said.Downing Street said on Friday that Starmer thought Trump’s tariffs would have as much impact on the global economy as his shift away from Europe was having on security policy.David Lammy, the foreign secretary, went further, saying during a visit to Brussels that he regretted a“return to protectionism”by the US, which was “something that we’ve not seen for nearly a century”.No 10 refused to echo Lammy’s language, but called Trump’s decision “disappointing”, in contrast with the US president himself,who saidStarmer had told him he was “very happy” with the UK’s tariff of 10%.A No 10 spokesperson said: “We need to understand – just as we’ve understood it for defence and security – the changing world when it comes to trade and the economy.

The US central bank may be reluctant to cut rates in the face of rocketing prices.“The ability of monetary policy to be the shock absorber may be more limited now because of the price impact of tariffs, and the stickiness of inflation,” said Gerard Lyons, the chief economist strategist at Netwealth..The scope for spending policy to offset any potential slowdown – with tax cuts to boost demand, for example – also looks constrained inside and outside the US, with many countries already struggling with the debt hangover from Covid.Another important factor driving the scale of the hit to growth is how aggressively US economic rivals hit back, with tit-for-tat tariffs likely to make a bad situation worse.Part of the answer emerged on Friday, when Beijing announced that instead of a forensically targeted response, it would simply slap 34% tariffs on all US imports. Markets plunged.Researchers at the OxfordEconomicsconsultancy predicted Trump’s measures could knock global GDP growth to below 2% this year, the weakest rate since the 2008 financial crisis, excluding the pandemic.After global growth of 3.2% in 2024, such an outcome would mark a significant decline, but would fall short of a global recession – which economists view as GDP growth falling short of the 0.9% rate of world population growth.Suggestions that the entire global trading system will be brought to a halt look wide of the mark, however. Although the US has lengthy supply chains stretching into vital overseas markets, trade still stands as a relatively small proportion of its overall $30tn economy; and as much as 80% of global trade in goods does not directly touch the US, according to research from the Boston Consulting Group..“Although we’re focused on the US being the largest economy, and the largest importer, things have changed from 10, 20, 30 years ago,” said Butler. “If you compare this with going back to the early 1970s, when Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard and imposed a temporary 10% tariff on trade, the US was vastly more important then.”The impact on countries will vary significantly, depending on the level of tariffs they face, and how reliant they are on exports to the US, and on trade more broadly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAnalysts at the Capital Economics consultancy reckon EU growth may be 0.25% lower as a result of the 20% levy its exports face, and Chinese growth perhaps 0.75% lower, for example.They suggest the UK, which was not in Trump’s sights because it does not have a major trade surplus with the US and so faces the minimum 10% tariff, will not be among the worst hit.“In the UK, the effect on growth is still a rounding error: it’s 0.1%,” said Capital’s chief economist, Neil Shearing. “It hits exporters in particular sectors – but it doesn’t necessarily hit the UK economy as a whole.”For some economies in the global south facing eye-wateringly high tariffs, however, and with little negotiating power, the effects could be devastating.Cambodia faces 49% tariffs, Laos 48% and Vietnam 46%.Back on Trump’s doorstep, in the medium term, experts say a radically more protectionist US is likely to be less competitive and more expensive – and may encourage other economies to forge deeper trading links between each other.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping. China reacted to the tariffs hike with a reciprocal 34% levy, sending markets plummetingPhotograph: Mandel Ngangreg Baker/AFP/Getty Images“You have a doughnut, where the US is an island surrounded by tariffs of 10-60%, while the rest of the world goes its own way,” says Creon Butler, who leads the global economy and finance programme at Chatham House, in London.“Look at how the Soviet Union performed in a state of autarky [economic isolationism]. If you do have this US island economy, you will have poorer quality, more expensive products, and international supply chains going elsewhere.”Economists fret that in the immediate future uncertainty itself is having a dampening effect – which could end up as damaging as the tariff policy itself.Gual said: “Some people argue he’s playing the madman strategy. Or some sort of random behaviour so that rivals, enemies, cannot anticipate his next move. Maybe that in geopolitics has some role. But in economics that increases the level of uncertainty and it is not supportive of economic growth and financial stability.”How many thousands of individual businesses and consumers respond in the coming days and weeks, will be critical in determining the impact of “liberation day”. Do multinationals rapidly reshape their supply chains or hold back from investment while they wait to see if Trump changes his mind? And does the US consumer keep on spending, or balk against rising prices?As Shearing said: “The issue is that not only is it, where does the tariff policy land, but the range of different outcomes is extremely wide.“As economists, we don’t have the tools to deal with the human side of economics – and there really are no historical parallels.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyTrump tariffsStock marketsTrump administrationEconomicsTariffsUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent.”Minutes before Powell was due to speak on Friday, Trump used a social media post to repeat his call on the Fed to lower rates. “This would be a PERFECT time for Fed ChairmanJerome Powellto cut Interest Rates,” the US president wrote. “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a good year, up to 10% of the company’s £23m annual sales come from the US.“It’ll make the US more like Canada, which is hard to get into. Canadians go to the US and find imported whisky that they can’t get. It’ll be less choice for Americans and that’s a bit sad.”View image in fullscreenPenderyn Distillery chief executive Stephen Davies says consumers will lose out from trade barriers.Photograph: Gareth Phillips/The GuardianWelsh whisky accounts for a tiny fraction of the UK’s alcohol trade, a wee dram compared with the big barrels of their cousins in the scotch business.Exports of British beverages, spirits and vinegar to the US are worth £1.6bn a year, by far the most valuable segment of the agrifood category, according to the National Farmers’ Union. Scotch makes up £913m of the total, about two-thirds.Of total UK food and drink exports, scotch accounts for about a quarter, and about 2% of all UK exported goods.The powerhouse distilleries inScotlandknow, from bitter experience, how US tariffs can leave a bad taste in the mouth.Between October and March 2021, the US imposed a 25% tariff on single malts and whisky liqueurs from the UK, collateral damage in a lengthy tit-for-tat dispute over competition between the aerospace companies Boeing and Airbus.The result was a 25% fall in scotch exports to the US during the last three months of 2019. More than £600m of exports were lost in total, about £1m a day, over the 18-month period.Trump’s new tariff policy,announcedduring a characteristically erratic speech in the Rose Garden of the White House, introduced a tariff that is lower than before, at 10%, but whose length is undetermined.One source in the spirits trade said scotch makers had agreed to rein in their anger, conscious of the fact that the president is unpredictable and could still be sweet-talked by British negotiators into rolling back or delaying the tariffs.But the ScotchWhiskyAssociation (SWA), which says the industry supports 66,000 UK jobs, did not hold back altogether. “The industry is disappointed that scotch whisky could be impacted by these tariffs,” said a spokesperson.“We welcome the intensive efforts by the UK government to reach a deal with the US administration, and we continue to support this measured and pragmatic approach towards a mutually beneficial resolution.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There aren’t many ways for us to absorb it, so some of the impact we’d have to share with the import company and some would work its way into the price.View image in fullscreenScotch whisky producers said they were ‘disappointed’ by the tariffs.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPA“Imported whisky is already at a premium to bourbon and the market is very price sensitive. I don’t think we’d pull out of the US but we’ll have to make a decision on priorities.”Whisky may be most of the ballgame when it comes to UK booze exports to the US, but it will not be the only corner of the alcohol industry to be affected.As a proportion of total UK exports, the US market accounted for 21% of beer made from malt, 18.6% of the wider spirits category (including gin), and 14.7% of wine, according to figures from the NFU.Some of these categories are admittedly small: Californians do not buy a lot of English wine and the US had its own thriving and varied craft beer scene before the UK did.Some British brewers, such as Samuel Smith’s and a string of newer independents, do have loyal customers in the US, who now face coughing up or trading down.“While only 17% of independent brewers still export from the UK to anywhere in the world, the imposition of trade tariffs is bound to hit those brewers who sell to the US at a time of great domestic challenge for them,” said Andy Slee, the chief executive of the indie beer trade body SIBA.“This is not good for independent British brewers.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryTariffsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpWalesScotlandWhiskyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A global trade war intensified when China responded on Friday by announcing tariffs of 34% on imports of US goods, accelerating the market sell-off. For people in the UK, there arereasons to be concernedabout the falls:Should I worry if I don’t own stocks and shares?Even if you have never bought stocks and shares directly, or a fund, you may have a pension that invests in them. Workplace pension schemes – whether public or private sector – hold a lot of money in the stock markets. If you have a scheme that pays out a figure depending on the performance of those investments, you could be affected (see below).The downturn in the markets gives companies less money to invest, and it signals concern over the future of the economy, so it suggests companies could batten down the hatches and decide not to take risks or expand, which will be bad for jobs. There could also be redundancies if companies become concerned about future costs.Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at the advice firm Hargreaves Lansdown, says the UK government is relying on growth to make its sums add up, and falling markets could hit this plan.“[The government] needs a healthy economy to bring in enough tax revenue to stay within its tax rules,” she says. “If we don’t get this growth – and if the economy starts shrinking – it could open up a new black hole in the finances. It would then mean either borrowing more and breaking the rules, spending less, or raising taxes.”What does it mean for pensions?Pension funds invest in stock markets, alongside other assets, to generate money to pay out. If you are in a defined contribution scheme, as many workers are, how much your individual pension is worth will depend on the performance of the investments.As you approach retirement, unless you have chosen otherwise, your scheme will usually start moving you into less risky assets, so you may not have much exposure to the market. However, if your scheme is in the process of doing this for you, you could be moving at the wrong time.Helen Morrissey, the head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, says people who may have planned to start selling investments to draw down money from their pension may choose to put this off until the situation is more settled.She says those investing in a pension should not panic. “Making kneejerk reactions such as changing investment strategy or cutting back on contributions can crystallise losses and make it harder for your fund to recover, and this can impact your retirement income. It’s important to make sure that your strategy is well diversified to protect your pension from these ups and downs.”What should I do if I have other investments?Again, the message from experts is not to panic. Unless you have a need to sell your stocks and shares, or holdings in funds, you will not have lost any money. If you can stay put until prices recover, you will be back as you were.“Selling out in fear can be the worst thing to do,” says Rob Morgan, the chief investment commenter at the stockbroker Charles Stanley. “Large falls can be followed by large rises, so you risk losing on both sides – selling when prices are depressed and not buying in until they have moved higher.”You will also miss out on any income your investment will have paid, he says. “In the absence of a crystal ball, keeping invested is often the best strategy, no matter how uncomfortable.”It is a good time to check that you have a diverse range of investments, as this will protect you if there are big falls in one particular sector or country.Is it a buying opportunity?If you are a regular investor, paying in every month, you could end up benefiting from the falls in the long run. You will be getting more for your money and, if the market recovers, your investments will go up in value.However, it is unclear how long markets will remain volatile, and no one can accurately predict how far they might fall before a recovery. Timing investments is really tricky and if you put in a lump sum now, you might see it go down in value and stay there for some time.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsConsumer affairsInvestmentsSharesPensionsInvestment fundsexplainersShareReuse this content"

Here, we examine some of the most exposed industries and brands.Technology: Apple and AmazonAsian countries are a big target of Trump’s tariffs, led by China, which was slapped with a 54% rate on imports to the US, prompting a rout on tech stocks, which lean heavily on the region for components for their products. Chinaquickly retaliated, with 34% tariffson US goods.Apple, the world’s most valuable publicly listed company, experienced a fall in market capitalisation of more than $300bn (£230bn) on Thursday in the worst single-day drop since 2020, over fears the tariffs will dramatically increase its costs and fuel price increases for products such as its iPhone.Apple makes most of its hardware in China, and two other leading production hubs, India and Vietnam, were also hit with 26% and 46% tariff rates.Other “Magnificent 7” mega-value tech companies suffered similarly. Amazon, a leading seller of imported goods from across the globe, was stripped of almost $190bn in market value.View image in fullscreenApple makes most of its hardware in China.Photograph: Stanislav Kogiku/SOPA Images/Rex/ShutterstockChina-based sellers have more than a 50% market share on Amazon’s third-party seller marketplace, according to MarketPlace Pulse.Analysts at Bank of America view the tariffs as a “sector negative” for e-commerce. However, the bank added that large-scale players, such as Amazon and eBay, were better able to substitute sellers and, if prices rose globally, could benefit as they collect commission on the total sale price of an item.Nvidia, the market leader manufacturing chips crucial to the artificial intelligence boom, lost $210bn from its market valuation on Thursday after Trump set a 32% tariff on imports from Taiwan, where it has its main semiconductor manufacturing facilities.On Friday, Apple’s share price fell 3% at the opening bell, Amazon fell 1% and Nvidia began the day with an almost 6% fall.Fashion: Nike and GapPrices of Nike’s signature Jordan sports shoes, Levi’s jeans and Gap clothes are likely to rise in the US as Trump’s tariffs hit the Asian factory hubs that underpin the global garment industry.Nike’s market value took a $13bn hit on Thursday, despite its efforts to reduce manufacturing in China in recent years.Last year, factories in the heavily tariff-hit countries Vietnam, Indonesia and China manufactured 95% of all Nike brand footwear.The high tariffs across many leading garment manufacturing countries also threatens significant supply chain cost increases of everything from tracksuits to sweaters.View image in fullscreenNike is likely to have to raise the price of its Jordan shoes in response to the Trump tariffsPhotograph: Lauren DeCicca/Getty ImagesAlmost 60% of all Nike-branded apparel was manufactured in Vietnam, China and Cambodia last year. However, with nearly 60% of Nike’s total sales coming from outside the US, the sportswear company has some insulation from apotential US recession.Gap, whose biggest supplier country is Vietnam, was one of the biggest fallers among US-listed stocks with its shares closing down more than a fifth on Thursday. Shares in Levi’s plunged almost 14%, while Under Armour fell by 19%.On Friday, Nike’s share price fell a further 4% at the start of trading, Gap dropped more than 2%, Levi’s slid nearly 5% and Under Armour plunged more than 7%.Travel: Boeing and DisneyFears that the tit-for-tat tariff war might spark a global recession and slowdown in consumer spending meant the travel sector was also hammered by an investor sell-off.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Experts fear that Trump’s sweeping border taxes, and retaliatory moves by targeted nations, are adding to the risk of a steep global downturn and a recession in the world’s biggest economy.Shares in the credit card company American Express fell almost 10% as investors reacted to businesses closely tied to consumer spending and credit.View image in fullscreenAmerican Express has heavy exposure to US consumers.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersAmex is much smaller than its US-listed global rivals – shares in Visa fell 2% while Mastercard dropped 3% – but has heavy exposure to US consumers.Almost half of the cards issued by Amex in 2021 were in the US, according to statistics from the last year that Amex published regional splits.Shares at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, which earlier this week described the sweeping tariffs as a “growth shock” that would hit US consumers, fell almost 10% over fears that merger and acquisition activity may slow as businesses cut back on investments.

He cited managers’plans to slash jobsand close factories earlier this year, and a decade before that the“dieselgate” scandal –costly financially and reputationally – when Germany’s largest carmaker was found to have falsified CO2emissions tests.Now that the US has put a punishing 25% tariff on car imports (until now it was 2.5%) “we’re swimming in shit”, he said, giving a husky chuckle. “You have to laugh or you’d not survive,” he added. He declined to give his full name, but said he had been at the company for more than 15 years, adding he was “glad to be going into retirement” in two years’ time “so I don’t have to watch the carnage from the factory floor”.Ahmed, talking as he dashed to the nearby station to catch the train home to pick up his children after finishing the early shift on the VW Golf assembly line, said he was proud of his job, but feared for the future. “The mood inside is not good,” he said. “We already felt bamboozled by our bosses after all the mistakes they’ve made. Now even bigger arseholes are deciding our future.”Stephan, towards the end of his first week working in electrical infrastructure at the plant, said he was sure that “initially this is going to be very bad for the German car industry, and forGermanyin general, but long term it might serve us well, to learn to be more independent from the US. We just have to hope that short term, our new government quickly starts to set us on the right course.”‘Liberation day’: what are tariffs and why do they matter?Read moreGermany’s new government, under the probable leadership of the conservative former bankerFriedrich Merz, which is still being painstakingly negotiated behind the scenes following a February election, suddenly faces a new and almighty challenge, on top of the already towering problem of how to steer Europe’s largest economy out of itsdeep economic woes.Demand for German goods in the US is high, in particular cars – BMW, Mercedes, VW and Porsche – as well as machinery, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and plenty of luxury goods from Montblanc pens to Hugo Boss suits. As a result, Germany’s trade deficit with the US is larger than most other countries’ and the impact of the tariffs will hit its economy particularly hard.“Trump’s economic war is in full flow and Germany is stuck smack bang in the middle of it,” ran a headline in the tabloid Bild this week.The leading economic institute IW predicted in astudypublished on Thursday that the loss to Germany’s economy would amount to an estimated €200bn (£170bn) stretched over the four years of a Trump tenure, or a drop of 1.5% in GDP.The study’s authors, Jürgen Matthes and Samina Sultan called it “an economic catastrophe for Germany”.Annual sales of VW vehicles in the US amounted to almost 380,000 last year, or 8% of its total global sales, consisting mainly of its higher-end vehicles. According to the Association of German Car Makers (VDA), overall exports of German vehicles and parts reached a total value of almost €37bn.US-Germany trade chartVW said this week it would not take the punishment lying down. It said it had provisionally halted rail shipments of vehicles from its factory in Puebla, Mexico into the US, and had also put a hold on the transport of its US-bound cars via ship at the western German seaport of Emden. In a memo to its North American retailers, it said it would introduce an “import fee” on affected vehicles. This was “to make sure on the label it’s clear to our customers it’s not us who’s fleecing them, but their own government”, a US car dealer told German media on condition of anonymity.As to Trump’s wish that manufacturers will be forced to move their operations to the US, the large German carmakers like VW, Mercedes, and BMW have long since done so, producing 900,000 cars on US soil last year, according to the VDA. Major car part suppliers, including Continental and Bosch, have done the same. In total, at 2,110 locations in the US the German car industry employs about 138,000 people.But this by no means makes them immune to the tariffs because plenty of parts, to which tariffs will also apply, have to be imported.As a result, cars are expected to rise in price on average between $5,000 (£3,840) and $10,000 dollars, and by as much as $50,000 in the luxury sector, experts predict. While car sales soared ahead of the tariff announcement as buyers sought to beat the price rise, already a sales war between foreign and domestic manufacturers is making itself felt, with the US carmaker Ford reportedly planning to offer customers its cutdown prices hitherto reserved for its employees, under the campaign banner: “From America for America.”Hildegard Müller, president of the VDA said the punitive taxes turned existing trade policy on its head. “This marks the departure of the US from the rules-based global trading order … it is not America First, this is America alone,” she said.Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, founder of the Center for Automotive Research (CAR), known as Germany’s “car pope” owing to his expertise in the industry, told German media that German car manufacturers and suppliers would be “extremely damaged and heavily punished”.“If this ends up being ongoing, German car manufacturers will increasingly move their production to the USA, leading to a further loss of jobs in Germany,” he predicted. “By forcing the companies into making losses and sucking the jobs away, economically speaking Trump is an even worse enemy for us than [Vladimir] Putin.”On Friday, the leading economistMarcel Fratzschersaid Germany’s best response to the tariff turmoil was to “fortify itself” from within, urging the new government to use the opportunity of crisis to carry out much-needed reforms and, with the EU, to hit the US where it hurt most by imposing a reciprocal tax on digital companies.“The future isn’t being made in the US; our own future is being made here in the country. And I would like the coalition partners [of the future government] to have more courage,” he said, calling for a radical change of course in economic policy.Explore more on these topicsGermanyAutomotive industryTrump tariffsVolkswagen (VW)International tradeGlobal economyEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Curry, who has been called the “rat king” locally, runs MC Environmental Pest Control. He has been on the frontline of stamping out the rodent threat amid aweeks-long bin strikethat has causedbins to pile up on Birmingham’s streets.Business has been booming as a result. “I’m getting a lot more callouts for rats especially,” he said. “It normally drops off at this time of year because the weather’s getting warmer and the rats spend a lot more time outside.”Unite hits back at Starmer over Birmingham bin strike, questioning Labour’s backing for ‘working people’– UK politics liveRead moreOn a balmy, spring afternoon, Curry gave the Guardian a whistle-stop tour of Birmingham, beginning on the outskirts of the city centre where bin bags and broken furniture were piled on the side of the road.Pointing to an armchair split in two surrounded by bits of food, Curry said: “This is ideal for them. There’s a food source and it’s easy for them to hide because of the furniture.”View image in fullscreenCurry setting some traps. ‘Chances are they’re not going to take it, because they’ve got lots of other tastier options.’Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianCurry pointed out some telltale signs that rats might be rummaging outside your home. “On outdoor bins you would see teeth marks all around the lids because they’ve been trying to get in,” he said. For inside the home, he said droppings, scratches and footprints or tail marks in dusty areas were warning signs.Around the outskirts of the city, piles of bin bags were littered on most street corners. The strike has been taking place since 11 March when refuse workers stopped work indefinitely after striking intermittently since January. In one residential area, both sides of the road were shoulder-high in rubbish, with one of the pavements blocked with bin bags stacked 5ft high.Bin bags towered over a sign warning of a £20,000 fine for dumping. “There’s probably a couple hundred bags of rubbish there. There’s all sorts of household waste, there’s takeaway wrappers, milk bottles, food waste, all sorts really,” said Curry.He said food waste should be the first thing to clear away. “Even if I put down poison, chances are they’re not going to take it, because they’ve got lots of other tastier options.”Takeaways are particularly attractive to rats. “There’s doughnuts and chips there, any of us would like that, nevermind the rats,” said Curry, pointing at the leftovers of somebody’s dinner. “They eat all the crumbs. They’ll even eat the grease off the pizza boxes. They’re not fussy at all.”While headlines have suggested that the entire city is affected, there are some exceptions. The streets of Edgbaston, an affluent area of Birmingham, are sparkling clean.View image in fullscreenThe strike has been taking place since 11 March when refuse workers stopped work indefinitely.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianEdgbaston, which is lined with lush, winding roads and big, well-kept homes, is perched atop a hill overlooking the city.“This is one of the more wealthy parts of Birmingham,” said Curry. “There’s no extra waste out here. I’m guessing it’s because these people have got transport and they’re taking their own waste to the rubbish sites.”Residents looking to dispose of their own bin bags can drop off their rubbish at designated points but the challenge lies in getting there in the first place.“A lot of people in the poorer areas don’t drive, they have to rely on public transport,” he said. “They’re not gonna bring their bins bags on the bus are they. So they’re just putting them outside their houses for a collection which isn’t happening.”Curry said he could not imagine bin bags rotting on the streets of London for weeks. “There’s too many celebrities and things who live in London and it would be all over social media, he said. “At the end of the day, the government is based in London as well, they’re not here on the streets seeing this. If they were living in it I don’t think they would have it.”While Curry is doing his best to offset the rats being drawn by uncollected bin bags, he has a worrying warning for those hoping to avoid the rodents. “Springtime is breeding time and the gestation period is only three weeks. It’s been that now.”Explore more on these topicsBirminghamIndustrial actionWasteAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And at this point on the river, the Silvertown link will, Transport for London (TfL) says, take the pressure off the semi-adjacent, traffic-choked Blackwall tunnel, and ease pollution by tackling daily 20-minute queues to cross the Thames, for buses as well as cars.About 100,000 vehicles use Blackwall daily; about 25,000 are expected to go through Silvertown after it opens on 7 April. Transport campaigners have long maintained that any new road simply grows traffic – and TfL agrees that, without the imposition of tolls, Silvertown would divert many drivers who use the Dartford crossing.This is a 1990s project that’s coming to fruition 30 years laterNow, Silvertown and the hitherto free Blackwall tunnel willcharge cars up to £4each trip. Discounts are available outside peak hours for motorists who register for TfL’s automatic payment system, with low-income residents and traders eligible for further reductions. Nonetheless, while the mayor has highlighted the inequity of the links across the Thames in east London compared with the affluent west, it is only in the poorer boroughs that drivers pay to cross.View image in fullscreenA construction worker in the new Silvertown tunnel in east London, that will connect Silvertown on the northern side with the Greenwich peninsula on the south of the River Thames.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PATfL expects to generate more than £100m a year in tolls – enough to pay off the private finance initiative (PFI) building, operation and maintenance contract awarded to the Riverlinx consortium over a 25-year term. Yet it says the primary reason is to control the traffic otherwise lured to a free-flowing tunnel, rather than being deterred by congestion.The logic appears murky to local opponents, and even the pronouncements by the mayor and his team appear ambivalent: heralding the positives of the tunnel while keen to stress that the plans were drawn up under his predecessor, Johnson.Unusually, Silvertown has been delivered on time and on budget. Khan said it will “transform travel in the south and east of our city, particularly across the River Thames.“It means faster, more reliable journey times for thousands of Londoners, reduced congestion and improved air quality, with enhanced public transport links through zero-emission cross-river buses.”He added: “The original plans for the Silvertown tunnel were developed in 2012. We made a series of significant improvements to make the scheme greener and to include a package of measures to support Londoners, local residents and businesses.“This includes ensuring there are discounts and concessions in place, and reserving, for the first time ever, a lane for zero-emission doubledecker buses and an innovative free cycle-shuttle service, which will encourage more people to switch to greener modes of transport.”It is the kind of breezy claim that has enraged opponents: while the £2m cycle-shuttle or bike-bus service will be free to use for the first year, the tunnel opens up a new route for bigger lorries that were unable to use the Blackwall tunnel. And those HGVs will, in fact, be sharing the bus lane.View image in fullscreenA general view of the control room for the new Silvertown tunnel in east London. Roadside monitoring is promised.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PATolls will not apply to any vehicle after 10pm. Victoria Rance, founder of the Stop the Silvertown Tunnel Coalition, said: “There’s no 24-hour crossing for bikes east of Tower Bridge. Then you think what they’re doing for HGVs – a free night-time crossing. They’re incentivising HGVs at night, when we are trying to sleep.”Rance had ridden her e-bike up the extended accessible zigzag ramps of the pedestrian bridge at Boord Street on the Greenwich peninsula, a new yellow steel-mesh structure big enough to span the new roads on the south side of the tunnels. Those living in the housing developments to the west are now separated by 10 lanes of traffic from the schools across the road.From this vantage point, the concerns of all become clearer. Even in the middle of the day, traffic is queueing; but this side of the road has, until now, been off limits to bigger lorries, Rance said. The northbound Blackwall tunnel, a late-Victorian construction, has a height restriction of 13ft (4m); lorries, however, are regularly emerging from the bigger southbound tunnel, added 70 years later in 1967.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And they come bombing along, it’s so dangerous.”Rance admits to feeling guilty about the air her own, now young adult, children breathed in living next to the A102: “I admireSadiq Khanfor the Ulez but this is just so retrograde,” she said. “All across Europe they are building infrastructure for trams, cycles and buses. This is a 1990s project that’s coming to fruition 30 years later.”View image in fullscreenThe tunnel opens up a new route for bigger lorries that were unable to use the Blackwall tunnel.Photograph: Luca Marino/TFLTfL counters that lorries in London are cleaner and safer than before – the tunnels lie within the Ulez, and HGVs have to comply with its Safer Lorry Scheme. Roadside monitoring is promised and, according to TfL’s director of investment delivery planning, David Rowe: “Our assessment showed there’s an overall improvement in air quality – and we legally committed to ensure that happened.”Rowe added: “If we were just building a road tunnel, we would expect it to induce traffic. That’s why part of the process was to get the powers to introduce user-charging, as well as the introduction of the new bus services.”Luton airport allowed to double capacity after UK government overrules plannersRead moreDoubledeckers will be able to cross in the tunnel, allowing another link in theSuperloop express service, and buses here will be zero-emission and free for the first year. Electric taxis and minicabs will be exempt from tolls.“I can understand why people would have concerns about what might happen in terms of additional HGVs, but that is absolutely not the case,” Rowe said. “We’ve set these charges at the level required [£10 per lorry] to ensure that we don’t induce additional traffic.”For campaigner Dominic Leggett, it doesn’t add up: “What TfL need to show is, given a toll on Blackwall, adding the tolled Silvertown tunnel leads to quantifiably better economic and environmental outcomes – outcomes worth spending billions on.”Despite requests, he said: “They’ve never done this. There would be no reason not to if they could actually show any substantial benefits. So we presume they can’t.”Some independent experts are enthusiastic. “Contrast it with the failure of three levels of government tosort out Hammersmith bridge, it’s a triumph of public procurement, ingenuity and delivery,” says professor Tony Travers, director of LSE London. “Nobody thinks road building is a great idea these days – but that shouldn’t be absolutist.“This will improve public transport as well to parts of London that are still relatively poor; it’s an economic opportunity. A piece of infrastructure that can pay for itself via charges or tolls makes sense.”Explore more on these topicsInfrastructureLondonRoad transportLocal governmentPollutionSadiq KhanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Good job that its lead, Michael Theo, is such a joyRachel AroestiFri 4 Apr 2025 17.00 EDTShareWe briefly meet Austin, the namesake of this British-Australian sitcom, at the very beginning of the opening episode: he’s walking through his workplace – a warehouse, he’s a forklift driver – bluntly dispensing unsolicited advice to his colleagues (“Best hangover cure: sardines on toast!”). But before we know it, we’ve been torn away from this offbeat sage and thrown into the orbit of a far less wise man. Julian (Ben Miller) is a children’s author in crisis. He has come to Australia with his illustrator wife Ingrid (Sally Phillips) to promote the latest instalment in their wildly successful Big Bear franchise. Before takeoff, Julian retweeted a missive about free speech from a neo-Nazi (he didn’t realise they were a neo-Nazi). Upon arrival, he discovers his career has effectively been destroyed.Book tour (and self) cancelled, Julian hastily arranges a signing in one of the only shops that will still have him, a Mein Kampf-laden store run by a neo-Nazi (he didn’t realise they were a neo … you get the picture). After the penny finally drops, Julian starts packing up – that’s when Austin arrives, Big Bear back catalogue in tow. He wants his books signed and to deliver some news. “I’m pretty sure that,” he begins, pausing idiosyncratically, “I’m your son.”Austin is played by Michael Theo, best known for appearing inLove on the Spectrum, the hit Australian reality show about autistic people navigating the world of dating. He is – by a long shot – the best thing about this series. Austin is autistic, and his directness, remorseless logic and atypical intonation are responsible for most of the amusement here. Yes, we are being invited to laugh at him – as is the case with the protagonists of practically every sitcom ever made – but never in a patronising or derisive way. Austin’s behavioural difference mainly serves to highlight how socially odd the neurotypical characters are: Julian, a model of British repression, runs away from Austin after he reveals his identity, while Austin’s grandfather (Roy Billing) ambushes Julian with an eye-wateringly terrible joke at their first meeting.Unfortunately, the rest of the show is a slog. Miller is generically bumbling as Julian, who attempts to weasel out of his responsibilities towards Austin while also dodging the fact he was clearly seeing his wife and Austin’s mother simultaneously three decades ago. Phillips does her trademark failing-to-suppress-a-wry-smile thing too many times as Ingrid, who sort of, maybe, might want to have an affair to even things out. The cancel culture storyline feels strangely dated too – the fact this was shown on Australian TV nearly a year ago may be why.Yet it’s the main plotline that is hardest to buy into. With his career on the skids, Julian decides to make a documentary about his relationship with his long-lost autistic son in the hope it will rehabilitate his reputation. To do so, he flies out a celebrated documentarian, the sulky, rude and extortionately expensive Yolanda Cox (Charlotte Nicdao) – although why she’d be interested in this vanity project, I have no idea.Then Julian and Ingrid return to London with Austin in tow. At this point the documentary element falls by the wayside and other unrealistic storylines – such as the couple’s daughter organising a show of her mother’s scrappy old life drawings, which inexplicably sell for thousands – take over. Austin, meanwhile, is free to indulge his Billie Piper obsession with a guided tour of tenuously related sites, before –of course– bumping into her at a restaurant. Cue a screamingly cringeworthy set of cameos from Piper, who plays herself as a giggly, golden-hearted egomaniac.Confusingly, despite being created by a team of Brits (including Miller) and featuring many British reference points, Austin doesn’t seem to have been designed for UK viewers. They will immediately see through the show’s trite, twee depiction of Britishness – one that involves excessive levels of politeness, plus Julian’s Oxford don get-up and Ingrid’s eccentric insults (at one point she calls her husband a “colossal clodhumping fink”) – while the UK-Australian culture clash, which mainly consists of long-winded explanations of Britishisms, will feel tiresome too.This lack of authentic perspective coupled with a heavily artificial plot means Austin never feels remotely plausible. It also fails to cash in on the premise’s tear-jerking potential – the standard conflict-resolution drama is in place, but the emotional climax never hits. Despite the personal charms of its protagonist (his straightforwardness, honesty and ability to be totally himself), Austin sadly has limited appeal.Austin aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTV comedyComedyTelevisionSally PhillipsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Val was playing Alexander’s father, Philip II of Macedon. Oliver wanted the Macedonians to have Celtic accents in contrast to the Greeks, who looked down on the Macedonians, as the English have only too frequently done to neighbours of the UK. We were prepping in Morocco and I had been working for a while with Val on his Irish accent when my 95-year-old mother died and I had to leave for a couple of days for her funeral. During my absence, Val had to go home for a short while. When I returned I opened my hotel room door to find it awash with beautiful white roses. Val had sent them before he left, leaving a note of condolence and both his personal phone numbers so that I might call any time if I needed someone. Such unexpected kindness I have never forgotten.Catherine Charlton, voice coach, St Leonards-on-Sea‘His characterisation would not allow us to look away’His turn as Jim Morrison, under Oliver Stone’s directing, is career-defining. Though the movie has been panned as excessive, Kilmer’s portrayed the mercurial, ambivalent and addictive nature of a since-deified artist. Few actors can do this. We abhorred the self destruction we were seeing, yet Val’s characterisation would not allow us to look away. Bravo,Val Kilmer.Tom Leigh, Missouri, US‘Much more than a heart-throb’A seriously underrated actor, with great range and depth. My favourite role of his is in Spartan, a fabulous David Mamet film. His sometimes laconic method of acting in this movie worked wonders, leaving the audience to ponder and guess what the character knows, feels and what his purpose is. A somewhat fitting epithet to his whole acting career, I think. As in Top Secret, Kill Me Again, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and many others, he delivered great performances, and was so, so much more than a heart-throb.Gaspar Garção, Portalegre, Portugal‘He was brilliant as Jim Morrison’I once met Val Kilmer at Art Basel Miami, while visiting as an MFA graduate. I had gone back to school after a career as a potter so that I could teach at college level, so I was older than many of my classmates in their mid 20s. I casually went up to say hello to him and they wondered how I could be so brazen. He was accompanied by an entourage of his friends who I did not recognise. I told him how much I enjoyed his acting, and relayed the synchronicity of just recently seeing him in Werner Herzog’s Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans as Detective Stevie Pruit. He asked me how I liked it and without thinking I said I wished he had had a bigger role, which was true. But I think he was proud of the role and looked disappointed. I then quickly said how brilliant I thought he was as Jim Morrison, which probably didn’t make it any better.Stephen Hawks, visual artist, Brownsville, Texas, US‘An intellectual stuck in a Batman suit’I was lucky enough to meet Val Kilmer in 2005 through a dear friend when he was starring in The Postman Always Rings Twice in the West End in London. He took me and a friend out for dinner the next evening, with his two children. I remember his children reading the London gossip columns about him out loud – very loudly and hilariously at the table – and he joked and played upset. Later, he and I would have breakfasts at The Wolseley in London (his favourite place for breakfast), and we discussed everything from his role in The Doors, to time and space, to just everything. Val was an intellectual stuck in aBatmansuit – he really didn’t like playing the role. He was very open and strong, sometimes, in his opinions on the world, about Hollywood, about art. He was outspoken, which to me was great, even if it caused him problems sometimes.Jane Spencer, film-maker, Zurich‘Thunderheart is often overlooked’Val Kilmer was an underrated actor, who would probably admit that he sabotaged his career by acquiring a bad reputation on set. I remember him mainly for his role in Thunderheart, a very rare and powerful Hollywood treatment of Native Americans, based on a true story. It is often overlooked when reviewing his career. It’s a tricky role as a self-confident FBI agent uncomfortable with his tribal roots. He is cynically manipulated by his FBI superiors as he navigates an emotional tightrope between his arrogant FBI detachment and growing empathy for the plight of the tribes’ peoples and their traditions. In some ways, the role became a mirror of Kilmer’s own career and personal progression: from a brash, and some might think arrogant and self-assured young actor, who soon gained a bad reputation, to a man who found humility, self-discovery and closure in his tragic final years, leaving behind his own celluloid monument in thehome-movie self-portrait Val.Malcolm, Berlin‘A great portrayal of Doc Holliday’While there have been many great portrayals of Doc Holliday, Val Kilmer’s portrayal in Tombstone has been the hands-down favourite in this household since the movie premiered. It is spooky, watching him slowly die over the course of the movie, while remaining the most dangerous character on the screen.Christopher Dinnes, Austin, Texas, US‘Val Kilmer in Hamlet was a special treat’We saw Val Kilmer perform the title role in Hamlet at the Colorado Shakespeare festival in Boulder during the summer of 1988. The theatre was outdoors on a perfect Colorado summer night under a sky filled with stars. We had friends from Ireland visiting, so my husband prepped an epic picnic to eat on the lawn beforehand. We love to see Shakespeare performed in Boulder, but it was most unusual that a cast included an actor of Val Kilmer’s calibre. It was a special treat for us. Here he was doing a regional production like an everyday Joe. I could hardly breathe. The next morning, our youngest (maybe five years old), who was a huge Kilmer fan, was very eager to hear about his hero. All bright-eyed, he asked about our experience: “So how did you like Omelette?” No family gathering since has ever been complete without bringing up this family lore and talking about the time we saw Val Kilmer play Hamlet in Boulder.Katy, Denver, Colorado, USExplore more on these topicsVal KilmerBatmanTheatreActingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And as a lifelong gardener myself – I asked for a pond liner for my 11th birthday – I’ve spent decades writing about gardening and putting the many tips I’ve discovered into play in my small, urban garden.How to get your garden ready for spring and summerGrow a mini meadowView image in fullscreenLow-growing wildflower seedsFrom £7 for 10g at Landlife Wildflowers£113.99 for 1kg at B&QLawn upkeep isn’t always environmentally friendly, but full-blown meadows can look scruffy for many months of the year; as a compromise, you could consider replacing your lawn with a low-growing multispecies-wildflower meadow, which can still be mown, though only on a long setting every few weeks.Wildflower Turfsells a selection of turfs for an instant transformation, while a budget option is to sow seeds into the bald patches of an existing lawn.If you’ve got a lawn, but want it to be a bit more eco-friendly, even leaving a tiny area of uncut grass will help attract various native species, says garden consultantEmma Burrill. If you have space for a proper meadow, “ascytheis the best way to take down a meadow at the end of summer or in early autumn”, says garden designerFiona Lydon.Keep on top of weedingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jonathan BuckleyHoriHori£32.95 at Sarah Raven£39.99 at CrocusWeeds seem to be the first thing to get growing in most gardens. Get on top of them from the start by keeping a multitool by the back door and taking it on every foray into the garden. Each of our experts swears by the same one: a Hori Hori knife. “It’s perfect for digging, cutting, weeding and planting, so you can get loads done even on a quick stroll or lunch break,” says garden designerLulu Roper-Caldbeck. “It’s especially useful for removing deep-rooted weeds like dandelion, and is great for planting out seedlings and plug plants,” adds Burrill.Create a seating areaView image in fullscreenMalta 6-seater garden corner sofa set£800 at ArgosView image in fullscreenLucinda garden furnitureFrom £60 at ArgosView image in fullscreenStriped deck chair£59 at John LewisComfortable seating is a gamechanger, allowing us to spend long periods in the garden.Burrill is a fan of a traditional deckchair. “They’re comfortable, look great, and can be stored away easily.”John Lewis sells a deckchair with the welcome addition of arms.Lydon suggests metal seating, with cushions that can be brought out of storage. Habitat’s colourful, postmodernLucinda collectionfeatures chairs, sofas and side tables. I bought an L-shaped garden sofa in lockdown, which means we now spend whole days, rather than hours, outdoors – including afternoon naps. Look for secondhand versions locally on eBay or Facebook Marketplace.Versatile tablesView image in fullscreenFrutta ceramic stool£168 at AnthropologieSlim German beer festival table and bench sets are great for gardens, particularly where space is tight. “Look online at places such aseBayorVinteriorfor secondhand ones. They often come in great colours and can be folded and stored easily when not in use,” says Burrill.A selection of sturdy ceramic outdoor stools are versatile and weather-proof: dot them around your garden, and look for designs with a flat top, so they can double as occasional tables.AnthropologieandLa Redoutehave good options.Get plantingView image in fullscreenJapanese anemone£12.99 at CrocusFrom £12.99 at RHS PlantsView image in fullscreenHart’s tongue fernFrom £9.99 at CrocusKnowing where to start can be hard. Be guided by the amount of sun your garden gets – and how cold it gets in winter, particularly in an exposed or rural setting. Look for “AGM” after the plant’s name: it’s the Royal Horticultural Society’sAward of Garden Merit, effectively meaning that a plant is easy to grow; while an RHSbee symbolmeans the plant is good for pollinators.TryErysimumBowles’s mauveandSalvia nemorosaCaradonnafor summer-long colour andAnemonexhybridaHonorine Jobert Japanese anemone, which flowers from late summer, well into autumn.

For shady spots, consider anacer, suggests Lydon.Malus domesticasunsetis a beautiful sturdy-looking apple tree that can grow to anything from 2.5-8m depending on rootstock, says Burrill. “Mine is growing on a semi-dwarfing rootstock so will only reach about 3.5m high, which means the fruit is easier to pick. It fruits abundantly and is an excellent eater similar to a cox but much less susceptible to pests and diseases; plus it stores well.”Most fruit trees need a sunny spot but for shade try the cherryPrunus cerasusmorello.“The blossom is also lovely and while the cherries are mostly for cooking, some people enjoy the sour taste,” says Lydon.View image in fullscreenVilmorin’s rowan trees£19.99 at Gardening Express£70 at Ornamental TreesIn small gardens, Lydon suggests the delicate rowan,Sorbus vilmorinii,which has single white flowers in blossom season and pink berries in the autumn. The pinnate leaves cast little shade and make the autumn clean-up a cinch. Or, consider a large shrub instead of a tree, which might outgrow its spot. “Viburnum x burkwoodiihas amazing flowers and the birds love it,” she says. “Viburnumxcarlcephalumis highly scented and can be pruned as a multistem to look very elegant.Pistacia lentiscusmastic treeis also wonderful in sheltered city gardens.”“Where space is not an issue, I like hawthorn because it’s such a great habitat and feeding point for birds,” says Lydon. “Crataegus persimilisprunifoliais a stunner when the tree is in berry. If you have clay soil, look atBetula(birch),Amelanchier(shadbush),Malus(crabapple)andCrataegus(hawthorn), and for year-round boundary screening try the evergreenLigustrum japonicumVariegatum: use a stake to give it good support.”Light upView image in fullscreenSolvinden table lampFrom £3 at IkeaGarden lighting is magical, but it can disturb wildlife, particularly in rural settings. “Be mindful of the need for skies to be dark – use sparingly and don’t be tempted to uplight. To minimise light pollution, usedownlights– wall mounted or strapped around a tree trunk – to highlight key features in the garden,” says Lydon, who recommendsIn-Liteas an easy-to-use outdoor lighting system. “You can plug outside lights into an outdoor socket. Or Ikea does some stylish take-outside battery-poweredlighting for evenings in the garden”.The joy of seedsView image in fullscreenSeasonal seed box£20 at Planet Good EarthNow is the time to get sowing. Lulu Roper-Caldbeck heartily recommends Planet Good Earth as an introduction to growing from seeds, for adults and children alike. “Its seasonal seed box is a great way to learn about growing, with a mix of seasonal veg, salad and herbs, perfect for any space, even small containers.”Chiltern Seedscomes highly recommended by our experts, while Burrill also suggestsNaturescapefor wild and native plant seeds. Sowing methods vary widely from plant to plant, so always follow the instructions on the packet.Fast compostingView image in fullscreenHotbin plinth bundle£215 at Hotbin Composting£213.99 at Marshalls GardenSpring is tidy-up time in the garden, so it’s worth getting into composting. It’s the best way to get rid of garden waste and create your own compost, which is always useful to gardeners. “To maximise space and time, get hold of a Hotbin rather than an open compost heap. These insulated bins don’t require as much space or a sunny spot and can turn garden clippings and food waste into compost in as little as three months. I put one in every client’s garden if I can,” says Lydon. Roper-Caldbeck agrees: “They’re a great composting option, especially for small gardens, as they’re compact, don’t smell or attract rats and, as a bonus, it also creates nutrients-rich liquid fertiliser for plants.”Save water this summer with a buttView image in fullscreenStrata recycled plastic water butt kit, 210l£38.99 at Wilko£54.99 at AmazonMost containers need regular watering through the summer, as do plants in their first year, so reduce your water consumption by installing a water butt. Go for the biggest one you can accommodate, or get a couple. I sourced a great one through a shout-out on my local free forum – and avoided more plastic.“Rainwater is naturally softer and better for plants, as it doesn’t contain the chemicals found in tap water,” says Roper-Caldbeck. “I use old and new galvanised cattle troughs, which can be easily adapted to collect water usingsimple DIY diverter kits for your guttering, and look so much more attractive than the off-the-shelf water butts,” says Burrill. If you do need the capacity and convenience of a standard water butt, look for recycled plastic versions.Feed your plantsView image in fullscreenMaxicrop original seaweed extract, 500ml£11.99 at Thompson & Morgan£14.99 at B&QIf you want to keep the plants you’ve got looking good for the season ahead, feed them. In early spring, I like to mulch the ground around my plants withorganic farmyard manure(it’s rotted down so any bad smell is negligible). For the rest of the growing season, I use organic seaweed extract, dosed into a watering can.Bulbs in the greenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jonathan BuckleyDouble snowdrop£11.87 for 25 bulbs at Sarah Raven£19.9 for 25 bulbs at CrocusWe may be looking beyond snowdrops at this time of year, but spring is actually the perfect time to plant them “in the green”, so they reappear in January.

Grand National steps out on delicate high-wire actTraditionalists rail at the ‘Plastic National’ but a third of all adults will have a bet on the world’s most famous raceSean Ingleat AintreeFri 4 Apr 2025 11.31 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 15.09 EDTShareThe numbers are nearly as breathtaking as the sight of 34 horses soaring over Aintree’s famous fences. Before Saturday’sGrand National, a third of adults in Britain will place some sort of bet on the world’s most famous steeplechase. £150m will be wagered in total. And six million will then tune in for the spectacle.But amid all the noise and fanfare surrounding the 177th running of the “people’s race”, organisers are increasingly engaged in a delicate high-wire act. Because the more they try to ensure the thrills come without horrific spills – and potential deaths – the more they upset traditionalists, who fear that the National has gone too soft.Grand National 2025: horse-by-horse guide to all the runnersRead moreSuch calls have become increasingly loudafter last year’s race, which had no fallers, no fatalities, and the highest number of finishers since 2005. Timeform, the bible of horse racing, was among those to wonder whether making the National safer had not only stripped it of its fiendish difficulty but its magic.“The old ‘Wooden National’ was primarily a test of jumping,” one Timeform writer lamented. “That is no longer the case. The ‘Plastic National’ is only slightly different to other top marathon chases.”Yet atAintreeon Friday, race organisers were insisting that the marathon race, which takes in four-a-quarter miles and 30 fences, had moved with the times and changed for the better.“I have friends who have been in the sport for 50 years, who say that it has lost its character, and is not what it was,” Dickon White of the Jockey Club said. “And while I respect their opinion, I thought last year was a fantastic spectacle, with so many horses in contention until the final fence. And the reality is, the race has always evolved.”That is certainly true. In the first National, in 1839, horses had to jump a stone wall, cross a stretch of ploughed land and finish over two hurdles. While in the 1950s the Manchester Guardian warned that the race “in its present form cannot in all public decency be tolerated any longer” after only 36 of the 192 horses which had started in the previous five Nationals finished, and nine had been killed.View image in fullscreenHorses gather at the start before racing on Friday at Aintree.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMore recent changes, which have included making the fences easier and reducing field sizes down from 40 to 34, are designed to sustain the drama but dial back on the danger. Which, given it is only two years since National made front page news when the 118 members of the activist group Animal Rising were arrested for trying to stop the race, is surely no bad thing.And while the race isn’t as popular as it was in the late 1990s, when 10 million viewers would watch, it is still notably resilient. The Sun’s man at Aintree said that his paper had put on over 200,000 over four days for last month’s Cheltenham Festival and expected Saturday’s paper to be one of the bigger sellers of the year. And the Star’s man reckoned they would also get a 20% uplift in sales too.Meanwhile bookmakers say the allure of the race remains strong. “We track all the figures so we know that in terms of turnover, there will be £150m bet on the Grand National, which is six times bigger than the next biggest betting race, which is the Cheltenham Gold Cup,” said Simon Claire of the bookmakers Coral.“Meanwhile a third of the adult population will have a bet, or have someone place one for them. So it remains an incredible British institution in a world where these things often get done in by the passage of time.”That, insisted Clare, that includes plenty of once-a-year punters. “Bookmakers aren’t shy of trying to recruit customers,” he added. “But the industry will take bets from hundreds of thousands or people tomorrow that we know will not be back again for 12 months. It’s a bit like selling turkeys at Christmas. You know that everyone wants them. But when it comes to June, it won’t be the case.”View image in fullscreenRacegoers walking down a temporary red carpet for Ladies Day at the Grand National festival.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMeanwhile as the debate about safety rumbles on, the British Horseracing Authority says it is trialling new software that uses AI to mitigate the risk of injuries and falls.The BHA’s acting chief executive, Brant Dunshea, said they had been using an app called Sleip, which tracks a horse’s gait over time, and flags up if it changes.Grand National fairytale on cards with ‘click-and-collect’ Horantzau D’AiryRead more“What this technology does is it helps inform decision making, because it takes a recording of the horse’s gait and then uses artificial intelligence to map over time whether or not there’s been a change,” Dunshea said. “If there has, it could give the veterinary officers a reason to look more closely at a particular issue.”Every horse running at Aintree will also undergo pre-race examinations as part of the trial, and Dunshea says the BHA is also looking at using wearables to track a horse’s heart rate, stride length and other variables during races.Meanwhile, White also insists the Jockey Club won’t hesitate to change the race again if necessary – whatever traditionalists think.“We want to ensure that we are putting on the most exciting, the best race we possibly can,” he said. “After every every Grand National we sit down and review what went well, what didn’t go so well. And we won’t be afraid to make changes to ensure that the race is as safe as it possibly can be.”None of that will matter to most watchers when the starter’s flag drops at 4pm on Saturday . For them the spectacle, and the chance to win their office sweepstake or a rare bet, will be the only thing on their minds.Explore more on these topicsGrand NationalAintreeHorse racingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No sooner have you pulled a crisp, clean sheet on to your bed than it is time to strip it off and start over. Blink and a clean towel becomes dirty. Somehow, lives, careers and relationships must fit into the tiny slivers of time between loads.I don’t enjoy laundry; give me dish duty any day. I do, however, enjoy living in a clean space that doesn’t smell like a locker room. Textiles can really trap scent – andbacteria.“Just because you can’t see dirt doesn’t mean it’s clean,” says Melissa Pateras, laundry expert and content creator. “Dirt, skin, sweat and sebum are all invisible. Same with dust mites.”We asked experts how often one should wash the various linens around the house.‘Listen to your body’: how to start runningRead moreIn the bedroomThere are broad guidelines for washing frequency, but each individual’s needs may vary based on their habits, health and lifestyles, says Lori Williamson, a lifestyle and cleaning expert.“What I do and what other people do might be two different things,” Williamson says. If you sweat a lot when you sleep or have aggressive allergies, you may need to wash bed linens more frequently.How often you wash each type of item depends on how much contact it has with your skin.Flat sheets, fitted sheets and pillow casesshould be washed once a week because “they’re touching your body every single night for eight hours”, says Melissa Maker, a cleaning expert and founder of Clean My Space in Toronto.When you sleep, Maker explains, you produce sweat, body oil and dead skin cells. And if you use products on your hair and skin, “all of that is transferring onto your sheets and they get dirty quick”, she says. “It’s effectively like sleeping in dirty clothes.”View image in fullscreenHow often you wash each type of item depends on how much contact it has with your skin.Photograph: omersukrugoksu/Getty ImagesIf you use a flat sheet,duvet coverscan be washed less frequently because they make less direct contact with your skin. Pateras recommends washing duvet covers every two to four washes of the sheets – so once or twice a month. This can be stretched. Maker says that getting her duvet cover on and off is a complicated endeavor, so she only washes it on an “as-needed basis”, like when her daughter was playing with makeup and smeared some lipstick on the bed.Pillowsdon’t make direct contact with the skin, but still need cleaning. Pateras recommends washing cotton, feather and down pillows every 3 to 6 months by washing them in the washing machine on a gentle cycle, then air drying them or drying them on low. “Foam memory pillows cannot be washed in the machine – they can only be spot cleaned,” Pateras says, adding that pillows should be replaced every two-ish years.Washing pillows can be tricky, Williamson says, because it can be difficult to get them completely dry. If this is a concern, she recommends putting them through either a refresh cycle on your washing machine, which steam cleans fabrics and eliminates bacteria, or running them through the dryer a couple of times. “Just getting air and heat to it can also help,” she says.In the bathroomFabrics in the bathroom face two major problems, Maker says. The first: “This is gross, but the plume from the toilet can land on soft surfaces in the bathroom,” she says.So close the toilet lid when you flush, she says.The second issue is mustiness. “That comes from damp fabric sitting for long stretches of time,” she says.Bath and hand towelsshould be washed at least once a week – Pateras suggests hand towels be washed every two to three days.“A towel can only sit wet so many times before it starts to smell,” says Maker.Williamson says she uses bath towels three to five times before washing. Between washes, make sure to air your towels out, she says – hang them out to dry rather than crumpling them in a corner where the wet fabric might collect foam and mildew.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But they can quickly collect moisture, toothpaste and splashes from the toilet, as well as develop mold, mildew and bacteria. Experts recommend they be washed at least once a week. “Just bunch it up and throw it in with the towels,” Maker says.If that’s too hard to remember, you could always do away with fabric bath mats entirely.

No need to run a full load for a single dish cloth – stock up on multiple, and when you are done with one, swap it out for another. Just make sure to rinse the old one and let it dry completely before you throw it into the laundry basket with other fabrics, Maker says; if it stays damp, it could make the rest of the laundry moldy and smelly.Williamson suggests paying attention to the state of yourtote bags. “People are using them frequently, they’re being put into grocery baskets and food is being dropped into them,” she says. Throw them in the laundry as needed.Throw blanketsare often overlooked, but should be washed about once a month, Williamson says. “They collect dust, different people around the house are using them, and pets snuggle up in them,” she says.Are you doing laundry all wrong?

The creator and star-studded cast of Black Mirror talk about why this season is the most moving and vulnerable yetFri 4 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTShareCharlie Brooker has been contemplating the passing of time, and he’s not happy about it. We’re on set at Shepperton for USS Callister: Into Infinity, the sequel to the 2017 space opera from his terrifying tech anthology Black Mirror. “The cast don’t seem to have aged at all,” he grumbles, “whereas I am a wizened old gentleman.”There is a more reflective, almost nostalgic tone to this seventh season. The episode Plaything flashes back to Brooker’s early years as a gaming journalist in a Bandersnatch-adjacent slice of computer-induced madness; Eulogy immerses Paul Giamatti in his memories as he literally enters decades-old photos; gaslighting parable Bête Noire forces Siena Kelly’s chocolatier to reckon with youthful misdemeanours; Hotel Reverie starsEmma Corrinas a 1940s matinee idol falling forIssa Rae’s modern film star, who plays her white, male love interest in an AI remake of a vintage romance.“Quite a lot of the technology is being used to relive things or bring them back into the present,” concedes Brooker. “It wasn’t conscious, but then I have a lot more past than future. There’s probably more social commentary and more emotive or vulnerable episodes. That doesn’t mean we don’t go to disturbing places or deliver those chills, but people come toBlack Mirrorexpecting to be surprised, so you can’t give them exactly what they want. I’d say there’s a little less dystopia. If you want that, there’s a 24-hour panel showing it calledyour window. You don’t necessarily want to see something saying: things are going to get worse.”View image in fullscreenBridge work … (from left) Billy Magnussen, Osy Ikhile, Paul G Raymond, Cristin Milioti and Milanka Brooks in USS Callister: Into Infinity.Photograph: Nick Wall/NetflixBrooker, fed up with Zoom (him) and Roblox (his sons, now 13 and 11) during the pandemic, opted to sideline tech in favour of other genres for season six, notably the bleak horror of Mazey Day, Demon 79 and Loch Henry. This year brings a return to what Brooker terms “trad” Black Mirror: the science that could yet come to define our lives.Nowhere is this clearer than in Common People, an allegory of private healthcare and the concept of “enshittification”. Chris O’Dowd agrees to revolutionary, life-saving treatment for his wife (Rashida Jones) but, over time, the excessive price tag leaves them in penury even as the aftercare gets shoddier and Jones becomes a walking pop-up ad. Likewise, USS Callister: Into Infinity. Thefirstepisodesaw sad-sack coding genius Robert Daly (Jesse Plemons) use his co-workers’ DNA to trap their clones in his multiplayer game Infinity, where he could torment and abuse them at will. Following a revolt led by both real and virtual versions of Cristin Milioti’s programmer Nanette and, more reluctantly, the avatar of toxic CEO Walton (Jimmi Simpson), Daly was killed and the cloned crew ventured into a universe that, we now discover, isn’t the paradise they imagined.“They’re in a minute-by-minute scrap for survival,” reveals Brooker. “Everyone else there is a player in a game who will idly blow your head off if they see you, whereas the clones can bleed and die.”While Plemons’s absence is felt on the set of the Callister’s bridge, consolation comes in the shape of Simpson, filthy, hirsute and gamely rocking a loincloth exposing both real buttock and prosthetic scrotum. Back in his trailer, fully clothed and cleaned up, Simpson is delighted by the effect. “It made sense because Walton has been stripped of everything. He’s a buffoon, so throw in some bullocks [sic] and lock that giggle in. I’m here for whatever sight gag they want. I’d be a short-order cook for Charlie if that would make him happy.”Simpson’s devotion is shared by Milioti, whose plans for a Callister reprise with Brooker were derailed by Covid, strikes and schedule clashes. In the interim, her performance as the fabulously monstrous Sofia Falcone in The Penguin has made her a star. “I filmed this two weeks after wrapping The Penguin, so it felt like being ricocheted into a whole new world,” she says. “Sofia and Nanette – both of her! – certainly felt very different to embody.”View image in fullscreenClone wars … Jimmi Simpson and Cristin Milioti in USS Callister: Into Infinity.Photograph: Nick Wall/NetflixInto Infinity’s aesthetic is now more inspired by theStar Trek of JJ Abramsthan the Shatner era of Big Acting and sexual objectification that was the touchstone of the original episode. Everything is a little shinier. An LED wall has replaced green screen for the ship’s windows, enabling the actors to respond to images in real time as they flash up. The teleporters glow, the controls are responsive (dials can be twiddled, joysticks grabbed and levers thrust forward for that hyperwarp effect) and the sliding doors really do go whoosh – at least when Milioti’s around.“It is an incredible feeling to experience your own brain being tricked,” she says, laughing. “There’s something about a 3D-printed space laser that immediately makes you eight years old again. It’s so difficult to not make the sound, so I did. Constantly.”Black Mirror has always sprinkled Easter eggs liberally around its many worlds (Into Infinity includes a news ticker update on Michael Callow, Rory Kinnear’s PM whose porcine intercourse launched the show with a bang in 2011), but until now has never repeated itself. Brooker, whose only returning character of note has been the antithesis of evolution,Philomena Cunk, responds to the charge with mock incredulity – “we’ve never repeated ourselves before, so it’s actually a very new thing to do …” – but writing the crew’s further adventures proved irresistible after the first episode’s cliffhanger.USS Callister is the only Black Mirror so far seen by Brooker’s sons, after he belatedly realised this “relatively benign” instalment was in fact “pouring nightmare fuel into their brains”. It also aired just as news of Harvey Weinstein’s abuse broke, making it one of Brooker’s most prescient episodes in its exposure of incel culture in gaming and beyond.“We flip the toxicity discussion in this episode,” says Brooker’s fellow executive Jessica Rhoades. “There’s a scene where a character, who sees themselves as a nice person, cannot contemplate another version of themselves. It speaks to nice-guy culture with a real understanding of someone’s isolation, while also asking: why should your loneliness and anger dictate what happens to my body? But that’s a little more in the background this time.”Simpson, a lapsed gamer, has form in cerebral futurology withWestworldand Apple TV+’sDark Matter. “I will never tire of doing sci-fi,” he says. “Anything can happen and it’s all relevant. In Callister, Charlie’s looking at what it means to be you: whether we’re defined by how we treat others, their perceptions of us or by something like a soul.”“What would it mean to have a complete copy of you running around this universe?” adds Brooker. “Are they experiencing real emotion? Do they deserve our empathy? We’ll be dealing with that more and more as AI gets more sophisticated. We already project a lot on to it and there’ll come a point, presumably, where it will qualify as a living thing.”Milioti sounds a note of caution. “We’ve made so much art warning ourselves about what could happen, and now it’s happening. I understand the benefits of some AI but, because it’s been designed by us, it will be flawed like us. Sometimes that means it comes up with a stupid summary of a movie. At other times, will it want to destroy in the way we want to destroy? I don’t understand why you would want to introduce this into the world when we still have ancient animal brains. It makes me really anxious, the idea of creating content at all costs and profit being more important than people.”Does Into Infinity place the blame for this age of anxiety at the feet of tech bros? From Musk to Bezos, they certainly seem to share Daly’s petty grievances and Walton’s venal avarice.“There’s definitely an element of that,” agrees Brooker. “But it’s just big business and the age-old thing of money and power corrupting. The optimistic part of me, which is admittedly undeveloped, would like to think people don’t go into things with malevolent intentions. And it frustrates me when people describe the show as a warning about the use of technology because the technology is neutral. It might be misused, but it might also be something that gets us out of this fucking mess. You can’t put the genie back in the bottle, so it’s about dealing with a new set of circumstances. We just can’t lose people from the equation.”As a family man, Brooker – “the most empathetic father I’ve ever seen,” reckons Rhoades – has some extra skin in the game. “If I play my hand too overtly, my sons will get all secretive about this stuff,” he shrugs. “Luckily, they haven’t got bogged down in the Andrew Tate world of algorithms spewing up shit, but I do worry about them sitting there in front of YouTube and then before you know it …” He grimaces. “I’ve installed all the parental controls you can, but it’s more that I’m struggling to keep up with the weird things they’ll come out with. [Bizarre YouTube animation] Skibidi Toilet is their pop music, their equivalent of ‘Turn that noise down!’ I’d have been into that at their age, I reckon.”It could be worse. They could be back watching their dad’s handiwork. “When one of my sons was about six, he came back from school and said: ‘Dad, do you do a show called Black Mirror?’ And I went: ‘Yeeeees … What do you think happens in Black Mirror?’ He said: ‘Is it where a man loves a pig?’ And I thought: ‘Oh, Christ …’”Season seven of Black Mirror is on Netflix on10 April.Explore more on these topicsBlack MirrorCharlie BrookerScience fiction TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Taking risks is scary – but so is missing opportunitiesEvery week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a problem sent in by a readerAnnalisa BarbieriFri 4 Apr 2025 09.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 12.27 EDTShareI’m 16 and have never really had crushes.Along with that, I moved around a lot as a kid and never really had many friendsuntil year 7. I’ve struggled a lot with maintaining friendships andI’ve always felt a bit awkward and isolated from my peers. I guess part of it wasCovid; I never really developed social skills and have always relied on others to help me make friends.Recently, I met this really nice guy at a debate competition. He seemed genuinely interested in me and kept trying to talk to me. I liked talking to him; it felt really comfortable. For the first time, it felt as ifI had met someone I“clicked” with. I activelysought out interactions with him and was praying he’d be on my team, which he was. I just thought I liked him as a friend at first, so I didn’t get any sort of contact information and assumed I’d forget about him.However, it’s been a while since then and it’s been bothering me. I can’t stop thinking about him.I don’t feel the same way about him as I do my other friends, so I’m sure it’s not a platonic feeling.My friends are telling me to tryto talk to him via his social media, but I’m really scared that he’ll hate me or think I’m weird. I don’t know what to do. I’ve never dealt with anything like this before and, as mentioned above, I have bad social skills, so I don’t have any instinctual knowledge to go off.What do I do in this situation? Do I try to connect with him, or just forget about it?Well, first, you’re not alone. My mailbag is full of men and women who, even though older than you, aren’t sure if someone likes them and are afraid to make the first move. None of us likes rejection, but we sometimes forget how the other person might feel about us getting in touch – and usually they’d feel flattered. I know taking risks is scary, but so is missing opportunities. Rejection, if it comes, can feel hot and sharp, but resentment from missed opportunities can be much more long lasting. It’s a cliche, but we tend to regret the things we don’t do, rather than the things we do.Intense romantic feeling can strike at any age and very few of us have ‘instinctual knowledge’ about all this – we just have to give it a goI went to the ACP-registered child and adolescent psychotherapist Rachel Melville-Thomas, who is an expert (in so far as anyone can be!) on teenagers. “These moments of intense romantic feeling can strike at any age and very few of us have ‘instinctual knowledge’ about all this – we just have to give it a go,” she says.You mentioned that you don’t have good social skills. Melville-Thomas and I have seen examples of this increasing among adolescents since Covid, when some key developmental stages seem to have been missed. “Your letter shows how important it is to be able to do basic friendliness first before you embark on a more romantic relationship. It’s possible you didn’t get the chance to become skilled in this (although some people never do!) if you were moving around a lot. It’s possible you became wary of bonding closely with friends you expected to lose again and perhaps it’s been safer to be ‘the romantic bystander’,” says Melville-Thomas.I also think crushes can be a safe way to experience big romantic feelings before making things real. “Plus,” continues Melville-Thomas, “everyone suffered in Covid from lack of meeting and exploring.” And that will include your debate guy.Remember, as a teenager, your brain is rewiring and “one part”, says Melville-Thomas “is responding with emotion and pleasure, while another part (the reasoning bit) isn’t able to work out what to do. Your friends, operating at a distance, can say rational things like ‘get in touch’, but you can’t think it through to act.”Melville-Thomas suggests slowing down “and looking at the evidence: this nice guy showed an interest in you; he kept trying to talk to you. Your sensible response was that you noticed it felt comfortable, you ‘clicked’ and you didn’t rush into things, you thought it was just platonic. But then your emotions went ‘Whoosh, this is different.’ Feeling ‘bothered’ can be a way for your body and brain to attract your attention and get you to do something.”It seems he liked you and you like him. Consider getting in touch with him via his socials. This could be the start of, at the very least, a friendship. Possibly your first romantic encounter. And if he doesn’t respond? You’re no worse off than you are now and at least you tried. Keep us posted!Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

Here, the Lonely Planet team share their advice for women traveling solo. Covering everything from making friends to personal safety to crying in public, most of these tips work well for anyone who finds themselves adventuring unescorted.1. Ease into it, even for an afternoonDoing activities alone can feel intimidating at first. It’s a muscle you build over time. Start with a solo day trip close to home or an afternoon wandering a museum you’ve always wanted to visit but didn’t know who to go with. When I backpacked through Australia and New Zealand/Aotearoa, I tacked on extra days at the end of group tours so I had solo time to explore (and decompress!) after nonstop socialising and being “on”. I’d already acclimatised to the new-to-me destination while travelling with the group, which meant I had more confidence and knowledge to navigate the streets on my own. –Deepa LakshminView image in fullscreen‘Some of my absolute favourite parts of a trip have been … sitting alone with a good book on a largely empty beach.’Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesI’m not quite 100% to the point where I’m ready to dive into a solo trip, so I like to carve out a day or an afternoon of “Rachy Adventures” when I’m travelling with friends or my wife. Said adventure often involves a croissant and an overpriced latte. Some of my absolute favourite parts of a trip have been a rainy afternoon spent wandering alone in Boston, or sitting alone with a good book on a largely empty beach, taking in the waves. –Rachel Lewis2. Consider staying in hostelsHostels are a great way to meet people, especially fellow solo female travellers. I truly believe you’re never too old for hostels. Many cater to people of various age groups and backgrounds, and offer private rooms for added comfort and privacy. I find it’s easier to meet like-minded people in communal settings – the kind of people who are eager to exchange travel tips and stories with you and who genuinely want you to have a good time. I’ve made lifelong connections with people I’ve met in hostels. –Sasha BradyView image in fullscreen‘I’ve made lifelong connections with people I’ve met in hostels.’Photograph: Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images3. Book group activities – for a trip or just a mealIf you’re feeling apprehensive about taking a big solo trip, arrange a tour or activity for each day. This way your days will be organised around a preplanned group event. I made connections from all over the world on a solo trip to Australia in my early 20s – and 20 years on I am still in regular touch with a Swedish woman I met on a boat trip to the Great Barrier Reef. –Fionnuala McCarthyAway with Kumi Taguchi: ‘I am really comfortable and happy travelling on my own’Read moreOne thing that makes a lot of solo travellers apprehensive is the thought of eating alone. If you join a food tour, you’ll have dining companions for the evening and the opportunity to try out a bunch of new restaurants – all while learning about the local culture. I joined a food tour of Rome neighbourhood Trastevere while travelling solo: not only did I get to meet fellow travellers, but the tour included a mix of casual street-food spots and restaurants. After you check these places out in a group, you may feel more relaxed coming back on your own. –Alex ButlerFor me, travelling solo can be a great way to meet new, like-minded people. Join a tour group like G Adventures or Intrepid for an entire trip or find a tour or class for something you’re passionate about such as art or cooking. –Melissa Yeager4. Seek out female hosts (pets a bonus)If I’m booking accommodation online, I tend to opt for women owners – preferably with pets in their host photos! This is partly psychological – but I’ve also found that women tend to think about things like where to go to avoid crowds, or safer alternatives to more touristy places. It’s nice how protective women are of each other, especially when we’re travelling alone. –Akanksha SinghView image in fullscreenA public ferry ride around Sydney Harbour.Photograph: Jérôme Favre/EPA5. Hop on a bus or boatI get my bearings by taking either a hop-on, hop-off bus tour or a boat tour. On my first solo trip to Paris, I decided to take a cruise down the Seine – during which I wrote out my plans for the trip and got to know people by offering to snap their photograph. –Brekke Fletcher6. Bring a book – and shop for moreI’ve cycled and hiked and taken trains all over the world by myself, and I never did any of it without a book on hand. Waiting on delayed trains, sitting down to meals, relaxing in a bar at the end of the day: all of these situations are improved with a book. Reading can also be a useful way to put off any potential unwanted conversation. A woman on her own can be a magnet for chatterers, and I’m not always in the mood to talk to strangers when travelling. –Amy LynchView image in fullscreenShakespeare and Company bookshop in Paris.Photograph: Michael Brooks/AlamyI find spending time in local bookstores to be a great way to immerse myself in the destination, as well as meet fellow travellers and locals who seem very happy to help and offer tips and advice. –Brekke Fletcher7. Make new friends – or don’tOne of my favourite things about solo travel is that I can spend as much time as I want by myself, choosing whatever I want to do. I’m a total introvert and I love spending time alone, but I’ve also found it’s pretty easy to start a conversation if I’m tired of being by myself. I can turn to the person next to me at a restaurant, at a museum, on transportation or anywhere else and just ask a question: What do they recommend on the menu? Do they like what they ordered? What are they reading? Do they know the neighbourhood the bus is heading to? This usually leads to a conversation and possibly a new friend. Or, if I’m not feeling it after all, I can just open my book, pick up my phone or leave, and I’m back to being on my own. –Caroline TreflerView image in fullscreen‘Dining alone can be the best kind of mini-adventure.’Photograph: Oleh_Slobodeniuk/Getty ImagesWhile you travel, research some of the digital-nomad meetups or find a bar where they show the games of your favourite team. There are lots of ways to forge new friendships on the road. –Melissa YeagerDining alone can be the best kind of mini adventure. You can chat with the bartender – often a wealth of local knowledge – or other patrons. You can play at being an international woman of mystery and hunker down with a book or a notebook and pen. And if you’ve had a long day of sightseeing, sometimes it feels good to just sit at a quiet table and fiddle with your phone. The best part? Solo diners can often glide right to the front of the line at popular and award-winning restaurants, even without a reservation. –Laura MottaView image in fullscreenA great playlist can help make memories, and headphones have other uses too.Photograph: South_agency/Getty Images8. Download a great playlistWhen I’m travelling solo, I like to listen to music to really set the scene while I’m exploring. And, if you’re like me, I like to have my headphones in so that no one approaches me (hello, introvert!), even with no music playing. Obviously, be careful and don’t have your noise-cancelling on so you can hear your surroundings. Oftentimes, music is a great way to block out all the noise (like in a museum) and any anxiety you might feel. Plus, when you get back home, you’ll have a nice memory from listening to a specific song from your trip. –Serina Patel9. Plan rest daysOn longer trips, for every seven to 10 days of travel, set aside a day to breathe. Sleep in, treat yourself to a nice meal or just give your legs a break. If you can resist the pressure to program every moment of your trip, you won’t feel like you’re “wasting” your time. This is especially true when you’re travelling solo and not on anyone else’s schedule. –Ann Douglas LottAvoid the White Lotus effect: Thailand travel without the touristsRead more10. Use your headphones for directionWhen navigating a new city on foot, plug your destination into a maps app, then listen to the walking directions through headphones. This allows you to avoid pulling out a map – which is equivalent to waving a flag printed with “tourist”! Most importantly, when you’re making your plans, try to resist fear – language and cultural barriers can raise discomfort, which will make you hyper-aware of your surroundings. But that doesn’t mean said surroundings are unsafe. –Jessica Lockhart11. Travel with a power bankTravelling alone, you will most likely be using your phone more than usual to take photos and videos, and for navigating. Even if your phone has a reliable battery, it’s always good to know you have a backup, especially if you’re on your own. There are plenty of small and lightweight power banks that you can purchase to slot into your bag when on the road. –Zara Sekhavat12. Share your location with friends – not the worldTo ensure peace of mind, I make it a habit to inform at least one person back home of my whereabouts using the Find My Friends app, which allows them to track my location in real time. While it can be reassuring for safety reasons, what I appreciate the most is the tangible sense of connection it provides. My family, in particular, loves that they can place me on a map and accompany me virtually on my explorations. –Sasha BradyView image in fullscreenA beach on the Amalfi coast. ‘If destinations cater specifically to couples, you will see a different – and sometimes more interesting – side by going solo.’Photograph: Stephanie Berger/Getty ImagesThe temptation to share your entire trip via social media can be overwhelming – especially if you’re having a fantastic time. But for safety reasons, it’s best to avoid sharing every movement with every follower until you return home. Not only do real-time posts alert people to where you are during every part of your trip, they also let folks know you’re not home. Consider sharing your photos and videos from the road only with close friends, or wait until your trip is over to flood your social media. –Alicia Johnson13. Don’t avoid romantic destinationsI’ve travelled solo to places like Hawaii, Italy’s Amalfi Coast and the Dominican Republic. When I tell these stories, someone will occasionally say something to me like, “I want to go there on my honeymoon, so I’m waiting to take that trip.” My advice? Don’t wait. If you want to go somewhere, even a place with a romantic reputation, go anyway. There are so many ways to enjoy a destination and make your own memories, with or without another person. If resorts or entire destinations cater specifically to couples, you will see a different – and sometimes more interesting – side by going solo. –Laura Motta14. Cry if you want toIt’s normal to feel homesick and miss the people, places and routines that feel familiar to you. Especially if you’re travelling alone for the first time. Especially if you’re far away from everything you’ve ever known. Especially if you feel confused or lonely or out of place. I’ve shed tears in more airports than I care to admit. You’re outside your comfort zone, and that’s scary! But you probably embarked on a solo adventure because some part of you craves something new – and any change requires getting comfortable with being uncomfortable, at least for a little bit. It’s OK to go through it. –Deepa LakshminView image in fullscreen15. Be presentTravelling by yourself is a great opportunity to be mindful. With no need to rush or please anyone else, I find myself doing a lot of thinking and reflecting. I try to limit interaction with my phone as well, to really enjoy the quiet. I find some of my most vivid travelling memories have come from solo trips. –AnneMarie McCarthyThis is an edited extract fromWomen Travel Soloby Lonely PlanetExplore more on these topicsTravelAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s my plea to the international communityThin Lei WinWe have had to be resilient because no one has come to our aid. Myanmar needs tangible support before the humanitarian crisis claims even more livesFri 4 Apr 2025 19.03 EDTShareTwo thoughts entered my head as soon as I saw thatMyanmar, my home country, had been hit by an earthquake: “Is everyone OK?”, followed by, “We just can’t catch a break”.My loved ones thankfully turned out to be badly shaken but physically OK. There were material losses but nothing compared with what so many others aregoing through.The quake on 28 March was both powerful and shallow, a combination that tends to unleash devastation. But it is crucial not to attribute solely to the quake the terrible and heartbreaking images and stories trickling out of Myanmar, of peopleusing bare handsto rescue trapped survivors anddesperate pleasfor medical assistance for the injured.What is turning this natural disaster into a full-blown humanitarian crisis is the actions of the military junta which seized power in February 2021.In the span of four years, I saw my country descend from a promising, if flawed, democracy into one struggling with a “profound polycrisis”. Even before the quake hit, half the population was living below the poverty line, the currency has lost 70% of its value, and more than one in three people need assistance, according to the United Nations. Our healthcare infrastructure is in tatters while the rates of infectious diseases havesoared.How will Myanmar’s earthquake impact the civil war? – podcastRead moreThe army, meanwhile, was busy terrorising its own citizens:bombing communities,burning villagesandcutting off communications.So many ofthe areas most affected by the quake, located in the Buddhist heartland of Sagaing and Mandalay where my family used to go on regular pilgrimages, were already highly vulnerable after four years of intense clashes and coming under the junta’sregular bombardment. In factnearly half of Myanmar’s displaced population of 3.5 millionare in quake-hit areas, which were the military’s former prime recruiting grounds but now are a resistance stronghold.These communities have been further hollowed out as young people fled to avoid the conscription law and the junta forced civil society groups andprivate hospitalsto close. These groups would normally be the first responders in natural disasters.Communication and electricity blackouts have also made it difficult to establish the full scale of the damage in some areas. Without internet access, local journalists have to rely on patchy mobile phone coverage.I’m glad the military made a rare appeal for international help, unlike in the aftermath ofCyclone Nargis in 2008or more recently in 2023 withCyclone Mocha. But I have serious doubts about itswillingness and abilityto provide aid effectively and impartially, given its history of blocking aid, and since some of the hardest hit areas are not under its control.Asian countries riven by war and disaster face some of steepest Trump tariffsRead moreI believe aid should not be conditional or political but I’m also not naive. The junta is likely to take advantage of this latest tragedy to portray itself as Myanmar’s legitimate government, seek to reinforce the myth it is the only institution that can hold the country together, and get broader support for itsupcoming elections.It has already shown a desire to have its cake and eat it: international aidwithout the scrutiny from international journalists, citing travel and accommodation challenges. Having spent years of my early career chasing disasters around South-East Asia, I know these things don’t deter journalists.The junta is illegitimate. Whenever given the chance, Myanmar people have repeatedly shown they do not want military rule. I’m glad there is finally some international attention on Myanmar and I hope it is accompanied by substance, given the UN’s assistance plans for Myanmar have beenconsistently woefully underfunded. Worse, a significant portion of the funds came from the United States,much of which is now goneafter the Trump administration’sdismantlingof USAID.Here’s my plea to the international community: Please push the junta to reverse its flimsy excuse for not allowing foreign journalists into the country, to honour the ceasefire it has finally announced days after pro-democracy groupscommitted to do so, to stop airstrikes of the kind it launchedhours after the quake, and toallow unfettered accessfor aid and aid workers.Please do not rely on the junta alone to deliver aid. Please work with a variety of actors, including local groups with access to some of the most disconnected areas. Volunteers on the grounds are already worried about diseases spreading if the dead bodies are not removed soon because April showers usually accompany our new year, which starts next Sunday.Much has been made of the Myanmar people’s resilience in the face of never-ending misfortune, but I have come to resent the term. We are resilient because we have had to be, because no one else has come to our aid.We should not have to endure this alone. Myanmar needs tangible, sustained support from the international community before this disaster claims even more lives.Thin Lei Win is an award-winning multimedia journalist who was born and raised in Myanmar.

I’m afraid the answer is bothMarina HydeAmid claims that a chatbot helped shape the key calculations, the president is now off playing golf. He’ll find the world economy in a bunkerFri 4 Apr 2025 08.01 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 12.01 EDTShareThere’s a scene in the very first episode of Yellowstone where the casino-owning Native American chiefexplains the basic financial logicof all casinos to an uncomfortable politician: “The gamblers’ money is like a river – flowing one way. Our way.” Oh no, hang on, wait … Not all casinos. In fact, it could be that when all is said and done, the historians looking for that one key fact to illustrate the eventual legacy of Donald Trump will not go with his two stunning presidential election wins. Instead, they’ll point out that in the 90s, he literally managed to bankrupt casinos. To repeat: this is a man who somehow contrived tobankrupt multiple casinos. Is he the guy to reshape the entire global economic order of the past century? Let’s find out! Either way, only 45 months of his presidency left to go.Anyway: tariffs. Rather than using actual tariff data, the United States of America this week appeared to have genuinely used a basic ChatGPT-style model tocalculate the tariffsit would immediately impose on friends/foes/arctic wildlife. This was called either “liberation day”, or the “declaration of economic independence” (sadly not abbreviated – yet – to DEI).It was hosted in the White House Rose Garden by ancient gameshow MC Donald Trump, who was accidentally wearing his indoors makeup outdoors. Like many, I’ve tried to mentally detach from the fact that we live in a time when the US defence secretary has a neck tattoo or whatever, but it makes me feel at least partially alive that the presidential paint job still occasionally retains the power to horrify. Trump leered his way through his tariff presentation while appearing to have been made up by the technique that provided the climax to Joe Wilkinson’s RNLI speech on Last One Laughing (If you saw it, you know). It’s not so much foundation any more as cosmetic bukkake.Forgive me, back to the economics. We know that Trump has always been obsessed with starkly simple numbers. Network TV ratings. The overall trade balance in goods (not services). And – before this week – the stock market. But now, like Bruno, wedon’t talk about the stock market, no no no … Certainly not since itdropped 1,679 pointsin one day alone (the day after Trump announced the tariffs). Although please enjoy the purehilarious happenstance of schedulingwhich meant that that day’s opening bell to signal the start of trading on Wall Street had been rung by the staff of wingnut media outlet Newsmax and Rudy Giuliani. Ding, dong – now just watch those stocks crap the bed. Seriously, Rudy – everything you touch! Then again we do have to remember that it was Trump himself who last year declared that “stock markets are crashing, jobs numbers are terrible, we are heading to World War III and we have two of the most incompetent ‘leaders’ in history. This is not good!!!”Is he still marking presidencies on the same metrics? Alas, reporters are going to need to shout that inquiry over the fairways, as Trump has now repaired to one of his Floridian golf courses to host the first domestic event of 2025 on the Saudi-owned LIV Golf tour. It’s called class: look it up. And no doubt it’ll be fun discussing falling oil prices with whoever is over from Riyadh for the event.Trump did offer one last comment on the tariffs before donning his big-boy golf pants. “The operation is over,” he said. “The patient lived, and is healing. The prognosis is that the patient will be far stronger, bigger, better and more resilient than ever before.” A speech I am positive I have heard delivered word-for-word on The Simpsons by ultra-shady physician Dr Nick. Meanwhile, in the back of shot, a Frankenfigure with a fish’s head grafted to a man’s body sits bolt upright, convulses wildly and dies within three foot of the operating table. Listen, you can’t save ‘em all.Incidentally, Trump is not the only one reaching for medical metaphors. Take the chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, who this morning observed mildly: “We often hear that when the US sneezes the global economy catches cold. This is not the US sneezing. This is the US cutting off its own arm. The self-inflicted economic cost naturally weakens the dollar.” Mm. One indication that an economic plan is going badly is that there’s no one responding to the above by going “ooh, but is cutting off your arm even a bad thing?”. Different circumstances, of course, but there was a similar mood in the air in the UK after Liz Truss’s “mini-budget”.Speaking of Blighty, Keir Starmer seems to have continued his policy of not poking the bear, and indeed to pretend to really enjoy it when the bear pokes you really hard somewhere really painful. According to Trump, Starmer is “very happy” about the 10% tariff kick he just took up the UK’s backside.Still, perhaps there are already signs of slight directional pivots in the West Wing. Having watched global markets tumble while the White House absolutely insisted that the tariffs were not lazy ChatGPT-assisted gambits to provoke immediate trade negotiations, it wasn’t too long before Trump’s son Eric was venturing on to X with a take. “I wouldn’t want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with @realDonaldTrump,” gibbered Trump minor. “The first to negotiate will win – the last will absolutely lose,” he continued. “I have seen this movie my entire life …” Weird, because I don’t remember this particular scene in the aforementioned Trump casino movie – or indeed several epic flops in the franchise.Yet this was also a week where we were reminded that life is not just about the adult sons with whom we are saddled, but the adult sons we choose. Fire up the elegy muzak, then, for there is sadness in the air. Reports – hotly denied, which means nothing – suggest that Elon Musk will fairly soon beleaving his postat the “department of government efficiency” and returning to the private sector. Yeah, let that sink out. And then try to picture his Doge leaving party. “Sorry boys, tariffs mean we can only afford US beer. And, unfortunately, we eliminated spending on paper cups. On the plus side, the president’s makeup artist is just going to spray Bud Light in the general directions of your mouths, and she has a 30% accurate aim. Open wide, victors!”All of which would seem to conclude this week’s look at Trump’s river, which a) is a river of effluent and b) only flows one way. Our way. What can I tell you?

Increasingly, that is under threat, but it must be defendedFri 4 Apr 2025 10.48 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 10.51 EDTShareIt was unsurprising that Benjamin Netanyahu praised Viktor Orbán’s “bold and principled” stand, in response to Hungary’s announcement yesterday that it will leave the international criminal court (ICC). More dismaying is that too few governments seem ready to stand up against impunity at a time when, because of Donald Trump, the very existence of the Hague court is under threat.Hungary’s leader described the ICC as “a political forum”; the Israeli prime minister, during his defiant visit to Budapest this week, complained of a “corrupt organisation”. That is all logical enough. Four months ago, the courtconfirmedan arrest warrant for Netanyahu for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. He could hardly be expected to praise his own indictment.But other European governments also seem ready to play the role of “Orbán-lite” when it comes to Gaza. They have praised the warrants for Vladimir Putin and his associates in the past two years, but recoil from acting on a similar warrant for Netanyahu. Trump, meanwhile,announced sanctionsagainst those who dare to cooperate with the court.Germany’s Green foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has been an almost lone voice in describing Netanyahu’s visit to Hungary as “a bad day” for international law. Her colleague, the then chancellor Olaf Scholz, repeated that he “cannot imagine” Netanyahu being arrested in Germany. The incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has said it would be “completely absurd” for Netanyahu not to be able to visit Berlin. France, traditionally a strong supporter of the ICC, has argued that Netanyahumight enjoy immunity– despite earlier praising the Putin warrant as a welcome reminder that “no one should escape justice”. Downing Streetslapped downthe foreign secretary, David Lammy, for echoing the ICC in asserting breaches of international law.And yet, as ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan points out, perceived unequal approaches are one of the biggest dangers for international justice itself. When I met Khan in The Hague just after his requested warrant for Netanyahu (as well as for Hamas leaders for their “unconscionable” crimes), he quoted King Lear: “Robes and furr’d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold, / And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks.” Khan said he was determined to confront that problem.Those who loathe the idea that political leaders with “furr’d gowns” and powerful connections might somehow be held accountable like to argue that Khan must be a biased prosecutorgone rogue. And yet, the ICC spent a decade chewing the issues over before giving a green light to an investigation. Asrevealed in the Guardianand the Israeli-Palestinian+972 Magazinelast year,Netanyahu became “obsessed” with the court’s work. In one bizarre incident among many, Khan’s predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, wasambushed in a Manhattan hotel suiteby the head of the Mossad. The one thing Israeldidn’tdo was launch credible investigations or prosecutions of alleged crimes, which, following the core principle of “complementarity”, would have spelled an end to ICC investigations.Khan’sadvisers includeda former British chief military prosecutor, a former ICC judge, and a former senior Israeli ambassador who is also the former president of the Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal.A panel of judges spent six months examining Khan’s request before giving theirunanimous approval(the Putin warrant, for comparison, took three weeks to confirm). In short: any politician who challenges the legitimacy of the Netanyahu warrant may be revealing more about their own biases than those of the prosecutor and his colleagues. To quote the Israeli daily Haaretz, the arrest warrant is “neither antisemitic nor a modern-day blood libel”, but a simple call for justice – important for Palestinians, for Israelis and the world.In some ways, the ICC seems stronger than ever. Last month, former president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte wasarrested at Manila airportand delivered to The Hague, in connection with the killing of thousands in his “war on drugs”. In 2023,Putin cancelled a trip to South Africabecause of the arrest warrant against him. Even Netanyahu, despite all his bluster, took alonger routewhen he flew to meet Trump in Washington in February, fearing he might be arrested if he needed to touch down in Europe. The possibilities of international justice, in other words, have grown.But that is not enough. The dangers posed by a vengeful and justice-hating Trump cannot be ignored. Last month, the president of the ICC called for the European Union not to “abandon the court and … the hope of the victims”. She demanded a more robust response to Trump’s sanctions. So far, there has been little sign of that. There is no shortage of issues, from tariffs to the war in Ukraine, where politicians are grappling with how to deal with the unhinged proposals that pour out of the White House almost daily. But confronting Trump’s attempts to destroy the rule of law worldwide cannot be just an optional add-on, once everything else has been dealt with. The events of this week need to be a wake-up call.Robert H Jackson, US chief prosecutor at Nuremberg, said we cannot afford to ignore the gravest crimes, because “we cannot survive their being repeated”. That remains true today. If this court is allowed to fail now – “an idea whose time has come”, as Germany described it at the time of the court’s foundation – it will be impossible to replace. That has implications for the whole world.Steve Crawshaw is the author ofProsecuting the Powerful: War Crimes and the Battle for Justice.

Continually nudging me off centre. Even though the world appears much as it did before my mum, Rosemary, died, everything feels slightly out of kilter. Not quite right. Not as I remembered it. Sometimes, I even have to double-check the chair is where I thought it was. The physical merges into the metaphysical. Most of the time I feel OK. Tell myself that it was the right time for her time to die and that no one can feel cheated at 101. That it is a blessing she is no longer subject to the terrors of her dementia. That she is at peace. I just get on with my work and spend time with family and friends.At other times, I feel overwhelmed with sadness. Struggling to come to terms with the finality. Unable to quite believe that the only time I will see my mum again is in my dreams. Consumed with regrets for the things I was never able to say, before and after the Alzheimer’s took hold. In the meantime, we get on with the death admin, of which there is surprisingly little. My sisters have registered her death and organised the small cremation service but there is no house to pack up and sell. We did all that years ago when she moved into the care home.Everything my mum owned was tucked away in the single room of the home where she lived. Just a few chairs and a small bookcase, some clothes and old photo albums. I felt in something of a daze as we went through my mum’s belongings. Now I regret some of the decisions I made. I found a small folder of random letters I had sent her, mostly ones I had written to her as a child. I found them too painful to re-read so I chose to throw them away. I wish I had hung on to them. As a mark of respect, both to her and to my younger self.TuesdayThere have been an increasing number of articles written warning Britons not to visit the US. I don’t feel as if I have a choice in this. My daughter lives in Minneapolis and I want to be able to visit her over the next four years. Or longer, ifDonald Trumpsomehow manages to tear up the constitution and award himself a third term. As things stand, I have no idea if I have any reason to be worried. I’m certainly not about to stop making fun of the Sun-Bed King or commenting on his influence on global politics. I can imagine border security have more important things to do than prevent a Guardian journalist going on holiday to visit his family.But maybe I’m being naive. After all, even the UK government is going out of its way not to rock the boat. Keir Starmer has been desperate not to do anything to upset The Donald, even when the US administration was about to impose tariffs. He doesn’t even fight back when JD Vance and Marco Rubio suggests the UK is stifling free speech. The irony. Rachel Reeves has gone further still. Inher spring statementlast week, she couldn’t even bring herself to mention Trump by name. In her section on “global headwinds”, she was happy to call out Vladimir Putin. But the section on tariffs was rather garbled, with no references to Trump in person; nor are any other members of the cabinet prepared to do so. Trump is He Who Must Not Be Named. For the time being, then, I will just carry on as normal. I’m due to renew my ESTA in a few months’ time so we’ll see how that goes. One step at a time.WednesdayI have a feeling thefour Beatles biopicsthat director Sam Mendes announced in Los Angeles this week may not be for me. One, maybe, out of curiosity. But four, each devoted to one member of the band, seems like overkill. It’s not as if the music is going to change much from film to film, though I guess Mendes will have prepared separate soundtracks, and the bottom line is I can’t see myself sitting through a film dedicated to Ringo.I’m just not a Beatles obsessive. I was well drilled by my eldest sister, Veronica. Back in 1964, when I was eight years old, she told me there was a choice to make. You were either a Beatles fan or a Rolling Stones fan and there was no crossing the divide. Veronica was a Stones girl through and through. She bought all their LPs and singles and was allowed out to see the band play at Longleat. My dad was a curate in nearby Westbury and the gig was a short drive away. I pleaded with my mum to be allowed to go as well, but was firmly put in my place.My first ever gig would have to wait a month or so. The Hollies were scheduled to also play Longleat and by now my mum had been ground down. I was in. Sadly, I had to make do with Heinz and the Wild Boys because the Hollies cancelled. But, from the age of eight I, too, was a Stones fan.The Beatleswere the safe choice. The Stones had an air of danger. I lived out a parallel life to my middle-class childhood through Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. It never occurred to me they would be still going 60 years later and that the Stones and the Beatles would both become about as establishment as you can get.View image in fullscreen‘Is this the Camberwell carrot?’Photograph: Aaron Chown/ReutersThursdayOne of the less-reported knock-on effects of Labour’s landslide victory last July has been on select committees. In theory, these are where ministers and officials are held to account. Far more so than in parliament, where questions are so easily left unanswered. When I first started political sketch writing, there were three standout committees. There was the home affairs committee, where Theresa May was time and again put under scrutiny as home secretary, and the public accounts committee. Heaven forbid anyone tried to pull the wool over the eyes of its chair, Margaret Hodge. But best of all was the Treasury committee under the forensic Andrew Tyrie, aided and abetted by his attack dogs,Rachel Reevesand Wes Streeting. It was always box office, no more so than when Dominic Cummings was completely exposed as a fraud. Chancellors used to be genuinely anxious before an appearance, unsure if their budgets were about to unravel in real time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because Labour have such a massive majority, they get to take the lion’s share of the places on every committee. And, inevitably, many of the committee members are also new MPs. Men and women who don’t quite know yet how the system works; who are reluctant to properly interrogate senior ministers from their own party.A case in point was the chancellor’s appearance before the Treasury committee to answer questions on her spring statement this week. The last person Reeves would have wanted to face was her former self, because then she would have been forced to defend her benefits cuts and say what she would do if her fiscal headroom again went awol. But Reeves had no such worries. All the Labour MPs asked tame question – “Have you thought about this?” “Yes, I have” – and the two Tories were more spaniel than rottweiler. Rachel went into the hearing with a smile on her face. She came out laughing. You couldn’t blame her.FridayNext Tuesday is my mum’s cremation. It will be a small affair with just my sisters and me, partners, and Anna and Robbie. For the music, we have chosen two piano pieces that my mum used to play: a Schubert Impromptu and Chopin’s Raindrop prelude. As her wicker basket leaves the chapel, Richard Strauss’s Morgen! will be playing: a beautiful song she loved and passed on to us. There will be tears.We are planning a bigger service to inter her ashes next to my dad some time in May, though we’re not sure how many people to expect. Mum outlived almost all her family and friends, though maybe a few of the younger generation will come. It’s a tough time, made worse by the illness of my dog,Herbert Hound. We had hoped to have him around for the summer at least, but he is fading fast and I fear his life is measured in weeks at best.He spends most of his time asleep, hardly eats and has trouble weeing. The only upside is that he doesn’t appear to be in any pain. It feels as if Herbie is looking at us in a different way. Distant, yet strangely intimate. As if he knows his time is short. One of the few consolations in all this loss has been you, the readers. Over the past two weeks, I have received so many kind emails from strangers. Too many to reply to them all, but greatly appreciated, nonetheless. I thank you all. It has also been wonderful to meet so many of you at events I have been doing round the country. I have three more upcoming. At the Marine Theatre in Lyme Regis on Good Friday, the Bloomsbury Theatre in London on 24 April and at the Norwich Arts Centre on 1 May. Please do come. I would love the chance to talk to you and thank you in person.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekUS politicsRachel ReevesThe BeatlesDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s why his team is using SignalKevin CarrollUsing the platform was dangerous and wrong – but officials appeared to prioritize shielding themselves from litigationFri 4 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 10.02 EDTShareNo senior US government official in the now-infamous “Houthi PC Small Group” Signal chat seemed new to that kind of group, nor surprised by the sensitivity of the subject discussed in that insecure forum, not even when the defense secretary,Pete Hegseth, chimed in with details of a coming airstrike. No one objected – not the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who was abroad and using her personal cellphone to discuss pending military operations; not even the presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, who wasin Moscowat the time. Yet most of these officials enjoy the luxury of access to secure government communications systems 24/7/365.Reasonable conclusions may be drawn from these facts. First, Trump’s national security cabinetcommonly discusses secret informationon insecure personal devices. Second, sophisticated adversaries such as Russia and China intercept such communications, especially those sent or received in their countries. Third, as a result, hostile intelligence services now probably possess blackmail material regarding these officials’ indiscreet past conversations on similar topics. Fourth, as a first-termTrump administrationofficial and ex-CIA officer, I believe the reason these officials risk interacting in this way is to prevent their communications from being preserved as required by the Presidential Records Act, and avoid them being discoverable in litigation, or subject to a subpoena or Freedom of Information Act request. And fifth, no one seems to have feared being investigated by the justice department for what appears to be a violation of the Espionage Act’s Section 793(f), which makes gross negligence in mishandling classified information a felony; the FBI director, Kash Patel, and attorney general, Pam Bondi, quickly confirmed that hunch. Remarkably, the CIA director John Ratcliffe wouldn’t even admit to Congress that he and his colleagues had made a mistake.The Trump team group chat news is obscuring an essential question | Mohamad BazziRead moreThe knock-on effects of this are many. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, needs to address his colleagues’ characterization of European partners as “pathetic” with foreign ministers now dubious of the US’s intentions. Allies already hesitant to share their countries’ secrets with the US, because of valid counterintelligence concerns regarding Trump’s affinity forVladimir Putin, will clam up even more rather than risk their sources being compromised by Trump’s appointees. Gabbard and Ratcliffe may have perjured themselves before Congress regarding whether their Signal chat included classified national defense information; certainly, their credibility on Capitol Hill is shredded. As a former CIA case officer, I suspect these directors’ own subordinates will prefer not to share restricted handling information with them going forward. Hegseth, confirmed as secretary by a vote of 51-50 despite concerns over his character and sobriety, lost any moral authority to lead the defense department by reflexively lying about his misconduct, claiming that the story by Jeffrey Goldberg, the unsuspecting Atlantic editor improvidently included in the text chain, is somehow a “hoax” despite the fact the White House contemporaneously confirmed its authenticity.Trump dismisses this scandal, nowunder investigationby the Pentagon’s inspector general, as a witch-hunt, and his followers will fall in line. But every senator who voted to confirm these national security officials, despite doubts regarding their temperaments and qualifications, quietly knows that they own part of this debacle. For fear of facing Republican primary challengers funded by Elon Musk, these senators failed in their solemn constitutional duty to independently provide wise advice and consent regarding nominations to the US’s most important war cabinet posts. How would the senators have explained their misfeasance to service members’ bereaved families – their constituents, perhaps – had the Houthis used information from the Signal chat, such as the time a particular target was to be engaged, to reorient their antiaircraft systems to intercept the inbound aircraft?I happen to have served inYemenas a sensitive activities officer for special operations command (central). Conspicuous in their absence from the Signal chat were uniformed officers responsible for the recent combat mission: the acting chair of the joint chiefs of staff Adm Christopher Grady, central command’s Gen Michael Kurilla and special operations command’s Gen Bryan Fenton. These good men would have raised the obvious objection: loose talk on insecure phones about a coming operation jeopardizes the lives of US sailors and marines standing watch on warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, naval aviators flying over the beach towards the target, and likely special operators, intelligence officers and human sources working in the shadows on the ground.The Signal chat exposes the administration’s incompetence – and its pecking order | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreYou don’t need 30-plus years in uniform to know that holding a detailed yet insecure discussion about a pending military mission is wrong; the participants in the chat knew, too. They just didn’t care, not as much as they cared about keeping their communications from being legally discoverable. They’re safe in the knowledge that in a new era without benefit of the rule of law, Patel’s FBI and Bondi’s justice department will never bring charges against them, for a crime which uniformed service members are routinely prosecuted for vastly smaller infractions. As the attorney general made plain in her remarks about this matter, federal law enforcement is now entirely subservient to Trump’s personal and political interests.Most senior US government officials in 2025 are, unfortunately, far gone from the fine old gentleman’s tradition of honorable resignation. But participants in the Signal chat should consider the Hollywood producer character Jack Woltz’s pained observation to the mafia lawyer Tom Hagen in The Godfatherabout his indiscreetly wayward mistress: “A man in my position cannot afford to be made to look ridiculous.” Trump, the justice department and the Republican Congress may not make them resign, but to the US’s allies and adversaries, and to their own subordinates, these officials now look ridiculous.Kevin Carroll served as senior counselor to the former homeland security secretary John Kelly and as a CIA and army officerExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionSignal group chat leakTrump administrationUS militaryUS foreign policyVladimir PutinDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Why spend more on older children, when we know spending earlier is most effective?Fri 4 Apr 2025 05.05 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 10.32 EDTShareDespite the rampaging rogue state across the Atlantic, around the cabinet table ministers push on with their plans. Too often ignored in all this sound and fury, there is some good news. This week Bridget Phillipsonawardedthe first 300 primary schools funding to set up nurseries that will add up to 4,000 places by the end of September. In the great dash for growth, growth, growth the OBRpredictedan extra 0.2% of GDP due to the provision of free nursery hours for under twos, which are now coming on stream.Nurseries may lack the glamour of mighty infrastructure projects, but the growth effect is immediate, letting more parents work, or work more hours. But the overriding motive of Labour’s early years push is to drive life chances of children whose future is too often determined long before they reach primary school.Fulbridge Academy in Peterborough (which Phillipson visited earlier this week) iscelebratingits grant of £150,000 to extend space for its nursery, raising numbers from 16 to 70 children in time for September. The head of school, Sam Smee, hopes for funding in time to raise this to 120 places, “so that all our children in reception can come through from places in our nursery, with no difficult transition, and we know all families right from the start”. He says four out of five deprived children who arrive in reception without attending nursery never catch up with the rest: “Even in year 6, it’s easy to recognise which children went through nursery from the start.” That’s no surprise, with voluminous evidence on the lifetime effect of good nurseries: the IFS, tracing children from the (mostly lost) Sure Start centres of the last Labour government,foundchildren had fewer hospitalisations and better GCSE results.This bright, spacious school, with extraordinary corridors decorated with fantasy scenes and woodlands, has room to expand. Nursery children attend forest school every week, and the advantage of being part of a large school means they are able to use the PE, sports, soft play, dance, drama, music and art teaching facilities used by the rest of the children. Maintained nurseries and nurseries within schools take considerably more Send children than those run mainly for profit: Fulbridge has 10% Send children in the nursery; thenational averageis 4.8%.View image in fullscreenBridget Phillipson at Fulbridge Academy.Photograph: Fulbridge AcademyThis is only the first tranche of new school-based nurseries, and there’s still a shortage. Coram Family and Childcare’s24th annual Childcare Surveyfinds the extra free hours means a part-time nursery place for under-2s in England now costs 56% less than in 2024. But most councils – 79% – have enough places for at least three-quarters of their eligible nursery age children. “Nursery deserts” remain in the poorest areas, where it’s unprofitable for the private sector, so these first 300 chosen schools are mostly in the North and Midlands. Peterborough council tells me they will still be 200 places short next September.There’s a waiting list of 20 children at Fulbridge, where 80% of the children have English as an additional language, half are of Pakistani heritage, with many others from eastern Europe. Thirty-two percent are on free school meals (24% is the national average), with a fifth living in multiple-occupancy housing and many families taking home food parcels provided at school by Fair Share. The breakfast club here has been free for a while, financed by Greggs, but the promised free breakfast clubs are rolled out to the first 750 schools this week, saving families £460 a year. In September every eligible child will get 30 free hours from nine months to age five, saving families an average £7,500 a year.From when she was made shadow education secretary, Phillipson always said early years would come first, because every pound spent on the youngest makes the most difference to the rest of their education and their lives. She gave the biggest uplift so far in the early-years pupil premium for poor children. But she intends far more. After suffering six education secretaries in five years, (Gavin Williamson,remember him?), she has fixed a course that may take years to prove her success. It took 15 years before the IFS could prove what Sure Start did for GCSE results among poorer children. Labour says it has the patience, as with major infrastructure projects, housing and green energy. Growth – physical and human – takes time.There is a very long way to go still to reverse the upside-down pyramid of education priorities, where more money is spent on a child where it makes least difference: nurseries add most human value, universities add least. Take that pupil premium – even with the uplift it’s worth just £388 for each poor nursery child but £1,480 for school-age deprived children. Why? Most nurseries don’t have trained teachers or graduates with thorough understanding in how to encourage development, speech and language, following the play-oriented early-years curriculum, which is very different from school teaching. (When I visited Sweden I found everyone working in a nursery is an early-years teaching graduate). Early vocabulary, oracy, expression, understanding, describing and reasoning should get the most intensive, skilled educators, not apprentices and the lowest paid in all education. The jumble of private providers need transforming into Fulbridge-style primary-linked nurseries.But first, put right the shocking “eligibility” criteria for nursery hours. By far the most disadvantaged children have no working parent. They may be mentally or physically ill, they may be foreign speakers culturally barred from working, or not working for any number of good or bad reasons, but their children are the ones needing most help from the youngest age. Yet any child with no working parent is barred from full-time nursery: they get just 15 hours, not 30. And yes, says Smee, those missing 15 hours make the most difference to the children with the hardest family backgrounds. Why punish young children for their parent’s lack of work?

Retaliation at this point makes no senseFri 4 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 06.49 EDTShareThe tirade was astonishing. On Wednesday afternoon the world watched as the leader of its most powerful nation accused friends and foes alike of having “looted, pillaged, raped, plundered”, and simultaneously waved a bogus list of tariff imbalances. The playground paranoia was cringeworthy. What onearthwas going on?The answer can only be that Donald Trump is America’s elected president for the next four years. He says hewants to endthe military conflicts the US has fought or sponsored round the globe for a quarter of a century. We are waiting for that. Meanwhile, he is waging an economic war on world trade, a response that his biographer and ghostwriter, Tony Schwartz,blames on his childhood: “a life spent feeling like a victim … any time he does not totally dominate he feels ripped off”.The immediate question is how Britain should respond. At this moment British and US trade negotiators, some presumably crippled with embarrassment, have been struggling to reach a bilateral trade agreement of sorts. Rumours are that it was near completion though Trump had yet to agree. Since Trump has already placed Britain among the countries to be least hit by the tariffs, retaliation at this point makes no sense. Britain would be acting outside the EU and it would have minimal impact.History is never the point in diplomacy, but in tariffs it offers lessons. What Trump calls reciprocity is nothing of the sort. It is competition. The countries he is hitting hardest are in China’s sphere of interest in south-east Asia. These are doing to the US exactly what America did to Europe at the end of the 19th century, working feverishly to undercut its competitor on costs. This plunged 1890s Britain into a deep and lastingagricultural depression. Britain retaliated with tariffs dressed up as imperial preference.Similar devastation followed President Herbert Hoover’s notoriousSmoot-Hawley Actof 1930. Seeking to answer the Wall Street crash, he imposed tariffs on imports that ran from about 20% to as high as 60%. The resulting bout of retaliation from European and other nations ensured that a downturn became a deep global depression. Is there no historian in the White House – or at least in the capitals of Europe? The lesson of Smoot-Hawley is don’t initiate, but above all, don’t retaliate.View image in fullscreenAfter Trump’s announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was on the floor at the opening bell of the NYSE in New York, 3 April 2025.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPAAs for Trump’s claims of the US being “pillaged”, he may have factored into his balance sheet the activities of his favourite pirates, those of America’s digital empire. Inadequately regulated and all but free of tax, they are widely accused of spreading social and psychological devastation among the world’s young people. Should they not be tariffed? That is without even starting on the service sector, inclusion of which would massively distort Trump’s concept of reciprocity.Students of classical economics are taught thatAdam Smithwas right. Free trade led to increased specialisation and market competition. It was tough but fair, and was to the advantage of all. The end of the postwarBretton Woods systemin the 1970s ushered in a world of ever freer trade, and eventual globalisation. The world’s increasing reliance on the dollar led to a recklessness that tottered then recovered in 2008. Ever freer trade remains a bulwark of world prosperity.What Trump is doing has long been the left’s answer to globalisation. It asserts that the benefits of freer trade flowed to the rich, while the poor needed protection from competition, fair or unfair. This is Trumpism. He is defending his domestic industries against what he understandably sees as an existential menace, particularly from south-east Asia. He is making his consumers pay more for their goods, supposedly repaying them with lower taxes. It did not rescue them in the 1930s.World trade has become a robust phenomenon. Since 2022 it has adjusted with relative ease to Nato’s sanctions against Russia and its supporting coalition. The chief beneficiaries of sanctions have been the so-called Bric nations (Brazil, Russia, India and China), who grow in strength by the year. Meanwhile ahuge energy costhas been borne by Europe, with no change whatsoever in Russia’s policy in Ukraine. But the truth is that trade does not do what it is told by governments. It finds ways of dodging regulatory obstacles and defying economic forecasters. Trump might partially mitigate this week’s damage by ending sanctions forthwith.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Today in Focus Extra – podcastRead moreWhat happens next is clearly open to doubt. Pessimists assume that in some degree Trump’s tariff regime will stay. That did not happen after Trump 1.0. There is every sign that he is mercurial, and this may even prove to have been peak Trump. The “economic emergency” powers under which he is operating are shaky andsubject to legal challenge. His behaviour has so damaged America’s government and reputation – slashing his civil service, sacking aid workers against the backdrop of the Myanmar disaster,devastatingthe stock market – that opposition from Washington to Wall Street must steadily emerge. Congress will face its electors in under two years, and party leaders must choose candidates for the succession in little over three. Trump tried to defy the constitution in 2021. He will not do so again.As for Britain, everything says play it long. Yes, there is a temporary advantage in London being free to negotiate with the US separately from Europe. Something might come of it. But the effect can only be to weaken Europe’s negotiating strength as a whole.The best hope is that this is not another 1930s or 1890s, but a rush of American blood to the head that will pass. Trump will have reduced the world’s trade with the US and consequently strengthened other countries’ links with each other. Meanwhile, businesses everywhere will have had an almighty shock. They will have been forced to pause and ponder their future. That, at least, is a silver lining. But for now, history screams one message: don’t retaliate, always negotiate.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionTariffsDonald TrumpUS economyGlobal economyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Whether that pledge will be fulfilled is moot. He will declare victory either way. What the US president offered was not just an economic programme, but an imperial one.Mr Trump’s logic, if it exists, lies in the 397-pagereporton “foreign trade barriers” he brandished on Wednesday. Its message is brutallysimple: you may sell your goods to Walmart shoppers, but only if you let US cloud services hoover up your data, US media flood your screens and US tech monopolies operate on their terms – not yours.TikTokis the test case for Trump’s platform nationalism: only US firms may mine data, reap profits and rule the digital empire.A one-weekultimatumand afabricated national emergencylay bare the theatrics driving Mr Trump’s agenda. The US president’s proposed tariffs and economic nationalism are not about correcting trade imbalances; they are about coercing others into accepting American economic dominance – without requiring the US to sacrifice its domestic advantage.The US continues to run goods deficits not because it “borrows” from abroad, but because the rest of the world willingly exchanges real goods for dollars it cannot issue. Mr Trump demands tribute for that privilege:controlover digital infrastructure, forced access for hi-tech rentiers and suppression of rival technologies. Therealpolitikis that you can sell to American consumers – but only if you buy into American rules, platforms and financial dependencies. Though Mr Trump’s foreign policy is transactional, its domestic effect will probably be transformative – and not in a good way. Tariffs raisepricesfor everyone, especially the poor, while shielding local producers from competition. Meanwhile, as Mr Trump made clear, the revenues are earmarked not for public investment or industrial policy, but fortax cutsthat benefit the wealthy. In this regime, tariffs redistribute upward: the poor pay more, so billionaires pay less.This is not so much anti-globalist as post-globalist. It seeks not withdrawal from the world, but a world that submits to new terms. The US empire still earns – but now demands more and spends less. Foreign aid isslashedand multilateral rules are replaced by bilateral bargains struck at speed. If allies want to trade, they must also license Google Cloud services, buy Boeing jets and resist Chinese influence. Trade, technology and security are bundled into a single, rent-seeking foreign policy.Markets, however, are less convinced – and their continuedcrashingreflects not just recession fears, but a dawning recognition that this model is not a one-quarter adjustment. It is aparadigmshift. The pain, even Mr Trump concedes, may be real. But for him, pain is purgative. It disciplines labour, justifies austerity and remakes the economy in the image of the deal.China’sretaliatorytariffs raise the prospect of a dangerous trade war. But Beijing is signalling that if it can’t win in the US-led system, it will build its own. For other major economies, including theUK, the task is not to replicate American leverage, but to reduce dependence on it – by deepening regional integration, investing in technological autonomy and limiting exposure to US-controlled chokepoints in finance, tech and defence. Resistance may provoke retaliation, but submission ensures subordination. In the long run, strategic cooperation – not bilateral concession – is the only durable answer to tariff imperialism.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The actor’s intervention is to be applauded, but it is not a long-term solutionFri 4 Apr 2025 12.54 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 18.45 EDTShareMichael Sheen’s statement of intent for his newly founded national theatre for Wales couldn’t be more clear. The Welsh actorlaunchedthe company in January after thedemiseof National Theatre Wales owing to funding cuts. This week, Sheenannouncedthat one of his first plays will be Owain & Henry, the story of Owain Glyndŵr, who led a 15-year revolt against the English in 1400. Sheen will star as Glyndŵr, adding the last Welshman to have been proclaimed Prince of Wales to a résumé that includes Tony Blair, David Frost and, most recently, another Welsh hero,Aneurin Bevan.Retelling Shakespeare’s Henry IV from the Welsh perspective was “an act of defiance” and “resistance”, Sheen toldBBC Four’s Front Row, saying that he hoped the play would spark national conversations, not least about his country’s relationship with England. Sheenreturned his OBE in 2017, calling for an end to the practice of keeping the title of Prince of Wales in the English royal family.On a less epic yet equally ambitious scale, the new theatre will also stageThornton Wilder’s Our Town, described by Edward Albee as “the greatest American play ever written”. It will be relocated to the Welsh valleys, with Sheen in the central role of the stage manager. As a celebration of small-town lives, Wilder’s 1930s Pulitzer prize winner might be a precursor to Dylan Thomas’s Under Milk Wood.National Theatre Wales was just one casualty ofa decade of austerity.Theatr Cymru, the touring Welsh language company, survives, but many of Wales’s cultural institutions are on the verge of collapse due to lack of funding – some literally. Cardiff’sSt David’s Hall(home to the Welsh Proms) has been silent since 2023, andthe National Museum of Wales, where staffhad to remove paintings when it rainedbecause its roof leaked so badly, temporarilyclosed for emergency repairsin February.Welsh National Operahas been forced to cut performances and jobs. Cardiff University is closing its prestigiousschool of music. The Books Council of Walesis publishing fewer Welsh-language books. The list goes on.Devolution was meant to safeguard Wales’s culture, butspending on cultural servicesis the lowest in Europe, bar Greece. A nation is its culture.Recent researchconfirms that the arts are good for us, reducing loneliness and boosting mental health. With an ageing population and rising poverty, the Welsh government has heavy budgetary demands, but in February itannouncedan additional £4.4m a year to support the cultural sectors. At last the Senedd is listening.If anyone can resurrect Wales’s creative spirit it is Sheen. As part of the National Theatre Wales’s launch season back in 2011, he transformed his home town of Port Talbot into the stage for a 72-hour performance ofThe Passionover the Easter weekend. More than 100 local amateurs took part. It was “like watching a town discovering its voice through a shared act of creation”, according to theGuardian review. Now Sheen is attempting to do the same for the whole country.Wales has a new national hero. But it shouldn’t be down to Hollywood stars to paper over the cracks with their own money. It is not a long-term solution. Sheen’smost recent philanthropic venturewas writing off £1m of debt for 900 people in south Wales for £100,000, but even his pockets aren’t deep enough to undo a decade of underfunding. He can, however, help the land of song to find its voice once more.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Is it the job you have, or your childhood experiences?Guardian readers respond to Daniel Lavelle’s piece about living in class limboFri 4 Apr 2025 12.51 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 12.54 EDTShareIn his critical reflections on the Marxist definition of the working class (My life in class limbo: am I working class or insufferably bourgeois?, 2 April), Daniel Lavelle wonders how a cleaner and a Premier League footballer could be deemed as part of the same class. They shouldn’t be, because they’re not the same class. Unlike the cleaner, the Premier League footballer doesn’t depend on his wage to survive, because he has probably accumulated enough wealth to do so even if he stops playing football tomorrow.Being working class is not simply about selling your labour, but having to sell your labour to make ends meet. If you have other sources of income that could cover that (profits, savings, inheritance, dividends, rent), then you are not working class. It’s less about, therefore, whether you own the means of production or not, and more about whether you own the means of self-reproduction or not.Interestingly, Lavelle himself comes closer to a Marxist standpoint towards the end of the text: “I have come to believe that you are either making money from your work or you are making it from someone else’s. It’s that simple.” It really is; and that simplicity can come in handy to researchers of class, making it easier to operationalise and measure. But it can also be helpful for the left, for at least two reasons: first, it allows for a more inclusive and broader conception of the working class as a political subject around which a project of social transformation can be built; second, it undercuts the “cultural” understandings of class that enable rich people like Alan Sugar to – as Lavelle correctly points out – pass off as working class when they’re nothing of the sort. In an age of populist politicians who often perform this “down to earth” act, recovering the materialist approach to class seems particularly relevant.Dr Vladimir BortunLecturer in politics, St John’s College, University of OxfordDaniel Lavelle’s discussion of class rings true for me. I have a degree, am a homeowner and own a car. I also work in the gig economy in event hospitality and write – both are mercurial jobs. My family were all working class, though my parents had professions (aviation engineer and scientist). Furthermore, one of my parents was from the Soviet Union and the other lived abroad most of their adult life, and they simply didn’t believe in, or refused to acknowledge, Britain’s class system; indeed, only of late have I decided I must be middle class.However, in my job I work at many affluent houses with many Oxbridge kids (as their part-time work) who have had everything handed to them. Catering a £30,000-plus 18th birthday party, where the parents hobnob and the children talk like adults, is a common occurrence in these circles. By seeing this, I understand that something far more deeply ingrained exists in British society. There is no ladder to the echelons of these elites; you’re either in or out.What the article doesn’t bring up is how sex adds to class disparity (eg unequal pay for women, who still take on the majority of unpaid domestic labour). For me, it is only my partner’s tech job that allows me to thrive and not just survive.As the article concludes, most of us are in it together. However, on the train, squeezed in like sardines, you won’t glimpse the elite in first class. They’re in private cars, in business class jetting around the globe, working from spacious home offices in mansions unseen. Their kids are either getting a first-class education behind fancy old walls, trekking across Asia, or at their parents’ pied-à-terre on Lake Como.K DudleyWallingford, OxfordshireClass has always played a part in my life, from my childhood in a prefab and then another council house to my current easy lifestyle. I have a home in England and another in France. I have a son who has an MA from Cambridge and I spent my own career as a computing lecturer – all very middle class, you might say. However, I have a husband who “dropped out” of a stressful career to work as a wood turner and neither of us is university educated.We are property-rich, through our own entrepreneurial efforts, but income-poor. I still have a working-class accent and I still lack the easy confidence of my privately educated friends. In fact, I don’t really fit in any camp, but I know where my roots are. I know what has shaped the way I see the world and my politics. Maybe it is possible to change your class, but only by rethinking who you are and the values that shaped you.It isn’t the superficial trappings of life that make a person working class or middle class. It is the upbringing and experiences from birth to adulthood that create the person you grow up to be. I can socialise with my middle-class friends, but I will never think like them. I will never see the world from the viewpoint of a privileged upbringing. Many of them think “working class” is an outdated concept. It is not. Working class is not whether you work for someone else who profits from your labour, and it has nothing to do with what job you do or whether you actually work. It is the circumstances you are born into that define who you are and how you think.Rosemary CordellChurt Farnham, SurreyI fully agree with Daniel Lavelle. I too have been obsessed with class all my life, having grown up on a council estate in the 1970s and being the daughter of a milkman and a mum who was a dinner lady. I went on to university to get a degree in economics and a master’s, only to be told at interviews “people like you don’t become solicitors” and “with your accent our clients wouldn’t trust you”. I went on to be a teacher and still am, but am in limbo class-wise, having nothing fully in common with either class.Julie De la CruzLondonDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

I, too, have signed up for aerobic classes, pilates sessions, tai chi courses and other activities, and though I did enjoy them, I hated being indoors. I began walking every day for long periods when both my children were chronically ill for several years. My daily walks helped me manage the stresses of being a caregiver. They got me out of the house without having to go too far, lifted my mood and delighted my senses.I found beautiful walks near my home through fields and parks and am fortunate to have some wooded areas within walking distance. My children are now grown, but I rarely miss a day of walking. I stroll through cities while on vacation, hike up mountains near my cottage and generally walk every day without fail, regardless of the weather.On my more regular routes, I note the small details of changing seasons: the early shoots poking through dead leaves, the summer snails on the path after the rain, the loud drumming of mating woodpeckers, the early frost on the morning leaves. Every walk is a thrill and, because the world is an ever-changing kaleidoscope of beauty, no two walks are the same.Kathy HaltrichKirkland, Quebec, CanadaI had planned that, when my lovely car expired, I would try living without one out of curiosity. I couldn’t actually imagine life without a car, having driven almost every day for well over 50 years.I have seven grandchildren and want to do something for the future. It’s a small enough gesture in terms of what’s happening in the world. To my amazement, I was happy walking everywhere and kept putting off buying another car.It’s now four years since I owned a car and cannot see myself owning another. I am retired and have time. It’s been lovely. Try it if you can.Sue AlavehSheffieldMy experience mirrors Kate McCusker’s. I don’t understand the media’s emphasis on sport, gyms and their pundits when it comes to fitness. My experience of sport was one of total inadequacy and humiliation. So walking and exploring is great, dancing joyous, gardening fabulous. I love public transport, with its passages and stairs. Cleaning the house and DIY actually achieve something. Don’t be bullied by the Lycra brigade.

With an almost startling level of honesty, highly unusual in the sport, the British driver has considered conventional wisdom and its implications and rejected it. That he wants to win is in no doubt but he will not allow his sense of self to be subsumed at the altar of success at all costs.“I feel like there is a very prescribed version of how people say a world champion needs to be – overly aggressive,” he says in hisMcLarenteam’s hospitality on a chilly day in Suzuka before this weekend’s Japanese Grand Prix. “I want to win a championship. I’d rather just be a good person and try to do well. I’ll do whatever I can to win a championship but maybe I won’t sacrifice in my life as much as some others, in terms of who I am as a person and have the ‘fuck you’ mentality people say you’ve got to have. I still believe I can be a world champion but doing it by being a nice guy.”Japan GP practice stopped four times but Tsunoda still delivers for Red BullRead moreThe 25-year-old, in his seventh season in F1, is in the opening phase of the most important year of his career. The McLaren is currently the quickest car on the grid and Norris has already taken one win and a second place in the opening two rounds and leads the world championship. He is likely to face a formidable fight however with teammate Oscar Piastri, the talented young Australian,who claimed victoryat the last round in China.Nonetheless Norris is the focal point, the favourite, facing a barrage of debate about whether he has what it takes to take the title, even with a further 22 races to go. Last season he was given no quarter by a ruthless Max Verstappen, who employed aggressive attacking and defensive driving at Norris’s expense to take the title, leading to widespread questioning of whether he was sufficiently steely to face down the Dutchman.That he has coped with such equanimity is impressive, while he also speaks maturely of his battles with a lack of confidence and depression, and how confronting these challenges and making them public has meant more to him than anything achieved so far in F1.There is an awareness here of the bigger picture. He is relaxed, unafraid to veer from the more comfortable topics of downforce and grip levels, calmly chewing on a banana as he considers his responses that come at length and with thought. So what then of the killer instinct, the supposedly essential ruthlessness required of top sports people and so beloved in F1?“What people want you to believe is you have to think you’re the best in the world, you have to think you can beat everyone,” he says. “That is a great attitude to have but I don’t think it’s the only attitude you have to have if you want to be a champion.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen (left) and Lando Norris went head-to-head for the title in 2024.Photograph: Ali Haider/EPA“I want to just enjoy my life. That’s kind of the attitude that’s maybe not as much of a killer instinct. I just don’t think you have to have that to be a world champion. I want to prove you can be a world champion and not have it. But I don’t want to be pushed around and I also never want to be seen as giving things up because I’m too nice. I’ll still fight for things and I’ll still take risks and I’ll still do whatever I know I can do to be a world champion but without losing the liberty ofwhoI am.”What may develop into an intense battle with Piastri or indeed defending champion Verstappen is likely to test this approach but Norris is adamant he will not take the easy route and obscure his personality beneath a simplistic show of bravado.There are certain things I would not do that other champions have done“I don’t have to show everyone I’ve got that kind of attitude,” he says. “I feel like people go around trying to put on a front and show people that you’ve got that attitude. I can easily go and pretend I’ve got a killer instinct and act like a bit of a dick that might give people that perception.“But there are certain things I would not do that other champions have done. I don’t have as much of a killer instinct as probably most of the drivers or most champions because I was just not brought up that way.”Norris is clearly liberated by feeling he can and should be open about this even knowing these words may be thrown back at him if he is found wanting.He admits to lacking confidence as a child. He grew up in Bristol, where his parents, Cisca and Adam, somewhat reluctantly indulged his need for speed after he became infatuated with a quad bike they bought him when he was five. Indeed they were so concerned for his safety as he hurtled round the garden they sold it, much to young Norris’s distress. However he was not to be denied and found his calling when he took to karting.Norris was happy with his own company and went racing at first not with any career in mind but simply because it was fun. However a relentless march through the ranks also left him questioning himself. He never spent more than one year in any category from karting aged 10 onwards and with every success, the new year would see a new challenge, a reset where the opposition always looked bigger and faster.“I’ve just never seen myself to be as good as Lewis [Hamilton] or even the guys I grew up with,” he explains. “Lewis, George [Russell], or Charles [Leclerc], or Fernando [Alonso], Seb [Vettel], these guys. I never saw myself being in a position of being in F1 in the first place.“For me it was just cool to be able to race against them, more than I want to prove that I’m better.”View image in fullscreenLando Norris in parc ferme after winning the opening race of this season in Australia.Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Formula 1/Getty ImagesHe has previously brought up his struggles with mental healthearly in his time in F1, of doubts fostered in part by this lack of confidence but it played a part in who he is; a determinedly self-critical character.“When I had the negative thoughts of everything and about my own performances, then I would start to think negatively about the next weekend when it’s not even arrived yet,” he says. “It was visible to see on the outside how negative I was and I still am. I’m still the kind of guy that will say: ‘I did a shit job today and I did terrible and I wasn’t good enough.’“Not many other people will probably admit to those kind of things but that will always be me. It was having a toll on me and my wellbeing.”This led to depression he sought help for which led him to taking a hard look at himself in order to then set about changing it, notably halfway through last year when the McLaren was upgraded to become a title contender and Norris entered the fight with Verstappen. The former world champion Nico Rosberg also contacted him with advice, revealing he had been through similar circumstances.“I am still very hard on myself, just probably a bit less publicly now than what I was in the past,” Norris says. “But I can also deal with things better than I could.”He believes he has come out stronger, which in turn puts him in better stead for the title challenge this year. Yet it is fascinating that Norris also feels speaking out on the subject has been of such great import, but that even in doing so he felt uncomfortable.View image in fullscreenThe McLaren of Lando Norris (pictured) and Oscar Piastri has been the fastest car on the track for the opening two races of the season.Photograph: Sopa Images/LightRocket/Getty Images“The worst bit of all of it is that I know how lucky I am to travel the world, get paid well. I can almost do whatever I want in my life and I know how lucky I am to be in that position,” he says. “So I feel like I don’t have the right sometimes to maybe complain or to say certain things as much as other people.“But for me, it’s certainly been a win talking about it because of the amount of messages that I got from people, saying how much having someone in my position and being able to relate to that has helped them.”His decision had far-reaching effects for both himself and others. “Even if it was just one message, that’s made me happier because when it’s mentioned that you saved their life because they wanted to end their life. I got quite a few of them; that makes me happier than winning a race,” he says. “That’s just my perception of life, that’s a bigger impact. Because you made a difference. Winning a race doesn’t make a difference.”There remains an awfully long way to go but with credit to Norris, a nice guy might yet take the title on his own terms.Explore more on these topicsLando NorrisMcLarenFormula OneMotor sportinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Not for the first time, he spotted the right play just a little earlier than everyone else. And of course this was always his gift: not simply to pick the right option but to do it faster than anyone else, buying him those crucial fractions of a second when everything else was in flux and only he in stillness.And of course this was not the only respect in which De Bruyne understood the game of football better than most. As a struggling teenager in the Genk academy, he noticed the way the club abruptly stopped paying for a foster family to house him, and then quietly resumed when he started banging in goals for the second team. Cast adrift at Chelsea, he noticed how he was ignored while first-team players were lavished with attention and bespoke coaching.‘One of the greatest’: De Bruyne hailed by Guardiola after confirming exitRead moreIn short, De Bruyne always intuited the brutal transactional nature of football, the way people hold doors open for you when things are going well, let them close when things are not. The way your only intrinsic worth is the worth you can provide to someone else. So far this season, he has providedManchester Citywith just two league goals and 49% of the minutes for which he was available. His contract is up this summer. The pieces are moving, Kevin. The pass is on. All that remains is for you to play it.And should he want to accept the offer of the Saudi Pro League, or indeed a top league in Europe, then it is a pass that probably needs to be played sooner rather than later. Aged 33, increasingly vulnerable to injury and with more than 50,000 minutes in his legs for club and country, his peak years are beginning to winnow away. Already two games a week at high intensity feels like a stretch. But in the good moments, when the ball rolls towards his feet and the pitch somehow seems to expand around him, he can still stir the imagination like few others alive.Some will advocate De Bruyne as the Premier League’s greatest midfielder of all time. Some will insist he wasn’t even Manchester City’s. Personally I suspect he may ultimately slot into the Roy Keane bracket – obviously not in terms of skillset, but as a player who performed one particular midfield skill so outstandingly that their true all-round value will probably be forgotten a little by history. And in the same way that Keane’s aggression obscured his brilliant vision and distribution, there is perhaps a danger that De Bruyne will be remembered exclusively as a luxury pinger, a threader and a crosser, a ginger Beckham.View image in fullscreenKevin De Bruyne hoists the European Cup in Istanbul in 2023.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAWhich would of course be unfair. Because beyond his exquisite technique – and let’s face it, lots of players can pass a ball nicely these days – what defines De Bruyne is that throttling intensity, not just the killer pass but the killer pass at the end of a lung-busting sprint, not just the pinpoint cross but the six pinpoint passes and runs that set it up. He could score as well as create, press as well as pass. And in this respect he could scarcely have wished for a better enabler than Pep Guardiola, one of the very few men with an obsession for perfection that matched his own, these two brilliant footballing nerds just brilliantly nerding the shit out of football.For all his individual gifts, the temptation to drown in highlight reels and pass porn, it’s also worth pointing out the halo effect a player like De Bruyne has on the players around him. The confidence to make the run, to show for the ball in tight spots, the knowledge that there is a guy 30 yards away who has made it his life’s work to make you look like a genius. Erling Haaland: “I’m not even looking at him because I know where the pass will come.” Sergio Agüero: “All I have to do is hit the ball.” Phil Foden: “You just have to run into the space and he’s going to find you.”Perhaps a consequence of the way De Bruyne uplifted his teammates is that his own achievements feel somehow normal-sized in comparison. There is no defining De Bruyne moment, no Agüero 2012 or Yaya Touré 2014, beyond perhapsthatpass against Stoke or his goal against Real Madrid in the 2023 Champions League semi-final or his four against Wolves. Arguably his greatest season came in 2019-20, when City collapsed in the league and the Ballon d’Or – in which he would certainly have run Robert Lewandowski very close – was cancelled due to Covid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was and remains an introvert, a family man whose friendships are few but close, whose public pronouncements are scarce but meaningful. Football is the only form of expression he ever needed, to the extent where he would refer to the two Kevins: the quiet bloke off the pitch and the “little bastard” who stepped over the line and entered it.Of course his departure marks a tipping point in the breakup of Guardiola’s last great team. And of course questions of wealth and fairness must intrude at this point, questions of meaning and competitive balance, questions with no simple answers. But just as money sufficiently amassed can buy beauty, surely beauty sufficiently amassed can transcend money. Just as people and memories can be co-opted by power and artifice, so people and memories can breathe life and realness into the artifice, give power a beating human heart.To hold these truths simultaneously, perhaps even to believe in them all equally, is not simply an act of maturity but an act of conscience. The same brilliance that makes football irresistible to despots makes it irresistible to us. The same qualities that render it such a potent tool of control also render it the ultimate escape. Perhaps De Bruyne’s greatest gift, on reflection, was not the ability to make us remember, but to make us forget.Explore more on these topicsKevin De BruyneManchester CityanalysisShareReuse this content"

Here they had the chance to prove they could deliver against lower ranked opposition and they did so in style.Lucy Bronze rolls back the years in reminder of Lionesses’ golden summer | Tom GarryRead more“At moments we made football look a little bit simple, I really liked that,” said Wiegman. “We’re developing. I also thought we were developing in October and November, but we took risks. We’re getting closer to how we want to play against different opponents. We know a lot can change quickly, but I’m just very happy with the win and how we showed up.”Lucy Bronze and Keira Walsh were rampant as goals from both bookended those from Millie Bright and the substitutes Aggie Beever-Jones and Jess Park to condemn the team ranked 16 places below them.The win, England’s second from their opening three Nations League games, ensured they sit a point above Spain at the top of group A3, who secured a 3-2 win over Portugal in the earlier fixture.Ashton Gate was heaving and alive for the visit of the European champions as they continue their preparations for their title defence in the summer. If ever there was an advert for why England – men and women – should venture from beneath the Wembley arch from time to time, this was it, fans shoulder to shoulder outside the ground, faces being painted, scarves being bought, signs clutched in hands, eager to see their idols up close. The sold-out crowd made the stadium hum and the players matched their energy, the combination of Bronze and Beth Mead on the right electric, Walsh’s balls in to the Arsenal forward reminiscent of Euro 2022 and Lauren James a constant threat.View image in fullscreenAggie Beever-Jones celebrates after scoring England’s third goal.Photograph: Tom Sandberg/PPAUK/REX/ShutterstockIt took 21 minutes for Wiegman’s side to find the net but it had been coming, Alessia Russo having tested the strength of the upright within two minutes of kick-off as the home team dominated. James was the instigator, whipping a pinpoint ball to the head of Chelsea teammate Bronze who flicked it goalwards, a kind deflection off Amber Tysiak lifting it over goalkeeper Nicky Evrard and in. It was a well deserved goal for the right-back who, at 33, continues to demonstrate why she is one of the first names on the teamsheet, her energy levels and drive unmatched.England doubled their lead with the final touch of the half though and Bronze, again, was key, heading on a corner where Bright was on hand to bundle in.The crowd were lapping it up, Mexican waves sweeping from stand to stand as early as 25 minutes in and phone torches out as soon as the sun faded for impromptu light shows. There was a somewhat worrying change at half-time, with James replaced by Beever-Jones. “She had a small tweak on her leg so we didn’t take any risks and took her out straight away,” said the manager. “I don’t know how it is right now. I think it was her hamstring.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Michael McArdle's side got off to a nightmare start in Dundee when Germany's Elisa Senss scored inside the first minute to set the tone for a one-sided affair.After Sophie Howard's own goal put the visitors 2-0 up at the break, Cora Zicai and Lea Schüller scored within three minutes of each other just before the hour to seal Germany's victory and leave Scotland rooted to the foot of the table.TheRepublic of Irelandwere emphatic winners in the first of a double header againstGreecein the Women's Nations League. Looking for their second victory of the campaign after beating Turkey and losing to Slovenia, the Republic ran out 4-0 winners in Crete, with all the goals coming in the second half.The Ireland manager, Carla Ward, made a double change at the break, bringing on Katie McCabe and Marissa Sheva for Megan Campbell and Tyler Toland, and the effect was immediate. Sheva put Ireland ahead with 48 minutes on the clock, her shot taking two deflections on its way into the net, and 13 minutes later it was 2-0 as Kyra Carusa converted a rebound after Leanne Kiernan's shot was saved.The third arrived with 16 minutes remaining, Jessie Stapleton heading in McCabe's corner. Another substitute, Amber Barrett, made her mark in stoppage time, celebrating her 50th cap in style with the fourth. The Republic will now try to engineer a repeat in the reverse fixture on Tuesday at Tallaght Stadium.Northern Irelandwere denied back-to-back victories afterRomaniahit back to share the spoils in a 1-1 draw in Group B1. Northern Ireland drew first blood in Bucharest when Danielle Maxwell struck in the 33rd minute. However, a defensive mix-up allowed Romania to level shortly afterwards through Mihaela Ciolacu as the home side secured their first points of the campaign.The draw sees Northern Ireland remain second in the group behind Poland as they prepare to face Romania again in Belfast on Tuesday.Walesfell to a 2-1 defeat againstDenmarkin Cardiff as injury to goalscorer Ceri Holland offered real concern ahead of this summer's European Championship. Denmark, ranked 12th in the world and 19 places above Wales, led through Signe Bruun's early strike after seven minutes but were pegged back before half-time by Holland.Wales had a wonderful opportunity to take the lead as Hannah Cain bore down on goal in the 70th minute, only for goalkeeper Maja Bay Østergaard to win the one-on-one duel. Denmark worked the same opening within 30 seconds and substitute Amelie Vangsgaard, who had squandered a clear-cut opening minutes earlier, slotted home past Olivia Clark in the Wales goal.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.England maintained their dominance in the second half but with a two-goal cushion the sting was taken out of the game a little, Wiegman’s charges were more calculated. They weathered the briefest of counterattacking spells from Belgium, who were without influential forward Tessa Wullaert, with substitute Féli Delacauw’s effort deflected onto the roof of the net and a dangerous cross from Jill Janssens missed by everyone, and added the third to kill the game moments later in retaliation.Mead and Walsh combined again and this time Beever–Jones was the recipient, slipping the ball into the back of the net.England were soon close to a fourth soon after, Walsh’s effort coming back off the post. Her fellow substitute Park did extend their lead 10 minutes later, latching on to the ball after Janice Cayman let it bounce before flying towards the box and slotting effortlessly past Evrard. Finally, in the 88th minute, Walsh had her goal, her first in 83 appearances for England, her effort taking a small deflection off Justine Vanhaevermaet as it headed into the net.“I was very happy for her because we want her to shoot more,” said Wiegman. “She has a very good shot and we want her to get higher up the pitch, which she did today. Now, we are joking it’s an own goal, but it’s her goal so I’m very happy for her.”At full time the crowd delighted in the show that had been put on for them. This was England’s biggest winning margin since February 2024, a statement of intent from the European champions and a sign things might be clicking into place at exactly the right time.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Nations LeagueEngland women's football teamBelgium women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Austrian had warned his Brighton counterpart in one of their frequent chats that their friendship would be put aside for the afternoon as arch-rival clubs met in the fixture some outsiders have taken to referring to as the “A23 derby”.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreIt is doubtful Glasner and Hürzeler have discussedthe hazy history of a rivalrythat can be traced back to the 1970s and a spat between their predecessors Terry Venables and Alan Mullery. But as they prepare for the latest showdown at Palace on Saturday, both will be fully aware of its significance for the supporters.Such have been the fine margins between the clubs that this fixture at Selhurst Park has ended 1-1 for the past five seasons, Palace not having tasted victory in front of their fanssince April 2018. Yet Glasner’s side go into the game as marginal favourites to complete the double over Brighton for the first time since they were both in Division Three South in 1933 given their superb recent form, even if a run of five straight wins in all competitions was ended byWednesday’s draw with Southamptonthat the manager attributed to his players being “mentally tired” after recent exertions.Victory at St Mary’s would have taken Palace to within five points of Brighton with a game in hand, after they failed to win any of their opening eight Premier League fixtures. They have an FA Cup semi-final to come against Aston Villa, and Glasner will know that a league finale to match last season’s six victories in their final seven matches could catapult Palace into European contention for the first time (other than in the Intertoto Cup after relegation in 1998) via their finishing position.Ending above Brighton for a second successive season may be a more realistic ambition, having failed to do so on two occasions since their rivals were promoted in 2017.Graham Potter guided Brighton to ninth in 2022 before Roberto De Zerbi’s historic sixth-placed finish 12 months later meant the club qualified for Europe for the first time. Palace have never ended higher than 10th since promotion in 2013 but look capable of pushing further up the table. Not since a decade ago when Alan Pardew racked up eight wins in his first 12 matches after joining from Newcastle have they been so handily placed at this stage of the season.Last week’s surprise departure of Dougie Freedman as sporting director could throw a major spanner in the works in the coming months, however. Glasner revealed this week that the highly regarded former Scotland forward,who is joining Al-Diriyah, a Saudi Arabian club recently promoted to the second tier and owned by the Public Investment Fund, had “a feeling” it was time to leave after eight years in his role.View image in fullscreenIsmaïla Sarr steals in behind Brighton’s Lewis Dunk to score in Crystal Palace’s away 3-1 win in December.Photograph: Shaun Brooks/CameraSport/Getty ImagesFreedman played an integral part in assembling the current squad, helping to sign Marc Guéhi, Eberechi Eze and Adam Wharton among others, and is understood to have passed on a list of potential summer targets before stepping down. So it was fitting that Matheus França, who he heavily scouted before signing him from the Brazilian club Flamengo in August 2023 for €20m (£17m), scored his first Palace goal to equalise against Southampton after struggling with injuries. The chair, Steve Parish, must find a replacement as he tries to persuade Glasner to sign an extension to a deal that ends next season but contains a 12-month option. Parish opened negotiations with Glasner last month amid interest from RB Leipzig.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brighton were denied the opportunity to join Palace at Wembley by their FA Cup penaltyshootout defeat by Nottingham Forestbefore beingoutclassed by Aston Villain a disappointing performance that was greeted by boos from some home supporters. Beating Palace would be the perfect riposte and boost their chances of qualifying for Europe again; only four points separate them and fifth-placed Manchester City.As has come to be expected at Brighton, planning is well advanced for next season under another Scotsman, the sporting director and former Everton defender David Weir. They confirmed the arrival of the England Under-18 winger Tommy Watson from Sunderland for £10m this week and it is understood they also have a sell-on clause for Viktor Gyökeres, the Sweden striker who was sold to Coventry in 2021 and plays for Sporting in Portugal. He has been linked with a big-money summer move to Arsenal or Manchester United.More immediately, Hürzeler must find a solution to the absence of Brighton’s record signing, Georginio Rutter, for the rest of the campaign with an ankle injury sustained against Forest as Brighton try to spoil Palace’s progression and get their season back on track.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceBrighton & Hove AlbionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The manager, who is fighting to continue into next season, described his job as different to anything he had experienced because of the “weight of things you’re trying to rail against”.They include the isolation of the post, how the Spurs manager is normally the lone spokesperson for the club, nobody from the hierarchy publicly defending its positions. This echoed the sentiments of some of his predecessors,especially Antonio Conte. Postecoglou did not name names but it is a matter of fact that the chairman, Daniel Levy, almost never gives interviews. The chief football officer, Scott Munn, and the technical director, Johan Lange, are similarly low-profile.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreOn a related note, Postecoglou considered how media pundits with affiliations to certain clubs will speak up in their favour, creating a more favourable climate for them. With Spurs, it is the opposite, everybody – including former players and managers – piling in on them.More broadly, Postecoglou suggested that whenever there was a bad season at Spurs, the default move was to change the manager, never mind the amount of positivity which had come before. That, he said, had to change. Postecoglou acknowledged that he would say this – it is plainly in his interests – but he hoped that people could take the point without prejudice.“I just don’t think it’s about the managers themselves,” Postecoglou said. “I’ve almost lasted two years. It’s pretty good for Tottenham! At some point, the club needs to stick to something. If I say it now it sounds self-serving and defeats the purpose, so maybe not now … but I think that if you want to change the course of your events, you need to change materially a lot of things in terms of the way your outlook is as a club.“It’s fair to say this year hasn’t worked out but that’s the other thing. We finished fifth last year. In another year, that would have been a Champions League spot. With people, it just doesn’t register. If you have five years at a club and you have maybe one or two disappointing years but you have three really strong years you’d say: ‘I’ll take that.’ But it seems like [at Spurs], you have one good year, you have one poor year and then that’s it. Let’s move on to the next.“That’s what I accepted so I can’t sit here and say: ‘Woe is me.’ It’s fair to say at the moment I’m not doing a good job of turning that mind-shift around. But I am a fighter. I will continue fighting until told otherwise. As has been rightly pointed out, there’s life after this for everybody, including Tottenham and including me.”View image in fullscreenAnge Postecoglou cups his ear after Pape Sarr’s goal which was later disallowed.Photograph: Robin Jones/Getty ImagesPostecoglou was frustrated thathis ear-cupping celebrationtowards the Spurs fans after Pape Sarr’s ultimately disallowed goal inThursday night’s 1-0 defeatat Chelsea became the major talking point, rather than the VAR processes that led to the over-rule. Postecoglou is a sworn enemy of the technology, feeling it is ruining the game. But he recognised the reaction as being very much of a piece with life at Spurs.“People tend to focus on the internals of Tottenham rather than the externals,” Postecoglou said. “Whether that’s the fan disenchantment – that’s internal. External is what happened with the decisions. It seems like every fight ends up being an internal fight at this club. There’s never any defending of the club or the club defending itself.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You probably hear too much from me. It doesn’t have to be just from people at the club, either. I hear plenty of people talking and defending other clubs but it seems with Tottenham, wherever there’s a sore there’s a real pile-on to stick a finger in that sore and then we accept our fate.“In the time I’ve been here, we’ve had two decisions that have gone for us against Liverpool and there has been a national campaign, almost.”Postecoglou was referring mainly to the reaction that followed the Luis Díaz goalthat was mistakenly disallowedby the VAR team in last season’s Premier League fixture at Spurs’s stadium. The other flashpoint came this time out in the Carabao Cup semi-final, first leg, also at Spurs, when Postecoglou’s midfielder Lucas Bergvall was surprisingly spared a second yellow card. Hewent on to scorefor 1-0.“You guys [in the media] know the landscape better than I do but it seems like … I never switch on and hear any sort of strong voice [for Spurs]. The only voice you hear is me. When we’re talking about the bigger clubs, there seems to be a lot more voices. And not always defending them. You need scrutiny and constructive criticism, as well. We definitely get enough of that. But we never get any of the other stuff.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurAnge PostecoglounewsShareReuse this content"

As well as welcoming their first round opponents, Sussex, who closed on 386-5, Warwickshire were saying farewell to their cricket operations manager, Keith Cook, after nearly 52 years of service.Cook first walked through the gates here in 1973 as a fresh-faced 17-year-old after deciding, shrewdly, that office junior at Edgbaston sounded more fun than the vacancies at the local gas board and law courts. Before this final day at the club, he wondered whether a couple of folks from the back office might pop outside to wish him well.Instead, as Cook walked out to conduct the toss – something which required special dispensation from the suits at Lord’s and prompted chuckles from the captains when his use of a one-euro coin left them wondering which side was in fact heads – he was warmly applauded by a crowd that was already in the hundreds.There were famous Bears from yesteryear among them – Dennis Amiss, Gladstone Small and Jeetan Patel to name a few – and a lengthy guard of honour from the current squad. Members later gathered in the pavilion during the lunch interval for a special Q&A, with a good few eyes in the room misting up as Cook relived his time at the club.For everyone bar Cook himself, these scenes were not exactly a surprise. The word “legend” is overused in sport but speak to anyone connected with Warwickshire about him and it almost always pops up. Over the years – years that have coincided with fiveCounty Championshiptitles, 11 in limited overs cricket, plus a total rebuild of the ground – Cook has been Mr Fix-it for countless players; the go-to man with the can-do attitude.View image in fullscreenWarwickshire’s Keith Cook is given an emotional send-off after 52 years of service.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesSam Hain, for instance, calls Cook his “English dad” and for good reason: 12 years ago, Cook picked up a wide-eyed, board-shorts-wearing Aussie kid at Heathrow in the middle of February and has been sorting out his off-field life ever since. Washing machine, boiler — you name it, Cook has pretty much arranged it.For Chris Woakes, as solid a judge of character as any, Cook is simply “one of the great men,” someone who “deals with the human being, not the cricketer.” Woakes saw this first-hand early on when, as an academy player entitled to very little, he crashed his old Corsa on the way to the ground and Cook swiftly arranged a replacement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is what the badge stands for. You see the people here today, like our old groundsman, Steve Rouse, who has popped in to say hello, and they just get it. They still feel part of something.”In terms of the future, Cook admits that the sense of belonging to one entity – the “Once a Bear, always a Bear mantra” here at Edgbaston – may well change. “I think it will be a challenge,” he said. “Players are now thinking about their careers in white-ball cricket, the franchises, and you maybe don’t have that same connection. I will be sad if that is lost.”As more money than ever before flows into English domestic cricket following the sale of the Hundred teams, the hope is that this sense of belonging remains; that the sport’s new overlords remember it is as much about people as it is a return on investment.Explore more on these topicsCounty ChampionshipCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dazn remains confident of securing an agreement, with Channel 4 or Channel 5 the most likely partners.Infantino’s $1bn prize: act of commercial disruption disguised as benevolence | Barney RonayRead moreAn industry source told the Guardian that Dazn viewing figures varied depending on the content but that its typical audience for live sport in the UK was in the low ten thousands. Dazn does not disclose viewing figures but its latest accounts say it has a global reach of 60 million premium users and 300 million monthly users.Manchester City and Chelsea will represent the Premier League at the tournament, where the winners will receive prize money of up to £97m for seven matches. Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami are among other participants.The BBC declined to enter negotiations and talks withITVhave not progressed beyond an exploratory conversation last month. The subscription channels Sky Sports and TNT Sports, rivals to Dazn, have shown no interest.The BBC is understood to have dismissed the proposal out of hand owing to the difficulty of promoting a commercial channel given its public service remit. As previously reported by theDaily Telegraph, ITV submitted a proposal to Fifa to carry Club World Cup games without paying a rights fee before the Dazn deal was agreed.BBC and ITV will share coverage of the Women’s European Championship for the first time as England’s Lionesses defend their title in Switzerland. The Club World Cup begins two days before the Euros quarter-finals get under way.Dazn is understood to be seeking a sublicensing arrangement in which a free-to-air broadcaster will take all 63 matches, to secure maximum exposure for its brand. Channel 4 broadcast 20 England’s men’s games live in 2023 and 2024 and has secondary rights for some Women’s FA Cup matches, and Channel 5 previously showed EFL highlights.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dazn is planning to send a production team and presenters to the US for the most high-profile football event it has covered. The London-based platform, owned by the billionaire Len Blavatnik, is better known in the UK for its coverage of world title boxing in Saudi Arabia, but has the rights for the Premier League, La Liga, NFL and NBA in other European countries.Dazn’s links to Saudi Arabia appear to be underpinning the financing of the Club World Cup, with the kingdom’s Surj Sports Investment group last month confirming it had taken minority stake in the company valued $1bn. Fifa subsequently announced the prize and appearance fundwould also be $1bn, with City and Chelsea receiving £29.6m for taking part.Explore more on these topicsClub World CupFifaBBCITVnewsShareReuse this content"

But the levies willnot apply to many fossil fuel products, including liquefied natural gas imports, crude oil from Canada, and materials needed for making petrochemicals.Trump’s tariffs: the full listRead moreOil interests celebrated the carveout: “We welcome President Trump’s decision to exclude oil and natural gas from new tariffs, underscoring the complexity of integrated global energy markets and the importance of America’s role as a net energy exporter,” Mike Sommers, head of the top US fossil fuel lobby group, the American Petroleum Institute, wrote in asocial media post. “We will continue working with the Trump administration on trade policies that support American energy dominance.”Sommers’ statement wascirculatedby the White House in a fact sheet on Thursday.The exemption came after the fossil fuel industrypoured $96minto Trump’s re-election campaign and affiliated political action committees, as he pledged to deregulate the sector and roll back environmental regulations. This wasless than the $1bnTrump requested from the sector in an infamous meeting at his Mar-a-Lago club, but still constituted record levels of spending.“Oil and gas billionaires just bought themselves an exemption from Trump’s tariffs,” Stevie O’Hanlon, a spokesperson for youth-led environmental justice group the Sunrise Movement, said on Thursday. “While the rest of us have to deal with skyrocketing prices and rising temperatures, they’re sitting on their thrones and raking in billions. We need an end to this oligarchy now.”In the first three months of his second term, Trump has made good on his promises to attack green policies. He has also maintained a cozy relationship with the industry, appointing anarray of industry intereststo his administration.Last month, the president held a meeting with more than a dozen oil executives at the White House, where hefloatedan energy exemption from his tariff package, according to the Washington Post, with one source telling the outlet that it was unclear if Trump was making a joke or a serious policy pledge.The carveout is expected to cushion the oil and gas sector from the market chaos caused by the tariffs – something about which they havevoiced concerninrecent weeks. But it has not completely shielded them from the fallout.Revealed: Trump’s fossil-fuel donors to profit from data-center boom and green rollbacksRead moreThough the tariffs won’t apply directly to many oil and gas products, they could still drive up the costs of production, with levies on steel and aluminum driving up the costs of building fossil fuel infrastructure. Further, less than 24 hours after the tariff package was announced,commodity markets cratered, with oil pricesfalling into negative territory– a result of weaker fuel demand often spurred by slowedglobal economic growth.“At this early stage, it’s difficult to fully assess the long-term impact of these tariffs on the global economy, but there will undoubtedly be immediate and severe consequences,” Claudio Galimberti, an economist at Rystad Energy, wrote in a Thursday analysis.Trump has repeatedly pledged to fight inflation and lower bills for ordinary Americans. Yet his new tariffs could fuel price increases on everything from gas and automobiles to wine and chocolate, experts say.“Donald Trump isn’t just breaking his promise to lower prices for Americans,” said Pete Jones, a spokesperson for green advocacy group Climate Power. “He’s making sure they pay more while his billionaire oil donors pay less.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpDemocracy and justiceTrump tariffsUS politicsTrump administrationOil and gas companiesnewsShareReuse this content"

He hosted commercial events in parliament, similar to the one to which he invited Taylor, on behalf of his son Richard’s company, which was charging up to £25,000 for sponsorship of the events. Evans owns a one-third shareholding in the business.Taylor pulled out of the event after she was contacted by the Guardian. Evans has previously told the Guardian he has not breached the Lords code of conduct, or taken any personal benefit.LiveLabour peer’s involvement in apparent cash-for-access venture exposed – videoThe documents, released under freedom of information laws, provide further details on howEvans contacted Taylor’s private secretary in her ministerial office on 4 February. Copied into the email was an address, redacted in the document, at Octavius GB Ltd, his son’s company.Evans wrote: “Baroness Sharon Taylor kindly asked me to contact you regarding my invitation for her to be our keynote speaker at a prestigious event that I am hosting on the 12th June 2025.“Commencing at 12.30pm in the Cholmondeley Room of the House of Lords. Guests include leading construction, development, architectural companies and their supply chain – essential in achieving HMG’s ambitious targets for new housing.”On 10 February, the official confirmed it would be put in Taylor’s diary, and asked for further information for the keynote speech to be drafted. Evans thanked the official and said the event was now going to be on “housing and infrastructure – which fits precisely with the minister’s brief”.Less than two hours later, Richard Evans announced on LinkedIn that Taylor would be the keynote speaker at the event. He wrote: “Do hurry and secure your ‘Early Bird’ place for this particular gathering.” Early bird tickets to the event had been sold as part of a membership offer costing more than £320.Posts by Richard Evans about Taylor’s attendance included an appeal to sponsor the event, for up to £25,000.On 12 February, Evans wrote to Taylor’s private secretary again, sharing information on the subjects he hoped the minister might discuss and offering further help if necessary.At no stage in the correspondence did Evans declare it was his son’s company organising the event or mention his shareholding in the company, which he told the Guardian he had forgotten about.Rules ban peers from exploiting their membership of the Lords. While there are grey zones in the rules, peers must follow key principles, including a requirement to act as parliamentarians on their “personal honour”.There are also rules barring peers from hosting for-profit events in parliament.Hours after the Guardian contacted Taylor for comment, her private secretary informed Evans the minister would “no longer be able to attend this event”. There is no suggestion she was aware of its commercial nature.The Lords commissioners for standards are investigating Evans for potential breaches ofthe rules.He is one of three peers being investigated after the Guardian’s reporting in the Lords debate series, which examined the conduct of members of the upper chamber in the context of government plans for reform.Five key takeaways from the Guardian’s House of Lords seriesRead moreEvans was recently cleared by a separate watchdog, the Office of the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists, which examines claims of improper lobbying. The watchdog found he had not received any payment as an individual or through a company, and thus no unregistered consultant lobbying had occurred.The registrar has written to Richard Evans as part of a separate investigation into Octavius GB Ltd and two other brands and companies he operates, in relation to potential unregistered consultant lobbying. The investigation has not yet concluded.A Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: “This invitation was initially accepted in principle but was later declined and the minister will not be attending this event in any capacity.”David and Richard Evans were approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsThe Lords debateLabournewsShareReuse this content"

However, the company has now written to the government withdrawing its planning application.The Whitehaven mine was ruled unlawful in September, with the judge agreeing with Friends of the Earth, which brought the judicial review. They had argued thatMichael Gove, when he was secretary of state for levelling up, acted unlawfully in accepting a claim by West Cumbria Mining that the mine would be net zero and have no impact on the UK’s ability to meet the emissions cuts required under the Climate Change Act 2008. WMC was relying on offsetting through buying carbon credits from abroad; however, UK government policy does not allow reliance on international offsets to meet carbon budgets.Emissions from burning coal from the proposed Whitehaven mine were not included in the developer’s climate assessment. New fossil fuel projects are thought to be on shakier legal ground after the precedent set by a landmark supreme court decision that quashed planning permission granted for an oil drilling well at Horse Hill on the Weald in Surrey.That judgmentfound the impact on the climate of burning coal, oil and gas must be taken into account when deciding whether to approve projects.Tony Bosworth, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “We’re delighted this long-running saga has finally drawn to a close. Congratulations to all the brilliant local campaigners who fought so powerfully to stop this mine.“The previous government should never have given the green light for this highly polluting and unnecessary coalmine in the first place – and WCM should have pulled the plug on it last year when planning permission was comprehensively quashed and coal licences were refused.”Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsMiningFossil fuelsPlanning policyCoalCumbrianewsShareReuse this content"

When political problems arose, Watson and fellow Labour party organisers would be guided through to comfy sofas in the family sitting room.He said the group, nearly all middle-aged men, would “start babbling” about the latest ructions and discuss how to negotiate multilayeredWest Midlandspolitics involving factions and complex community alliances.Inevitably, Ahmed would turn towards his daughter who had appeared with a fresh pot of tea. The group soon learned to listen carefully to her suggestions, Watson said.“Shabana would let them know exactly what to do, and when to do it. She would give them the line, clearly and concisely. She could see a problem and cut through it at a young age,” the peer said.Lawyers attack ‘dangerous’ decision to halt Sentencing Council guidelinesRead moreMore than 25 years later, her allies say the same political nous was on display last week when, as lord chancellor, Mahmood forced the Sentencing Council toreverse plansto issue new advice to judges that would have made the ethnicity or faith of an offender a prominent factor when deciding whether to jail them.In a move that instantly undercut the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, who had claimed the advice was proof of “two tier” policing, the former barrister told MPs she might “legislate if necessary” to curb the powers of the independent body.She said: “As someone who is from an ethnic minority background myself, I do not stand for any differential treatment before the law.”Criticisms have been led by senior black lawyers and judicial campaigners, some of whom believe she has failed to back the independence of the judiciary and deliberately misinterpreted theSentencingCouncil’s advice to score political points.One barrister said his colleagues are furious at what they see as an effort to pander to Reform voters. “She is taking her lead from the Suella Braverman handbook,” he said, in reference to the hard-right former Tory home secretary.Such digs are unlikely to unsettle Mahmood, who last year fought a bruising general election campaign that resulted in threats and heightened security.Mahmood was born in September 1980 inBirmingham, one of four siblings at the centre of a large Kashmiri community. Her father, originally from Mirpur, worked as a civil engineer while her mother, Zubaida, ran a corner shop, with both taking a close interest in their children’s education.Watson said: “Her dad would get home from work and would gather the children around him, cross-legged. They would each be asked to read for five minutes from The Times.” If they did not understand or mispronounced a word, they were told to look it up.Mahmood went to state schools and read law at Lincoln College, Oxford. She qualified as a barrister, entering parliament in 2010 after becoming the Labour candidate for Birmingham Ladywood after Clare Short’s resignation.She refused to serve in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet and emerged as a reformer and leading supporter of Labour Together after the 2019 general election defeat to Boris Johnson.As a result of the escalating conflict in the Middle East, and criticisms over Starmer’s policies towards Israel-Palestine,Mahmood and her family faced intimidation, harassment and threatsduring the 2024 general election campaign.She returns to Birmingham most weekends where she shares a house with her sister and lives next door to her parents.However, it would be a mistake to believe that she fulfils the stereotype of a demure Asian daughter, according to her friend Lucy Powell, the leader of the House of Commons. “Shabana really enjoys a laugh. She has a wicked sense of humour and would probably swear more than other people in the room,” she said.Since becoming the first Muslim woman and the first Kashmiri to become lord chancellor and justice secretary nine months ago, Mahmood has also led Starmer’s policy to convince the British people that many more criminals should spend less time in prison and instead be rehabilitated in the community.Less than a week into the job, Mahmood announced the early release of thousands of criminals amid a deepening overcrowding crisis across jails inEnglandand Wales.Her allies are acutely aware that such policies carry daily jeopardies and possible demands for her resignation if a released prisoner commits a serious crime or a jail riot escalates.Powell said: “Shabana came in with probably the most tricky sets of issues from day one of anybody around the cabinet table. She’s had to make some very, very big judgment calls from the off.”If the cabinet could be compared to a football team, Powell, a Manchester City fan, said Mahmood’s role overseeing the criminal justice system is a central part of the defence. “You don’t really get the glory very often. But if you make a mistake, it’s all on you,” she said. “LikeRúben Dias.”Explore more on these topicsShabana MahmoodLabourSentencingUK criminal justicePrisons and probationEnglandBirminghamprofilesShareReuse this content"

He said his current show was already turning a profit since he broke away from Rupert Murdoch’s media empire in January.“I see Uncensored as being potentially a really big entity where I will have other people under me who will be also Uncensored, but I’m also going to expand the genres,” he told Semafor Media’sMixed Signals podcast. “I want to get into Crime Uncensored, to History Uncensored, to Sport Uncensored – and start to build it out like that.”He added: “I can tell you there are some big players who are very, very keen to get involved in the Uncensored business, so I would watch this space sooner rather than later.”It appears to be an attempt to replicate the success enjoyed by Gary Lineker, hisfriend and social media sparring partner, whose Goalhanger podcast has spawned a series of successful shows including The Rest is History, The Rest is Politics and The Rest is Entertainment. Its latest published accounts show it made a profit of £1.4m last year.Morgan said he was taking inspiration from The Daily Wire, a US conservative media company co-founded in 2015 by the rightwing political commentator Ben Shapiro. It has a series of YouTube shows and podcasts – as well as a profitable sideline in razors.While Morgan has not released the names of potential investors, his plans are part of a wider trend whereby prominent figures have moved from traditional broadcasters to new media platforms, particularly YouTube.The trend has been most prominent on the US political right. The former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who wasdropped by NBCin 2018 after only one year of her three-year contract, has nearly 3.5 million YouTube subscribers on her pro-Trump channel and recently announced she was starting her own podcast network. Tucker Carlson, another former Fox host, has almost 3.9 million subscribers.“You’re going to see a lot of people like me who were, perhaps, associated with conventional media, going off and doing their own thing,” Morgan said. “I think some of us are going to be enormously successful.”He added: “I think you’ll look back in five years’ time and you’ll see that this interview I’ve given you – about the way I see the Uncensored brand developing – will be exactly how it develops. And we’ll have a lot of financial clout behind us and it will be incredibly successful. There will be lots of ‘mini-mes’ running around. I want to go and find the next mes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He did so after the expiration of a deal with Murdoch’s News UK that paid him a reported £50m over three years.While News UK retains a financial interest in Uncensored until 2029, Morgan now owns the brand through his production company, Wake Up Productions. News UK had signed him to be the star of TalkTV, launched in 2022 to take on the rightwing broadcaster GB News.

His DNA had been uploaded to the national database when he was arrested for an unrelated offence years earlier.Sharkey, a former council officer from Liverpool, was then tracked down by police and arrested on suspicion of murder. She had kept the baby’s birth secret from everyone, including her family.Sentencing Sharkey at Liverpool crown court on Friday, Judge Eady said the case was “both terrible and tragic”.Sparing the defendant jail, Eady said this “highly unusual” case raised the real question of whether “appropriate punishment can only be achieved with immediate custody”. The judge said: “This very sad case calls for compassion. No useful purpose would be achieved by immediate imprisonment.”Sharkey shook and sobbed in the dock, while her husband, Neil, and their son, Matthew, wept in the public gallery as she was told she would not be jailed.Eady said the defendant’s judgment had been “significantly impaired” by the severe undiagnosed postnatal depression she was suffering at the time, following the birth of her first son Matthew in July 1996.Sharkey, then 28, kept her second pregnancy a secret and gave birth alone at home. She suffocated the newborn by stuffing tissue paper in his mouth then wrapping his body in bin bags, the court heard. She disposed of her baby boy near Gulliver’s World theme park, in Cheshire, where he was discovered days later.Jonas Hankin KC, prosecuting, said the defendant had expressed “feelings of guilt and a sense of relief” when she was arrested, adding that she had thought about telling someone “a million times – but how would you say it?”In police interviews, Sharkey said: “I couldn’t actually say the words. It’s not easy to live with all that time. I thought this would happen. You don’t get away with anything for ever.” She added: “It’s haunting. Something you think about every day. You try and push it out but it creeps back in.”Sharkey’s husband and their son gave emotional witness statements in support of Sharkey, describing her as “an amazing mother” who was “remorseful and accepting of any punishment the courts deem suitable”.The court was told that Sharkey would have been jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 17 to 20 years in prison had she not been suffering mental illness at the time. The prosecution had sought a sentence of between seven and 12 years.Sentencing Sharkey to two years in prison, suspended for two years, the judge said the defendant’s mental state at the time was “not a case of the baby blues, but a far more sustained period of depression which impacted on you physically and mentally”. She said she had no doubt that Sharkey’s symptoms would have been viewed as requiring urgent medical attention had she sought help at the time.A psychiatrist described Sharkey’s account of her secret birth as “an experience of de-realisation”, an intense dissociative experience whereby the sufferer perceives the world as unreal. This account was consistent with Sharkey’s recollection of the event, Eady said.The judge said it was accepted that the defendant’s mental state “substantially impaired your ability to form rational judgment or exercise self-control” and that this had continued after she disposed of her baby’s body.The court heard that Sharkey had suffered from low mood, anxiety and a personality disorder in the two decades since.The judge said Sharkey’s legal responsibility was “diminished, not extinguished” by her mental state and accepted that she was “genuinely remorseful”. She added: “You lived isolated with this terrible and tragic knowledge for a quarter of a century.”Outside court, Det Insp Hannah Friend said the “really tragic” case highlighted the importance of postnatal support. Friend, the head of Cheshire constabulary’s major crime review team, said she hoped the family could now “draw a line under this horrendous matter and that it can bring some peace to people who have been waiting such a long time for answers”.Explore more on these topicsCheshireCrimeEnglandPostnatal depressionMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

But this year, spectators atAintreehad good need for their headwear, as the sun shone at the racecourse for the first time in almost a decade.A crowd of 45,000 people had been predicted, and as temperatures reached 19C on Friday, the Met Office said it was just short of being the warmest Aintree festival this century.A strong breeze meant there was some clutching of hats but it takes more than a bit of wind to bother racegoers.View image in fullscreen‘You save up for this,’ said Chantalle Green, from Liverpool. ‘You want to look good – it’s everything about the day, the getting ready, that makes it.’Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I always wear giant hats,” said Chantalle Green, fromLiverpool, who has been coming to Aintree for two decades and this year brought her 18-year-old daughter. “I think it should be a rule that everyone has to wear big hats.”She had donned a dramatic sculptural black creation which she had hired for the occasion and was delighted to bump into the Guardian, having been featured 13 years ago in a similarly impressive brightly coloured fascinator.Grand National 2025: horse-by-horse guide to all the runnersRead moreIt was an event she would not miss, she said, even though the cost of living crisis was making attending more prohibitive and many people were thinking twice about the tickets.“I’m a single mum.

But I don’t do anything else the rest of the year – this is my best event.”While the venue is home to one of the racing calendar’s biggest meetings, for many attenders it is as much a celebration of the enjoyment of dressing up, of taking pride in looking stylish and the power of a Liverpool institution that goes back nearly two centuries.View image in fullscreen‘It is expensive,’ said Mary-Ann Smith, ‘but you make sacrifices.

On Friday she was found guilty of two charges of breaching the order.Tossici-Bolt was given a conditional discharge and ordered not to commit any additional offences over a two-year period. She was ordered to pay costs of £20,000 towards what the judge said had been the “considerable” resources expended by the local authority, along with £26 towards a victim surcharge fee.A delegation from the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), an office within the US Department of State, met Tossici-Bolt last month during a visit to the UK, along with a US-backed anti-abortion group, which had been supporting her case.In a post on X hours after the conviction on Friday, the DRL said: “We are disappointed with the UK court’s conviction of Livia Tossici-Bolt for violating a designated ‘buffer zone’ at an abortion clinic. Freedom of expression must be protected for all.”Judge Orla Austin said it was beyond reasonable doubt that Tossici-Bolt was engaging in an act of disapproval of abortion services on the days in question. “She lacks insight that her presence could have a detrimental effect on the women attending the clinic, their associates, staff and members of the public,” the judge said.Tossici-Bolt had stood with a sign reading “Here to talk, if you want” facing the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) clinic, which was previously targeted by anti-abortion activists who had gathered nearby before Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council put the order in place.View image in fullscreenLivia Tossici-Bolt outside the Houses of Parliament on 1 April.Photograph: ADF International/PAA Downing Street spokesperson said it was vital that women using abortion services could do so “without being subject to harassment or distress” and that the right to protest did not “give people the right to harass others”.Asked whether there was a problem with free speech in the UK, the spokesperson said Britain had a “very proud tradition of free speech over many centuries, and we remain proud of it today”.The court previously heard evidence from council enforcement officers who said they had asked Tossici-Bolt to leave the area on both days after they received calls from a member of the public and from staff inside the clinic.Tossici-Bolt told one of the officers that she had located herself outside the clinic “because from my experience women come here in a very lonely state”. The order prohibited protests and other direct or indirect activities that could influence users of the abortion clinic and was in place on weekdays until 7pm. She had been asked to leave the area within that period.Austin said Tossici-Bolt could have gone somewhere else given that people who were lonely could be found everywhere. “I accept her beliefs were truly held beliefs. Although it’s accepted this defendant held [anti-abortion] views, it’s important to note this case is not about the rights and wrongs about abortion but about whether the defendant was in breach of the PSPO (public spaces protection order),” she said.The verdict was welcomed by the BPAS, which said the result would protect women and the staff who provided abortion care.The chief executive of BPAS, Heidi Stewart, said: “The clinic in Bournemouth has been subjected to decades of anti-abortion protests which resulted in more than 500 reports of harassment before this local safe access zone was brought into force.“This case was never about global politics but about the simple ability of women to access legal healthcare free from harassment.”During a discussion of costs, the hearing was told that Tossici-Bolt had significant assets and received a grant from the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a registered charity in the UK, backed by a conservative US organisation of the same name.Kuljit Bhogal KC, for the council, said ADF UK had an income of more than £1.3m in the year up to June 2024 and that at least one member of staff had a salary of more than £100,000, according to records filed at Companies House.The Guardian reportedon Wednesday on those filings on how the ADF has been expanding UK operations.Its global subsidiary, ADF International, said it is supporting Tossici-Bolt as she assesses her options in terms of an appeal. Robert Clarke, director of advocacy for ADF International, described the verdict as an “egregious failure of justice”.Explore more on these topicsAbortionWomenHealthWomen's healthFreedom of speechBournemouthnewsShareReuse this content"

Eastern areas of the UK were cooler, owing to easterly winds over the North Sea.The Met Office said: “Temperatures [on Thursday] have been nearer to what we’d expect in July in some inland and western areas, but conversely a chilly easterly breeze has kept many eastern coastal regions much colder.”The average temperature for this time of year is about 12C in England and 10C inScotland.Dan Stroud, a forecaster, said on Thursday: “We’ve got an area of cloud and showery outbreaks of rain moving northwards across south-west England and parts of Wales overnight tonight and into tomorrow.“So that will bring some welcome rain for small parts of the country, but much of the country is looking at another fine and dry spring day tomorrow with a lot of warm sunshine on offer, although still holding on to those cool temperatures near the east coast.“But one thing we are expecting tomorrow is for temperatures to creep up into 23C or maybe the odd isolated 24C, so potentially the warmest day of the year so far.”Earlier in the week, firefighters tackled large blazes in Scotland and Dorset. Stroud said wildfires had erupted after a dry period in March.In Scotland, crews battled a large grass fire at Gartur Moss in Port of Menteith, Stirling. The alarm was raised at about noon on Wednesday and four fire appliances remained at the scene on Thursday morning.The Scottish fire and rescue service said the blaze stretched nearly half a mile. It added that a “very high to extreme” risk of wildfire remained across the country until Monday, and urged the public not to light fires outdoors.Crews extinguished a wildfire near Bonhill in West Dunbartonshire and another in the Kilpatrick Hills near Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire, earlier this week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No injuries were reported.Firefighters responded to two more large wildfires in Dorset overnight on Wednesday.The fires in Upton and Canford were under control by Thursday evening and morning respectively.A spokesperson for Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service said: “Both fires were down to human intervention, but we’ve not yet been able to establish whether that was malicious or accidental. The investigation will remain open for now.”The first broke out at Upton Heath, near Poole, just before 11.45pm on Wednesday, spreading across more than 15 hectares (37 acres). Crews were then called to a blaze at nearby Canford Heath at about 5.30am on Thursday, which covered 2.4 hectares.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherWildfiresScotlandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Over two years, the jump is nearly 27%, or approaching £3 more a kilo, based on the pre-promotion price across Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons.The price of hot cross buns has also crept up, with supermarkets charging an average of £1.71 for a four-pack of premium “extra fruity” buns, which is 19p, or 12%, more than last year.View image in fullscreenThe price of hot cross buns has risen.Photograph: zi3000/Getty Images/iStockphotoTucking into chocolate eggs is an integral part of the annual festivities, and last year Britons spent more than £255m on Easter eggs, according to the data company Kantar. However, this year consumers are often being asked to pay more for a smaller egg.When pack sizes are reduced and prices stay the same, or even go up, it is called “shrinkflation”. Some chocolate eggs from big names such asCadburyand Mars have increased prices bymore than 50%per 100g, according to research by the consumer group Which?.At Tesco, Which? found a Twix white chocolate Easter egg had increased from £5 to £6 in the run-up to Easter, and had shrunk from 316g in 2024 to 258g, meaning the unit price (per 100g) had gone up by 47%.Eagle-eyed shoppers havespotted that a Terry’sChocolateOrange has diminished in size, down from 157g to 145g. A Terry’s spokesperson blamed the decision on “sky-high cocoa prices due to massive cocoa shortages. We’ve put off making any changes for as long as we could, but … we’ve had to make adjustments to the weight of the balls,” they said.Even Cadbury Mini Eggs now have a maxi price tag. At £1.80, an 80g pack costs 30p more than last year. In 2023 the average price was £1.25, according to the market research company Assosia. The increase is particularly noticeable on larger packs, with a family sharing bag hovering around the £5 mark.“Shrinkflation is becoming more common as manufacturers try to offset rising production costs,” said Richard Price, a grocery analyst at Britsuperstore. “Brands often choose to reduce portion sizes to maintain affordability while keeping their pricing competitive. Unfortunately, this means consumers are getting less for their money.”The most recent officialcost of living datashowed UK food prices rose 3.1% in the 12 months to February but a breakdown revealed some big increases. The prices of lamb and chocolate were up by 16%. Meanwhile, Easter baking ingredients such as butter and eggs climbed nearly 19% and 5% respectively.Chocolate has become more expensive because of poor harvests in westAfrica, in particular Ghana and Ivory Coast, where more than half of the world’s cocoa beans are harvested. After hitting an all-time high of £10,137 a tonne last year, cocoa bean market prices had then fallen back but have recently marched higher, reaching £6,200 a tonne in late March.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The report by the supply chain company Inverto said the cost of elements such as beef, potatoes and cabbage was up sharply since 2020.The dinner’s centrepiece, lamb, has also risen in price, with supplies tight. The British Retail Consortium economist Harvir Dhillon pointed to shortages, with the number of lambs slaughtered falling in 2022 and 2023. “In addition to this, demand was fairly strong, with consumers slightly less price sensitive and able to spend more on more expensive meat options.”The price of unsalted butter is nearly 28% up on this time last year at £6,250 a tonne, and goes some way to explaining higher prices on supermarket shelves. It is being driven up by several factors, including tight stocks and higher Irish butter prices. “The UK is a net importer of butter and heavily relies on Irish butter,” said Jose Saiz, a dairy market analyst at the research firm Expana. “Thus, expensive Irish butter prices have had a knock-on effect on UK prices.”Explore more on these topicsEasterFood & drink industryRetail industrySupermarketsFoodChocolatenewsShareReuse this content"

The project also faced local concerns over its impact on tourism.Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said: “The UK has a boundlesssupply of windthat cannot be turned on and off at the whims of dictators and petrostates. It’s time to get off the fossil fuel rollercoaster, roll out clean power, protect our energy security and bring down bills for good.”The green light for Rampion 2 means the current government has now approved enough new clean energy projects to power 1.8m British households since it came to power in July last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The inundation is larger than France and Germany combined – and is even bigger than Texas.The seemingly endless plains of outbackQueenslandare so vast and remote as to boggle any attempts to visualise the scale of what is being described as one of the most devastating floods in living memory.The Bureau of Meteorology said on Friday that the flooding had “severely impacted” more catchments spanning about 1m sq km since prolonged downpours began drenching south-west and central Queensland on 23 March.To put that in perspective, Tasmania is 15 times smaller (64,519 sq km or 24,911 sq miles); the land area of the United Kingdom is 241,930 sq km, and Texas is 695,662 sq km.View image in fullscreenHomes under flood waters in the town of Windorah in central-west Queensland.Photograph: Queensland Fire Department/AFP/Getty ImagesThe flooded area is more than four times the size of Victoria (227,038 sq km) and bigger than New South Wales (801,137 sq km). It is about the same size as Egypt and about half the size of Saudi Arabia or Mexico.If the flooding were a country, it would be the 31st largest on Earth.The bureau said many stations across the Queensland and New South Wales interior had broken their March or annual rainfall records.“In four days (from 23 to 26 March) parts of southern and south-western Queensland had more than their annual average rainfall,” a BoM spokesperson said.“Widespread major flooding continues for parts of Queensland and far northern New South Wales [and] this is likely to continue for many weeks as flood waters slowly move downstream.“Flood water will drain slowly towards Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre through the south-west Queensland catchments, with a clearer picture of what may eventuate as flood peaks begin to move downstream.”A comparison of the size of the flood watersTiny, far-flung towns have been evacuated – in some, such as Adavale, every resident has departed. Others will remain cut off for weeks, despite the heavy rain having passed, as the deluge slowly makes way through flat and sodden country via slow moving rivers.Along with the loss of property and damage to homes, farmers were bracing for the slowly receding water to reveal the extent of agricultural devastation.The premier, David Crisafulli, told the Queensland parliament on Thursday afternoon that the number of livestock lost to flood water had gone past 150,000.“I do believe that, sadly, that number will continue to rise in days ahead,” Crisafulli said.The premier said 4,552km of fencing had been destroyed.Speaking from Longreachearlier in the week, he said of particular concern was the loss of exclusion fencing that protected stock from canine depredation, which had been rolled out over recent decades and was crucial to the survival of the sheep industry.1:19Outback Queensland inundated by worst flooding in 50 years – videoRoyal Flying Doctors Service base support manager in Charleville, Liane Spencer, said communities like Yowah had been cut off from health care for weeks and were relying on helicopters to drop off medication – as well as food and fodder – and to extract people who needed medical attention.That lack of primary health care could have “really major impacts” on the largely elderly communities with some “very complex medical situations,” she said. In addition to the physical challenges, Spencer said there would be “a lot of very sad people around the country”.“There’s been so many homes inundated, they’ve basically had to walk off with just clothes on their back – leave their pets and leave their stock – and then come back to the unknown,” she said.One Australian’s dramatic rescue from a flood in one of the driest places on EarthRead more“And they’re coming back and finding dead kangaroos in their garden, dead pigs in their chook pens and then, once they can get out and about a little bit, just seeing the impact that it has had on their own livestock … that has ramifications.“Some property owners just can’t come back from that – so there will be a lot of mental health issues ongoing for a long time.”Dr Piet Filet from Griffith University’s Australian Rivers Institute said that some stock that survived the flood waters would be battling heavy clays and thick mud and would be at risk of sickness.View image in fullscreenRescue workers arriving to give residents lifejackets in flood waters near the town of Adavale in south-west Queensland.Photograph: Queensland Fire Department/AFP/Getty ImagesBut Filet said the vast inundation would also replenish parched soils, recharge the groundwater systems upon which outback communities and industries are dependent for drinking and agricultural water and bring ephemeral ecosystems bursting into life.“Flooding is the natural process through which our soil fertility is maintained,” he said.“There are places out there that hadn’t seen rain for two to three years.“This is the pulse of western Queensland.”Explore more on these topicsQueenslandAustralia weatherExtreme weatherFloodingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Among other things, the wetlands play a key role in offering the area a measure of protection from hurricanes.The jury found that the oil brand Texaco, which is owned byChevron, violated state regulations surrounding coastal resources by contributing to the disappearing coastline through dredging canals, drilling wells and dumping massive amounts of wastewater into the marsh.Oil giant Chevron to lay off thousands in bid to cut up to 20% of global workforceRead moreThe verdict could prompt other companies to settle the other separate but similar lawsuits. Nonetheless, Chevron’s attorney, Mike Phillips, said that the oil company intends to appeal the verdict.According tothe US Geological Survey, Louisiana’s coastal wetlands are among the most critically endangered environments across the country as they experience more wetland loss than all other states in the continental US combined.From 1932 to 2016, coastalLouisianaexperienced a net change in land area of approximately -4,833 square kilometers, marking a decrease of approximately 25% of the land area at the beginning of that time period.The canals used to create transportation routes for oil and gas rigs have over the years impeded natural water flow across the wetland ecosystems,according tothe Lowlander Center. Additionally, the canals create straight avenues which allow surging ocean waters to bypass the bayous and instead head directly inland during severe weather events.According to a 1978 Louisiana management law, sites used by oil companies must “be cleared, revegetated, detoxified, and otherwise restored as near as practicable to their original condition” after the companies’ projects end, the Associated Pressreports.The south-eastern Louisiana community of Plaquemines parish filed the lawsuit against Chevron in 2013, asking for $2.6bn in damages at the time. The parish has an additional 20 pending cases against other oil companies.The jury awarded various compensations to Plaquemines on Friday, including $575m for land loss, $161m for contamination – as well as $8.6 million for abandoned equipment.Speaking to jurors, Jimmy Faircloth Jr, an attorney representing the state of Louisiana, said that Chevron had said that Plaquemines Parish was not worth preserving, the Associated Press reported.“Our communities are built on coast, our families raised on coast, our children go to school on coast,” he said. He added: “The state of Louisiana will not surrender the coast. It’s for the good of the state that the coast be maintained.”According tothe state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, Louisiana could lose up to another 3,000 square miles in the next 50 years.Phillips said that Chevron was “not the cause of the land loss occurring” in Plaquemines. He said that the law does not apply to “conduct that occurred decades before the law was enacted”.Phillips called the ruling “unjust,” contending that there were “numerous legal errors.”Explore more on these topicsLouisianaChevronFossil fuelsPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

He claims the policy – a blanket 10% tariff from Saturday, with higher rates for specific markets from next week – will bring US manufacturing jobs back to the US and raise trillions of dollars for the federal government. Many economists have cautioned it will trigger economic chaos, and likely raise prices.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that the move may well knock the global economy. Kristalina Georgieva, its managing director, , said: “We are still assessing the macroeconomic implications of the announced tariff measures, but they clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth.”People in the US: how have your shopping habits changed due to Trump’s tariffs?Read moreShortly before Wall Street opened on Friday, Trump claimed China had “panicked” by announcing new retaliatory tariffs on US imports. “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” he wrote on Truth Social.China’s industry associations have unanimouslycondemned the tariffs. The country’s National Textile and Apparel Council said it “supported the government’s forceful measures” and that the US had “damaged the resilience of the global textile industry’s supply chain”.The S&P 500 fell 4.4% in early trading, exacerbating a decline that began in February. The index, which tracks 500 of the leading US companies, is now down almost 14% from its peak.Shares in the US bank sector had fallen nearly 6% on Friday, reflecting fears that the trade war could trigger a recession. It could also be an indicator that investors are expecting faster interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, in order to instigate growth.Crude oil prices also plunged by 8% on Friday, heading for their lowest point since the middle of the pandemic in 2021.Trump personally selected the controversial formula for determining what tariffs would be imposed on specific countries from a menu of options, according to theWashington Post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sources told the Post that more sophisticated approaches had been developed.Trump reportedly didn’t decide on the final plan until around 1pm Wednesday – less than three hours ahead of his Rose Garden address announcing the tariffs. It is unclear who authored the formula Trump ultimately picked.Trump tariffs: ‘In economic terms, it makes no sense at all’Read moreThe US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, told reporters that themarkets “will adjust”to the sweeping tariffs imposed by Trump. “The markets are reacting to a dramatic change in the global order in terms of trade … As long as they know what the rules are going to be moving forward … the markets will adjust.”Many Democrats have expressed frustration with the early impacts of the tariffs on theUS economy. JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, wrote on X: “The biggest tax hike in American history. Donald Trump’s tariffs are throwing the economy into the tank.”California senator Alex Padilla wrote: “I’m not enraged by the stock market crashing because I’m sympathetic towards traders on Wall Street.

Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson all dissented.In the unsigned opinion, the court said that the states made it clear “that they have the financial wherewithal to keep their programs running”, but theTrump administrationhad a strong case that it would not be able to reclaim any of the funds spent while the lower court’s order remained in place.The cuts to more than 100 programs had been temporarily blocked by a federal judge inBoston, who found that they were already affecting training programs aimed at addressing a nationwide teacher shortage. The federal appeals court in Boston turned away an appeal from the administration to allow them to resume.The emergency appeal is among several the high court is considering in which the justice department argues that lower-court judges have improperly obstructedDonald Trump’s agenda.Friday’s order was the first time in three attempts that the nation’s highest court gave the administration what it wanted on an emergency basis.US district judge Myong Joun issued a temporary restraining order sought by eight Democratic-led states that argued the cuts were probably driven by efforts from Trump’s administration to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs.The Republican president also hassigned an executive ordercalling for the dismantling of the education department, and his administration has already started overhauling much of its work, including cutting dozens of contracts it dismissed as “woke” and wasteful.The two programs at issue – the Teacher Quality Partnership and Supporting Effective Educator Development – provide more than $600m in grants for teacher preparation programs, often in subject areas such as math, science and special education, the states have argued. They said data has shown the programs had led to increased teacher retention rates and ensured that educators remain in the profession beyond five years.Despite Joun’s finding that the programs already were being affected, the high court’s conservative majority wrote that the states can keep the programs running with their own money for now. By contrast, the majority said in an unsigned opinion, the federal government probably wouldn’t be able to recover the cash if it ultimately wins the lawsuit.Kagan wrote in dissent that there was no reason for the court’s emergency intervention.“Nowhere in its papers does the Government defend the legality of canceling the education grants at issue here,” Kagan wrote.In a separate opinion, Brown Jackson wrote: “It is beyond puzzling that a majority of Justices conceive of the government’s application as an emergency.”The administration halted the programs without notice in February. Joun, an appointee of Democratic president Joe Biden, found that the cancellations probably violated a federal law that requires a clear explanation.The appellate panel that rejected the administration’s request for a stay also was made up of judges appointed by Democrats.California is leading the ongoing lawsuit, joined by Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin.Boston public schools have already had to fire several full-time employees due to the loss of grant funding, and the College of New Jersey has also canceled the rest of its teacher-residency program. California State University has ended support for two dozen students in a similar program, and eliminated financial assistance for 50 incoming students.Explore more on these topicsUS supreme courtTrump administrationUS educationUS politicsBostonSchoolsLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

I will always pray for our beloved Republic of Korea and its citizens.”While anti-Yoon protesters celebrated the court’s decision – many of them in tears – media reports said some of his supporters had starting damaging police vehicles near the court building.View image in fullscreenImpeached South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol at an earlier hearing in SeoulPhotograph: Kim Hong-Ji/APIn the court ruling, broadcast live, the acting chief justice, Moon Hyung-bae, said the decision had been unanimous. “We hereby pronounce the following ruling, with the unanimous agreement of all Justices.“(We) dismiss respondent PresidentYoon Suk Yeol.”As crowds outside hung onto his every word, Moon said Yoon had violated his duty as president by taking actions that were beyond the powers granted to him under the constitution. Yoon’s actions, he added, had constituted a serious challenge to democracy.“(Yoon) committed a grave betrayal of the trust of the people, who are the sovereign members of the democratic republic,” Moon said, adding by declaring martial law, Yoon had created chaos in all areas of society, the economy and foreign policy.Moon said: “The defendant not only declared martial law, but also violated the constitution and laws by mobilizing military and police forces to obstruct the exercise of legislative authority. Ultimately, the declaration of martial law in this case violated the substantive requirements for emergency martial law.“Given the grave negative impact on constitutional order and the significant ripple effects of the defendant’s violations, we find that the benefits of upholding the constitution by removing the defendant from office far outweigh the national losses from the removal of a president.”Yoon, who was not in court for the ruling, cannot appeal and must now turn his attention to a separate criminal trial – linked to his martial law declaration – on charges of insurrection.His ruling party said it “solemnly accepts” the constitutional court’s decision. “It is regrettable, but the People Power party solemnly accepts and humbly respects the constitutional court’s decision,” lawmaker Kwon Young-se said. “We extend our sincere apologies to the people.”One of Yoon’s lawyers, Yoon Kap-keun, remained defiant, however, describing the judgement as “completely incomprehensible” and a “purely political decision”.The long-awaited decision on Yoon’s late-night order to impose martial law in early December has exposed deep divisions in South Korean society and alarmed the US and other allies.His opponents and supporters have held large rallies in recent days, although an unprecedented police presence meant protesters were unable to access the immediate vicinity of the court building on Friday. Reports said that 14,000 police officers had been deployed in the capital in anticipation of possible violence, irrespective of which way the court ruled.Yoon’s supporters and lawyers argued that the impeachment proceedings were illegal and that he should be immediately returned to office, three years after the conservative populist was voted to lead Asia’s fourth-biggest economy.A Gallup Korea poll released last week showed 60% of South Koreans said he should be permanently removed from office. His opponents have accused the former prosecutor of abusing his presidential powers in an attempt to suspend democratic institutions and take the country back into its dark authoritarian past.The opposition-controlled national assembly voted to impeach Yoon in mid-December, a fortnight after he imposed martial law in an attempt, he claimed, to prevent “anti-state” opposition forces with North Korean sympathies from destroying the country.Yoon was forced to lift the edict after only six hours, however, after lawmakers defied efforts by security forces to seal off parliament and voted to reject it. Yoon has claimed he never intended to fully impose emergency military rule and has tried to downplay the chaos, pointing out that no one was killed or injured.Yoon became the second South Korean president to be removed from office through impeachment after Park Geun-hye in 2017. If found guilty in his criminal trial, he faces life imprisonment or the death penalty, although South Korea has not carried out an execution since the late 1990s.Explore more on these topicsYoon Suk YeolSouth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The plaintiffs were able to sue because of aCalifornialaw that took effect in 2020 and suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sex abuse victims to bring cases for three years.Many of the claims involved the MacLaren children’s center, which was closed in 2003. The facility, which was intended to be a safe space for children awaiting placement in foster homes, opened in 1961 and was overseen by probation officials until it was placed under the county’s department of children and family services in 1976.One man said he was sexually abused by a physician at the facility when he was eight years old, while another said he was assaulted by a male staff member in a bathroom when he was five. Children were routinely placed in solitary confinement, drugged and restrained in chairs at the facility, according to court papers filed by plaintiffs.“It is bittersweet for the survivors, because nothing is ever going to take away what was done to them, and how badly their lives were altered and how much they have suffered,” said Adam Slater, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys. “However, the settlement hopefully gives them some measure of justice and provides them with some measure of closure.”The agreement by Los Angeles county would surpass the Boy Scouts of America’s 2022 settlement for $2.6bn with more than 80,000 men who said they were molested as children by Scout leaders and others. At the time, that was considered the largest aggregate sexual abuse settlement in US history.Last year, the archdiocese of Los Angeles agreed to pay $800m to victims of clergy sexual abuse, bringing the total payout to more than $1.5bn.Disclosure of the tentative payout comes at a time when the nation’s largest county – home to about 10 million residents – is facing a tightening bind of financial obligations on its $49bn annual budget. County officials fear hundreds of millions of dollars for public services could vanish in Trump administration cutbacks, while the county has seen additional costs from January’s historic wildfires as it also deals with an ongoing homeless crisis.Davenport recently said the county is facing a “large amount of uncertainty” with its budget – some agencies are largely funded by federal dollars.The proposed agreement includes creating a countywide hotline for reporting child sexual abuse allegations against county employees and developing a system to expedite investigations, county officials said.“By balancing justice for the victims with a commitment to reform, this resolution ensures both acknowledgment of past wrongs and a pathway to a safer, more accountable future,” Patrick McNicholas, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, said in a statement.The county’s claims board will consider the proposed settlement on Monday. If approved, it would be considered by the board of supervisors on 29 April.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Black ravens lift sullenly from their feast as cars speed past.Some think this sort of roadkill is how Valerie, the miniature dachshund that has beenmissing for more than 500 days, has survived since running away from her owners. It’s hard to picture the 4kg, adorable, goofy-eared, big-eyed sausage dog choosing this particular meal, but that’s a prevailing theory.“Apparently, this thing’s running up and down the north coast. I think it’s old enough to vote now,” local councillor Sam Mumford says. “I can’t believe the damn thing’s still alive … there’s obviously enough roadkill to keep it going.“But it’s not fair on the dog. Best thing would be if they find it and catch it.”View image in fullscreenStokes Bay, the area where Valerie went missing.Photograph: Jack Schofield/The GuardianPeople have been trying to find Valerie since she went missing in November 2023. Her owners, NSW couple Josh Fishlock and Georgia Gardner, were visiting Stokes Bay, home to one ofAustralia’s best beachesbut also farmland and dense scrub. She fled, and the pair searched for her with the help of locals but to no avail.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterThen, in March, reports began coming in that Valerie had been spotted. One picture appears to show the dog’s oversized ears poking above some paddock stubble.KangalaWildlifeRescue volunteers have been using surveillance, traps and lures to try to find Valerie. They captured a video of her capering about, apparently healthy, but she remains at large.View image in fullscreenJosh Fishlock and Georgia Gardner with Valerie before she went missing.Photograph: Courtesy of Georgia GardnerOn Wednesday, a donor gave Kangala a portable Starlink unit to connect their cameras. “We are flying,” the group wrote on Facebook. Kangala has been almost as elusive as Valerie herself when contacted for comment, but, on Thursday, the groupreported another apparent sightingand published a picture it claimed was of Valerie. The group said the dachshund had been “enjoying all the yummy treats on offer after an anxious wait [of four days with no sightings]”.“Seeing that long body and wiggly bum was just the boost everyone needed,” Kangala wrote.View image in fullscreenKangala Wildlife Rescue have posted another image it claims is of Valerie.Photograph: Kangala Wildlife RescueGardner remains optimistic that her “little princess”, who loves puppuccinos and chicken, will be found. “They’ve narrowed down the area that she’s in, and they’ve seen her on their cameras, so they’re looking forward … to trapping her,” she says.Gardner says she and Fishlock are trying to stay patient and hope to get over to the island as soon as she’s found.But not everyone is as upbeat about a pup’s chances on the vast, rugged land.Good news story – or too good to be true?The locals like to point out their island is six times bigger than Singapore. It’s also much wilder – a place where a couple can walk alone on a pristine beach, whales visit, trees grow bent over from the wind, andbushfires occasionally raze the land.While fancy facilities – a lodge, wineries, restaurants and distilleries – are peppered around the 4,400sqm island, much of it remains untamed, remote.So the residents are somewhat bemused at the way Valerie’s story has spread around the world. The New York Times reported onthe elusive dog, which is still apparently wearing her pink collar. In the UK, the Times wrote of herdodging snakes and eagles, and the Independent commented on her “remarkable resilience”.View image in fullscreenKangaroo Island local Louise Custance is helping search for Valerie.Photograph: Jack Schofield/The GuardianValerie has been painted as a lucky rascal and an unexpected hero in tough times, with a story that has people in far-flung places cheering her on.“Kangaroo Island is known for many things … dogs that survive for 500 days is not what you expect,” resident and animal lover Louise Custance says.“I think people just want to have a good news story; otherwise, everything’s so sad. The last global headline that Kangaroo Island made was the [2020] fires.”Custance believes Valerie “decided that she didn’t want to go back to the city. She liked the island lifestyle, and she’s probably had some support from farm animals or wildlife to stay alive … to find water”.Others doubt the roadkill story. As Valerie’s mythical status grows, so do the theories. Was she stolen and then just escaped? Should she be saved, or should the native wildlife be saved from her? Can a dog that has apparently been living wild for so long ever be happily reunited with its owner?View image in fullscreenSome believe the black dot circled is Valerie.Photograph: Courtesy of Georgia GardnerSeveral people with long years of experience on the island say there will be no happy ending.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ubiquitous roos and their smaller cousin, the wallaby. Bandicoots, possums, snakes, and a menagerie of birds. Others read like a roll call of Australiana: koalas, echidnas and platypuses. And endangered species such asthe KI dunnarts.The natives face threats, including the much-hated feral cats. Some see Valerie as another feral invader.A changed dogThe America Kennel Club describes the dachshund as curious, friendly and spunky with a “famously long, low silhouette, ever-alert expression, and bold, vivacious personality”.But it also says it’s an “independent hunter of dangerous prey … brave to the point of rashness, and a bit stubborn”.“If it was a larger breed of dog, people would be up in arms trying to hunt it down,” local Ronnie Kreher says.“They’re good hunters, those little critters; they’re fearless. The cute story of it cruising around living off roadkill is pretty unlikely.“So it might be just as bad as the cats … the best case scenario is it’s actually hunting cats.”Where is Valerie?! Have you seen this intrepid yet mysterious miniature dachshund? | First Dog on the MoonRead moreAt the Queenscliffe Family hotel in Kingscote, Carrie Higson is sceptical about Valerie’s survival chances.“There’s plenty of roadkill, but it would be surprising that she’d last that long. When dogs go missing, they either get stolen or run over.”Andrew “Aphid” Heinrich says he hopes Valerie is found and returned, and he speculates that it’s the sort of amusing story people just like.Others agree that it’s a story of hope in a tumultuous world, but they worry it’s a false hope, soon to be dashed.View image in fullscreenRonnie Kreher, who lives on Kangaroo Island, is also helping in the search.Photograph: Jack Schofield/The GuardianProf Paul McGreevy, of the University of Sydney’s veterinary school, says he’s not surprised that Valerie’s “still chugging around”, likely living off carrion and other animals’ poo. Nor is he surprised that she seems to be avoiding the humans who would end her island adventure.“If I was the shape of a dachshund, with a predisposition to a bad back … they get scooped up a lot and often have awful back pain. No wonder it’s telling everyone to fuck off,” he says.When asked about how domestic dogs might go feral, he says it depends on whether Valerie has been frightened by people trying to grab her. “Chances are she’s more resourceful, and she may have learned some phobia of humans,” he says.“She’s not the same dog that the owners last saw, that’s for sure.”Explore more on these topicsKangaroo IslandSouth AustraliaDogsInvasive speciesAnimalsConservationWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Paros, people saw cars, motorcycles and beachside restaurant furniture hurtling into the sea as torrential rain flooded shops and homes and turned streets into debris-filled streams. The picturesque port of Naoussa was transformed into a “lake of mud”, local people said, with the sea and land “becoming one”. Large parts of the road network were devastated.View image in fullscreenA flooded road in Naoussa on Monday.Photograph: Stathis Roussos/HappyFrameFlights/ReutersIn Mykonos, another hotspot expected to attract thousands of visitors at Easter, hailstorms triggered landslides, with muddy flood waters cascading through its white-washed alleys. Civil protection services urged residents to restrict their movements and stay indoors. In Crete’s port town of Chania, officials spoke of “biblical destruction” as images of flooded streets, hospitals and courthouses also emerged.Schools on several islands were closed, and inhabitants were still picking their way through silt-strewn streets on Thursday.Meteorologists said more rain was dumped on Paros over the course of a couple of hours on Tuesday than would normally fall in an entire month. “It’s incredible, really, that there were no casualties,” said one official.Climate breakdown is causing extreme rainfall to become more common and more intense across most of the world, and flooding has most probably become more frequent and severe in these locations as a result.But the devastation at tourist destinations that, thanks to the rise in global travel, increasinglydraw record numbershas also highlighted Greece’s lack of preparedness in dealing with natural disasters.Critics have singled out the absence of proper flood management systems, as well as unregulated development on the Aegean islands, which have attracted ever more visitors seeking villas, swimming pools and other high-end services.“Yes, the rainfall was intense but what turned it into a disaster wasn’t just nature; it was the result of decades of unsustainable construction,” wrote the Greek environmentalist and former MEP Kriton Arsenis.“Paros has been overbuilt at a dramatic pace. In the past five years alone, it has topped the Cyclades in new building permits, surpassing even Mykonos and Santorini. Villas, hotels, roads and swimming pools have replaced the dry-stone terraces that once held water, slowed down runoff and kept the soil alive.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They simply accelerate it – pushing it downhill with force, until it floods homes, or is lost to the sea.”It was critical, he said, that a way was found in such heavily built environments to absorb, store and release rainwater slowly. “This wasn’t just a flood. It was a failure of planning … [and] this same story is unfolding all along the Mediterranean coast.”At a time when anger over the impoverished state of public services has also prompted some of thelargest protestsin years – with hundreds of thousands of Greeks taking to the streets in fury on the second anniversary of the Tempe rail disaster – others bemoaned the lack of state funding on islands whose populations dwindled drastically in winter.“Not enough money, clearly, is put into civil protection,” said Mykonos’s former mayor Konstantinos Koukas. “To fix that, funds have to stop being allocated based on the permanent population of a place. It’s why we have the scenes we see today, clearing up after a storm when Easter is just a few weeks away.”The prominent commentator Nikos Syrigos, who hails from the Cycladic isle of Syros, said that despite tourism being the engine of Greece’s economy, the underdevelopment of its islands meant destinations that were “giants in the summer” became “dwarfs in the winter”.“Streets that have been turned into streams [by this storm] will be turned into them again,” he said this week. “Unfortunately, the Cyclades have remained years behind when it comes to infrastructure and are completely ill-prepared to withstand any intense [weather] phenomenon, much less any that is extreme.”Explore more on these topicsGreeceFloodingExtreme weatherEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In 2019, he settledin a 17th-century farmhouse in the Pays d’Auge countryside, south of Deauville, Normandy.The 2020 lockdown led him to produce a continuous 90-metre frieze of iPad paintings inspiredby the Bayeux tapestrynearby. Entitled A Year in Normandie, it is again on show in Paris this week.View image in fullscreenHockney is a significant contributor to the pop art movement of the 1960s.Photograph: David Hockney, Jean-Pierre Gonçalves de LimaView image in fullscreenMr and Mrs Clark and Percy, 1970.Photograph: David Hockney, ©Richard SchmidtView image in fullscreenChristopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy, 1968.Photograph: David Hockney, ©Fabrice GibertView image in fullscreenApple Tree, 2019.Photograph: David Hockney, ©Richard SchmidtView image in fullscreenA Bigger Grand Canyon, 1998.Photograph: David Hockney, Courtesy National Gallery of AustraliaView image in fullscreenInterior of the Fondation Louis Vuitton building designed by Frank Gehry.Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty ImagesThe move coincided with renewed French interest in the British artist after a large retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in 2017, followed by shows at the Galerie Lelong and the Orangerie museum inParis, the Musée Granet in Aix-en-Provence, the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen and the Matisse museum in Nice.“France and Hockney became a mutual love affair,” said Catherine Cusset, a French author whose 2018 “biographical novel”, Life ofDavid Hockney, is being reissued in an illustrated version this week. “I think he felt at home here: he enjoys good food and good wine, and the French are more tolerant than England or California when it comes to his other big passion – smoking.”Cusset explained her country’s view of the British artist: “The great appeal of Hockney’s paintings is that they are easy to understand. This was sometimes a criticism. InFrance, though, Hockney found a tradition of other painters giving an enchanting view of the world: Matisse, Bonnard, and his neighbour in Normandy, Claude Monet.”View image in fullscreenPortrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), 1972.Photograph: Jenni Carter/David Hockney, ©Art Gallery of New South WalesYet an exhibition of the size and scale of David Hockney 25 can only in part be explained by mutual admiration. For the show, Fondation Louis Vuitton is loaning works from museums around the world – signature paintings such as A Bigger Splash and Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy from the Tate, and the panoramic A Bigger Grand Canyon from the National Gallery of Australia – creating transport and insurance costs that would be hard for other institutions to shoulder.The Gehry-designed private museum, sponsored by the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH and headed by one of the world’s richest people, Bernard Arnault, opened in Bois de Boulogne in 2014.“When the Fondation Louis Vuitton hosts a show these days, there is almost no competition”, said Thaddaeus Ropac, an Austrian gallerist. The museum’s most successful show to date, 2016-17’s Icons of ModernArt, drew 1.3 million visitors.View image in fullscreenOne of a series of Hockney’s iPad artworks from 2020.Photograph: David HockneyThe opening of Fondation Louis Vuitton kickstarted a proliferation of similar private exhibition sites, such as the Bourse de Commerce – Pinault Collection, by the billionaire founder of luxury group Kering, François Pinault, which opened in 2021. The Fondation Cartier is setting up a large contemporary art space on the historic Place du Palais-Royal in Paris, right across from the Louvre, that will open to the public in autumn.“Paris has developed in a way I used to think was not possible”, said Ropac, who has galleries in Paris and London and commutes between the two European capitals. “We haven’t seen such a concentration of new museums anywhere else inEurope, or even in the US recently.”Britain remains the largest market for art in Europe by some distance: according to the 2024Art Basel & UBS art market report, France’s estimated share of the previous year’s global art sales was 7% compared with Britain’s 17. But the trend and the ambition are with the French capital.“Paris used to be the art capital of the world in the early 20th century,” said Clément Delépine, the director of Art Basel Paris. “Then we lost that status to London and New York. Now there’s a shared assumption that we can collectively reposition our city.”Explore more on these topicsDavid HockneyPaintingParisFranceArtEuropeFrank GehryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We go behind the scenes to hear about millions of Severance and White Lotus fans, wild freebies – and accusations of racismAmelia TaitFri 4 Apr 2025 10.45 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 11.34 EDTShareThey say that ancient civilisations celebrated significant televisual events by gathering around a plastic watering hole in a building known as an “office”. These so-called “water-cooler moments” were characterised by buzzy chatter, as colleagues chewed over what they’d seen on TV the night before. “Who shot JR?” they asked. “You can’t killeveryoneat a wedding!” they cried. Tissues were passed around because “She got off the plane!.”Today, there are too many streaming apps and too few days in the office for people to catch up in quite the same way. Instead, online forums dedicated to dissecting TV episodes are thriving: on Reddit, more than 776,000 people have joined a subreddit aboutThe White Lotus, while 765,000 discuss everything that happens in Ben Stiller’s dystopian workplace thrillerSeverance. Like colleagues around a cooler, people praise their favourite characters and share theories about what will happen next. Unlike colleagues around a cooler, they also accuse each other of being stupid, bigoted and perverted.There’s no HR here, so who supervises almost a million people as they contribute their opinions – ensuring they stick to strict subreddit rules ranging from “no spoilers” to “no politics”? The answer – a lot of the time – is: Will Smith.No, not that one. Will Smith is a 38-year-old from North Carolina who works for an airline. In his spare time, he also moderates 22 subreddits, including ones for House of the Dragon, The Boys, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, Severance andThe White Lotus. “If I’m moderating it, it’s because I like the show or the movie,” Smith says. “I just want a place to be able to hang out with other nerds and talk about stuff while being respectful to one another.”View image in fullscreenSource of controversy … Miss Huang (Sarah Bock) in Severance.Photograph: Jon Pack/AppleA single episode ofSeverancecan inspire up to 40,000 comments, so Smith spends three to four hours a day moderating. “Some nights we are getting 10m visits on [the Severance] sub and we have six moderators,” Smith says. An auto-moderating bot flags banned terms (such as hate speech, slurs and explicit content) and these comments are placed in a queue that Smith works through as soon as he wakes up. If one user in particular regularly gets flagged, moderators might issue a temporary or permanent ban. People can also get kicked out for spamming. Recently, a user was banned from the Severance subreddit for claiming to have read a leaked script and repeatedly insisting that the cis male protagonist was pregnant.Both The White Lotus and Severance are shows filled to the brim withsymbolism, foreshadowing andhidden Easter eggs, which means a large number of posts on these subreddits are theories. They range from thejaw-droppingly perceptiveto the downright daft. “People get so attached to characters or theories that they want their take to be the correct one, and sometimes that means everyone else has to be wrong,” Smith says. “It’s like having a favourite sports team.”In March, users of the Severance subreddit accused each other of racism. In Severance season two, a new character, Miss Huang, was introduced. Some theorised that she must be the daughter of another character, Gemma Scout, while otherspointed out that“there is no logic or any kind of evidence behind this ‘theory’ other than the fact that both characters are Asian”. In the latest series of The White Lotus, a matriarch butchers the Thai language before briefly speaking it confidently – some claimed she was secretly fluent and actual Thai speakers had to disabuse them of this notion. “Please stop telling Thai speakers they do not know their own language,”one user wrote.During season one of Severance, there was a sense of camaraderie. Now, debates can become more contentiousModerators allow users to have these heated discussions, but have to act when things become uncivil. “Folks can argue back and forth respectfully and the comments and threads can remain up, but once they devolve into personal insults the mods step in,” Smith says. “We like to live by the rule that attacking the post or theory is fine but attacking the person crosses the line.”One of Smith’s fellow mods on the Severance and The White Lotus subreddits is a 45-year-old pharmacy worker from Indiana who asked to be identified only by the initials MC. “As someone who is multiracial with a mother from Japan, the Miss Huang conversation was difficult to navigate,” she says. “Part of being a mod is ensuring my personal feelings don’t cloud my judgment when reviewing the sub, and sometimes you have to let the conversation happen so it won’t crop up again later.”Meanwhile: is it sexist to dislike Severance season two, episode eight because of its reveal about a super-smart female character? Should you be locked up if you’re not sufficiently troubled by the age-gap relationship in The White Lotus season three, episode five? “You can talk about how you think thecharacterin a show is a paedophile,” says Smith. “But if somebody comes through and is like, ‘They’re both of legal age, it doesn’t bother me,’ and somebody replies, ‘Well, you’re a paedophile too then!’, then no.” The debates that crop up are often unpredictable. “You can’t just make rules on day one and think these are going to take care of everything.”For example, The White Lotus subreddit has a “no politics” rule, but this was essentially unenforceable after characters discussed voting for Donald Trump in a recent episode. “I think in those scenarios you have to be flexible with the rules,” Smith says. Moderators try not to alter the rules while a season is still airing, instead taking notes of issues that repeatedly crop up so they can make changes between seasons.View image in fullscreenRadar, Irving’s dog in Severance.Photograph: AppleOf course, TV dramas begetting online drama is not the whole story.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion“I love that we’re an outlet for people who don’t have anyone in real life to talk about their favourite TV shows,” says MC. Moderating is unpaid work, so it’s this passion that keeps MC modding for around 30 hours a week, wrapped up in blankets and resting her hand on a cat-shaped wrist rest. “Moderating can be a bit like housekeeping. It has to be done, and usually goes unnoticed until it’s not done. The most rewarding part for me is when someone spontaneously says how much they love a sub.”There are perks with the work: Smith now has industry contacts and has been flown to media events to see exclusive previews of shows. He also recently receivedpromotional merchandisefrom Apple TV+, including a pair of AirPods. While some friends and family initially might have found his commitment to moderating a bit “ridiculous”, things changed after Amazon flew him to London for the second time. “From there on, I think everybody thinks Reddit is the coolest thing ever.”Between the lines: what do White Lotus characters’ book choices tell us?Read moreIt’s likely that moderating will only get more difficult as time goes on: membership of the Severance subreddit has tripled this year while The White Lotus sub has grown from just over 200,000 membersin 2023to its 776,000 now. “During season one [of Severance], there was a sense of camaraderie,” says Daniel Dang, a 27-year-old from California who moderates the Severance subreddit as well as ones for Better Call Saul, True Detective, The White Lotus and more. “Now, with more people trying to crack the show’s secrets, debates can become more contentious, and it’s harder to maintain that same sense of unity.”Dang adds that “quality control” is another issue – fans themselves accuse each other ofposting “dumb” theories. The moderator believes that “smart” shows “often create a sense of intellectual superiority among their audiences” which can lead to “defensiveness, arguments and, unfortunately, a lot of moderation work.”But while it’s now acommon refrainfor people to accuse others of lacking “media literacy”, Dang believes TV subreddits prove the very opposite. “I disagree with that sentiment,” he says. “Discussions around pacing, story structure and character development are common in these communities, which suggests that media literacy is very much alive.”Your office might not have a water cooler – you might not even have an office to grab a drink in – but it’s clear that, nonetheless, water-cooler moments are not dead. The cooler is virtual now, and the conversations happening around it are still very real.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe White LotusRedditSuccessionSeveranceSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Quarterback Next Door. Revenge of the XXL Wife. My Secret Agent Husband.These may sound like cringey fantasies, but they’re actually titles of “vertical dramas”, a new form of episodic television that is gripping millions around the world.The genre, which originated inChinaand has been called “TV for the Tiktok generation”, consists of minute-long episodes designed for smartphones. It has experienced such a boom that the market is predicted to be worth $14bn (£11bn) by 2027.“The rise means that there are a lot of audiences who haven’t been satisfied by the current supply of the media market,” Zhou Yuan, the founder of the Beijing-based vertical film production house Content Republic,told Hong Kong’s Filmartlast month.Duanjus – Chinese for micro-dramas – began their life on social media beforetransforming the national audiovisual market in China. Chinese companies are now working with foreign production companies to export the form, buoyed by a slew of new streaming apps such as ReelShort, ShortTV, DramaPops and FlexTV.Last November, the California-based, Chinese-backed ReelShort overtook TikTok as the most popular product in the entertainment section of Apple’s app store in the US – and has been downloaded more than 30m times since its launch in 2022.“Some people said: ‘I can’t believe someone would pay for this,’” Joey Jia, the head of Crazy Maple Studio, the company behind ReelShort,told the Washington Post. “Our answer is: You think you understand the entire entertainment market? You don’t.”View image in fullscreenA poster for the romantic soap If Loving You Is a Sin Then I’ll Go to Hell.Photograph: Reel ShortViewers are attracted to many of the tropes that BookTok readers recognise, such as enemies to lovers, secret billionaires and werewolves. They report becoming hooked by the clickbait titles, cliffhangers and eyebrow-raising scenes. Apps will usually offer a handful of episodes for free, before requiring a paid subscription. Much like a video game, ReelShort allows its users to purchase “coins” to access episodes.Jen Cooper, the British founder of the website VerticalDramaLove, was drawn to the format because of her love for romantic movies and comedies.“Last April, I was going through a really difficult time personally. I couldn’t relax or focus enough to watch full-length dramas any more,” the former bookseller said. “One day I was scrolling TikTok and saw an ad that made me go, ‘what?!’.”She ended up watching her first vertical drama, You Belong With Me, about a jilted woman who gets together with her ex’s uncle. “It’s full of classic tropes, but at the heart of it is a gorgeous love story with some genuinely funny moments,” she said.After that, Cooper “went down the rabbit hole”. She set up an Instagram account to write reviews and connect with those within the industry, and quickly formed a community. The interest was so huge that when she set up fan awards, she received more than 16,000 votes from around the world in just one week.Cooper learned that many others discovered verticals during difficult times in their life. “I’ve heard from fans who are bereaved, living with serious health conditions, or acting as carers. The audience is largely women, from early 20s to 60s. I’ve spoken to a student in Pakistan, a bed-bound older woman in Italy, and a single mum whose husband died from an overdose who tunes in while doing the housework.”The common appeal for all of them is escapism; a quick and guaranteed dopamine hit when life feels overwhelming. “People want to see good triumph over bad, and – let’s be honest – very attractive people falling in love.”Defne Turan, a production manager for London-based Sea Star Productions, which makes verticals, said the format was “the way of the world now”.The company had been receiving applications from film-makers and actors who wanted to be involved, she said. “It’s a new genre and I believe it should be handled with as much care as any other part of the industry. Just because it’s different and fast-paced doesn’t mean the standards are any less. We use industry-standard cameras and lots of the production crew and make-up artists have all worked on big productions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionFor many of the actors, verticals have been a lifeline. At a time when strikes and cutbacks have made work hard to come by, they provide consistent jobs. Verticals are typically filmed in seven to 10 days, with two cameras capturing scenes in a single take.View image in fullscreenTeig Sadhana, an Australian-British actor, says the format has provided him with regular work.Photograph: courtesy of Teig SadhanaTeig Sadhana, 29, an Australian-British actor based in New York, began working in verticals after graduating from the Stella Adler Studio of Acting last year.“I applied to an ad on a pretty standard acting job site,” he said. “I didn’t know what a vertical was, I just needed the pay cheque.” He had a brief call with a director, and a few days later was on location in Pennsylvania to shoot Glory of Revenge.“Since then I’ve made 10 films across all the major vertical platforms, worked with incredible professionals, and am finding some of the joys and comforts of having regular work. Not an easy thing to manage so quickly out of the conservatory.”He said he initially struggled to make sense of a format with limited room for character development, but that it helped to avoid “overcomplicating it too much”.Nic Westaway, a former star of the Australian TV soap opera Home and Away, who now appears in the hit vertical The Double Life of Mr President, told Filmart: “In Australia, I played one character for nearly four years, nearly 400 episodes; but in the last nine months I’ve got to play 14 different characters in 14 different crazy verticals.”According to Zhou, Content Republic is aiming to have 400 verticals in production each year: 200 for the Chinese market and 200 for an international audience.Whether the novelty will wear off is yet to be seen (Quibi shut down after six months), but even traditional media companies are monitoring the trend as they look to appeal to younger viewers with diminishing attention spans. In 2023, Paramount Pictures briefly released Mean Girls on TikTok in 23 snippets.“It’s a space we’re watching closely, with plenty to learn from how audiences and creators are embracing it,” Sacha Khari, Channel 4’s head of digital commissioning, said.Explore more on these topicsDramaSmartphonesTelevisionMobile phonesChinaSoap operaAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now satirical spa dramaThe White Lotusis set to solve all its mysteries in the third season finale, titled Amor Fati (which translate as “love of fate”, Latin fans).The Thailand-set series opened with Zion’s meditation session being interrupted by gunfire. As the panicking student waded through the resort’s ponds to look for his mother, Belinda, an unidentified corpse floated past him face-down. Who was it? Who pulled the trigger? And will anyone squat over a suitcase?The internet is awash with speculation about how creator Mike White will wrap up his wellness whodunnit. Book yourself in for a stress-relieving massage as we round up the wildest theories and most compelling predictions …1. A Ratliff will shoot Tim when they realise he’s bankruptView image in fullscreenThe truth will out … Timothy (Jason Isaacs).Photograph: HBOAs Saxon said: “If I’m not a success, then I’m nothing. And I can’t handle being nothing.” Unravelling Ratliff patriarch Timothy (Jason Isaacs) is hiding from his legal and financial troubles at the bottom of a lorazepam bottle. However, the family’s phones will soon be switched back on and news of the scandal will break. Douchebag son Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger) has threatened a meltdown if they lose social status. So has his mother, Victoria (Parker Posey): “I honestly don’t know if I’d want to live.”Tim has fantasised about shooting the money-mad pair before turning the gun on himself. This has surely been too signposted to come true. Instead, a confrontation could escalate. Either Saxon (already shaken by that incestuous threesome) or Victoria (suffering withdrawal because Tim stole her pills) could gun Tim down.2. There’s more to Mook than meets the eyeView image in fullscreenJust the girl next door? Mook (Lalisa Manobal) with Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong).Photograph: HBOSurely you don’t cast K-pop star Lalisa Manobal (AKA Lisa from Blackpink) in her debut acting role only to consign her to the sidelines? As health mentor Mook, she seems angelic and innocent. Yet there have been hints at a steely side. She can clearly handle spiky hotel guests and constantly encourages lovesick colleague Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong) to become a gun-toting henchman.Could Mook’s girl-next-door act conceal darker intentions? Is she flirting with Gaitok to keep him occupied because she’s in cahoots with the bodyguards or the Russians? Don’t be surprised if one of the cast’s headline signings has a bigger part to play.3. Not one but three deathsAnother trending theory predicts a hat-trick of murders in the finale. The number three has loomed large all series. This is the show’s third season. Chelsea keeps saying how “bad luck comes in threes”. The three Ratliff children were shown in the opening episode resembling the three wise monkeys.View image in fullscreenSee no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil … the Ratliff sibling in The White Lotus.Photograph: HBOThere are three toxic female friends, three Russian party boys and there was a pivotal threesome. Tim stashed the stolen gun in the suite’s cabinet in the third drawer from the left and three rows down. It all parallels the Three Marks of Existence, a fundamental concept in Buddhism. Could the theme continue with three deaths, perhaps perpetrated by three different killers?4. Greg will kill Belinda (or vice versa)View image in fullscreenA marked woman … Belinda (Natasha Rothwell).Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOIt’s the plot thread tying all three seasons together. Greg AKA “Gary” (Jon Gries) is the only character to pop up in every series. Spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) has rumbled him as the gold-digging husband of her late friend Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge) and wants justice. Gary has offered her $100K to stay silent but Belinda seems set to refuse his blood money.Will Gary get to Belinda before she can alert the authorities? After all, the series did begin with her son Zion (Nicholas Duvernay) hearing gunshots and fearing for his mother’s safety. Or will Belinda become an avenging angel and kill Greg?5. Rick’s dad is alive but Chelsea will dieView image in fullscreenPain and hope … Rick (Walton Goggins) and Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood).Photograph: HBOIrascible Rick (Walton Goggins) had an ulterior motive for coming to Thailand. He’s seeking revenge on resort co-owner Jim Hollinger (Scott Glenn), who he believes murdered his father. Their eventual confrontation was freighted with meaning. Jim called Rick “my kind of drinker” when he downed whisky, like a chip off the old block. He repeated Rick’s mother’s name, Gloria Hatchett, as if shaking a memory loose. What if Jim is Rick’s long-lost biological father? It would make Rick’s reluctance to kill him more poignant. No burying the Hatchett here.Viewers last saw Rick achieving closure and smiling beatifically, which doesn’t bode well for his survival. We also fear for his hippy-dippy girlfriend Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood), who’s been begging Rick to let her help him. “We’re in this yin and yang battle,” she said in the penultimate episode. “I’m hope. He’s pain. Eventually one of us will win.” Will she die to save Rick? After being held at gunpoint and bitten by a snake, she said: “Death is coming for me. This could be some Final Destination-type shit.”6. The frenemies kill each otherView image in fullscreenToxic trio … Laurie (Carrie Coon), Kate (Leslie Bibb) and Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan).Photograph: Fabio Lovino/APHow many more pass-agg meals can they have? TV star Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) took childhood pals Laurie (Carrie Coon) and Kate (Leslie Bibb) on holiday but there’s trouble in paradise. Fuelled by wine and jealousy, tensions between the toxic trio have boiled over. Kate has already been outed as a Trump voter, so White might make a political point by having her go postal.7. First incest, now fratricideView image in fullscreenBrotherly love … Lochlan (Sam Nivola) and Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger).Photograph: HBOSaxon and younger brother Lochlan (Sam Nivola) have both had queasy flashbacks to their incestuous tryst after the Full Moon party. However, with Lochlan staying overnight at the Buddhist temple and Saxon back at the resort, the pair have yet to be reunited.There might be festival-style fireworks when they meet again. Could Saxon murder his own brother in a fit of revulsion? Could Lockie kill Saxon in self-defence? The brotherly power balance has already shifted. Lochlan told his big sibling: “One day, I’m gonna take you down.” Maybe he meant fatally.8. Chloe and Gary are a con artist duoView image in fullscreenIs she really a grifter? Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon).Photograph: HBOFans have questioned why socialite Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) and boyfriend Gary frequent the White Lotus so much when they have a superyacht and swish house. Some say they’re only hanging around the hotel to scam its minted guests. Gary keeps throwing parties and inviting old dudes with age-gap “sugar baby” girlfriends. Is he looking for marks to relieve of their money, like he did to dead wife Tanya?Eagle-eyed viewers have also spotted Chloe wearing a Maggie Simpson necklace. Don’t forget it was the dummy-sucking Springfield infant who shot wealthy, bald villain Mr Burns. An omen that Chloe will soon do the same to Gary? (*Steeples fingers* “Eeexcellent.”)9. Gaitok will shoot Valentin to prove himselfSweet security guard Gaitok is keen to demonstrate that he has what it takes. What better way than becoming a have-a-go hero by gunning down a villain? At the muay thai fight, Gaitok realised that yoga teacher Valentin (Arnas Fedaravicius) deliberately distracted him so his Russian buddies could commit armed robbery on the hotel jewellery store. Meanwhile, Gaitok’s date Mook is urging him to show killer instinct. Could Gaitok catch the baddie and get the girl?10. Tim will find spiritual enlightenmentWhat if that wild monologue from Frank (Sam Rockwell) – “Maybe I want to become one of these Asian girls” – foreshadowed Tim’s future? The Bangkok expat spoke at jaw-dropping length about finding sexual and spiritual enlightenment in Thailand. Meanwhile, Tim has considered not returning to the US to evade arrest for fraud.He seemed enchanted by his audience with the chief monk, saying he “seems like the real deal”. Could he follow the path of daughter Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook) and join the Buddhist monastery himself? His wife Victoria’s reaction would be priceless. “Tim, no!”11.

With Tanya’s husband Greg making a surprise Koh Samui comeback, it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that her PA could too.

Regular shots of wild monkeys in the trees around the resort, along with mentions of how dangerous they could be, has fuelled talk of a simian grabbing a gun and pulling the trigger. During a recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Monaghan debunked the idea: “Guys, the monkeys did not do it! People have gone apeshit thinking that.” But perhaps she protests too much and a monkey will indeed go bananas.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe White LotusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why are their efforts so little known?Kevin Le GendreFri 4 Apr 2025 08.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 12.04 EDTShareThe Ethiopian famine of the early 1980s was one of the defining news stories of the decade, an exposure of the stark divide between developed and developing nations, still referred to at the time as the Third World. It is a received wisdom that the general public in Britain learned about the crisis when shocking images of emaciated men, women and children were shown on BBC news reports. This is not entirely true. In fact, plenty of Rastafarians were already aware of the situation.The east African country was their spiritual home – many in the movement viewed its former emperor Haile Selassie as their messiah – and a place free from the iniquities of the west. “A lot of Rastafarians went to Ethiopia [before they] came to London,” says the musician and campaigner Leon Leiffer. “I knew many of them, and there was a rumour going around that things were really bad because of the drought. We heard it like thatbeforethe mainstream media. And I had the idea to do something to help before we saw anything on the BBC.”Leiffer, a member of the influential reggae vocal harmony groupthe Blackstones, is the great social activist you may never have heard of. He was the driving force behind Brafa (British Reggae Artists Famine Appeal), an ensemble that featured, among others, renowned Jamaican vocalist Dennis Brown, roots heroes Aswad and Janet Kay, the queen of lovers rock, that uniquely British strain of romantic reggae. This month marks the 40th anniversary of the release of the group’s charity single, Let’s Make Africa Green Again, created to raise money for famine relief efforts in Ethiopia at around the same time as another, far more notorious charity single.View image in fullscreenRedemption song … Janet Kay and Ken Parker.Photograph: David Corio“We were always singing about Africa, so we thought: let’s put our money where our mouth is,” Leiffer, a friendly 72-year-old with braided grey hair, says over tea in his front room in Leyton, east London. He had initially decided to stage a concert to raise money for famine relief but finding a venue and sponsorship proved too difficult, so the fallback position was to make a record, the proceeds of which would be sent to Ethiopia via Save the Children. Leiffer, who came as a teenager from Jamaica to Britain and pursued a career in music, duly assembled a team consisting of several Rastafarian artists, such as singer Gene Rondo, drummer Jah Bunny and bassist Elroy Bailey, as well as vocalists including Leiffer’s wife Fay Addison and his Blackstones bandmates Tony Douglas and Ken Kendricks.On the day of the recording I said to everybody: Let go of your ego! Any artist was welcomeThis was very much a grassroots operation, and word spread of the plan to make a charity record at popular community centres such as Roots Pool in Hackney, east London, where, as Leiffer recalls, you were as likely to see reggae royalty such as Dennis Brown as you were a “notorious local gangster”. One musician alerted another, and Brafa soon put together an all-star UK reggae cast.Finding a studio willing to give free session time was a problem, but Leiffer and Rondo lucked out through a chance encounter with Eddy Grant, the innovative Guyanese singer who had had a big hit with Electric Avenue. Grant agreed to lend the group his own east London studio, and with that manna from heaven the project motored forward. Leiffer and Rondo combined lyrics from their previous songs, one of which hailed Africa as “paradise”, and they soon had the tune for Let’s Make Africa Green Again.View image in fullscreenHearing aid … (l-r) Tony Douglas, Trevor Walters, Dennis Brown and Winston Reedy.Photograph: David Corio“On the day of the recording I said to everybody: ‘Let go of your ego!’” recalls Leiffer. “Any artist was welcome, all they had to do was come to the studio and take part. And there were people singing who had never sung on a record before. People walked by, like at carnival time, and we’d say come in, we want you to sing on the chorus. It was anopen house, a special thing. We had all kinds of folk with us. There were over 200 people involved, including local schoolkids.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

As far as Leiffer was concerned, the priority was for everybody, both in the reggae and wider Black British community, to pull together and do their bit regardless of who they were. Needless to say,Band Aidhad captured the world’s attention in November 1984 with Do They Know It’s Christmas? but Leiffer did not feel they were in competition with that song. However, on the vexed issue of the lack of Black British representation in the aforementioned project and its follow-up concert Live Aid – notwithstanding the presence in the latter of pop-jazz star Sade – he has strong views, and believes the argument that reggae artists were simply not big enough to make the bill doesn’t cut any ice.“I’d say Bob Geldof and Midge Ure have good hearts,” says Leiffer. “They did fantastic. But to have Aswad in the international charts, and [lovers rock star] Trevor Walters, Eddy Grant, Janet Kay all enjoying major commercial success and not be involved … They didn’t call us for Live Aid and they didn’t call us for the recording. We had gifted, talented people and we had something to offer, and I think they should have reached out to us. Soon after our record was made, I was coming from the BBC and saw Geldof walking to Radio 1 and I said: ‘Wh’appen Bob?’ He acknowledged me but made no attempt to stop. I got the feeling of a brush-off.”While Black newspapers such as Caribbean Times and The Voice (who had offered up their office, with an all-important fax machine, for practical help), and music magazines such as Black Echoes and Blues & Soul ran features, there was scant coverage in the national press. Leiffer remembers an article “the size of a postage stamp” in the Sun, though he has fond memories of appearing on Janice Long’s Radio 1 show to promote the single.View image in fullscreenTooting their own horn … (l-r) Ruddy Isaacs and Aswad.Photograph: David CorioDespite selling well to reggae fans, the song did not make the national pop chart. Still, Brafa soldiered on and finally was able to hold a benefit concert in Shoreditch Park, east London in May 1986 that featured many of the artists on Let’s Make Africa Green Again. It drew a crowd of more than 10,000 people, raising £8,000. Although one headline called it “Live Aid reggae style”, the event also showcasedBlack British culturein the broadest sense, including appearances by notable sports people such as Olympic sprinter Mike McFarlane and boxer Dennis Andries. The concert countered the largely negative image that clung to Black British youth just a few years after the Brixton and Toxteth riots, which may well have contributed to the mainstream media snub of Brafa.How Live Aid reinvented pop musicRead moreSome recognition did eventually arrive, though. In 2021, the forecourt of the Britannia Leisure Centre on the border of Shoreditch Park wasnamed Brafa Squarein honour of Leiffer and his collective. Today, he is still focused on making music and the Blackstones recently enjoyed radio play on US reggae stations with their single Ting a Ling. Looking back, he feels a sense of achievement in what he, Gene Rondo, who died in 1994, and others did.“We were well received, maybe not on the level of Band Aid, which I understand,” he says. “We could have had more coverage. Of what we did, though, I am hugely proud. I remember the struggle, and all the good times.”Explore more on these topicsReggaeBlack British cultureBand AidfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Already this year we have seen the arrival of the seventh mainlineCivilizationgame, the 14th entry in theAssassin’s Creedfranchise, and, most brain-melting of all, the 27thMonster Huntertitle. But look: here’s a magical-realist tale set in a moody, hurricane-ravaged imagining of the American deep south, whose title, crucially, bears no numerical suffix.South of Midnight makes a brilliantly atmospheric first impression. Winds bludgeon flimsy abodes; rain lashes down on tin roofs; the world is rendered with the macabre and crooked details of a Tim Burton film. Within minutes, a house – that of high-school athlete Hazel and her mother, a social worker – is carried away along a roiling flooded river. Playing as Hazel, you give chase, bounding with a lanky teenage gait across various platforms until the storm abates. In its wake lie miles of stagnant, fetid swamps. At one grisly point, you explore a farm stacked with the carcasses of pigs who did not survive the typhoon.As a protagonist, Hazel more than holds her own against this vivid and unusual (for video games, at least) world. With mere flicks of her wrists, connected to which are metaphysical scythe-like blades, Hazel rips through reality itself. For this spunky, determined young woman is a Weaver, adept at magically dispelling unsavoury spirits lurking amid the weeping willows and glinting glass bottle trees of her southern home. As a Weaver, she is able to see an enormous cosmic grand tapestry where myth, reality, time and space collide; peering into the past, she learns of ancestors who helped free slaves and of tragic child deaths.View image in fullscreenVivid and unusual … South of Midnight.Photograph: Xbox Game StudiosSprinting with energy, South of Midnight lays out its imaginative stall: action-packed chapters whisk the player from sweltering bayous to chilly mountains that feel as if they are edging towards Appalachia. The atmosphere is thick – at times, laying it on a little too thick: your friendly guide to this folkloric romp is a gigantic catfish who speaks with a distinct Creole drawl about, among other things, the classic southern dish grits.But in the actual playing, South of Midnight is simply thin. With its mostly linear mix of 3D platforming and melee combat, the game evokes PlayStation 2-era titles. Yet neither element has much personality. The brawling looks stylish, ending with brutal finishing moves in which Hazel unravels her wraith-like enemies’ very fabric of being. Really, it lacks the depth and expressive possibilities of titles such as God of War. Platforming feels floaty until you are vaulting from one conspicuously painted white ledge to another: then it just feels prescriptive and clunky.What great lengths the team of visual artists, sound designers, and scriptwriters at Microsoft-owned studio, CompulsionGames, went to in creating this rugged, earthy place, only to have it undone by gameplay of often mind-numbing smoothness. At various points, you must flee from a nebulous, mist-like entity. But these sequences are so straightforward as to lack any dramatic tension. They repeat many times throughout the game’s approximately 12-hour duration, only increasing a little in difficulty each time.Other loops grate as the hours stack up: clear this area of oozing corrupted matter (a visual manifestation of the land’s pain and trauma); watch another lightly animated flashback. This lovingly illustrated depiction of the south is rich and arresting yet the game is rote.What you’re left with is a game whose best ideas are all optics. The fairytale southern style plays out like a modern, YA take on Toni Morrison’s fiction while summoning some of the whimsical, damaged beauty of 2012’s Beasts of the Southern Wild. The soundtrack is a rambunctious collage of howling blues, twanging folk and lilting jazz. Compulsion Games bottled much southern magic during the making of this seemingly risky gambit for Microsoft, yet failed to take risks where it really mattered: this unique setting deserved more.South of Midnight is released 8 April, £39.99 or GamePass subscriptionExplore more on these topicsGamesXbox series S/XreviewsShareReuse this content"

Vigilantly monitored, it sends me into autopilot: finishing my water, putting my luggage on the tray, taking out my electronics, shuffling through the body scanner and collecting my belongings. But as of August last year, I’m no longer so nonchalant.My family, boyfriend and I had spent a carefree two weeks on holiday in Portugal. I was already mourning the end of summer – and my return to medical school – when we arrived at Porto airport for our flight home. I had just stepped away from the security queue and was repacking my bag when I realised something I had put on the scanner belt was missing: my iPad. Panicked, I demanded that everyone comb through their luggage, but it was nowhere to be found. Four years of medical school notes, as well as reams of unfinished writing from my year as a journalist, had vanished.We alerted a security guard, who seemed sceptical, and insisted that my bag be rescanned. That confirmed it: the iPad was gone. The security guard called the police, and the countdown began. Our flight was due to take off in 45 minutes. I had to find my iPad before then.Opening my phone’s tracker app, I saw my iPad moving through the airportMy family and I were greeted by a friendly policeman, who said he would review the CCTV. I began to second-guess myself – had I just misplaced it? But I realised there was a way to check: Find My iPhone. Opening the app, I spotted my iPad, moving through the airport, away from me.The policeman returned with footage of the culprit: an elderly, balding man in a white shirt accompanied by a little boy wearing an oversized blue rucksack. Unassuming suspects.At this point, we had only 30 minutes until our flight took off. While my mum and sisters went through passport control, my dad, boyfriend and I followed the policeman. I showed him the location on my phone and he knew where to go.“I have a plan,” he announced, bounding down the stairs. We tried to keep up but lost him in the crowd. Checking my iPad’s location, I saw it on the other side of the airport.After 20 minutes of futile searching, we regrouped and agreed to go through passport control. The policeman reappeared, took my details and said he would send me a case report for insurance purposes.It seemed like the end. But on the other side of the airport, my sisters had also been tracking the iPad. While it had moved farther away from me, it had drawn closer to them, to a boarding gate just opposite our own.Running to the ground crew, they explained the situation and asked them to hold the plane. The staff looked confused, but called the police to confirm our story. The gate was deserted – everyone had boarded and the plane was about to depart. Our flight had started boarding, too.Amazingly, the ground crew agreed to search the plane. Armed with a verbal description of the culprit, the colour of my iPad and its screensaver, one of the team members boarded.The wait was tense. We sat in silence. But then a figure appeared, striding down the boarding bridge with an object held over his head: my iPad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The fact that we had narrowed down the exact plane and a crew member had found the thief with nothing but a vague description seemed like something out of a spy thriller. Overwhelmed with gratitude, we thanked the crew profusely before sprinting to the tail end of our boarding queue.We never did find out what happened to the culprit. I only hope that the other passengers on his flight weren’t too delayed. To this day, my family still spends hours around the dinner table debating how the crew persuaded the elderly man to surrender my iPad. It has become our favourite story to tell.I used to think airport etiquette was an unspoken law: don’t tamper with other people’s security trays, and only take your own suitcase from the luggage conveyor.

Which may explain why so much cash has been thrown at the area around the station to turn it into “an aspirational lifestyle destination”, rather than somewhere to stomp through grumpily while dragging a suitcase.By and large, however, this proposed glow-up has failed – the Euston Road will always be an unlovable, multi-laned traffic snarl-up – although now, if you creep intothe Megaro hotel, you’ll find a minimalist Scandi restaurant,Voyage with Adam Simmonds. This plain, dark brown, oak-panelled room sits rather incongruously inside the recently restyled Megaro, which now has a Britpop, Austin Powers-esque, rock’n’roll theme and suites boasting names such asGroove Britanniaand Pop Diva; Backstage Britannia comes complete with acid smiley face pillows.View image in fullscreenVoyage’s veal sweetbread comes ‘perched on a delicate plinth of kohlrabi’.If the Megaro is a celebration of the 1990s London party scene, however, Voyage is a post-party detox in Gällivare, Sweden. Dinner is a five- or seven-course tasting menu of painstakingly prepped gastronomical visions.Take our first course, named simply “Oyster”. One word, no clues. Fancy, Scandi-influenced menus – and I have seen many – never reveal what you’re ordering, although the portion sizes are almost guaranteed to be minute, as if they’re designed to feed psychic hamsters. That “Oyster”, by the way, turned out to be something very delicious indeed: a bivalve mollusc from France with teeny-tiny flecks of compressed granny smith apple, white asparagus, wood sorrel and tapioca pearls, which a flurry of chefs in the open kitchen assembled meticulously with tweezers.Similarly, when Voyage’s menu reads “Sweetbread”, you can expect a single veal sweetbread perched on a delicate plinth of kohlrabi served two ways – raw and salt-baked – with a dash of onion puree, a pied mouton mushroom and a whisper of chicken jus in its yellow mustard seed sauce. Voyage’s journey might, to some diners, feel like a trip to a weight-loss camp, although admittedly we were on several occasions offered some good rye bread with whipped butter. Even so, you should expect dinner here to be light and dainty, so on no account take a fine-dining refusenik who will pine for a side of buttered spuds with the “Venison”. That aged venison comes with a slice of salt-baked beetroot, another slice of raw beetroot and a puree of spinach, parsley and juniper.View image in fullscreen‘Light and dainty’: Voyage’s aged venison with beetroot two ways and a puree of spinach, parsley and juniper.Photograph: Beca B Jones/The GuardianAdam Simmonds spent his formative years atLe Manoir aux Quat’ Saisons, so his style was always heading towards the precise, refined, faultless and crisp. Voyage feels like a journey through all the various stoves behind which he has stood over a long career – atLe Gavroche,the Ritzand the Halkin, let alonethe LanesboroughandL’Escargot. It takes thousands of hours in hot kitchens to cook like Simmonds does.For me, the highlight of our meal was “Celeriac”, a bowl of cubed, salt-baked, roasted and fermented celeriac with truffle, plus some pieces of shiitake mushroom and walnut, all finished with celeriac broth. Celeriac cooked in five different ways in a single dish is as time-consuming as it sounds, but it’s worth it for this level of vegetarian joy. Also stridently finickety was “Lobster”, in which a forkful of lobster meat sat in a clear broth with some razor clam and squid.Like all fancy hotel restaurants, Voyage’s clientele included several guests who had possibly ambled in hoping for a caesar salad and a side of fries and were now knee-deep in a Noma-style nosh-up. And if the celeriac and the lobster dishes had puzzled them, they hadn’t seen pudding yet. A bowl of pale smears and creams of varying textures eventually revealed itself to be compressed pear infused with tea and kombucha, some koji ice-cream and some chocolate ganache with a few chestnut drops and a hazelnut cream. Not over-sweet and, in fact, by some interpretations of the word, not really dessert at all.View image in fullscreenVoyage’s sea buckthorn dessert.Voyage is not for everyone, sure, but others will love it. The service is warm, knowledgable and determinedly proud of Simmonds’ hard work, and they sent us on our way with delightful rosebud tea bags that had the look and feel of something I might have made atBrownies. These were packed into a homemade envelope, complete with a letter from Simmonds himself, and sealed with wax at the table, as if they were issuing me with a medieval death warrant. None of this, as far as I remember it, felt remotely normal at the time, and the whole experience becomes even weirder in its retelling.

The biscuit base stays nice and crunchy, while the tangy, salted creme fraiche topping cuts through some of the richness. You can serve this while it’s still warm for something a little more gooey, but it’s much easier to slice if you let it cool completely.Double chocolate brownie tartPrep5 minCook50 min, plus coolingServes12For the base270gbourbonbiscuits80g unsalted butter, meltedFor the filling90g dark chocolate100g unsalted butter2 large eggs90g caster sugar90g dark brown sugar70g plain flour½ tbsp cocoa powder, plus extra for dusting½ tsp espresso powder¼ tsp saltTo top120mldouble creamFlaky sea salt150gcreme fraicheHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and line the base of a 23cm tart tin with baking paper.Finely crush the biscuits in a food processor (or in a food bag with a rolling pin). In a bowl, mix the melted butter into the biscuits until well coated, then tip into the lined tin and use the back of a spoon to press the mix down firmly, going up the sides of the tin, too. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove and leave to cool while you make the filling.Melt the chocolate and butter in a bowl set over (but not touching) a pan of simmering water.Whisk the eggs and sugars in a bowl for a couple of minutes, until slightly paler in colour, then pour in the melted chocolate and stir to combine. Add the flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder and salt, and stir to make a smooth batter. Pour this over the biscuit base in the tin, then bake for 20-25 minutes, until the middle is just set. Take out of the oven and leave to cool completely.To make the topping, lightly beat the cream and a big pinch of salt to very soft peaks, then fold in the creme fraiche and whip again until the mixture thickens. Spoon this on to the tart, then dust with cocoa powder and serve (if you’re having the tart warm, serve the cream on the side).Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotFoodBakingPastryDessertChocolateBiscuitsrecipesShareReuse this content"

Xenia finds it disgusting. You decide who should keep their mouth shutFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonFri 4 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 08.23 EDTShareThe prosecution: XeniaHe says his throat is dry but to me spitting is a sign of disrespect. I’ve seen people look shocked by itMy boyfriend, Ahmed, has a habit I find disgusting: he’s always spitting in public. I think that’s bad enough, but he does it really loudly, which makes it worse – a huge hack sound followed by a big glob of spit, which goes flying. It’s so gross, and sometimes draws attention. I find myself apologising to anyone who catches our eye after he does it, and they always look shocked, but Ahmed rarely notices.He doesn’t spit to be rude – he says that where he grew up, in Saudi Arabia, spitting is normal and not seen as disgusting. He used to have spitting competitions at his school, and girls and boys competed against each other. Once he estimated that he could spit up to 8ft away. He said it in jest in our early days of dating, but I was horrified.However, when I asked, jokingly, if I could spit beside him he told me it was “more of a men’s thing”. That proves he does have some internalised stigma around spitting. But only if he has to watch a woman doing it. Quite ironic, really.My mum watched Ahmed spit towards her car once when he needed to clear his throat, and I saw her mouth drop openAhmed says he needs to spit because his throat is always dry, but if that’s the case it’s been dry since the day we met in 2019 and he needs to get it checked out.To me, spitting is a sign of disrespect and seen as uncouth. I don’t mean that in a snobby way, but it suggests you don’t have manners. My mum watched Ahmed spit towards her car once when he needed to clear his throat, and I saw her mouth drop open. I told her it was part of Ahmed’s culture and she said it was fine, but I think she was mortified.You be the judge - send us your domestic disputesRead moreI guess Ahmed has always shown me exactly who he is and has never tried to hide anything about himself. On our first date he told me he was once in £20,000 of debt. I rate his honesty and don’t want him to change – except for this one annoying habit.Ahmed could stop spitting if he really wanted to. He is easy-going and a good communicator, but he won’t properly discuss giving it up. I have asked him to control it and he’s said he’s trying, but he could improve a bit more.The defence: AhmedIt’s just a habit that society has arbitrarily decided is gross. Xenia needs to be more tolerantI don’t spit to offend, but because it’s second nature. I always spit to clear my throat or when I’ve got a sour taste in my mouth. It’s just a habit. My throat gets dry, and spitting solves the problem. It’s a practical necessity, not an act of rebellion.I’ll admit the sound might be a little jarring. But in Saudi Arabia, spitting wasn’t a social faux pas like it is in the UK. It was practically a sport. We’d measure distances, compare techniques. People spit as they go into a mosque, or after smoking. So now, years later, I don’t even think about what it means.I have tried to explain it to Xenia, but she doesn’t really get it. She says I need to try to tone it down.Xenia thinks about my spitting a lot. She winces every time I do it, and apologises to strangers on my behalf as if I’ve just committed some unspeakable crime. She acts as though I’ve spat on someone, when really all I’m doing is just clearing mucus from my throat.What’s next? Banning sneezes in public? Issuing fines for throat-clearing?I have tried to tone down how emphatic my spitting is because I know that Xenia hates it. Now, I’ll spit straight on to the ground instead of firing it out quickly and at a height.Xenia says she likes my honesty – well this is part of the package. The guy who explained his financial troubles on our first date is the same guy who occasionally feels the need to expectorate.I get that some people find it unpleasant. But am I really supposed to change something that feels entirely normal to me just because society has arbitrarily decided it’s gross? What’s next? Banning sneezes in public? Issuing fines for throat-clearing? I know Singapore fines people for spitting in the streets, but we don’t live there.Xenia needs to build up some tolerance. I put up with her annoying habits because I love her. The worst thing about me is that I occasionally launch some saliva into the ether, which I will try to tone down. But ultimately I’ve been spitting for too long now to totally stop.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Should he stop?Of course Ahmed shouldn’t spit in public – it’s deeply offensive and looks aggressive. He should carry a handkerchief to spit into.Samira, 38Plenty of people born and raised in the UK spit in public too – and it’s generally considered a no-no. But every society has its conventions and cultural quirks. Surely it’s not too hard to avoid doing things that a lot of people find disgusting. Ahmed needs to train himself to stop spitting.Matthieu, 63“Am I really supposed to change something that feels entirely normal to me just because society has arbitrarily decided it’s gross?”– YES. It’s disgusting.Diane, 46Ahmed is hypocritical about what he sees as his right to spit in public, since he thinks it’s only OK for men to do it. But if he insists on spitting outdoors, maybe he could respect Xenia’s concerns and stop doing it so much when she’s around, or at least do it out of her sight.Brian, 31I don’t think the defence has a leg to stand on here. Neither “I’m clearing my throat because it is always dry” nor “it feels entirely normal to me” are reasons for spitting on the street.Kitwana, 35Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us who you think is in the wrong?The poll closes on Thursday 10 April at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked ifRay was wrong to refuse to wash Liam’s car again, having made a hash of it the first time.4%of you said yes –Ray is guilty96%of you said no –Ray is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeRelationshipsFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The air is thick with flies, attracted to the cow dung but ignoring the nearby dinosaur poo, sturdily constructed from papier-mache.“Oh god,” Sam Neill groans – though these words aren’t actually uttered by Neill but local builder Ian Flavell, who has taken on Neill’s role as palaeontologist Alan Grant – and drops to his knees in front of an ailing triceratops.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThis is Jurassic Park: Castlemaine Redux, a shot-for-shot remake (if you squint) of Jurassic Park, the 1993 blockbuster directed bySteven Spielberg.Thisfilm’s director is John Roebuck, the man with the vision and the $3,000 budget. Right now, he’s hunched over a monitor: some sheep walked into the last shot and screwed up the continuity.View image in fullscreenL-R: Ian Flavell (Dr Alan Grant), Peter Bevin (Dr Ian Malcolm), Jen O’Donnell (Dr Ellie Sattler) and Angus Read-Hill (Dr Harding) laugh near a pile of triceratops dung in Sandon, Australia.Photograph: Steve Womersley/The GuardianThere have been longer-term continuity problems: Charles Sanderson-Eales, who plays Tim, one of the child characters, was 14 when he started in the role. He’s now 17: his voice has broken and he’s too big to be carried in one scene, as Tim was in the original film.“His height goes up and down throughout,” says Roebuck. “It’ll hopefully add to the charm.”This “back yard mockbuster” has been a labour of fandom three years in the making, born out of a staffroom conversation between Roebuck, a teacher, and some bored colleagues about what they could do to lift themselves out of the doldrums. Someone suggested crocheting. Roebuck had other ideas.View image in fullscreenDirector John Roebuck laughs, after creating the impression that the triceratops was breathing.Photograph: Steve Womersley/The GuardianThe trailer for Jurassic Park: Castlemaine Redux.Spielberg’s mega-hit was chosen on a whim. For 10 years, Roebuck was a film critic and ran the ReelGood film festival, so his tastes usually steer to “semi-pretentious”. But taking on such an ambitious project became a personal quest. On the local Facebook page for the town, Roebuck’s posts tend to start with “Long shot …” and end with a request for the film: could someone provide temporary fencing, a raft, a cave, a generator, a dirt road …?To Roebuck’s surprise, support for his project quickly grew, which meant he only wound up spending $3,000 of his own money – mainly on venue hire and catering. Jurassic Park Motor Pool Australia – a club for owners and enthusiasts of replica Jurassic Park vehicles – supplied some wheels and props. Local cameraman Kristian Bruce brought his professional gear, retiring the DSLR Roebuck had been using. A man in Texas sawthe trailerand offered his VFX services. Castlemaine itself – a town that embraces sublimely ridiculous ideas, such as Castlemaine Idyll (a raucous take on Australian Idol) and the community dance-off Hot Moves No Pressure – leapt on tickets to the “world premiere”. There are four screenings of Jurassic Park: Castlemaine Redux atthe Theatre Royalbetween 11 and 13 April.View image in fullscreenCinematographer Michael Mouritz captures the main characters’ arrival on the island.Photograph: Steve Womersley/The Guardian“Part of me wants to reshoot the crappy looking stuff,” Roebuck says of the earlier material, “but people keep saying, ‘Nah, you’ve got to play it as it lays’. The bad stuff will hopefully be funny, and with the good stuff people will be like, ‘How did you dothat?’”The film has become an allosaurus around Roebuck’s neck. For three years he’s been wrangling about 150 people, and is responsible for directing and editing the film. The project also coincided with the birth of his child and a children’s book deal with his wife, Emma Mulvey, who also acts in the film.“It’s become bigger than Ben-Hur,” Roebuck says. “By the time I realised it was all too much, we’d done way too much to stop and I’d told way too many people about it. When this is done, I’ll settle into the relatively easy job of raising a child for 18 years.”Back in that field outside Castlemaine, local actor Gus Read-Hill is waiting his turn. Read-Hill – playing ranger Dr Harding – has decided to go full-tilt at an American accent, which not every cast member is willing to attempt.View image in fullscreenL-R: Orvokki Britton (Lex), Jen O’Donnell (Dr Ellie Sattler), Ian Flavell (Dr Alan Grant) and Charlie Sanderson-Eales (Tim) approach the triceratops.Photograph: Steve Womersley/The Guardian“John said to just decide and stick to it,” Read-Hill says, citing Kevin Costner’s performance in Robin Hood: Prince as Thieves as an example ofnotsticking to it. “You’ve just got to commit.”There’s stifled laughter from the crew as Jen O’Donnell (playing Dr Ellie Sattler, originally depicted by Laura Dern) breathes heavily over the fallen triceratops, which looks way more realistic than its bubble wrap and beanbag construction should allow. Cinematographer Michael Mouritz positions himself to use depth of field to make the triceratops much bigger than the humans mourning it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Roebuck also teaches there, including an elective where students are tasked with recreating a scene from blockbuster films. O’Donnell’s husband and children all have roles in theJurassic Parkremake. “Our son was too cool to be in our daggy project at first,” she says. “Then it started getting bigger and he wanted to be involved.”Hold on to Your Butts review – Jurassic Park redone with DIY dinosRead moreHer most memorable experience was filming in the toilet corridor of Castlemaine’s artisan shopping hub, The Mill, where they recreated the scene where Samuel L Jackson’s character Ray Arnold has his arm ripped off by a raptor.“I’m trying to flick a switchboard and a dinosaur attacks me,” O’Donnell says. “I had to scream over and over – my screams overpowered the band that was playing next door at The Taproom, so the owner had to come out and tell me to stop.” (Local radio station Main FM got O’Donnell to recreate that scream on air, then started playing it randomly between segments: “Castlemaine’s a place where magical things can happen,” she observes.)View image in fullscreenA still from the trailer for Jurassic Park: Castlemaine ReduxPhotograph: John RoebuckRoebuck’s project has inspired his own family. “I think my dad’s love language has been discovered,” he says. “He built us a replica of the Jurassic Park gates, and hand-carved a raptor claw, which looks exactly the same as the one in the film. I think my parents were [perplexed] for a long time. My brother, who’s a doctor and a lawyer, has a career path that’s a lot easier for them to understand. But it’s actually been a surprise how much they’ve gotten behind this.”Every bold idea has its haters, though, and Jurassic Park: Castlemaine Redux found those onReddit, with some predicting failure to finish, and others wondering why the team wouldn’t create something entirely original. As one poster put it, quoting Jeff Goldblum’s cynical scientist Ian Malcolm: “They were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.”It’s water off Roebuck’s back. “A lot of me connects with what they’re saying,” he says. “I mean, when people ask me, ‘Why? Why on earth would you do that?’ I get where they’re coming from. But there’s something appealing about there being absolutely no teaching moment or take-home message from all this effort.”View image in fullscreenIan Flavell as Dr Alan Grant in the trailer for Jurassic Park: Castlemaine Redux.Photograph: John RoebuckTwo babies, 25 filming locations, thousands of minutes of footage and about 10 “rock bottom despair-fuelled meltdowns” later (all Roebuck’s, he says), the film is now done. The cast and crew will be dressing up for the “world premiere” in Castlemaine like it’s a red-carpet event, because this is the end of the road. The remake can’t be screened more widely, even at film festivals, because of copyright infringement. The Castlemaine screenings are free to attend, so nobody’s profiting from it – but even they theoretically risk being shut down.“A few people on the team have already been getting worried that we’ll get shut down,” says Roebuck. “In my head, I’m like, ‘Oh, that’d be kind of a funny way for all this to finish.’ Essentially, we’ll probably screen it at the Theatre Royal and then it’ll sit on a hard drive, like the ark at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark, and just gather dust.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian filmSteven SpielbergJurassic ParkVictoriafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But how does it affect people with eating disorders?Doctors worry about GLP-1s being used by people with restrictive eating disorders – but research also shows they could help others struggling with binge eatingHannah SeoFri 4 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 13.11 EDTShareGLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic have, in three short years, changed our attitudes to the body. They’ve revived a cultural fervor for thinness that has been blamed for everything fromthe closure of wine barsto killing offthe body positivity movement. What began as a seeming miracle drug posited to help those most in need of losing weight for health reasons has led to a clamor in whichone in eight Americans have tried the drugsand telehealth companies have offered cheaper off-brand versions with very little oversight.Ozempic (the brand name for semaglutide) and other GLP-1s mimic a natural hormone in the body, stimulating insulin and slowing the rate of stomach emptying after eating, increasing one’s sense of fullness. But the very qualities that make GLP-1s such powerful tools for weight loss also make them potentially dangerous for those who struggle to adequately feed themselves.Some healthcare specialists say that an injection enabling people to eat dramatically fewer calories in a day resembles nothing less than a drug-induced – or at least, a drug-encouraged – eating disorder. Dr Kimberly Dennis, a psychiatrist and expert on eating disorders in the US, is quoted as saying: “These drugs are rocket fuel for people with eating disorders.” Another doctor told Bloomberg News directly that they had seen patients with“drug-induced” anorexia. For people who are prone to anorexia, bulimia and other eating disorders, easy access to GLP-1s is causing alarm.How I escaped the wild west of #cleaneating Instagram and TikTokRead moreMany healthcare professionals are concerned that those withrestrictiveeating disorders should not be on appetite-suppressant drugs, says Pamela Keel, a psychologist and eating disorder expert at Florida State University. She says medications should not be being prescribed to help a malnourished person stay malnourished, regardless of their weight. After all, “we are not interested in helping people do a better job of having an eating disorder.”GLP-1s not only make it easier to restrict consumption by suppressing appetite, they could also encourage other disordered behavior such as purging. Because the stomach empties more slowly on these drugs, it can make it easier to vomit up food, says Keel.A good doctor would be aware of a patient’s history of eating disorders and would be able to take those risk factors into account. However, GLP-1s are increasingly easy to access through telehealth platforms such as Hers, Eden and Ro, which only require online consultations. To see just how easy it would be to lie about my own health and my need for these drugs, I went on the website of one well-known telehealth platform. I went through the various intake forms and surveys, telling the truth about my health in all instances but over-reporting my weight.I was quickly approved and charged for compounded semaglutide. At no point was I put in contact with any kind of doctor.View image in fullscreenA banner advertises Ozempic for weight loss in West Virginia.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersThe interactions between Ozempic and eating disorders are complex. There are concerns that drug could retrigger a restrictive eating disorder in someone diagnosed with one previously, or even trigger one in someone who hadn’t had one before. Complicating matters is that there is evidence to suggest that Ozempic can be helpful to people with binge eating disorder, and many people who cycle between patterns of restrictive eating and overeating.Because these drugs are still so new, there’s no longitudinal data on how they affect eating disorders in the long term. One theory of how anorexia is triggered is that calorie restriction and “starvation mode” flips a metaphorical switch in the brain of those who are predisposed, says Terry Schwartz, the interim executive director of the Eating Disorders Center for Treatment and Research at the University of California, San Diego.It’s not yet known whether GLP-1s can flip this switch, but there is a medical precedent for this, Schwartz says. The anti-seizure medication Topamax (also known by its generic drug name, topiramate) has side effects of weight loss and suppressed appetite. We now know that this drug canincrease the riskof developing an eating disorder. “I saw a number of people … who developed a syndrome like anorexia nervosa on Topamax,” Schwartz says – disordered behaviors that disappeared once they stopped the drug. And this is something scientists are considering as they continue to monitor and study GLP-1s and their effects.There is more consensus that these drugs could trigger a relapse in someone who has already suffered from disordered eating. At the age of 30, Lily, a retail worker in Australia, found that climbing even just a few stairs had her pausing to catch her breath. Her body mass had swelled in recent years, but she had put off seeing the doctor even as her fatigue grew heavier and heavier. Even when she started wetting herself she still found it hard to see the severity of her symptoms.People will never be able to accept their bodies, they’ll always be told: ‘Well, you could be thinner, just use this medicine’Maria RagoWhen she finally went to the doctor in June 2023, Lily was stunned to hear her diagnosis of adult-onset type 1 diabetes. She knew she had been unhealthy, gaining 70kg in the past five years, having developed some binge eating tendencies. But for most of her life, Lily had actually been unhealthily underweight. It seemed unreal that she could develop diabetes so quickly.To get her diabetes under control, she was told she needed the help of a GLP-1 drug. She told her endocrinologist that she’d had anorexia for over a decade and felt that suppressing her appetite was a bad idea.“He did not give two shits, excuse my language,” Lily says. And so, against the advice of her long-term psychiatrist and dietician, Lily was put on Ozempic. She relapsed immediately.In Lily’s case, she was lucky that a friend noticed her symptoms and urged her to tell her psychiatrist. Though she is still technically overweight, her psychiatrist helped her pivot to simply maintaining her current weight, which has helped Lily pull herself out of her relapse. She stopped losing weight and stopped weighing herself. She regularly checks in with both her psychiatrist and her dietician to make sure she’s eating enough, even while she remains on Ozempic.Lily’s feelings toward Ozempic are complicated. Her blood sugars are down and her cholesterol is at a better place. In contrast to her previous “all-or-nothing” mindset with food, she’s able to eat “normal” meal portions for the first time in her adult life.The Ozempic keeps her urges to binge at bay, she says, and now she doubts whether she can ever go off it. When a hernia repair surgery forced her to pause her Ozempic usage for about a month in June 2024, the ferocity of her returning appetite scared her. “All of my thoughts about food came back exactly the way that they were before, and it was horrifying,” she says. “I felt so out of control and I was miserable.”Ozempic has won, body positivity has lost. And I want no part of itRead moreLily, like many people with eating disorders that don’t fit into neat boxes, is wedged between an urge to binge that is tempered by the Ozempic and the impulse to restrict that the Ozempic enables.‘Food noise’ and binge eatingThough anorexia nervosa is probably the most well-known eating disorder, binge eating disorder, which causes compulsive and chronic overeating, is about four times more common in girls and women of all ages than anorexia nervosa and twice as common as bulimia nervosa, according to a comprehensiveHarvard report. The potential for GLP-1s to help those with binge eating disorder is a source of some optimism.Researchhas started to come out over the past couple yearssuggestingthat these drugs could be a valuable tool to curb binges.GLP-1 is a natural hormone in the body that spikes when we eat a meal. In-progress research suggests that GLP-1 responses are blunted or muted in people with a history of binging, says Keel, so it’s possible these medications could help rebalance their hormone.Megan, a 39-year-old nurse in Jersey City, New Jersey, sought out Ozempic in May of 2023 after struggling with cycles of binging and purging for all of her adult life. She eventually switched to Mounjaro, and the change for her has been dramatic. Before she started taking GLP-1s, Megan would get hunger pangs throughout the day that would consume her mind and affect her body. She would wake up in the middle of the night from the discomfort – and the urges wouldn’t settle until she got up to eat food from the fridge. With GLP-1s all of that went away.View image in fullscreenAdvertising for semaglutide injections outside Penn Station in New York in 2024.Photograph: Richard Levine/AlamyExperiencing physical discomfort driving her to binge, and then relief that the medication provided, Megan realized how much of her disorder was a biological condition, and not just a matter of discipline. “I thought it was a willpower issue and I always blamed myself,” Megan says. But all this has “made me forgive myself for what I went through”.We’ve already seen that GLP-1s reduce “food noise” and people’s preoccupations with eating, so “for somebody who has binge eating disorder, these could be helpful tools,” says Leslie Heinberg, a Cleveland Clinic psychologist and expert in obesity and eating disorders.Preliminarystudiesdo show that these drugs hold promise in reducing binge eating behaviors, but more research is needed, she says.Control and shameThe idea that we need to tame our bodies to be thin dates back to at least the Enlightenment, with distinctly racist roots. It can be traced back to the idea that those in bigger bodies lack self-control and refinement, says Sabrina Strings, a professor of Black studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies portrayals of gender, race and bodies. GLP-1s, she says, provide a medicalized avenue for that control.Control and shame, coincidentally, feature strongly in the mindsets of those with eating disorders, notes Debra Safer, a psychiatrist at Stanford’s medical weight loss clinic. The tension between semaglutides and body acceptance is palpable.This was true for Morgan, a 27-year-old marketing project manager in Chicago. After spending most of her life unhappy in her body and struggling with disordered eating, Morgan began therapy in 2022 where she learned about theHealthAt Every Size framework, which teaches people to strive for optimal health without focusing on size or weight. Even after a lot of unlearning unhealthy mindsets and learning to appreciate her body, Morgan eventually decided that Wegovy was the right choice for her. “It’s been kind of earth-shattering to admit to myself that it could be something that helps me,” she says. Her decision has sometimes felt like a betrayal of her values, but the relief the medication has brought her is undeniable – her joint pain has been reduced and the noise around food has been reduced.Lurking underneath the whole conversation of GLP-1s and eating disorders is the difficult truth that cultural fatphobia contributes to the prevalence of eating disorders, says Maria Rago, a psychologist in Illinois and the president of the board of directors for the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders. There are many people who are against these drugs because of how they contribute to the idea that we can and should all be thin, she says – there’s a fear that this will contribute to more eating disorders, and that “people will never be able to accept their bodies, they’ll always be told: ‘Well, you could be thinner, just use this medicine.’”From fashion to the food industry: 11 ways that weight-loss drugs have changed the worldRead moreFor now, what clinicians can do is what most of them are already doing: screening patients for a history of eating disorders before prescribing GLP-1s. If a patient has an active eating disorder they’ll be sent to treat that first, says Chika Anekwe, an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital and an instructor of medicine at Harvard University. But if a patient has just a history of restrictive eating disorder, that won’t necessarily disqualify them from GLP-1 use. It’s a case by case assessment of “do the benefits outweigh the potential risk?” she says.Lily thinks her doctors “should have been more careful when they prescribed it to me”, she says. “I know that I had diabetes, and that my diabetes was really bad and that I was very sick, but I think they should have been more careful when they prescribed it to me.” Ultimately, however, she is grateful to be on Ozempic. The thought of trying to rein in her binge eating disorder without Ozempic feels scarier to her than what she’s doing now, managing her restrictive impulses while on it. And swirled in with all of this is the misplaced shame and embarrassment of needing to be on Ozempic in the first place, of having lost control to the point of needing medical intervention. All told, she says: “This has been one of the most confusing things that I’ve ever done to my own body.”In the US, help is available at nationaleatingdisorders.org or by calling ANAD’s eating disorders hotline at 800-375-7767.

Using a PCR test similar to those used during the Covid-19 pandemic to test for the virus, Cardeñosa was able to identify the species behind the fin as sandbar shark, an endangered species found in tropical and warm-temperate waters.Now, Cardeñosa and other scientists from Florida International University, alongside law enforcement officials from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), plan to deploy the tests at ports across the country in order to crack down on seafood fraud and fish trafficking.Illegal fishing adversely affects legitimate commercial fishers as well as fish populations. Almost a third of shark species are threatened or near threatened with extinction and the value of world trade in shark parts is almost $1bn a year,according to the UN.View image in fullscreenNOAA enforcement staff and Florida International University scientists perform the first field PCR test in Newark, New Jersey.Photograph: NOAAAt the same time, US consumption of seafood is increasing, rising by more than 30% in the decade from 2002. About 80% of this comes from foreign exports – mostly from Canada, Chile, India, Indonesia and Vietnam,according tothe US department of agriculture.The PCR device uses genetic markers developed for more than 100 species including great whites, hammerheads, makos, oceanic whitetips, threshers and whale sharks. Other species whose genetic markers have been developed for the PCR device include all Atlantic tuna species and European eel.Once samples are added into the device, the genetic markers produce a specific chemical reaction depending on which fish species is being tested for.Cardeñosa recently tested a container labeled as “American eel” for European eel. Upon performing the tests using eel samples from the container, the PCR devices lit up, he said, confirming the presence of European eel. “If none of the samples light up or give you an increase in fluorescence in the tube, that means none of those tubes have European eel in them,” he said.The tools are designed to give law enforcement officers enough preliminary evidence to stop a shipment, he added.Revealed: seafood fraud happening on a vast global scaleRead moreTypical port inspections currently consist of visual identifications of fish species yet, according to Noaa, the vast majority of fish and seafood products imported into the US enter as filets, processed fish products or shark fins without carcasses. As a result, relying on visual inspections to identify species can be incredibly challenging.Noaa spokesperson James Miller said: “Deployment of the PCR device will allow officers to conduct genetic analysis in real-time during inspections and detect seafood fraud.”The device also saves money. The submission and analysis of a single fish sample to a government forensic laboratory can cost several hundred dollars. In contrast, the cost of collection and analysis of a fish sample taken in the field using the PCR device costs less than $1.“These efforts protect US consumers, who can feel safe knowing they are buying legal and safe seafood,” Miller said.Explore more on these topicsFishSeascape: the state of our oceansEndangered speciesConservationWildlifeFoodAnimalsIllegal wildlife tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Now aged 20, he watches from the US as the war drags on. In December, Zelenskyysaid43,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and another 370,000 have been wounded in the war.“I didn’t want to die young,” said Danyil, whose last name the Guardian is withholding due to concerns for his safety if he returns toUkrainenow.His view of current,US-brokered negotiationsare: “There are peace talks now but unless the Russian government is overthrown nothing is going to change. They will continue to bomb.”After 10 months of working in a Czech automobile plant in the northern region of Liberec, Danyil traveled to the US on 4 January 2023, thanks to a Biden administration program,Uniting for Ukraine, that offered a temporary sanctuary to Ukrainians fleeing the Russian aggression.But soon afterDonald Trumptook office again in January, he suspended the Uniting for Ukraine policy, pausing admissions under the program and barring those already in the US from renewing their two-year work permits and deportation protections.Weeks later, theTrump administrationpaused all immigration applications for further relief by those who arrived under Uniting for Ukraine and other Biden-era processes that relied on a policy known as parole and Trump has blocked pathways to permanent legal status.The moves have pushed hundreds of thousands into a state of insecurity after they were welcomed to a safe haven.As of December 2024, the US had 240,000 Ukrainians with US sponsors under the Uniting for Ukraine program, including Danyil, according to government figures obtained by the Guardian.Unable to renew their parole status or apply for another temporary legal status, Danyil and the other thousands of immigrants could lose their permits and could end up undocumented and vulnerable to deportation.Danyil said his parole status ended at the beginning of this year and while he has applied for renewal, he hasn’t received a response from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services.“I don’t want to stay here illegally but I don’t want to go back to Ukraine. I am afraid, I am young, I want to live,” he said.Because Ukrainian newcomers were only given permission to live in the US for two-year increments, many applied for other legal shelters, including Temporary Protected Status (TPS).Earlier in January, Joe Biden’s homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas,extended Ukraine’s designation for TPSthrough October 2026. As of September 2024, 63,425 Ukrainians had been granted TPS in the US.Danyilsaid he applied for TPS this March, but has not yet received a response.Trump has directed the Department of Homeland Security to re-evaluate TPS designations of all countries, and his administration has already announced it will phase out protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from countries under ongoing armed conflicts.In response, the agency has said that itwould revokethe temporary legal status of more than 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans welcomed into the US under another Biden-era sponsorship known as CHNV.More recently, the US district judge Edward Chen in San Francisco blocked theTrump administrationfrom terminating the temporary protection program for 350,000 Venezuelan migrants.But with continued administration efforts to repeal protection for immigrants in the country, advocates are worried that officials could also discontinue Ukraine’s TPS designation, leaving Ukrainians afraid to go back to a country still at war with no other valid status in the US.“That’s what has really threatened the safety of over 240,000 Ukrainians,” said Anne Smith, the executive director at Ukraine Immigration Task Force, a nonprofit organization that has helped families from Ukraine find refuge in the US.“There’s a great danger of being deported, and if not deported, then placed in detention for a long time. Given the majority of the Ukrainians who came here on Uniting for Ukraine under humanitarian parole, there really are no legal avenues available to them unless either the Department of Homeland Security lifts the processing of applications suspension or Congress decides to act,” she added.On the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois,introduced a billthat would offer Ukrainians who were granted parole, like Danyil, a temporary guest status, regardless of when they arrived in the US.“When the war started, Republicans across the country opened their hearts and communities to desperately fleeing Ukrainians, even actively petitioning President Biden to protect them from deportation. So far, not a single Republican has cosponsored my bill. But I urge them to join this simple act of American compassion. Standing up to dictators and speaking out for victims of war should never be a partisan issue,” Durbinsaid in a recent press release.Illinois is now home to 57,000 Ukrainians brought to the US under Uniting for Ukraine and another 65,000 reside in New Jersey and New York.The Leonid Foundation, named after a Ukrainian man who was killedin Mariupolduring the Russian assault of 2022, has helped more than 3,000 Ukrainian refugees relocate to New Jersey since the war started, according to Anna Move, the organization’s president.The foundation helped Danyil find a home in central New Jersey. He works mounting television sets in people’s homes and is saving money hopefully to go to college. Meanwhile, he assists wounded Ukrainian soldiers who come to the US to get their prosthetics.He said: “A lot of people like me dream of staying in the US because there’s an opportunity. I am afraid of going back, I’ve seen those soldiers.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS foreign policyDonald TrumpUS politicsUkraineUS immigrationEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A leisurely stroll down the canals? A family outing? These details are lost to time, but others are hard to erase completely.View image in fullscreenThe dates on packaging found in a coot’s nest in an Amsterdam canalPhotograph: Auke-Florian HiemstraThis meal left a permanent mark on the local environment when a nesting coot found the discarded McChicken wrapper and decided to use it to line its nest, where it remained.“It really shows that it’s not just us humans who are writing history, but also these birds are taking notes, keeping a score and then documenting our throwaway society,” said the nest biologist Auke-Florian Hiemstra, who has been researching the influence of the Anthropocene era on birds’ nests in Amsterdam’s canals.Hiemstra is a researcher who works on animal architecture and specialises in builds made with artificial material. When investigating nests in the canals, he found a variety of old packaging discarded from the early 1990s up to last year.The Eurasian coot only started to migrate to Amsterdam in the late 1980s and Hiemstra’s findings of packaging from 1994 could show the entire life span and heritage of the species’ existence in the area.Hiemstra identifies the year from which the packaging originates using best before dates or researching the era in which the logo designs were used.Some of the nests have packaging from more recent foods, which gives researchers a more accurate date of when the nest would have been built. “One nest had a package of fresh milk, and so we knew that the expiry date could not be that far from the day that it was consumed,” he said.Some relics found in the nests include Mars bar packaging advertising the 1994 World Cup, while a more recent nest was made with a layer of face masks, a lasting impact of the waste from the Covid-19 pandemic.While a bird’s nest is usually made from twigs and moss, the abundance of plastics has been helpful for birds in the city where natural items are in short supply.Hiemstra said there would probably be a return of natural nests if people focused on regreening cities and bringing natural water vegetation back, but in the meantime the birds were successfully working with what they had.“We had this very polluted swan nest in Amsterdam, and everyone was talking about it, saying ‘such a shame’ and ‘what a horrible nest’,” he said. “However, the swan was very happy with the nest and it had five chicks, and they all made it to adults. For the swan it was a very successful nest. In a way, the same goes for the coots.“Our litter for them is not a waste product but something very valuable. I really hope we can learn something from these animals to re-evaluate how we think about our materials. These plastics are a wonderful material yet we use them for single use and throw them away.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Now, we are a little bit afraid because it does not fall apart.

They ostentatiously start sweeping a street and speak solemnly about civic duty while the media take photos. The next day it’s over and things go back to how they were before.But not in Indore in Madhya Pradesh. From 2017, when it won the prize for being the cleanest city in the country, it kept winning for eight straight years, until last year.“When you come out of the airport, it feels as though you aren’t in India, it’s so clean,” said Nitisha Agarwal, a corporate executive who travels to Indore frequently for work.Before 2017, Indore had been ranked 25th of 471 towns and cities in the government’s cleanliness rankings.The transformation has covered many aspects of public life, from the way waste is removed and treated to the army of about 850 sweepers and the thousands of differently coloured bins that line even the smallest alley.In many cities, families will keep their home scrupulously clean, but a few feet from their front door rubbish is left lying around.“That other area is seen as someone else’s responsibility and no one sees any contradiction in walking past a stinking pile of rubbish to their clean home,” said Arjun Sehgal, a local chemistry tutor.View image in fullscreenIndian president, Ram Nath Kovind (centre, back) and other ministers present India’s cleanest city award to Indore in 2019.Photograph: Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesIndore was once dotted with fetid garbage dumps where stray cows, pigs and dogs rootled around and added their excrement to the pile, attracting swarms of flies.But now in the early morning, pavements and road dividers are hosed down with recycled water. The garbage vans roll out playing a jingle called Indore Has Become Number One. As the sound approaches, people emerge from their homes with their rubbish.Using GPS tracking, a team of workers monitor the vans’ movements to make sure they are doing their job and not cutting corners. The local government says 100% of household waste is segregated into wet, electronics, plastics, non-plastic, biomedical and hazardous materials.The waste is converted into fuel and compost, which in turn is sold to farmers as manure. Many restaurants have mobile composting vans stationed outside.“The fruit and vegetable market near my house has different bins for different kinds of waste. There is also a machine there which converts the waste to fuel which is used by city buses and as cooking fuel,” said homemaker Neeru Sharma.Riya Raghuvanshi, who lived in Indore for five years, said the push from government had been a success because it had created a sense of civic pride in the city. “It’s worked because there is so much pride in this award. Along with the pride is a determination to maintain the city’s reputation. This has been a great motivator,” she said.View image in fullscreenStreet being cleaned with a broom in Indore.Photograph: Pallava Bagla/Corbis/Getty ImagesResidents have taken up cleanliness as their own personal responsibility, according to Prabhnit Sawhney, a petrol pump owner. “I’ve seen people stopping someone who littered. I’ve seen drivers stop their car when they see rubbish on the street to remove it. It’s become a kind of mission that inspires everyone,” he said.It took intensive public awareness campaigns to bring about the new behaviour. Schoolchildren were asked to take oaths to keep the city clean. CCTV cameras were installed and anyone who was identified as having dropped rubbish was fined.Cleanliness competitions were launched. Religious leaders were roped in to invoke religious texts to back up the need for hygiene. During the Hindu festival of Holi, when streets and buildings become stained with bright colours, extra vehicles and water tankers come out to hose the city down.Sawhney believes Indore’s success could be replicated elsewhere in India if local governments dedicate themselves to it. “You need a willing public, a determined government, and here and there you need very energetic, proactive individuals to keep up the momentum,” he said. “Only then will habits going back generations change.”Explore more on these topicsWasteThe alternativesIndiaSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ahead of their second, they explain how they protected one another amid sudden fame – and how queer love and Davina McCall inspired themFri 4 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 11.21 EDTShareWet Leg’s Rhian Teasdale looks like a pop star from a different era. She walks into a bar in east London wearing a giant, floor-length pale-pink padded coat. She has bleached eyebrows, dip-dyed hair, drawn-on freckles and jewels stuck to her nails and teeth. For a moment, Top of the Pops could be on primetime TV and a copy of Smash Hits in my bag. But then Wet Leg’s story always did feel anachronistic. In 2021, they managed what indie bands don’t often manage any more and became an overnight success. That June, they released their first single, Chaise Longue, a deadpan, perfectly simple and cheerfully daft megahit; they conquered the US and Japan, toured arenas and topped the album charts with their scathing, self-titled debut, scoring two Brit awards and two Grammys.They were still touring that album last summer, supporting Foo Fighters in stadiums. But eventually they found time to make a new one. Trailed by the punchy, indie-sleazy Catch These Fists, Moisturizer otherwise largely ditches their trademark death-stare sarcasm in favour of stompy but soppy love songs. Teasdale lives in London and we are meeting in person, but Hester Chambers, the band’s co-founder and lead guitarist, lives on the Isle of Wight, where Wet Leg met and formed. (Having written their debut alone, this time, they co-wrote with drummer Henry Holmes, guitarist Joshua Mobaraki and bassist Ellis Durand.) Tracking Chambers down will prove a trickier task, but more on that later.Watch the video for Catch These Fists.Today, Teasdale is fresh from getting a tattoo. When we meet, she reveals the new vine-like shapes snaking up the sides of her stomach. “It’s the same artist that did this,” she says, showing me more of her ink. “Which is kind of like a three-headed spider lady. She does loads of elves and mythical beings and swords and wizards.” There has always been something a bit otherworldly about Wet Leg. Their early videos were jokey but unnerving, a creepy hybrid of folklore and pop culture. They appeared at the Brits accompanied by Morris dancers. For Moisturizer’s Aphex-Twin-esque artwork, a goblin-like Teasdale stares at the camera, while Chambers hides her face. Their nails are long, sharp and deadly looking. They are upping the uncanny.But in spring 2021, Wet Leg were just a hopeful guitar band, signed to Domino, with Chaise Longue in their back pocket. What did Teasdale think was going to happen next? “We were completely naive and, in some ways, that was good,” she says. “I just thought we were going to keep on working our regular jobs. Even if you’re quite high up on a festival bill, you can’t support yourself from that alone, especially in a band with five people.”View image in fullscreenTeasdale and Chambers with their two Brit awards in February 2023.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty ImagesWhat actually happened was that Wet Leg toured the world solidly for three years, playing countless festivals – Dave Grohl came out to scream with them at Coachella – and as support for Harry Styles’ global arena tour after he covered their single Wet Dream on BBC Radio 1. Was there any danger of burnout? “I did get homesick a few times,” Teasdale concedes. “I had a couple of emergency flights, where I’d fly home for one day and my partner would cook me dinner and then I’d go again.” What did she want when she got home? “Beans. Cheese and beans on toast.” Luxury! “Sometimes withMarmite,” she sighs, happily.In earlier interviews, Wet Leg sometimes seemed baffled by all the attention. Their interviews could be vague and peppered with in-jokes; it rarely looked as if they were taking themselves seriously. Watching footage of themon the Grammys red carpetshows a distinct clash between the sincerity of a US reporter and two British women gamely giving it a go. Chambers mostly looks alarmed, while Teasdale describes her choice of outfit with a deadpan: “I just wanted to get my bum out.”Being from the Isle of Wight, Teasdale says now: “To find yourself at some weird Grammys afterparty together, it’s just funny. It’s extremely easy to realise how ridiculous everything is, because we’ve known each other from being teenagers.” It is not that they weren’t taking it seriously. “I can’t really speak for the others, but I’ve had so many weird jobs. And whatever weird job I’ve had, something in me does want to try really hard.” What’s the weirdest? “I was a character at a theme park,” she says, a little reluctantly. Go on … “I was this thing called a Squawk Bird, a puppet you have to get inside. You have to make all the sounds.”View image in fullscreenTeasdale and Chambers at Coachella in California in 2023.Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for CoachellaThe theme park was on the Isle of Wight, where three of the band live. After a few days of trying to arrange a chat with Chambers, she asks if she can instead answer my questions by email. Chambers has anxiety. “My initial thought was: ‘Sorry, I can’t, I’m too scared,’” she writes. “These past years have been a crash course in learning about myself, and one of those [lessons] is that my social anxiety won’t be therapied away.”Chambers admits that certain aspects of band life can be challenging. “Sometimes I have no idea how I manage to get on the stage,” she writes. “Rhian said to me, feel the fear and do it anyway. That’s helped a lot. We never thought it would get this far, so it wasn’t really a problem before. But now we’re here.” What did getting here feel like? “It was such a weird and unexpected journey [that] I assumed it would be over before we knew it, like a long summer holiday, just riding the wave before it spat us out. I still have that voice saying ‘Don’t get too comfy’, but it’s drowned out a little by the excitement of having made a second record and getting to play some more gigs together.”I ask Teasdale if she feels protective towards Chambers. She isn’t sure. “Yeah? But then I don’t know if it’s because I’m more naive than Hester. Hester is very intelligent, so I think, in our own ways, we’re both protective of each other.”View image in fullscreenTheir secret show at the Moth Club in London last month.Photograph: Alice BackhamIn early 2024, having finally finished touring, the band stayed in an Airbnb in Southwold, Suffolk, and started working on the songs that would become Moisturizer. In one not-so-serious interview in summer 2022, they claimed to have already written and finished a second album. “That was a lie,” Teasdale says, serenely. “Everyone was like: ‘Don’t you feel the pressure? Aren’t you scared?’ So we just said we’d done it.”But wasn’t she scared? “Of course,” she says. “There’s that noise in your head that we didn’t have last time. But it’s just not very helpful. And it’s helped so much, having the five of us writing together, because sometimes I’d go down in the morning and be like: ‘I just can’t. I don’t have anything to give today, nothing sounds like music.’ And Ellis would just be like: ‘Don’t worry about it, dude.’”In a sign of how much the music industry has changed, the Airbnb was an extravagance. “Something I’ve learned the hard way is that the more money you chuck at something, the worse it is creatively,” says Teasdale. “The more money you spend on something, the less it becomes yours. That’s a really freeing observation. Just having a good idea is sometimes the strongest …” She catches herself and breaks into a mocking, singsong voice. “A good idea and a pure heart,” she jokes. “Please don’t write that.”View image in fullscreen‘We were completely naive and, in some ways, that was good.’Photograph: Alice BackhamRather than trying to replicate the Chaise Longue formula, Wet Leg simplified everything, shooting for songs that would be fun to play live. As a result, Moisturizer has more muscle than its predecessor. There is a hint of Nine Inch Nails and Post-era Björk; most of its tracks would tear up an indie disco dancefloor.Its subject matter is also more straightforward. There are still a couple of scorching kiss-offs: Catch These Fists is about being chatted up by a sleazy guy (“I just threw up in my mouth / When he just tried to ask me out”), while Mangetout gives short shrift to a “washed-up, irrelevant” enemy, telling him to “get lost forever”. But the record generally steps away from caustic put-downs and radiates romance.Why? Love, of course. Teasdale met her partner at a festival in Portugal, in the thick of the madness, at the end of 2021. It was the first time Wet Leg had played outside the UK. “We were all so excited,” she says. And then? “It was love at first sight. Literally. It was just an energy. It was just like: oh.Ohhh!Because of course I wasn’t looking for love, in any capacity, at all. But that’s what they say, isn’t it? It always comes when you least expect it.”Her partner is non-binary; Teasdale prefers not to reveal their identity. Until that moment, Teasdale had always assumed that she was straight. “It’s not very mysterious,” she says. “The thing with queer love, as well, is that, if you’re female-presenting, people assume you’re best friends.”View image in fullscreen(From left)Henry Holmes, Hester Chambers, Joshua Mobaraki, Ellis Durand and Rhian Teasdale at the Grammys in Los Angeles in February 2024.Photograph: Jason Armond/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesWhen Wet Leg were writing their first album, Teasdale was nursing a broken heart. During the band’s ascent, the ex-boyfriend in question gave an interview to the Sunday Times about how he inspired the songs, which provoked a deserved backlash. “It was pretty shit,” she says, quietly, conscious of widening the conversation to “how often people – especially women – have their work or contributions overshadowed or claimed by others” in all fields, not just music.Teasdale used to be a cynic about love, she explains, and says she had never been able to write a love song before – at least one that was “lusting over a guy. Maybe that was something in my subconscious that was just … very gay,” she laughs. “It just feels so much more empowering to write it about a non-man.” That sense of empowerment has also expanded into their image: Teasdale says she feels far less inclined to cover up these days.How does Teasdale’s love story fit in with what Chambers, who is in a long-term relationship with Mobaraki, has experienced over the past three years? “The theme was pretty prevalent early on in Rhian’s lyrics and it made me really happy to see my friend so happy and in love that she wrote about it,” Chambers says. She points out that she had never written a love song before this record, either, but has also broken that barrier, in a way. “Don’t Speak is a song I wrote as Josh, to me. Does that still count?”The record opens with CPR, a stomping melodrama about falling deep and hard; Jennifer’s Body, named after the cult horror film, is a declaration of obsessive love. “The first time I watched it, I would have been a straight teenager and was just like: ‘Oh, this is a cute film,’” says Teasdale. She has since picked up on its queer subtext. “It’s so funny. I’ve been with my partner for three years now and I’m still having these epiphanies, literally daily.”‘Saying you’re in a jangle-pop band is a red flag’: the Tubs talk speed, squalor and their glorious second albumRead moreThere are odes to domesticity, too, such as the lovely, lilting Davina McCall. “It’s a really soppy love song. Me and my partner were watching Big Brother, and I know she isn’t presenting the new one, but it made me think of watching Big Brother as a teenager, and how iconic she was, and that catchphrase: ‘I’m coming to get you.’” It turns out that McCall was also an early fan of the band. “When we were first starting to play shows, she tagged us in a post and she was at a show with a Wet Leg T-shirt on. We were all obviously super-stoked.”Does McCall know she has a song named after her? “No! I feel like I need to tell her. I feel like that would be the right thing to do.”When I tell McCall, she sends an ecstatic video note about how much she loves the band and how sorry she was that a prior engagement meant she had to turn down their invitation to a secret show last week. “Please invite me again,” she says, “because you’ve made my life. Bearing in mind I’m a 57-year-old woman, I’m not their natural fan, but I think they are ace: really cool, love the lyrics, love the music, love the attitude. They’re fucking amazing.”It is strange to hear Teasdale talk about what excited them all first time around: being tagged by McCall, playing in Europe for the very first time. Given how much Wet Leg exceeded their own wildest expectations, are they having to reconsider what they want from the band? “Going with the flow is part of the ambition,” says Teasdale. “It’s not: ‘What accolades do we want? What slots do we want to have?’ My ambitions, personally, are to just make something that I can look back on and be like: ‘Oh, that was really fun to make, I’m happy with that.’” She adopts a silly voice. “Taking it seriously, but not taking yourself too seriously,” she says, with a grimace. “That classic chestnut.”Having achieved world domination, they are about to find out what happens next. I ask Chambers if she is ready. “We’re heading back into the madness, ready or not,” she replies. “This weird dream just keeps going. I’m down to clown.”Moisturizer is released on 11 July on DominoExplore more on these topicsWet LegIndiePop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

I’ll be forced to return home to the very poverty I thought I had escaped when I moved to the city.”tariff graphicOn Wednesday, Trump unveiled what he claimed were “reciprocal” tariffs, overturning decades of global trade policy.The tariff rates, which are due to come into force on 9 April,range from 10% to 50%and were calculated with whateconomists labelled an “idiotic” formula, penalising countries that have the highest trade surpluses with the US relative to their imports from the US.Dr Ratjomose Machema, a lecturer in economics at the National University of Lesotho, said: “I don’t understand how this is a reciprocal tariff because we really don’t charge that much in tariffs.”Lesotho, which has a population of 2.3 million, was hit with the highest rate. In Africa, it was followed by Madagascar, a vanilla exporter, with a tariff of 47%; Botswana, a diamond producer, on 37%; oil-rich Angola with 32%; and the continent’s most industrialised economy, South Africa, on 30%.View image in fullscreenMost garment worker jobs in Lesotho are paid the monthly minimum wage of $146-$163 and are nevertheless highly sought after.Photograph: Roberta Ciuccio/AFP/GettyLike thehard-hit, south-east Asian economies, the poor majority in these countries cannot afford expensive American products. In recent decades, China has overtaken western countries to become the largest trading partner of most African countries.According tothe African Growth and Opportunities Act (Agoa) US data portal, Lesotho exported $237m of goods last year to the US and imported $2.8m. Agoa, which has allowed tariff-free access to the US market for thousands of product types since 2000, created a thriving garment industry, accounting forabout 20% of GDP.There are about30,000 garment workersin Lesotho, mostly women, with 12,000 making clothes for US brands including Levi’s, Calvin Klein and Walmart in Chinese- and Taiwanese-owned factories. While most of the jobs pay the monthly minimum wage of $146-$163, they are still highly sought after in the poor, largely informal economy.In Madagascar, which has a population of about 32 million, Agoa has also nurtured a significant garment sector, which employsabout 180,000 peoplein a country where GDP per head is just $575. In 2024, the island nationexported $733m of goods to the US, with clothing the top export, followed by vanilla.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reuveni had few, if any, to offer, conceding that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed from the US and sent to El Salvador. He could not cite any authority held by theTrump administrationto arrest Abrego Garcia in Maryland.“I’m also frustrated that I have no answers for you for a lot of these questions,” he said.Reuveni said, “I don’t know,” when asked why Abrego Garcia was sent toEl Salvador, which has a history rife with human rights abuses.Abrego Garcia’s wife, US citizen Jennifer Vasquez Sura, hasn’t spoken to him since he was flown to his native El Salvador last month and imprisoned. She urged her supporters to keep fighting for him “and all the Kilmars out there whose stories are still waiting to be heard”.View image in fullscreenJennifer Vasquez Sura, the wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, speaks during a news conference in Hyattsville, Maryland, on Friday.Photograph: José Luis Magaña/AP“To all the wives, mothers, children who also face this cruel separation, I stand with you in this bond of pain,” she said during the rally at a community center in Hyattsville,Maryland. “It’s a journey that no one ever should ever have to suffer, a nightmare that feels endless.”The campaign to reunite the couple will shift to a courtroom in Greenbelt, Maryland, a suburb of Washington DC.The White House has cast Abrego Garcia, 29, as an MS-13 gang member and assert that US courts lack jurisdiction over the matter because the Salvadoran national is no longer in the US.Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have countered that there is no evidence he was in MS-13. The allegation is based on a confidential informant’s claim in 2019 that Abrego Garcia was a member of a chapter in New York, where he has never lived.Abrego Garcia’s mistaken deportation, described by the White House as an “administrative error”, has outraged many and raised concerns about expelling noncitizens who were granted permission to be in the US.Abrego Garcia had a permit from the Department of Homeland Security to legally work in the US, his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. He served as a sheet metal apprentice and was pursuing his journeyman license.‘He is not a gang member’: outrage as US deports makeup artist to El Salvador prison for crown tattoosRead moreHe fled El Salvador around 2011 because he and his family were facing threats by local gangs. In 2019, aUS immigrationjudge granted him protection from deportation to El Salvador because he was likely to face gang persecution. He was released and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) did not appeal the decision or try to deport him to another country.Abrego Garcia later married Vasquez Sura. The couple are parents to their son and her two children from a previous relationship.“If I had all the money in the world, I would spend it all just to buy one thing: a phone call to hear Kilmar’s voice again,” Vasquez Sura said. “Kilmar, if you can hear me, I miss you so much, and I’m doing the best to fight for you and our children.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsMarylandEl SalvadorTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS immigrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, last week Trinidad’s supreme court upheld a government appeal against the ruling and recriminalised the act, dealing a hammer blow to LGBTQ+ rights in the Caribbean country and prompting the UK Foreign Office to update its advice for LGBTQ+ travellers.The 2018 case was brought by Jason Jones, an LGBTQ+ activist. This week he said he would continue the fight before the privy council – Trinidad’s final court of appeal. Central to his argument will be the controversial “savings clause”, which former British empire jurisdictions such as Trinidad can revert to whenever a challenge is made to their constitution.“This backwards step revolves around the savings clause, which was designed as an instrument for the smooth transition of power upon independence in 1962 to protect the laws we had for hundreds of years. That clause is now being used against democracy in our country,” said Jones.Jones argues that because Trinidad and Tobago altered its sexual offences legislation three times – in 1976 when it became a republic, in 1986, and in 2000 – the law can no longer be classified as “saved”.“These are Trinidadian laws,” he said. “Parliament is hiding its homophobic bigotry behind an archaic clause that serves no useful purpose in a modern democratic country.”The mood among Trinidad’s LGBTQ+ people is a far cry from their tears of joy on the steps of Port of Spain’s Hall of Justice seven years ago. Back then, the judge Devindra Rampersad delivered a poeticrulingthat swept away nearly a century of discrimination enshrined in law.“This is a case about the dignity of the person, not the will of the majority or any religious view,” Rampersad said at the time. “History has proven that the two do not always coincide.”For the law to be constitutional, he added, every Trinidadian must be free “to make decisions as to whom he or she loves”.In contrast, the weighty 196-page report from which the appeal judge Nolan Bereaux read in overturning Jones v AG was clinical, claiming, “Judges cannot change the law. We give effect to parliament’s intention. Buggery remains a crime in Trinidad and Tobago.”The judgment reverted to a familiar trope that the law is never actually enforced in practice. “No one has been charged or punished … for engaging in consensual anal sex in the privacy of his or her home,” it said.But LGBTQ+ activists say enforcement is not the point. Jones’s victory was achieved on the grounds that the law denied him his human rights and right to privacy.The cofounder of Pride TT, Kennedy Maraj, described last week’s ruling as a devastating setback and a betrayal by the justice system. “It tells LGBTQ+ individuals their very existence remains subject to legal scrutiny, that progress is fragile and that hard-won rights can be overturned,” Maraj said.Patrick Lee Loy came out to his family at 30. As one of few openly gay Trinidadian men, he said he felt “shocked and angry that, as a community, we will not be free to express who we love”.Although Trinidad is notoriously hedonistic – its exuberance plain to see at carnival where hundreds of thousands of straight, gay, lesbian and trans Trinidadians parade the streets wearing next to nothing – the undercurrent of religious piety and evenextremismthat runs through its Catholic, Hindu, Anglican, Muslim and evangelical traditionalists heavily influences opinions on sexual freedom.Whether it is safe to be gay in Trinidad is a complex question – more so than in Jamaica, where the answer is an outright no. Away from the more liberal confines of the capital, there are many communities where to be gay puts you in danger.“I know a few gay men who were murdered,” said Loy. “The crimes were never solved. In one instance, the family did not push for an investigation in case it brought up too many ghosts.“I have friends who only meet at their home. When we go out to a restaurant or bar, they will not come. They fear for their jobs, families and status. Now that people feel the government will not protect its citizens, some may feel it is easier to target us.”Jones’s 2018 case triggered a wave of similar cases across the Commonwealth, including in India where homosexuality was decriminalised just months after Trinidad. A new progressive era appeared to have dawned in the global south.In Trinidad, however, the government immediately appealed against the decision – a move designed to reassure its religious, socially conservative electorate. Backlogs delayed the case, which has taken seven years to be heard by the country’s highest court.The ruling echoed sentiments in a similar case thrown out byJamaica’s supreme courtin 2023 that such matters were for parliament to decide.If the privy council rules in favour of Trinidad’s government, Jones says it is time to leave the institution, which “can no longer be of useful service if hamstrung by the savings clause”.Explore more on these topicsTrinidad and TobagoLGBTQ+ rightsHuman rightsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

This is thesecond timethe president will have delayed the ban or sale of the social media app, and will punt the deadline to 75 days from now.The TikTok deal “requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed”, Trumpannouncedon his Truth Social platform on Friday.ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, issued a statement in response to the executive order: “ByteDance has been in discussion with the US government regarding a potential solution forTikTokUS. An agreement has not been executed. There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law.”China put a possible deal on hold this week after Trump announced his sweeping tariffs, according to Reuters.Congresspassed a law last yearforcing TikTok to either divest or sell its assets in the US. The law stemmed from concerns that the app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, could use the social media platform to manipulate Americans. The first deadline to ban or force the sale of the app was 19 January. But, on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to delay that decision to 5 April. Now the new deadline will be in mid-June.Earlier this week, the president met with potential buyers for TikTok and said his administration is“very close” to a deal. Among those who’ve reportedly thrown in bids are a consortium of investors led by the software giant Oracle, asset manager Blackstone, Amazon, Walmart, billionaire Frank McCourt, a crypto foundation, and the founder of the adult website OnlyFans.TikTok is a tremendously popular social media app with 170 million users in the US. Investors and corporations see huge appeal with owning the app and its secretive algorithm.ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok and in previous court filings said a divestiture “is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally”.After announcingsweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, Trump hinted on Thursday aboard Air Force One that he might lessen the trade penalties onChinaif ByteDance were to approve a sale. The country faces a 54% tariff on goods imported to the US.“We have a situation withTikTokwhere China will probably say we’ll approve a deal, but will you do something on the tariffs.

But the South Korean constitutional court’s decision on Friday to oustYoon Suk Yeolfrom office may have restored the public’s faith in their democracy.For 22 minutes, millions of South Koreans held their breath as the chief justice of the constitutional court, Moon Hyung-bae, began delivering the court’s verdict on Yoon’s impeachment over hischaotic declaration of martial lawin December.With each damning statement, Moon raised the hopes of the crowds outside who had been demanding the suspended president’s permanent removal from office.Yoon’s actions, he said, had constituted “a serious challenge to democracy”, adding that the 64-year-old conservative populist had “committed a grave betrayal of the people’s trust” in bringing about South Korea’s worst political crisis since it became a democracy in the late 1980s.When Moon finally uttered the words: “The defendant president Yoon Suk Yeol is hereby removed from office,” the crowd erupted with cheers.The ruling sets in motion a 60-day countdown to elect a new leader, the date to be confirmed within 10 days by the acting president, Han Duck-soo.Political parties are scrambling to select candidates, with the Democratic party’s Lee Jae-myung currently leading the polls. Yoon’s conservative People Power party has the unenviable task of selecting a candidate who is untainted by association with Yoon’s failed administration.The national assembly’s first impeachment vote in December was an opportunity for the party to distance itself from Yoon. Instead, People Power MPs doubled down, boycotting the vote and continuing to back their embattled leader.They then amplified what many believe to be Yoon’s groundless claims that previous elections, including a national assembly vote earlier in the year, had been mired in voting fraud. The conspiracy theories found fertile ground among Yoon’s supporters, who adoptedTrump-style slogans such as “stop the steal”as they took to the streets.View image in fullscreenCrowds shouting slogans and holding posters reading: ‘Let’s build a democratic government’ during a rally in Seoul on Friday.Photograph: Lee Jin-man/APBy invoking cold war language about “pro-North Korean, anti-state forces” to describe his political opponents, analysts said Yoondeepened the political dividein an already polarised country.Whoever becomes president later this year faces the unenviable task of healing those divisions and rebuilding trust in the democratic institutions that Yoon so casually undermined.The ruling marked the end of a tumultuous three years for the conservative populist. The former senior prosecutor who had led the case for impeachment against the then president,Park Geun-hyein 2017, now has the same ignominious postscript to his presidency.Having won the 2022 election – beating the liberal Lee by the slimmest of margins – Yoon was initially admired as an assertive and strong-willed leader, until those qualities were exposed as an unwillingness to compromise or accept criticism.As he struggled to implement budgets and key policies in the opposition-controlled national assembly, Yoon grew increasingly irritable, targeting critical journalists, confronting striking doctors, blocking attempts to investigate corruption allegations involving the first lady, Kim Keon Hee, and labelling opposition MPs as a “den of criminals” working in cahoots with communist North Korea.Human rights activists welcomed Friday’s verdict. In a statement, Human Rights Watch said Yoon’s attempt to impose martial law had “posed a grave threat to human rights and the rule of law”.It added: “If martial law had been maintained, South Koreans would have faced the risk of arrest and detention without trial as well as severe restrictions on their freedom of expression and assembly, among other human rights violations. The constitutional court’s ruling was a decisive step to uphold human rights protections and democratic values.”Some characterise Yoon’s removal as the start of a process to restore public faith in South Korea as a liberal democracy with a successful economy and a culture admired around the world.Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the court’s verdict had “removed a major source of uncertainty. And not a moment too soon, given how the next administration in Seoul must navigate North Korea’s military threats, China’s diplomatic pressure, and Trump’s trade tariffs”.It is a sentiment shared by anti-Yoon protesters who had gathered outdoors to watch a live broadcast of the verdict. When his removal was announced, they cheered, danced and cried. “When the dismissal was finally declared, the cheers were so loud it felt like the rally was being swept away,” said Kim Min-ji, a 25-year-old protester. “We cried tears and shouted that we, the citizens, had won!”But the saga is far from over. Few believe that candidates and voters in the forthcoming presidential election will be able to put the acrimony of the past four months behind them, while Yoon faces a separate criminal trial on charges of insurrection – a crime that carries a maximum term of life imprisonment or the death penalty.“If people start refusing to accept any election outcome that is unfavourable to them, the other side will start doing the same,” said Kim Tae-hyung, a professor at Soongsil University in Seoul. “If that cycle continues, trust in democracy will completely collapse.”Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaYoon Suk YeolAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

We appeal to the United States and its trading partners to work constructively to resolve trade tensions and reduce uncertainty.”‘There are no winners’: global companies respond to Trump tariffsRead moreChina retaliated on Friday, accusing the US of “bullying” and signalling a new front in the intensifying global trade war.The Chinese finance ministry said it would impose additional tariffs of 34% on all US goods from 10 April as a countermeasure to sweeping border taxes announced by the US president on Wednesday.Trump’s“liberation day” tariffsof up to 50% on imports to the US had alreadywiped trillions of dollars off the valueof the world’s biggest companies on Thursday amid heightened fears of a US recession.The sell-off continued into Friday, with Asian and European markets falling.

The NSE Nifty Pharma index fell more than 6% on Friday.Pharmaceutical companies had experienced a boost on Thursday as the sector was believed to have been exempted from the US import duties.In the UK, a Treasury minister said the government was “negotiating intensively” and “at pace” to secure a deal with the US. The government is also consulting on possible retaliatory action.The exchequer secretary to the Treasury, James Murray, told Sky News: “The next stage of engagement is to ask [for companies’] input about what possible measures would look like in terms of the UK response because we want to involve businesses in that decision, and we need to be clear that we keep all options on the table … We reserve the right to retaliate but we want a deal, and our full focus is on that.”Oil graphicBond prices have jumped across Europe and the US amid fears over global economic growth.UK government bonds – seen as a safe haven asset – increased in value, sending the yield, or effective interest rate, plummeting. The two-year UK government bond yield fell to its lowest level since last September, 0.29 percentage points lower than when US tariffs were announced. The 10-year gilt was 0.1% lower, taking it to the lowest level since February.The falls will ease the pressure on the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who announced cuts to welfare spending in the spring statement largely to cover an increase in borrowing costs earlier this year.Traders also ramped up their bets on cuts to UK interest rates. The money markets now expect about 74 basis points of cuts by the Bank of England this year. That shows that three more quarter-point rate cuts are almost fully priced in.A cut, from thecurrent level of 4.5%, at the Bank’s next rate-setting meeting in early May is now an 86% chance, up from about 75% on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)Kristalina GeorgievaTrump tariffsGlobal economyStock marketsInternational tradeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Among the common themes raised by opponents were inconsistency with the treaty, flaws or inadequacies in the bill development process and the negative effect of the bill on social cohesion.The Act party argues that Māori have been afforded different political and legal rights and privileges compared with non-Māori because of the principles that have flowed from theTreaty of Waitangi– New Zealand’s founding document that is instrumental in upholding Māori rights.The bill has sparked strident criticism from lawyers, academics and the public, who believe Act’s principles will weaken Māori rights and remove checks on the crown. It has promptedmass meetingsof Māori leaders, and thelargest ever protest on Māori rights.The bill’s proponent, Act leader David Seymour, said that high-profile bills often result in committee submissions that “don’t reflect public opinion”.“Opponents will make much of the balance of submissions, but if they believed the public opposed the bill they could call for a referendum where everyone votes,” he said in a statement after the report.As part of its coalition agreement with Act, National promised it would support the bill through its first reading and the select committee process. But both National and the third coalition partner, New Zealand First, have said they will vote it down at the second reading.Prime minister Christopher Luxon told media on Tuesday the committee had been overwhelmed with the number of submissions.“The positions on the treaty principles bill are well known on all sides of that debate and what’s important now is to actually wrap it up and actually move it forward,” he said.Explore more on these topicsMāoriNew ZealandNew Zealand politicsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

I will always pray for our beloved Republic of Korea and its citizens.”While anti-Yoon protesters celebrated the court’s decision – many of them in tears – media reports said some of his supporters had starting damaging police vehicles near the court building.View image in fullscreenImpeached South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol at an earlier hearing in SeoulPhotograph: Kim Hong-Ji/APIn the court ruling, broadcast live, the acting chief justice, Moon Hyung-bae, said the decision had been unanimous. “We hereby pronounce the following ruling, with the unanimous agreement of all Justices.“(We) dismiss respondent PresidentYoon Suk Yeol.”As crowds outside hung onto his every word, Moon said Yoon had violated his duty as president by taking actions that were beyond the powers granted to him under the constitution. Yoon’s actions, he added, had constituted a serious challenge to democracy.“(Yoon) committed a grave betrayal of the trust of the people, who are the sovereign members of the democratic republic,” Moon said, adding by declaring martial law, Yoon had created chaos in all areas of society, the economy and foreign policy.Moon said: “The defendant not only declared martial law, but also violated the constitution and laws by mobilizing military and police forces to obstruct the exercise of legislative authority. Ultimately, the declaration of martial law in this case violated the substantive requirements for emergency martial law.“Given the grave negative impact on constitutional order and the significant ripple effects of the defendant’s violations, we find that the benefits of upholding the constitution by removing the defendant from office far outweigh the national losses from the removal of a president.”Yoon, who was not in court for the ruling, cannot appeal and must now turn his attention to a separate criminal trial – linked to his martial law declaration – on charges of insurrection.His ruling party said it “solemnly accepts” the constitutional court’s decision. “It is regrettable, but the People Power party solemnly accepts and humbly respects the constitutional court’s decision,” lawmaker Kwon Young-se said. “We extend our sincere apologies to the people.”One of Yoon’s lawyers, Yoon Kap-keun, remained defiant, however, describing the judgement as “completely incomprehensible” and a “purely political decision”.The long-awaited decision on Yoon’s late-night order to impose martial law in early December has exposed deep divisions in South Korean society and alarmed the US and other allies.His opponents and supporters have held large rallies in recent days, although an unprecedented police presence meant protesters were unable to access the immediate vicinity of the court building on Friday. Reports said that 14,000 police officers had been deployed in the capital in anticipation of possible violence, irrespective of which way the court ruled.Yoon’s supporters and lawyers argued that the impeachment proceedings were illegal and that he should be immediately returned to office, three years after the conservative populist was voted to lead Asia’s fourth-biggest economy.A Gallup Korea poll released last week showed 60% of South Koreans said he should be permanently removed from office. His opponents have accused the former prosecutor of abusing his presidential powers in an attempt to suspend democratic institutions and take the country back into its dark authoritarian past.The opposition-controlled national assembly voted to impeach Yoon in mid-December, a fortnight after he imposed martial law in an attempt, he claimed, to prevent “anti-state” opposition forces with North Korean sympathies from destroying the country.Yoon was forced to lift the edict after only six hours, however, after lawmakers defied efforts by security forces to seal off parliament and voted to reject it. Yoon has claimed he never intended to fully impose emergency military rule and has tried to downplay the chaos, pointing out that no one was killed or injured.Yoon became the second South Korean president to be removed from office through impeachment after Park Geun-hye in 2017. If found guilty in his criminal trial, he faces life imprisonment or the death penalty, although South Korea has not carried out an execution since the late 1990s.Explore more on these topicsYoon Suk YeolSouth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He launched into animpassioned tirade against Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg, revisiting the fraught themes of the pandemic, while Albanese stood beside him, visibly uneasy. After that, Andrews largely stayed off the campaign trail.But the fears proved unfounded.Victoriaswung hard against the Coalition, securing Labor the seats it needed to form government and delivering the best two-party preferred result of all the states at 54.8%. Six months later, Andrews was also re-elected with an increased majority.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterThree years on, a similar situation is unfolding with federal Labor increasingly nervous of being linked to Andrews’ successor,Jacinta Allan.While Albanese campaigned alongside the West Australian premier, Roger Cook, on Monday and the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, on Tuesday, when he was in Melbourne on Wednesday and Thursday, Allan was notably absent.Asked why, Albanese blamed “this little thing called parliament”. Allan offered the same excuse, though parliament sitting has hardly impeded in the past.At the same time, the Coalition leader, Peter Dutton, who needs to pick up seats in Victoria to have any hope of forming government, did all he could to link the two leaders.What do Peter Dutton’s proposed funding cuts really mean for Melbourne’s long-awaited airport rail?Read moreHe accused Albanese of being “joined at the hip” with Allan when it came to the Suburban Rail Loop – a project from which he pledged to pull $2.2bn in federal funding.Both his state and federal colleagues have been hammering the line: “A vote for Anthony Albanese is a vote for Jacinta Allan.” A recent Liberal flyer branded them “double trouble for Victorians”, highlighting the state’s debt andrising crime rates.“The same thing happens every single election,” one state Labor MP said.Another Labor source described the ads as “not new, not unique and not very clever”.But others within the party think this time, it’s different.Liability or scapegoatSince Allan took over as leader, consecutive surveys have shown her personal standing has taken a hit while support for her government has plummeted.Polling published by the Age this weekfound Allan’s “likeability” rating had plunged to -32% in February and March while primary support for her government stands at just 24%, a minor improvement on two months earlier.Some of this may not be entirely of her own making. Like many female leaders, she’s facing a “glass cliff” scenario, stepping into a role after a popular, long-serving male predecessor and inheriting his baggage, including a dire budget situation and rising debt.But there is no denying Allan has also stumbled from one crisis to another, the latest being ahuge spike in crimeandinstability within the police force. Rather than being known for bold policy, she’s become more associated with backflips and backdowns.Given this, it is easy to see how federal Labor is worried her poor standing will rub off on them.The Coalition believes they can pick up as many as nine seats in Victoria, while even the most optimistic Labor sources expect to lose at least three. (The more pessimistic say even traditional Labor strongholds like Bruce and Hawke are now in play.)If it turns into a wipeout, some state Labor MPs concerned about their own chances in 2026 say there’s a possibility Allan could be rolled.“It’s just not sustainable,” one said. “We can’t keep getting battered week after week.”However, some Labor insiders suggest it is unfair to scapegoat Allan for all of the state’s woes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the exception of the ACT, Victoria now boasts the longest-serving Labor government.Six graphs reveal the true state of crime in Victoria and who’s behind itRead moreOne Labor source suggested the party’s dominance in Victoria may have simply worn thin.“The most common refrain I hear is that the government is just tired, there’s too much baggage,” they said. “It’s hard to combat the ‘it’s time factor.’”Another said it wasn’t “all doom and gloom” in Victoria, pointing to the latest BludgerTrack poll, which aggregates voting intention across multiple surveys, showing Labor at 50.5% two-party preferred in Victoria, just behind NSW at 51% and Queensland where it is 46.3%.They acknowledged, however, that Victoria’s polling represented a 4.3% swing away from Labor since last election. By contrast, in New South Wales, the federal vote has held up much better, with just a 1.3% swing away from Labor.Further complicating matters federally is the redistribution, which saw the Labor-held seat of Higgins abolished and about a third of Victorians move into new electorates.“That means for a lot of voters, they’ll have a new local MP, and incumbency is compromised,” a source said.Others believed federal Labor MPs were already laying the groundwork to deflect blame and point the finger at the state if they lost. They argued the real issue was that federal Labor had failed to do the necessary work themselves.One state Labor MP said their federal counterparts had “delivered nothing” for Victoria, with their government “carrying the load” when it came to funding for infrastructure, schools, mental health and family violence.They said some federal MPs had “taken their seats for granted”, many opting not to live in them or attend local events.“The Canberra bubble is very real,” they said.One thing all of Labor could agree on, however, was that the best thing the party had going for it in Victoria was Peter Dutton.They were convinced Victorians – with their undeniable progressive streak – hadn’t forgot Dutton’s comments about beingscared to go out for dinner in Melbourne, his stints as home affairs and health minister or his plans for nuclear energy. They said his hard-man image was also a turn-off in a state that remained deeply wary of his style of politics.This could explain why the Victorian Liberal leader,Brad Battin, has also been conspicuously absent from Dutton’s press conferences so far this campaign – though it’s received considerably less media attention.As for Allan, perhaps one Labor MP summed up the situation: “If we win, then it will be in spite of her. If we lose, it’s because of her.”Explore more on these topicsVictorian politicsAustralian election 2025Anthony AlbaneseJacinta AllanVictoriaanalysisShareReuse this content"

It was a risk, exposing Albanese to hecklers, or worse.This wasn’t just any shopping centre; it was inPeter Dutton’s seat of Dicksonin Brisbane’s northern suburbs. But as he strode into Fitstop gym, the Labor leader was received not as an intruder but a celebrity.“Let’s go defend Medicare!” he shouted to raucous cheers.2:28Hi-vis vests, meeting babies and Trump's tariffs – TLDR: Election 2025 with Krishani Dhanji – videoThe interaction will be a footnote in the history of the 2025 campaign. But it was instructive because it showed something so lacking on the opening day of Albanese’s 2022 campaign: confidence.At a press conference at a nearby Medicare urgent clinic, he demonstrated a quality that has betrayed him so often in the past three years: sharpness.Albanese had found his groove. And after rushing surprise new income tax cuts through parliament on election eve, in the face ofCoalitionresistance, he found his message, too.“Peter Dutton will cut everything except your taxes.”The campaign cocoonIn the sheltered cocoon of the campaign trail, the travelling media don’t get much chance to consume much beyond what’s happening in front of you.That’s partly by design of the advancers and advisers designing the campaign schedule, endlessly moving from one place to another but never really having any time to see beside what they want you to see; but it has been striking to see, even at a distance, how different Albanese’s campaign events have been from Dutton’s.In Dutton’s first, he has interacted outside with the general public just twice: once at an Assyrian cultural festival in Fairfield, then chatting to a few motorists at a Sydney petrol station.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterEvery other event has been closed off, in private areas: an empty brewery on a quiet Saturday, two factories in fenced industrial areas, an empty function room in a far-flung winery, a private dining room in a Chinese restaurant, two rooms full of supporters on his Dickson home turf.Partly it’s security reasons: as evidenced by two Rising Tide protesters gatecrashing events on day one, and his phalanx of burly security heralding his arrivals.From babysitting to keeping a secret, the PM is preferred. But it is the literal pub test where Albo stands out | Peter LewisRead moreThe same group gatecrashed Albanese’s visit to Maitland hospital on Thursday, one of two incursions into his highly controlled campaign after a far-right agitator disrupted his opening-day conference.Dutton may be able to stay out of the public eye, but he can’t avoidmedia scrutinyas easily, and this week was marked by another more significant development.It was the first time in three years of Liberal leadership that Dutton faced sustained, day-after-day pressure to answer questions,to expand on policiesand thought bubbles, to flesh out the half-answers and sledges that he casually drops in the middle of sentences, which has become a hallmark of his communication style.He was also not really saying anything. A week into the campaign, he is not really talking about his policies or making compelling arguments beyond general criticism of the government, leaving himself open to be challenged on details and past remarks.The ‘choice’Albanese and senior Labor strategists didn’t panic as the Coalition inched ahead in the opinion polls midway through 2024. They were confident the contest would tighten and turn in their favour when voters were confronted with the “choice” of a Dutton or an Albanese government.Their task, then, was to define what that “choice” was.The prime minister believes the fatal error in Kamala Harris’s US presidential campaign was a failure to offer a substantial policy alternative to counter Donald Trump’s America-first agenda.Guardian Essential poll: Albanese’s approval rating takes a hit but Labor inches ahead of CoalitionRead moreSince August last year Albanese and his team have been devising what’s described internally as the “offer”, a second-term agenda built on investments in Medicare, education and childcare.The pitch to voters in 2025 would also frame the “risk”, highlighting the supposed threat a Dutton government poses to those essential services.The two aims have converged around Labor’s central campaign commitment to“strengthen” the Medicare universal health system.After that first event in Dickson, Albanese and the health minister, Mark Butler, visited hospitals or healthcare clinics in Perth, Adelaide and Burnie, pledging new funding, spruiking Labor’s promises and warning it would all be in jeopardy if Dutton won on 3 May. That the Coalition has matched each of Labor’s health commitments has done little to dampen the attacks.“Under our prime minister, you’ll get lower taxes and stronger Medicare. Under Peter Dutton, you’re going to get higher taxes and a gutted Medicare,” Butler told a press conference at Adelaide’s Flinders Medical Centre.Butler was a fixture in the campaign’s first week, travelling with Albanese along with the prime minister’s chief-of-staff, Tim Gartrell, media chief, Fi Sugden, and principal private secretary, David Epstein.Butler’s presence was logical given the health focus. But he served another purpose as one of Albanese’s closest confidantes, offering a calming influence in the pressure-cooker of a campaign’s opening round.View image in fullscreenPeter Dutton and Bridget McKenzie speaks to local candidates in Victoria.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPSo too was Penny Wong. The foreign minister was at Albanese’s side for much of the first week as the spectre ofDonald Trump’s “liberation day”hung over the campaign.As Albanese dined with Greg Norman in Melbourne on Wednesday night, he was resigned to what the golfing legend’s friend, Trump, was about to inflict on Australia and the rest of the world at 7am the next morning.The prime minister had danced around Trump and tariffs in the days prior, refusing to pre-empt the announcement or Australia’s response.At 8.21am on Thursday, the dancing stopped. “This is not the act of a friend,” Albanese said.Boxed into a cornerIf Albanese dances, Dutton bobs and weaves like a boxer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He doesn’t get mad or agitated, as Albanese sometimes does; he doesn’t screw up his face at a question he doesn’t like.We asked on Thursday whether he still believes Donald Trump is a “big thinker” who brings “gravitas” to international affairs, as he said in February. Dutton countered that his comment was about Trump’s efforts to negotiate an agreement for Hamas to release Israeli hostages: close, but not quite, we interject mid-answer, saying his comments were actually in relation to Trump’s plan to take over and redevelop Gaza into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.Federal budget 2025: Labor bets big with $17.1bn in tax cuts to win over middle AustraliaRead moreDutton barely pauses, not deviating from his answer, even when confronted in real-time that he’s either misremembering or stretching the truth.Dutton gives little away, in fact. He listens quietly to the questions and answers the way he wants. He doesn’t get snippy or cranky. Even confronted with inconsistencies, he simply rolls on, unhurried and outwardly unfazed.He is under pressure, though, and facing a ticking clock on questions he refuses to answer – there’s only so much longer he can promise that the gas modelling will come “soon”, that he will announce his public service cuts “at an appropriate time”. He’s getting questions on this nearly daily, and even joking that the “anticipation” of journalists will soon wear off.The only visible measure of stress in the week was in a warm brickworks in McMahon, his back to a hot oven, when a large bead of sweat dripped conspicuously down his forehead as he declined to give details of his gas plan, his public service cuts, his nuclear details, and three floated-then-quickly-popped proposals for referendums.Match fitFilomena was restless.The Canberra nonna’s daughter, Ren Knerr, had opened her home in the suburb of Downer to Albanese and the travelling media pack, providing a backdrop for an announcement to “outlaw” supermarket price gouging.Filomena put on a generous spread, including shortbread, a cheesecake and a pile of struffoli, a doughnut-like desert from her native southern Italy. She doesn’t bake as much as she used to. She can’t afford to.But the prime minister was running late, possibly taking a private moment to decompress after an interview on ABC’s Insiders earlier that morning.“Where is the prime minister?” Filomena asked one of Albanese’s staffers, to which they replied “he’ll be here soon”.“Yes, so will Christmas!”Albanese showed up moments later, greeting the family before tucking into the morning tea. The Labor leader cut out carbs to slim down ahead of the 2022 campaign but was happy to indulge this time.“I’m trying to keep fit on the campaign and I’m breaking all the rules,” he joked.View image in fullscreenAnthony Albanese joins Canberra resident Filomena for morning tea.Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPAlbanese is campaign-fit this time. He’s been in election mode since the first week of January.He’s confident, too. A YouGov poll, published just hours before morning tea in Canberra’s inner-north, showed Labor on track to fall just one seat short of a majority, a dramatic turnaround from one month earlier. But Albanese, both publicly and privately, is adamant Labor can retain power in its own right.He spent the first week on the offensive, campaigning in the Liberal-held seats of Dickson in Brisbane, Deakin in Melbourne, Sturt in Adelaide and Braddon in northern Tasmania.The Labor camp is pleased with how smooth things are running. But the veteran political hard-heads close to Albanese and inside campaign HQ know campaigns are long, unexpected disruptions will occur and Dutton will rebound from a bad first week.‘Not getting ahead of myself’The cost-of-living pressure on households, an incumbent killer during the global inflation crisis, won’t ease with a single rate cut, a $150 energy rebate and $5-a-week tax cut in 15 months’ time.Labor remains deeply worried about Melbourne’s outer suburbs, where discontent with Jacinta Allan’s state government threatens half a dozen seats.After the popular premiers Roger Cook and Peter Malinauskas appeared with Albanese in Western Australia and South Australia, Allan was conspicuously absent from the prime minister’s two Melbourne press conferences.With friends like Trump, who needs Aukus?

One, literally, on stage after he addressed a mining union conference in the New South Wales Hunter Valley on Thursday afternoon.Another at a press conference in Perth, when he said he couldn’t rule out forming a coalition with the Greens – the opposite of what he intended to say.Albanese could have tripped up again on Friday, when asked at a Daily Telegraph-hosted event in Blacktown for one word to sum up the politically charged subject of migration.The prime minister paused, hesitated and then replied: “Balanced.” It was a safe and measured response, avoiding a trap that may have so easily ensnared him in 2022.Albanese won the week. Even Dutton may admit that. But it’s just one week.“I’m not getting ahead of myself,” Albanese said. “Elections are hard to win, and there are four weeks left in this campaign.”Guardian Australia political reporters Dan Jervis-Bardy and Josh Butler are travelling with the Albanese and Dutton campaignsExplore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Anthony AlbanesePeter DuttonCoalitionLabor partyAustralian politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

One of the show’s stars this week saidthe UK should follow Australia’s leadin banning children aged under 16 from social media platforms.The ban has been praised in the US and UK, and is described as “world-leading” by the Australian government. Time magazinethis week praisedthe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, for a “remarkable” policy that was “politically uncontroversial” on the basis that both major parties supported it.Left unsaid was all the criticism raised by mental health groups, LGBTQ+ groups and other campaigners during the rushed process to pass the bill in parliament last year. The committee reviewing the bill only reviewed the legislation fora single day, despite over 15,000 submissions being received.Author Jonathan Haidt, who reportedlylobbied politicians in Australiato push the policy before it was adopted and privately dismissed critics of his approach, told theNew York Times this weekthat “it’s going to work. It doesn’t have to be perfect at first, but within a few years it will be very good”. If it worked in Australia, it was going to go global “very quickly”, he said.But nine months out from the policy coming into effect, Australians are still in the dark about how our ban – which waspassed by the parliament in November 2024– will work. And that’s likely to remain the case up to the federal election on 3 May.A trial of age assurance technology is under way, with schoolchildren still being recruited to participate just weeks before the first report is due.Australia passes world-first law banning under-16s from social media despite safety concernsRead moreThe under-16s social media ban is due to come into effect in December, but the government faces a number of hurdles before then, including figuring out what tech to use, and whether the platforms – emboldened by the apparent backing of Donald Trump – will comply.The Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS), a UK-based company recruited by the Albanese government to conduct an assessment of the technology used to determine whether people are the age they say they are when accessing social media, is due to provide a preliminary report to the government by the end of April.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterWhile the report is said to be on track to be delivered this month, Guardian Australia has confirmed this preliminary report will not be released publicly by the company. A spokesperson for the communications department said the report was never intended for public release and is designed “to afford procedural fairness to trial participants” on any changes that need to be made.The final report is due just two months after the preliminary report in June, before the communications minister – whoever it will be after the federal election – will get to decide which platforms it applies to, and what technology is appropriate.ACCS has begun recruitment of school-age children to test out the various technologies, but there is an education and consent process still under way.From there, schoolchildren will test out age estimation (where tech estimates how old a user is), assurance (where a parent or guardian confirms an age) and verification (using some sort of identity document verification) technologies.The children will act as “mystery shoppers” and attempt to access a purpose-built online platform through the various age assurance methods, documents released by ACCS state.This process leaves just weeks to get the trials conducted, analysed, and a final report prepared for government.The ban is not a major focus of the federal election campaign – it had bipartisan support, after the Coalition pushed for it for months until the Labor government relented.However, there are still major concerns over how the ban will work, and who is included.TikTokand Meta, for example, are angry over the carve out YouTube received. The government’s messaging on why this exemption was allowed has been mixed.The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said last year that YouTube would be included in a range of services exempt from the ban on health and education grounds. But in the draft wording of the document that sets out what services are exempt, YouTube is granted an exemption on its own, while health and education services are another carve out.In response to questions in Senate estimates from the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young last month, the department said the exclusion was “consistent with broad community sentiment, which highlights the value of YouTube as a tool for education and learning”.Evidence shows most children under 13 accessing social media are accessing YouTube.A report from the eSafety commissioner last month stated more than 80% of children aged between eight and 12 are accessing social media, despite the current minimum age requirement being 13.However, this figure was largely skewed by children accessing YouTube, either by watching while logged out, or using a parent or carer’s account. When YouTube is excluded, the figure is closer to 44%.TikTok and Snapchat are second and third behind YouTube (68%) on 31% and 19%, respectively.Social media firms criticise ‘irrational’ exemption of YouTube from Australia’s under-16s banRead moreIt is also worth noting that the stakeholder advisory board overseeing the trial has some members who have long called for bans or restrictions on online pornography, and have called for online censorship. But missing from the board are digital rights and privacy groups.Those organisations have subsequently been invited to apply to join the stakeholder advisory board, after inquiries from Guardian Australia, but as of yet do not appear to be included.Whether all this results in a report that the government can rely upon and implement before the end of this year remains to be seen, as does whether the social media companies will be willing players.The inconsistent treatment of some platforms over others might lead to companies such asMeta– which has already approached the Trump administration over their treatment by the Australian government – to seek the US government to push back on the ban before it comes into effect.But this week, Albanese, and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said the ban was not up for negotiation.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyAustralian politicsSocial mediaMetaTikTokanalysisShareReuse this content"

We don’t know if it’s coming from upstream … or if it’s coming out of the deep water ocean outfall.”Sydney’s unusual sewerage system to blame for faecal and fat balls on beaches, experts claimRead moreA major question, Khan said, was why these incidents had happened now.Given the waste washed up along some of Sydney’s most popular beaches – during peak tourist season – understanding the source was crucial. “We can’t address it if we don’t understand it,” he said.In October 2024, Guardian Australia first reported a team of scientists was investigating whether theballs could be linked to sewageand whether they could have come from a nearby water treatment plant.In November, theEPA chose to reveal the content– but not the source – of the mystery beach balls on the day of the US election.Sydney Water saidat the time there had “been no issues with the normal operations of the Bondi or Malabar wastewater treatment plants”.Guardian Australia reported in January that Sydney’sunusual sewerage system was most likely responsiblefor the faecal and fat balls turning up on beaches.A $32bn project to improve the system over the next 15 years would not stop waste being pumped into the ocean off the city’s famous eastern suburbs beaches,it was revealed in February.Beaches affected by mystery balls and nearby wastewater plantsThe EPA director of operations, Adam Gilligan, said on Friday the authority’s finding was “a significant step forward in our investigation but there is still work to do”.“While we are yet to determine exactly what caused the pollution incidents to occur when they did, we can saythe composition and the characteristicsof the debris balls are consistent with a land-based sewage source,” Gilligan said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Beves was unsurprised by the EPA’s conclusion that the debris likely originated from the sewage system.Testing by his team had revealed the debris contained materials such as cooking oil, soap scum, traces of diesel, human hair, bits of plastic, prescription and recreational drugs, and markers of faecal matter.He was pleased the EPA had continued its investigation.“We might be able to find out where they’ve come from and hopefully prevent them in future,” he said on Friday.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesPollutionWaterSydneyOceansnewsShareReuse this content"

If it’s a delay tactic, [Trump]’s not interested in that. We will know soon enough, in a matter of weeks, not months, whetherRussiais serious about peace or not.”Rubio also appeared to strike a more sympathetic tone towards Kyiv, noting that the Ukrainians “have shown a willingness to enter, for example, into a complete ceasefire”.US officials appear to be growing increasingly impatient with the lack of progress in the ongoing peace negotiations. While Trump continues to publicly suggest that Putin wants to end the war, there is growing recognition within the US administration that the Kremlin is unlikely to back down from its maximalist demands before it commits to peace conditions that would effectively dismantle Ukraine as an independent, functioning state and pull it firmly into Russia’s sphere of influence.On Friday a Russian missile attack killed at least 18 people, including nine children, in a residential area of the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, local officials said.​The attack on the hometown of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, damaged residential blocks and sparked fires, Serhiy Lysak, the region’s governor, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.At least 50 people were wounded, the emergency services said, adding that the figure was growing. More than 30 people, including a three-month-old baby, were in hospital, Lysak said.Zelenskyy responded by calling on the west to exert greater pressure on Moscow. “The whole world sees it,” he wrote on Telegram. “Each missile, every attack drone proves that Russia seeks only war.”Russia said it had targeted a gathering of servicemen but Ukraine accused Moscow of “again spreading false information”.“The missile struck a residential area with a playground,” the military’s general staff said in a statement on Telegram. “Through this latest violation of the norms of international human rights, the insidious enemy shows that it is in no way seeking peace but rather intends to continue its invasion and war to destroy Ukraine and all Ukrainians.”View image in fullscreenThe German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, pictured with Marco Rubio, said Putin was ‘playing for time by raising ever-new demands’.Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/APRussiahas previously rejecteda US proposal for a full and immediate 30-day ceasefire, to which Ukraine had agreed. Meanwhile, neither side appears to be adhering to an earlier agreement to temporarily halt strikes on energy infrastructure during that period.European allies have been urging Washington to take a tougher stance on Moscow and push for a serious commitment to a ceasefire, with some suggesting that a clear deadline should be set.Moscow “owes an answer to the United States”, which had “worked very hard to come up with a mediation effort and a ceasefire proposal”, the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said in Brussels, standing alongside the British foreign minister, David Lammy.“[Putin] could accept a ceasefire now, he continues to bombard Ukraine, its civilian population, its energy supplies,” said Lammy. “We see you, Vladimir Putin, we know what you are doing.”There was similar rhetoric among other European allies of Ukraine, with the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, dismissing Putin’s talk of negotiations as “nothing but empty promises”. She accused the Russian leader of “playing for time by raising ever-new demands”.The Kremlin this week sent an envoy to Washington, marking the first time since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion that a senior Russian official had travelled to the US for talks with American counterparts.View image in fullscreenPutin ‘could accept a ceasefire now’, said David Lammy, left, while his French counterpart, Jean-Noël Barrot, right, said Moscow ‘owes an answer to the United States’.Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/APKirill Dmitriev met Steve Witkoff, Trump’s senior adviser on Russia negotiations, as well as Rubioat the White Houseon Wednesday. Dmitriev described the meetings as evidence of a “positive dynamic” between the two countries and claimed progress had been made towards peace in Ukraine.Rubio, the US’s top diplomat, took a more cautious stance, saying he hoped Dmitriev would deliver a clear message to Moscow. “He’ll take some messages back, and the message is the United States needs to know whether you’re serious or not about peace,” he said.Trumphas previously suggestedhe would impose a 25% or even 50% tariff on countries buying Russian oil if he concluded that Putin was obstructing peace talks.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaNatoMarco RubioEuropeBelgiumnewsShareReuse this content"

He cited managers’plans to slash jobsand close factories earlier this year, and a decade before that the“dieselgate” scandal –costly financially and reputationally – when Germany’s largest carmaker was found to have falsified CO2emissions tests.Now that the US has put a punishing 25% tariff on car imports (until now it was 2.5%) “we’re swimming in shit”, he said, giving a husky chuckle. “You have to laugh or you’d not survive,” he added. He declined to give his full name, but said he had been at the company for more than 15 years, adding he was “glad to be going into retirement” in two years’ time “so I don’t have to watch the carnage from the factory floor”.Ahmed, talking as he dashed to the nearby station to catch the train home to pick up his children after finishing the early shift on the VW Golf assembly line, said he was proud of his job, but feared for the future. “The mood inside is not good,” he said. “We already felt bamboozled by our bosses after all the mistakes they’ve made. Now even bigger arseholes are deciding our future.”Stephan, towards the end of his first week working in electrical infrastructure at the plant, said he was sure that “initially this is going to be very bad for the German car industry, and forGermanyin general, but long term it might serve us well, to learn to be more independent from the US. We just have to hope that short term, our new government quickly starts to set us on the right course.”‘Liberation day’: what are tariffs and why do they matter?Read moreGermany’s new government, under the probable leadership of the conservative former bankerFriedrich Merz, which is still being painstakingly negotiated behind the scenes following a February election, suddenly faces a new and almighty challenge, on top of the already towering problem of how to steer Europe’s largest economy out of itsdeep economic woes.Demand for German goods in the US is high, in particular cars – BMW, Mercedes, VW and Porsche – as well as machinery, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and plenty of luxury goods from Montblanc pens to Hugo Boss suits. As a result, Germany’s trade deficit with the US is larger than most other countries’ and the impact of the tariffs will hit its economy particularly hard.“Trump’s economic war is in full flow and Germany is stuck smack bang in the middle of it,” ran a headline in the tabloid Bild this week.The leading economic institute IW predicted in astudypublished on Thursday that the loss to Germany’s economy would amount to an estimated €200bn (£170bn) stretched over the four years of a Trump tenure, or a drop of 1.5% in GDP.The study’s authors, Jürgen Matthes and Samina Sultan called it “an economic catastrophe for Germany”.Annual sales of VW vehicles in the US amounted to almost 380,000 last year, or 8% of its total global sales, consisting mainly of its higher-end vehicles. According to the Association of German Car Makers (VDA), overall exports of German vehicles and parts reached a total value of almost €37bn.US-Germany trade chartVW said this week it would not take the punishment lying down. It said it had provisionally halted rail shipments of vehicles from its factory in Puebla, Mexico into the US, and had also put a hold on the transport of its US-bound cars via ship at the western German seaport of Emden. In a memo to its North American retailers, it said it would introduce an “import fee” on affected vehicles. This was “to make sure on the label it’s clear to our customers it’s not us who’s fleecing them, but their own government”, a US car dealer told German media on condition of anonymity.As to Trump’s wish that manufacturers will be forced to move their operations to the US, the large German carmakers like VW, Mercedes, and BMW have long since done so, producing 900,000 cars on US soil last year, according to the VDA. Major car part suppliers, including Continental and Bosch, have done the same. In total, at 2,110 locations in the US the German car industry employs about 138,000 people.But this by no means makes them immune to the tariffs because plenty of parts, to which tariffs will also apply, have to be imported.As a result, cars are expected to rise in price on average between $5,000 (£3,840) and $10,000 dollars, and by as much as $50,000 in the luxury sector, experts predict. While car sales soared ahead of the tariff announcement as buyers sought to beat the price rise, already a sales war between foreign and domestic manufacturers is making itself felt, with the US carmaker Ford reportedly planning to offer customers its cutdown prices hitherto reserved for its employees, under the campaign banner: “From America for America.”Hildegard Müller, president of the VDA said the punitive taxes turned existing trade policy on its head. “This marks the departure of the US from the rules-based global trading order … it is not America First, this is America alone,” she said.Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, founder of the Center for Automotive Research (CAR), known as Germany’s “car pope” owing to his expertise in the industry, told German media that German car manufacturers and suppliers would be “extremely damaged and heavily punished”.“If this ends up being ongoing, German car manufacturers will increasingly move their production to the USA, leading to a further loss of jobs in Germany,” he predicted. “By forcing the companies into making losses and sucking the jobs away, economically speaking Trump is an even worse enemy for us than [Vladimir] Putin.”On Friday, the leading economistMarcel Fratzschersaid Germany’s best response to the tariff turmoil was to “fortify itself” from within, urging the new government to use the opportunity of crisis to carry out much-needed reforms and, with the EU, to hit the US where it hurt most by imposing a reciprocal tax on digital companies.“The future isn’t being made in the US; our own future is being made here in the country. And I would like the coalition partners [of the future government] to have more courage,” he said, calling for a radical change of course in economic policy.Explore more on these topicsGermanyAutomotive industryTrump tariffsVolkswagen (VW)International tradeGlobal economyEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Theresultant flash floodingswept vehicles and debris through streets and washed boats away from the shore, and 13 people were rescued by firefighters after becoming trapped by flood water. Authorities issued a travel ban restricting road use to emergency vehicles only, and ferry services were also disrupted.Tuesday’s storms, though slightly less intense, also brought heavy rain and flooding to a collection of islands in the east, close to mainland Turkey, and across Crete in the south. Seven people were rescued from vehicles stranded in flood water on Crete, where landslips were also reported.Across north-westEuropeit was one of the driest and sunniest Marches on record. In the Netherlands the sun shone for 248 hours at De Bilt weather station near Utrecht, surpassing the previous record set in 2022, and almost 100 hours above the March average. An average of 5mm of rain was recorded nationwide, more than 50mm less than the typical March average.Belgium also experienced dry and sunny conditions, with 7.8mm of rain recorded in Brussels, just 10% of the March average, making it the third-driest March in 100 years, and 191 hours of sunshine, 50% more than average. It was also much milder than average during the day, with an average high of 13.6C compared with the normal March high of 10.9C.It was also the driest March since at least 1961 across England and Wales, with record-breaking sunshine in some areas too. With high pressure expected to dominate northern Europe for at least the first 10 days of April it looks likely to remain dry and largely sunny across the Netherlands, Belgium, UK and Ireland.Explore more on these topicsExtreme weatherWeather trackerGreeceEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

In Paros, people saw cars, motorcycles and beachside restaurant furniture hurtling into the sea as torrential rain flooded shops and homes and turned streets into debris-filled streams. The picturesque port of Naoussa was transformed into a “lake of mud”, local people said, with the sea and land “becoming one”. Large parts of the road network were devastated.View image in fullscreenA flooded road in Naoussa on Monday.Photograph: Stathis Roussos/HappyFrameFlights/ReutersIn Mykonos, another hotspot expected to attract thousands of visitors at Easter, hailstorms triggered landslides, with muddy flood waters cascading through its white-washed alleys. Civil protection services urged residents to restrict their movements and stay indoors. In Crete’s port town of Chania, officials spoke of “biblical destruction” as images of flooded streets, hospitals and courthouses also emerged.Schools on several islands were closed, and inhabitants were still picking their way through silt-strewn streets on Thursday.Meteorologists said more rain was dumped on Paros over the course of a couple of hours on Tuesday than would normally fall in an entire month. “It’s incredible, really, that there were no casualties,” said one official.Climate breakdown is causing extreme rainfall to become more common and more intense across most of the world, and flooding has most probably become more frequent and severe in these locations as a result.But the devastation at tourist destinations that, thanks to the rise in global travel, increasinglydraw record numbershas also highlighted Greece’s lack of preparedness in dealing with natural disasters.Critics have singled out the absence of proper flood management systems, as well as unregulated development on the Aegean islands, which have attracted ever more visitors seeking villas, swimming pools and other high-end services.“Yes, the rainfall was intense but what turned it into a disaster wasn’t just nature; it was the result of decades of unsustainable construction,” wrote the Greek environmentalist and former MEP Kriton Arsenis.“Paros has been overbuilt at a dramatic pace. In the past five years alone, it has topped the Cyclades in new building permits, surpassing even Mykonos and Santorini. Villas, hotels, roads and swimming pools have replaced the dry-stone terraces that once held water, slowed down runoff and kept the soil alive.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They simply accelerate it – pushing it downhill with force, until it floods homes, or is lost to the sea.”It was critical, he said, that a way was found in such heavily built environments to absorb, store and release rainwater slowly. “This wasn’t just a flood. It was a failure of planning … [and] this same story is unfolding all along the Mediterranean coast.”At a time when anger over the impoverished state of public services has also prompted some of thelargest protestsin years – with hundreds of thousands of Greeks taking to the streets in fury on the second anniversary of the Tempe rail disaster – others bemoaned the lack of state funding on islands whose populations dwindled drastically in winter.“Not enough money, clearly, is put into civil protection,” said Mykonos’s former mayor Konstantinos Koukas. “To fix that, funds have to stop being allocated based on the permanent population of a place. It’s why we have the scenes we see today, clearing up after a storm when Easter is just a few weeks away.”The prominent commentator Nikos Syrigos, who hails from the Cycladic isle of Syros, said that despite tourism being the engine of Greece’s economy, the underdevelopment of its islands meant destinations that were “giants in the summer” became “dwarfs in the winter”.“Streets that have been turned into streams [by this storm] will be turned into them again,” he said this week. “Unfortunately, the Cyclades have remained years behind when it comes to infrastructure and are completely ill-prepared to withstand any intense [weather] phenomenon, much less any that is extreme.”Explore more on these topicsGreeceFloodingExtreme weatherEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The two sides have pledged to improve transport links, through a project known as the trans-Caspian transport corridor, which aims to cut the overland journey between the EU and central Asia by half, down to no more than 15 days. Brussels also hopes for endorsement of a text on critical raw materials that are abundant in the region and needed for the EU’s green transition.One senior EU official said it was “a landmark summit” and that central Asian countries showed “a corresponding wish to deepen the relationship with the EU and to diversify their foreign policy”.Ahead of the summit, the most complex issue – for the central Asian countries – was how to refer to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the final declaration. Kazakhstan, once one of Russia’s closes allies, hassent humanitarian aid to Ukraine, maintained contact with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and banned Russian military propaganda symbols. Kazakhstan, however, joined Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in abstaining on arecent UN general assembly votecalling for “peaceful resolution of the war in Ukraine”.The European parliament has also raised concerns about Kazakhstan,Kyrgyzstanand Uzbekistan being “possible hubs” allowing Russia to circumvent western sanctions.Amid shifting geopolitical alliances and the scramble for mineral wealth, campaigners are urging the EU not to overlook human rights.“These new partnerships are very important, but they will not be sustainable and will not really secure the EU’s interests unless the EU also cares about rule of law in the region and protection of rights,” Iskra Kirova, of Human Rights Watch, said.The EU, she added, was not using its leverage in a credible way. She questioned the union’s decision to sign a wide-ranging trade and cooperation deal with Kyrgyzstan last June, after Bishkek adopted a Russian-style“foreign representatives” lawthat requires NGOs receiving funds from abroad to bear this designation. The law stigmatises organisations and has had a “very chilling effect” on Kyrgyz civil society, Kirova said.The EU “does not insist that there will be concrete achievements before it grants these kinds of straight benefits or bilateral agreements”, she said, referring also to preferential trade deals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has introduced reforms, including clamping down on forced labour in cotton fields. Rights groups say his governmentallows no dissentand voting remains tightly controlled, such as in a recent referendum introducing constitutional changes that willenable Mirziyoyev to remain in power until 2040.Jana Toom, the vice-chair of the European parliament’s delegation for central Asia, said central Asian countries were not doing enough to stop circumvention of EU sanctions against Russia, although she added that they had not made any commitments on this score.Asked whether the EU was striking the right balance between economic interests and human rights, the Estonian liberal MEP said: “I believe that if we have beneficial cooperation between theEuropean Unionand central Asia, things will improve. It will take time, of course. And we have to take into account also the fact where they find themselves: between Russia and China, and they are trying to balance.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionSouth and central AsiaUzbekistanEuropeKazakhstanKyrgyzstanTajikistannewsShareReuse this content"

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the targets were Hamas control centres.View image in fullscreenThe search continues for survivors of an Israeli airstrike on Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, early on Friday.Photograph: Mariam Dagga/APAccording to the UN, 280,000 people have been forced to leave their homes or shelters since Israel decided to abandon a two-month-old ceasefire withHamas, cutting off aid and fuel on 2 March and resuming large-scale bombing two weeks later.Ground troops have since re-entered the strip’s southernmost city of Rafah and the Netzarim corridor that cuts offGazaCity from the rest of the territory. On Friday, the IDF said troops were advancing in Shuja’iya, a northern suburb of Gaza City.Israeli officials vowed this week toseize large swathes of the stripas security zones and establish a new military corridor between Rafah and Khan Younis, exacerbating Palestinian fears of permanent displacement and annexation.Friday also saw escalations on other fronts in the regional conflagration set in motion by Hamas’s October 2023 attack on southern Israel. Israel says 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians, were killed and a further 250 taken captive in the attack; all but 59 have since been released in hostage and detainee swaps. Israel’s retaliatory military campaign on Gaza has killed at least 50,600 people, most of them civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.In Lebanon on Friday, the Israeli military said it had killed Hassan Farhat, a senior Hamas commander, in an airstrike on the southern city of Sidon, a move that threatens to upset the fragile truce signed in November with the Hamas-allied Lebanese militant groupHezbollah.View image in fullscreenFirefighters tackle a blaze at an apartment block in Sidon, Lebanon, after an airstrike by Israeli forces.Photograph: Mohammad Abushama/Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe bombing came after Israel targeted what it said were Hezbollah facilities in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, last weekfor the first time since the ceasefirewent into effect. That attack was launched in response to rocket fire aimed at northern Israel, which neither Hamas nor Hezbollah claimed responsibility for.Tensions between Israel and the new transitional government inSyriaare also rising after a wave of Israeli airstrikes across the country and a deepening Israeli ground incursion in the Daraa border area on Thursday, in which 13 people were killed.Israel has long targeted Hezbollah and Iranian assets in Syria but has continued its bombing campaign since Islamist-led rebel groups forced the dictator Bashar al-Assad to flee the country in December. It has also seized land in southern Syria and warned that Islamist groups must stay away from Israeli territory.Hakan Fidan, the foreign minister of Turkey, which backs the new regime in Damascus, on Friday accused Israel of fuelling regional instability.“Israel is taking out, one by one, all these capabilities that a new state can use against Isis and other terrorist threats,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of a Nato summit in Brussels. “What Israel is doing in Syria is not only threatening the security of Syria, but also is paving the way for future instability of the region.”Also on Friday, the Israeli army confirmed troops killed a Palestinian teenager after shooting at a group of boys and young men throwing stones near the occupied West Bank village of Husan the night before. Palestinian officials gave his name as Yusef Zaoul, 17. The IDF did not comment on the deceased’s name or age.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelPalestinian territoriesHamasLebanonnewsShareReuse this content"

On Friday she was found guilty of two charges of breaching the order.Tossici-Bolt was given a conditional discharge and ordered not to commit any additional offences over a two-year period. She was ordered to pay costs of £20,000 towards what the judge said had been the “considerable” resources expended by the local authority, along with £26 towards a victim surcharge fee.A delegation from the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), an office within the US Department of State, met Tossici-Bolt last month during a visit to the UK, along with a US-backed anti-abortion group, which had been supporting her case.In a post on X hours after the conviction on Friday, the DRL said: “We are disappointed with the UK court’s conviction of Livia Tossici-Bolt for violating a designated ‘buffer zone’ at an abortion clinic. Freedom of expression must be protected for all.”Judge Orla Austin said it was beyond reasonable doubt that Tossici-Bolt was engaging in an act of disapproval of abortion services on the days in question. “She lacks insight that her presence could have a detrimental effect on the women attending the clinic, their associates, staff and members of the public,” the judge said.Tossici-Bolt had stood with a sign reading “Here to talk, if you want” facing the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) clinic, which was previously targeted by anti-abortion activists who had gathered nearby before Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council put the order in place.View image in fullscreenLivia Tossici-Bolt outside the Houses of Parliament on 1 April.Photograph: ADF International/PAA Downing Street spokesperson said it was vital that women using abortion services could do so “without being subject to harassment or distress” and that the right to protest did not “give people the right to harass others”.Asked whether there was a problem with free speech in the UK, the spokesperson said Britain had a “very proud tradition of free speech over many centuries, and we remain proud of it today”.The court previously heard evidence from council enforcement officers who said they had asked Tossici-Bolt to leave the area on both days after they received calls from a member of the public and from staff inside the clinic.Tossici-Bolt told one of the officers that she had located herself outside the clinic “because from my experience women come here in a very lonely state”. The order prohibited protests and other direct or indirect activities that could influence users of the abortion clinic and was in place on weekdays until 7pm. She had been asked to leave the area within that period.Austin said Tossici-Bolt could have gone somewhere else given that people who were lonely could be found everywhere. “I accept her beliefs were truly held beliefs. Although it’s accepted this defendant held [anti-abortion] views, it’s important to note this case is not about the rights and wrongs about abortion but about whether the defendant was in breach of the PSPO (public spaces protection order),” she said.The verdict was welcomed by the BPAS, which said the result would protect women and the staff who provided abortion care.The chief executive of BPAS, Heidi Stewart, said: “The clinic in Bournemouth has been subjected to decades of anti-abortion protests which resulted in more than 500 reports of harassment before this local safe access zone was brought into force.“This case was never about global politics but about the simple ability of women to access legal healthcare free from harassment.”During a discussion of costs, the hearing was told that Tossici-Bolt had significant assets and received a grant from the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a registered charity in the UK, backed by a conservative US organisation of the same name.Kuljit Bhogal KC, for the council, said ADF UK had an income of more than £1.3m in the year up to June 2024 and that at least one member of staff had a salary of more than £100,000, according to records filed at Companies House.The Guardian reportedon Wednesday on those filings on how the ADF has been expanding UK operations.Its global subsidiary, ADF International, said it is supporting Tossici-Bolt as she assesses her options in terms of an appeal. Robert Clarke, director of advocacy for ADF International, described the verdict as an “egregious failure of justice”.Explore more on these topicsAbortionWomenHealthWomen's healthFreedom of speechBournemouthnewsShareReuse this content"

Is this the sameLabourparty that accepted the defections of then Conservative MPs Christian Wakeford and Natalie Elphicke?”The Labour study of candidate nominations for the local elections in May shows more than 60 Reform council candidates across Britain have served as councillors, candidates or activists for the Tories.Reform’s parliamentary candidate for the byelection in Runcorn and Helsby, triggered by the resignation of the Labour MP Mike Amesbury after a criminal conviction, is Sarah Pochin, a former Tory councillor for Cheshire East.In social media posts that have been deleted since Pochin became a Reform candidate, she described her “absolute pleasure” posing in 2019 with the then levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, while she was a Conservative councillor, before describing her meeting with Liz Truss’s business secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg, as “inspiring”.Nineteen of the 23 councils up for election this May are run by the Conservatives. There will be mayoral elections in the West ofEngland, and Peterborough and Cambridgeshire, and inaugural mayoral contests in Hull and East Yorkshire, and Greater Lincolnshire.A Labour spokesperson said: “A snake might shed its skin but at the end of the day it’s still a snake.

For example, the duke sends a letter to the president for his birthday each year.”His statement, made in May 2024, said Andrew “must surely be a valuable communication point with China”. “Whilst I think China would prefer a different royal, the reality is, to this day, that if the UK government or the palace said that someone needs to see the Chinese president and talk to him, I think the duke would be able to do that, whereas I don’t think anyone else could do so as simply.”Hampshire said that, having known Andrew for nearly 20 years, and worked closely with him for five, he believed he was “deeply trusted” within the palace at “the highest level”. He said he had had two meetings in six months last year with Andrew and the king “to discuss what the duke can do moving forward in a way that is acceptable to his majesty”.Hampshire said the Eurasia Fund was discussed with the king at these meetings. The Eurasia Fund was an investment vehicle, involving Andrew and Yang, which intended to use Chinese funds for renewable energy projects in Africa but never got off the ground.Buckingham Palace said of Hampshire’s meetings with the king: “While his majesty met the duke and his adviser to hear outline proposals for independent funding over the past year, the individual known as H6 [Yang] was not mentioned at any time or in any way as part of these discussions.”It is understood that while Andrew may have mentioned a number of proposals including the Eurasia Fund, it was not discussed in any level of detail with the king, nor did the king or his advisers give approval to this business relationship or opportunity.Hampshire said Andrew’s reputation was “irrecoverable” after his BBC Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis about his relationship with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. “This was a common feeling within the royal household, despite what the duke thought may happen. It was very clear internally within the royal household that we would have to look at options for the duke’s future away from royal duties.”He said the duke’s Pitch@Palace initiative, set up to support entrepreneurs, was one of Andrew’s “indisputable successes” and there were hopes it would continue internationally. He added that Yang, who was the founder-partner of Pitch@Palace China, had not deserted the duke after the interview even while UK sponsors and supporters of Andrew’s initiative were “falling away”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But because of the work on Pitch he had succeeded in building up his personal brand and reputation in China.“He was well regarded in senior circles and in Chinese media perception. After the Maitlis interview, the duke’s reputation in China was terrible.”Hampshire said he was summonsed by the late queen’s private secretary, Sir Edward Young, and asked if he knew Yang, who had come to the attention of the security services. Hampshire said in his statement he told Young: “Chris is pretty much our only avenue for the duke moving forward and arguably the only light at the end of the tunnel for him. Do you have a plan B? Sir Edward said he did not.”In the five years he had known Yang, Hampshire said there had “never been one single red flag in my head” about him, and in the “limited contact” Andrew had, the duke was “of the same opinion”. He added that Yang “categorically does not have a close relationship with the duke”.After the documents were made public on Friday, Hampshire said he left the royal household in 2022 and no longer provided advice to Andrew. He said Andrew “fully complied” with advice to end all contact with Yang.“For the record, as soon as the Duke of York was advised to cease all contact with Mr Yang, he fully complied,” Hampshire said in a statement. “He did not receive a penny in funding or support, directly or indirectly, from any Chinese individual or entity.”Yang has previously said he intends to appeal against the decision upholding his ban from entering the UK.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewChinaUK security and counter-terrorismImmigration and asylumMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

The tariffs “clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth,” said the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva.China’s retaliation came after Trump imposed 34% tariffs on Chinese goods, which were already subject to a 20% levy, taking the total levy to 54%. He also imposed hefty tariffs on neighbouring countries in south-east Asia including Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, through which billions of dollars of Chinese exports are processed on their way to the US.Trump responded on his social media platform Truth Social on Friday. He said: “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!”The UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said ministers would continue to negotiate with Washington, in the hope that the 10% levy on UK exports could be lifted. The UK is offering a series of concessions, including a cut to the £1bn-a-year digital services tax for some of the biggest tech firms.“We want to do everything in our power, and we’ll continue to do everything in our power to get the best possible deal for British industry, working closely with them to protect prosperity and jobs here in the UK,” she said.Trump tariff timelineFinancial markets are now pricing in a further three interest cuts from the Bank of England by the end of this year, as they weigh up the risks of weaker growth, as some analysts warned that a slowdown could force Reeves to raise taxes in her autumn budget.“I would have thought the central expectation now must be that if she is sticking to her fiscal rules, she’ll need to increase taxes in the autumn by possibly some significant amount,” said Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Downing Street says Trump’s tariffs signal ‘new era’ in global economicsRead moreOn Wall Street, the tech-focused Nasdaq index entered bear market territory – meaning it has lost more than 20% of its value since the sell-off began. It was down 5.8% on Friday alone. The S&P 500 fell 9.1%, its worst five-day trading stretch since March 2020.Oil prices also declined sharply, as experts reassessed their projections for global growth, with Brent crude down 7% at about $65 a barrel.FTSE 100 chartGeorgieva appealed for calm. “It is important to avoid steps that could further harm the world economy. We appeal to the US and its trading partners to work constructively to resolve trade tensions and reduce uncertainty.”There was little sign of such moderation in China’s trenchant response to theTrump tariffs, however. The country’s state council tariff commission said the US approach was “not in line with international trade rules, seriously undermines China’s legitimate rights and interests, and is a typical unilateral bullying practice”.Despite fears his trade war will send prices higher for Americans, Trump also called on the independent Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, urging Powell, “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!”Countries exporting the most goods to the US chartIn a speech in Arlington, Virginia, on Friday, however, Powell suggested the outlook was still too uncertain to make decisions about the direction of monetary policy. “It is too soon to say what the appropriate policy stance should be. I understand the uncertainty that people feel, but it’s a process that we are going through.”But he gave a blunt assessment of the likely effects of Trump’s policies. “While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,” he said. “The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.”‘In economic terms, Trump’s tariffs make no sense at all’Read moreThe president has promised voters his “liberation day” policies will bring jobs and investment pouring back into the US. But investors fear the higher prices that are likely to result will depress consumer demand in the US, and put the brakes on export-dependent economies worldwide.The market meltdown has also been fuelled by Trump’s unpredictability, which makes it impossible to forecast whether he will negotiate away some of the tariffs in exchange for concessions – or double down.Trump’s chart of tariffsOn Friday alone, Trump posted a message insisting “MY POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE,” followed four hours later by another statement in which he said he had had “a very productive call” with the Vietnamese leader, To Lam, who Trump claimed had offered to reduce that country’s tariffs.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, shrugged off the chaos on Wall Street on Friday, appearing to suggest it was all part of the administration’s plan for reshaping the US economy.“Markets are crashing because markets are based on the stock value of companies who today are embedded in modes of production that are bad for the US,” he claimed.Still, in the UK, some economists suggested the tariffs may have only a modest impact. James Smith, an economist at the analysts ING, said: “The overall hit from tariffs on Britain’s GDP is perhaps only 0.2% or so. Certainly not enough to decisively change the outlook for UK growth. And remember there are some decent tailwinds for growth this year, notably from government spending.”The investment bank JP Morgan said it now sees a 60% chance of the global economy entering recession by the year-end, up from 40% previously.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsGlobal economyDonald TrumpChinaEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But this year, spectators atAintreehad good need for their headwear, as the sun shone at the racecourse for the first time in almost a decade.A crowd of 45,000 people had been predicted, and as temperatures reached 19C on Friday, the Met Office said it was just short of being the warmest Aintree festival this century.A strong breeze meant there was some clutching of hats but it takes more than a bit of wind to bother racegoers.View image in fullscreen‘You save up for this,’ said Chantalle Green, from Liverpool. ‘You want to look good – it’s everything about the day, the getting ready, that makes it.’Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I always wear giant hats,” said Chantalle Green, fromLiverpool, who has been coming to Aintree for two decades and this year brought her 18-year-old daughter. “I think it should be a rule that everyone has to wear big hats.”She had donned a dramatic sculptural black creation which she had hired for the occasion and was delighted to bump into the Guardian, having been featured 13 years ago in a similarly impressive brightly coloured fascinator.Grand National 2025: horse-by-horse guide to all the runnersRead moreIt was an event she would not miss, she said, even though the cost of living crisis was making attending more prohibitive and many people were thinking twice about the tickets.“I’m a single mum. Everything we’ve got I’ve worked for,” Green said. “You save up for this. You want to look good – it’s everything about the day, the getting ready, that makes it.“You make pinches and squeezes. But I don’t do anything else the rest of the year – this is my best event.”While the venue is home to one of the racing calendar’s biggest meetings, for many attenders it is as much a celebration of the enjoyment of dressing up, of taking pride in looking stylish and the power of a Liverpool institution that goes back nearly two centuries.View image in fullscreen‘It is expensive,’ said Mary-Ann Smith, ‘but you make sacrifices.

After No 10 issued a strong statement criticising its conduct in the Birmingham bin strike (see1.32pm), Unite has hit back, questioning Labour’s commitment to “working people” and saying the government should intervene directly in the dispute and force the council to settle.In a statement issued in response to what Downing Street said earlier,Sharon Graham, theUnitegeneral secretary, said:It is not surprising that many workers in Britian question the Labour government’s commitment to working people when it issues a statement clearly blaming bin workers in a dispute not of their making.The bottom line about this dispute is that these workers woke up one morning to be told they would be taking up to an £8,000 pay cut. They are being made to pay the price for austerity and bad decisions by Birmingham city council.Hold the front page, Unite has already agreed major changes, with the removal ofjob and knockand shift pay last year and in Unite’s current proposals there are no equal pay issues. This authority is determined to impose cuts on workers at any cost and has moved the goalposts again.Unite’s team of decision makers has been in negotiations in good faith for weeks. It is the leader of the council who is missing in action and not been in any of the talks. Indeed the council are only scheduling meetings once a week. Unite has said it is ready to negotiate anytime and everyday if necessary.The government is going to have to wake up and smell the coffee that they are part of this dispute, as the commissioners report directly to them and they own the £3.9bn debt of the council.If the government were really concerned about the residents of Birmingham they would get the decision makers in a room of which they are clearly one, to ensure that Unite’s solutions on the table were adopted.Yet again workers and communities pay the price for government inaction.Sharon Graham.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesShare"

Among other things, the wetlands play a key role in offering the area a measure of protection from hurricanes.The jury found that the oil brand Texaco, which is owned byChevron, violated state regulations surrounding coastal resources by contributing to the disappearing coastline through dredging canals, drilling wells and dumping massive amounts of wastewater into the marsh.Oil giant Chevron to lay off thousands in bid to cut up to 20% of global workforceRead moreThe verdict could prompt other companies to settle the other separate but similar lawsuits. Nonetheless, Chevron’s attorney, Mike Phillips, said that the oil company intends to appeal the verdict.According tothe US Geological Survey, Louisiana’s coastal wetlands are among the most critically endangered environments across the country as they experience more wetland loss than all other states in the continental US combined.From 1932 to 2016, coastalLouisianaexperienced a net change in land area of approximately -4,833 square kilometers, marking a decrease of approximately 25% of the land area at the beginning of that time period.The canals used to create transportation routes for oil and gas rigs have over the years impeded natural water flow across the wetland ecosystems,according tothe Lowlander Center. Additionally, the canals create straight avenues which allow surging ocean waters to bypass the bayous and instead head directly inland during severe weather events.According to a 1978 Louisiana management law, sites used by oil companies must “be cleared, revegetated, detoxified, and otherwise restored as near as practicable to their original condition” after the companies’ projects end, the Associated Pressreports.The south-eastern Louisiana community of Plaquemines parish filed the lawsuit against Chevron in 2013, asking for $2.6bn in damages at the time. The parish has an additional 20 pending cases against other oil companies.The jury awarded various compensations to Plaquemines on Friday, including $575m for land loss, $161m for contamination – as well as $8.6 million for abandoned equipment.Speaking to jurors, Jimmy Faircloth Jr, an attorney representing the state of Louisiana, said that Chevron had said that Plaquemines Parish was not worth preserving, the Associated Press reported.“Our communities are built on coast, our families raised on coast, our children go to school on coast,” he said. He added: “The state of Louisiana will not surrender the coast. It’s for the good of the state that the coast be maintained.”According tothe state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, Louisiana could lose up to another 3,000 square miles in the next 50 years.Phillips said that Chevron was “not the cause of the land loss occurring” in Plaquemines. He said that the law does not apply to “conduct that occurred decades before the law was enacted”.Phillips called the ruling “unjust,” contending that there were “numerous legal errors.”Explore more on these topicsLouisianaChevronFossil fuelsPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

The plaintiffs were able to sue because of aCalifornialaw that took effect in 2020 and suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sex abuse victims to bring cases for three years.Many of the claims involved the MacLaren children’s center, which was closed in 2003. The facility, which was intended to be a safe space for children awaiting placement in foster homes, opened in 1961 and was overseen by probation officials until it was placed under the county’s department of children and family services in 1976.One man said he was sexually abused by a physician at the facility when he was eight years old, while another said he was assaulted by a male staff member in a bathroom when he was five. Children were routinely placed in solitary confinement, drugged and restrained in chairs at the facility, according to court papers filed by plaintiffs.“It is bittersweet for the survivors, because nothing is ever going to take away what was done to them, and how badly their lives were altered and how much they have suffered,” said Adam Slater, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys. “However, the settlement hopefully gives them some measure of justice and provides them with some measure of closure.”The agreement by Los Angeles county would surpass the Boy Scouts of America’s 2022 settlement for $2.6bn with more than 80,000 men who said they were molested as children by Scout leaders and others. At the time, that was considered the largest aggregate sexual abuse settlement in US history.Last year, the archdiocese of Los Angeles agreed to pay $800m to victims of clergy sexual abuse, bringing the total payout to more than $1.5bn.Disclosure of the tentative payout comes at a time when the nation’s largest county – home to about 10 million residents – is facing a tightening bind of financial obligations on its $49bn annual budget. County officials fear hundreds of millions of dollars for public services could vanish in Trump administration cutbacks, while the county has seen additional costs from January’s historic wildfires as it also deals with an ongoing homeless crisis.Davenport recently said the county is facing a “large amount of uncertainty” with its budget – some agencies are largely funded by federal dollars.The proposed agreement includes creating a countywide hotline for reporting child sexual abuse allegations against county employees and developing a system to expedite investigations, county officials said.“By balancing justice for the victims with a commitment to reform, this resolution ensures both acknowledgment of past wrongs and a pathway to a safer, more accountable future,” Patrick McNicholas, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, said in a statement.The county’s claims board will consider the proposed settlement on Monday. If approved, it would be considered by the board of supervisors on 29 April.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Hartman has been appointed acting head of the command, according to its website.The NSA notified congressional leadership and top lawmakers of the national security committees of Haugh’s firing late on Wednesday but did not give reasons, the Associated Press reported, citing a source.

At a time when the United States is facing unprecedented cyber threats … how does firing him make Americans any safer?”Representative Jim Himes, the ranking member on the House intelligence committee, said he was “deeply disturbed by the decision”.“I have known General Haugh to be an honest and forthright leader who followed the law and put national security first – I fear those are precisely the qualities that could lead to his firing in this administration,” Himes added. “The intelligence committee and the American people need an immediate explanation for this decision, which makes all of us less safe.”Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, saidDonald Trump“has given a priceless gift to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea by purging competence from our national security leadership”.“In addition to the other military leaders and national security officials Trump has fired, he is sending a chilling message throughout the ranks: don’t give your best military advice, or you may face consequences,” Reed added.Trump fires six national security staffers after meeting with far-right activist Laura LoomerRead moreEarlier on Thursday,Donald Trumpsaid he hadfired “some” White House National Security Council officials, a move that came a day after far-right activistLaura Loomerraised concerns directly to him about staff loyalty.Loomer, during her Oval Office conversation with Trump, urged the president to purge staffers she deemed insufficiently loyal to his “make America great again” agenda, according to several people familiar with the matter. They all spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel manner.Loomerposted on Xin the first moments of Friday morning: “NSA Director Tim Haugh and his deputy Wendy Noble have been disloyal to President Trump. That is why they have been fired.”She added a screed about how they were hired by Joe Biden during his presidency and were, she said, “hand picked” by Mark Milley, then chair of the joint chiefs of staff, the most senior uniformed officer in the military. Milley served Trump in his first term in the White House but has since turned fiercely critical,calling the presidentdangerous and “fascist to the core”, andwas firedin the early days of Trump’s second term. The 47th US president then alsorevokedMilley’s security clearance. Biden, the 46th US president, had preemptively pardoned Milley in his final days in office, following threats from Trump that the veteran was treasonous and should face the death penalty.Loomer added Haugh was “referred for firing” and Noble was Haugh’s “Obama loving protégé” who was nominated by Biden and promoted diversity, equity and inclusion at the agency. Loomer noted: “This is called VETTING”.She also said Noble was a protege of James Clapper, director of national intelligence in Barack Obama’s presidency, and said Clapper should be in prison.Trump spoke to reporters on Air Force One on Thursday afternoon after the earlier firing of six national security agency staffers below the level of Haugh and Noble, based on recommendations from Loomer, a extremist cheerleader for Trump and a white supremacist with an incendiary social media presence who has no political experience outside of unsuccessfully running for US Congress in Florida twice.“Always we’re letting go of people,” Trump said. “People that we don’t like or people that we don’t think can do the job or people that may have loyalties to somebody else.”The firings come as Trump’s national security adviserMike Waltz continues to fight calls for his ousterafter using the publicly available encrypted Signal app to discuss planning for the sensitive 15 March military operation targeting Houthi militants in Yemen.Warner said on Thursday night: “It is astonishing, too, that President Trump would fire the nonpartisan, experienced leader of the National Security Agency while still failing to hold any member of his team accountable for leaking classified information on a commercial messaging app – even as he apparently takes staffing direction on national security from a discredited conspiracy theorist in the Oval Office.”Haugh met last month with Elon Musk, whose so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, has roiled the federal government by slashing personnel and budgets at dozens of agencies. In a statement, the NSA said the meeting was intended to ensure both organizations were “aligned” with the new administration’s priorities.Haugh had led both the NSA and Cyber Command since 2023. Both departments play leading roles in the nation’s cybersecurity. The NSA also supports the military and other national security agencies by collecting and analysing a vast amount of data and information globally.Cyber Command is known as America’s first line of defence in cyberspace and also plans offensive cyber-operations for potential use against adversaries. Defense secretary Pete Hegseth recently ordered the office to pause some offensive cyber-operations against Russia, in another sign of how Trump’s administration is transforming the work of the nation’s intelligence community.Renée Burton, a cybersecurity expert previously working for the NSA,told CNNthe removal of the personnel was “alarming” and the disruption would “expose the country to new risk”.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS national securityUS militaryUS politicsDonald TrumpDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

The virus has been spreading in undervaccinated communities, and since February, two unvaccinated people have died from measles-related causes.‘The goal is to disassemble public health’: experts warn against US turn to vaccine skepticismRead moreThe multi-state outbreak confirms health experts’ fears that the virus will take hold in other US communities with low vaccination rates and that the spread could stretch on for a year. The World Health Organization said last week that cases in Mexico were linked to theTexasoutbreak.Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable throughvaccination, and in 2000 had been declared eliminated from the US.The outbreak in Texas began more than two months ago. State health officials said on Friday there were 59 new cases of measles since Tuesday, bringing the total to 481 across 19 counties – most of them in west Texas. The state also logged 14 new hospitalizations, for a total of 56 throughout the outbreak.More than 65% of the Texas cases are in Gaines county, which has a population of 22,892, and where the virus stated spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county now has logged 315 cases since late January – just over 1% of the county’s residents.Explore more on these topicsUS healthcareMMRTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

The Dow’s two-day slump has wiped out $6.4tn in value, according to Dow Jones Market Data.The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, sank 5.8%, and entered bear market territory, having fallen more than 20% since peaking in December.Over the week, the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, its worst five-day trading stretch since March 2020.Trump sought to reverse the slide, but aninsistence that his policies “will never change”in an all-caps social media post appeared to only reinforce apprehension over his strategy.“ONLY THE WEAK WILL FAIL!” he wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform.Chinaoutlined plans to retaliate, setting the stage for an all-out trade war between the world’s two largest economies, as other governments worldwide pulled together their response.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But already shopkeepers are bracing forrecession, and their customers spending less, as they prepare to increase prices.“We’re going to have to put our prices up and people aren’t going to like it,” said Ian Anderson, store manager at Tea and Sympathy, a UK grocery store, restaurant and fish-and-chip shop stalwart in Manhattan’s West Village.Business costs have already increased significantly, he noted. But tariffs would add to the load. “We’ve survived so far because we sell base products – cakes, scones, hot cross buns, mince pies. If it was just imports, we’d struggle.”From Nike to Apple: which US brands could be hit hardest by Trump tariffs and what’s at stake?Read moreMost retailers in theNew Yorkneighborhood agreed on one thing: the tariffs announced this week would contribute to business environment anxieties that have been mounting for years, from the 2008 economic crisis, to the initial wave of tariffs under Trump’s first administration, the Covid pandemic and the high inflation that followed.But many also said it was too soon to tell if Trump’s tariffs would ultimately go into effect – or if they were just the opening salvo of his latest shock-and-awe style of dealmaking. A day earlier, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, encouraged countries around the world to refrain from retaliating against the US.For businesses that rely on wealthy downtown residents and visitors to the city, prices of imported goods had already been rising. A 10% levy on UK imports, 20% on other European imports, and a patchwork of numbers on other countries will not help at all, according to Jennifer Pulidore, the owner of Myers of Keswick, a family business selling British groceries for four decades.View image in fullscreenJennifer Pulidore, the owner of Myers of Keswick, at her West Village shop.Photograph: Ed Helmore“The price of chocolate has gone up astronomically,” she said. “Our Easter order was over £7,000 [$9,100] more compared to last year and we didn’t grossly increase the quantities,” Pulidore said. Myer’s imports broker hadn’t yet estimated what the new tariffs would cost, but Pulidore doubts that customers will accept $2 more on a $16 box of chocolates.Customers, she said, are already questioning why shortcake originally marked at £2.25 was already $6.95. Customers, she said, sometimes question the mark-up. “Well, do you not consider we are inNew YorkCity and we pay New York City rent? Our employees don’t work for free. And I have to pay that price, and then get it over here.”Myers is celebrating 40 years in business in July. Pulidore’s father, Peter Myers, has retired back to Cumbria. Pulidore thinks about the future of the business “all the time”.Trump argues that his plan – however disruptive – will create American jobs and trigger a vast windfall for the country, despitemany economists’ warnings. “I get that,” said Pulidore’s. “But the implementation – the ways he’s gone about it – is just awful. I’m definitely worried about a recession, and people spending less.”At a clothing store, a Canadian customer on his way back to Toronto arrived to return goods because he didn’t want to pay 25% retaliatory duties going into Canada. The store offered to ship and label the items as gifts, thereby avoiding the duties. “It’s scary times,” offered a sales assistant. “Like, wasn’t the first time scary enough with Trump? Why do we have to do this again?”Nearby, having her picture taken in front of Carrie Bradshaw’s fictional Sex and the City townhouse, was Siobhan Copeland and her son, visiting from London. Fears about coming through customs at JFK a day earlier had proved unfounded.“I was a bit apprehensive, but he just asked me to pronounce my name, so it was all good,” Copeland said. But she was hopeful about the tariff conflict, because the UK appeared to have a “slightly better relationship with the US than Europe now that we’re separated. But who knows what’s to come?

Anderson’s contractor was already warning before the latest round of tariffs that building materials, mostly from China, would put the cost at around $80,000.The bitter irony of tariff wars, store owner Hakim at Waverly Wines & Spirits on Sixth Avenue pointed out, is that prices don’t necessarily go down if the tariffs are lifted. He pointed to a bottle of Lagavulin Scotch whisky priced at $115.99. Prior to Trump’s 25% tariffs during his first term, the bottle was $75.“We’ve still never recovered from that,” he said. “Scotch prices went up but they never went down when the tariffs were removed.

Traditional defensive havens offered some refuge, with gains seen in consumer staples and utilities.”Shares in Indian pharmaceutical companies also slumped after Trump said that US tariffs on drugmakers were still under consideration. The NSE Nifty Pharma index fell more than 6% on Friday.Pharmaceutical companies had experienced a boost on Thursday as the sector was believed to have been exempted from the US import duties.In the UK, a Treasury minister said the government was “negotiating intensively” and “at pace” to secure a deal with the US. The government is also consulting on possible retaliatory action.The exchequer secretary to the Treasury, James Murray, told Sky News: “The next stage of engagement is to ask [for companies’] input about what possible measures would look like in terms of the UK response because we want to involve businesses in that decision, and we need to be clear that we keep all options on the table … We reserve the right to retaliate but we want a deal, and our full focus is on that.”Oil graphicBond prices have jumped across Europe and the US amid fears over global economic growth.UK government bonds – seen as a safe haven asset – increased in value, sending the yield, or effective interest rate, plummeting. The two-year UK government bond yield fell to its lowest level since last September, 0.29 percentage points lower than when US tariffs were announced. The 10-year gilt was 0.1% lower, taking it to the lowest level since February.The falls will ease the pressure on the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who announced cuts to welfare spending in the spring statement largely to cover an increase in borrowing costs earlier this year.Traders also ramped up their bets on cuts to UK interest rates. The money markets now expect about 74 basis points of cuts by the Bank of England this year. That shows that three more quarter-point rate cuts are almost fully priced in.A cut, from thecurrent level of 4.5%, at the Bank’s next rate-setting meeting in early May is now an 86% chance, up from about 75% on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)Kristalina GeorgievaTrump tariffsGlobal economyStock marketsInternational tradeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The country’s trade minister, Don Farrell, said it was “clearly a mistake”.George Plant, the administrator of Norfolk Island,told the Guardian on Thursday: “There are no known exports from Norfolk Island to the United States.”But according to US government data, presented by the Observatory of Economic Complexity, Norfolk Island exported US$655,000 (A$1.04m) worth of goods to the US in 2023, with its main export being US$413,000 (A$658,000) worth of leather footwear.There is one large shoe shop on Norfolk Island, Franks Shoes. Its manager said in an email to the Guardian: “We are a shoe shop selling shoes to the tourists that visit the island and do not export shoes to the US or have any business with the US.”The Guardian has identified two bills of lading – records of cargo shipments – for shipments each containing 3,714 black Timberland men’s ankle boots that set sail from South Riding port in the Bahamas for Miami, Florida, in December 2023. The shipments were worth a combined total of US$315,000 (A$498,000).The bills of lading list “Norfolk Island” as the country of origin and the address of the shipper as Timberland, 200 Domain Drive, Stratham 03885-2575, Norfolk Island.Timberland’s corporate office address is listed as 200 Domain Drive, Stratham, New Hampshire on its LinkedIn page.A spokesperson for Timberland shoes said: “We are in a quiet period and have no comment.”Map of Australian external territoriesOther bills of lading that appear to have erroneously listed Norfolk Island as the country of origin include several from an aquarium and fountain company, OASE, which sent shipments from Norfolk in the UK to the US, and steel equipment sent from Novum Structures in Norfolk, UK, to the US.Novum Structure’s address is listed on one bill of lading as 14 Hopper Way, DissBusinessPark, Diss, Norfolk Island, instead of Norfolk in the UK, which is its EU headquarters, according to Novum’s website.OASE and Novum were contacted for comment. The Guardian is not alleging that any of the companies are responsible for the errors in the paperwork.The US Census Bureau, the agency responsible for collating US trade statistics, acknowledgesin its guide to trade statisticsthat such reporting errors can occur and can “significantly impact detailed commodity statistics”.The shipping databases that the Guardian used to check bill of lading information appear to rely on documents released by US customs under freedom of information requests, so it is not clear when in the process errors were made – during the exporting and shipping process or during the data collection process.The errors in the shipping records appear to have flowed through to US census and trade data used as the basis for calculating tariffs.Farrell told the ABC on Friday that the US’s 29% tariff imposed on Norfolk Island was “clearly a mistake” as Norfolk Island was part of Australia and so should be subject to the same tariff as the rest of the country. He said the Australian government would raise the issue with the US administration.“It’s an indication that this was a rushed process,” he said. “The trade system that America has until yesterday been working on had been built up since the second world war. In the space of four weeks, the American president has upended that process. So I think it was inevitable that mistakes would be made and particularly including Norfolk Island as [a] 29% tariff.”Journalistsandeconomistshave figured out the method used by the Trump administration to calculate the tariffs placed on other countries and territories.It is a simple formula which produces a tariff percentage based on the country’s trade deficit with the US in 2024. The Guardian has confirmed that this formula produces the 29% figure using US trade data for Norfolk Island.Heard Island and McDonald Islands – an uninhabited group of islands covered in glaciers near Antarctica, which is also an “external territory” of Australia – was also named in the White House’s list of “countries” hit by tariffs, with a 10% tariff placed on it.The territory does have a fishery but no buildings or human habitation. Despite this, according to export data from the World Bank, the US imported US$1.4m (A$2.23m) of products from Heard Island and McDonald Islands in 2022, nearly all of which was “machinery and electrical” imports.The Guardian has identified multiple bills of lading that suggest exports originated from the remote islands but are largely steel or plastic imports from Europe to the US. The paperwork lists the shipper’s address as being in the Heard Island and McDonald Islands rather than Germany or Austria, however.One bill of lading, from September 2024, relates to parts for a PET recycling plant, shipped from Starlinger Co in Vienna to Oakland California, which lists the address of Starlinger as being in “Vienna, Heard Island and McDonald Islands”. Starlinger Co was contacted for comment.Jared Mondschein, director of research at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, said of the rushed development of the tariff policy: “It doesn’t surprise me that because of the lack of conventional interagency thinking on this, that there were some errors that were not caught.“If you input the wrong data in, then you’re going to get the wrong data out.“And I think in this instance, if there are errors in the shipping records, which, you know, they’re ultimately humans and these things happen, then there’s going to be mistakes.”The trade data issue may also be responsible for other remote areas being targeted with tariffs. The Arctic island of Jan Mayen and the Svalbard archipelago were hit with a 10% trade tariff – againdespite local reporting suggestingfew people lived there and there was very little in the way of exports.Other territories appear to be in a similar situation, with bills of lading for shipments from Indian suppliers being mislabelled as coming from “British Indian Ocean Territory”, a remote external territory of the UK with few inhabitants.Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand in the southern Pacific Ocean, was also targeted with tariffs, and again some shipments have been mislabelled as the suppliers originating from the island, such as a shipment of pergola parts from Turkey.The White House was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsNorfolk IslandTrump administrationDonald TrumpTariffsInternational tradeBusiness (Australia news)newsShareReuse this content"

The plan angered climate campaigners and did little to appease BP’s investors, who have seen BP’s shares underperform compared with its rivals.Lund said: “Having fundamentally reset our strategy, BP’s focus now is on delivering the strategy at pace, improving performance and growing shareholder value. Now is the right time to start the process to find my successor and enable an orderly and seamless handover.”Lund had also faced pressure from the shareholder activist Follow This, a climate campaigner, which planned to vote against the chair at BP’s annual shareholder meeting later this month.On Friday, Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said: “The new chair needs to be climate and transition competent and resistant to short-term activists. BP made a strategic U-turn in panic mode after an alleged short-term activist bought shares in BP. We hear a lot of frustration from long-term investors on this aspect.”Lund was at the centre of ahigh-profile stormover a £25m remuneration package to lure him to BG Group, formerly the exploration arm of British Gas that wasacquired by Shell for £47bn in 2015.The Norwegian joined BG Group in 2014 after a stellar 10-year career transforming Statoil, now known as Equinor, from a local operator in Norway into a global oil and gas company.Ashareholders’ revoltforced BG Group toamend Lund’s pay packageto ensure his earnings would be more closely linked to company performance.Amanda Blanc, the boss of Aviva and a senior independent director at BP, will lead the search for a new chair.Explore more on these topicsBPOil and gas companiesEnergy industryOilGasnewsShareReuse this content"

Not for the first time, he spotted the right play just a little earlier than everyone else. And of course this was always his gift: not simply to pick the right option but to do it faster than anyone else, buying him those crucial fractions of a second when everything else was in flux and only he in stillness.And of course this was not the only respect in which De Bruyne understood the game of football better than most. As a struggling teenager in the Genk academy, he noticed the way the club abruptly stopped paying for a foster family to house him, and then quietly resumed when he started banging in goals for the second team. Cast adrift at Chelsea, he noticed how he was ignored while first-team players were lavished with attention and bespoke coaching.‘One of the greatest’: De Bruyne hailed by Guardiola after confirming exitRead moreIn short, De Bruyne always intuited the brutal transactional nature of football, the way people hold doors open for you when things are going well, let them close when things are not. The way your only intrinsic worth is the worth you can provide to someone else. So far this season, he has providedManchester Citywith just two league goals and 49% of the minutes for which he was available. His contract is up this summer. The pieces are moving, Kevin. The pass is on. All that remains is for you to play it.And should he want to accept the offer of the Saudi Pro League, or indeed a top league in Europe, then it is a pass that probably needs to be played sooner rather than later. Aged 33, increasingly vulnerable to injury and with more than 50,000 minutes in his legs for club and country, his peak years are beginning to winnow away. Already two games a week at high intensity feels like a stretch. But in the good moments, when the ball rolls towards his feet and the pitch somehow seems to expand around him, he can still stir the imagination like few others alive.Some will advocate De Bruyne as the Premier League’s greatest midfielder of all time. Some will insist he wasn’t even Manchester City’s. Personally I suspect he may ultimately slot into the Roy Keane bracket – obviously not in terms of skillset, but as a player who performed one particular midfield skill so outstandingly that their true all-round value will probably be forgotten a little by history. And in the same way that Keane’s aggression obscured his brilliant vision and distribution, there is perhaps a danger that De Bruyne will be remembered exclusively as a luxury pinger, a threader and a crosser, a ginger Beckham.View image in fullscreenKevin De Bruyne hoists the European Cup in Istanbul in 2023.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAWhich would of course be unfair. Because beyond his exquisite technique – and let’s face it, lots of players can pass a ball nicely these days – what defines De Bruyne is that throttling intensity, not just the killer pass but the killer pass at the end of a lung-busting sprint, not just the pinpoint cross but the six pinpoint passes and runs that set it up. He could score as well as create, press as well as pass. And in this respect he could scarcely have wished for a better enabler than Pep Guardiola, one of the very few men with an obsession for perfection that matched his own, these two brilliant footballing nerds just brilliantly nerding the shit out of football.For all his individual gifts, the temptation to drown in highlight reels and pass porn, it’s also worth pointing out the halo effect a player like De Bruyne has on the players around him. The confidence to make the run, to show for the ball in tight spots, the knowledge that there is a guy 30 yards away who has made it his life’s work to make you look like a genius. Erling Haaland: “I’m not even looking at him because I know where the pass will come.” Sergio Agüero: “All I have to do is hit the ball.” Phil Foden: “You just have to run into the space and he’s going to find you.”Perhaps a consequence of the way De Bruyne uplifted his teammates is that his own achievements feel somehow normal-sized in comparison. There is no defining De Bruyne moment, no Agüero 2012 or Yaya Touré 2014, beyond perhapsthatpass against Stoke or his goal against Real Madrid in the 2023 Champions League semi-final or his four against Wolves. Arguably his greatest season came in 2019-20, when City collapsed in the league and the Ballon d’Or – in which he would certainly have run Robert Lewandowski very close – was cancelled due to Covid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was and remains an introvert, a family man whose friendships are few but close, whose public pronouncements are scarce but meaningful. Football is the only form of expression he ever needed, to the extent where he would refer to the two Kevins: the quiet bloke off the pitch and the “little bastard” who stepped over the line and entered it.Of course his departure marks a tipping point in the breakup of Guardiola’s last great team. And of course questions of wealth and fairness must intrude at this point, questions of meaning and competitive balance, questions with no simple answers. But just as money sufficiently amassed can buy beauty, surely beauty sufficiently amassed can transcend money. Just as people and memories can be co-opted by power and artifice, so people and memories can breathe life and realness into the artifice, give power a beating human heart.To hold these truths simultaneously, perhaps even to believe in them all equally, is not simply an act of maturity but an act of conscience. The same brilliance that makes football irresistible to despots makes it irresistible to us. The same qualities that render it such a potent tool of control also render it the ultimate escape. Perhaps De Bruyne’s greatest gift, on reflection, was not the ability to make us remember, but to make us forget.Explore more on these topicsKevin De BruyneManchester CityanalysisShareReuse this content"

With an almost startling level of honesty, highly unusual in the sport, the British driver has considered conventional wisdom and its implications and rejected it. That he wants to win is in no doubt but he will not allow his sense of self to be subsumed at the altar of success at all costs.“I feel like there is a very prescribed version of how people say a world champion needs to be – overly aggressive,” he says in hisMcLarenteam’s hospitality on a chilly day in Suzuka before this weekend’s Japanese Grand Prix. “I want to win a championship. I’d rather just be a good person and try to do well. I’ll do whatever I can to win a championship but maybe I won’t sacrifice in my life as much as some others, in terms of who I am as a person and have the ‘fuck you’ mentality people say you’ve got to have. I still believe I can be a world champion but doing it by being a nice guy.”Japan GP practice stopped four times but Tsunoda still delivers for Red BullRead moreThe 25-year-old, in his seventh season in F1, is in the opening phase of the most important year of his career. The McLaren is currently the quickest car on the grid and Norris has already taken one win and a second place in the opening two rounds and leads the world championship. He is likely to face a formidable fight however with teammate Oscar Piastri, the talented young Australian,who claimed victoryat the last round in China.Nonetheless Norris is the focal point, the favourite, facing a barrage of debate about whether he has what it takes to take the title, even with a further 22 races to go. Last season he was given no quarter by a ruthless Max Verstappen, who employed aggressive attacking and defensive driving at Norris’s expense to take the title, leading to widespread questioning of whether he was sufficiently steely to face down the Dutchman.That he has coped with such equanimity is impressive, while he also speaks maturely of his battles with a lack of confidence and depression, and how confronting these challenges and making them public has meant more to him than anything achieved so far in F1.There is an awareness here of the bigger picture. He is relaxed, unafraid to veer from the more comfortable topics of downforce and grip levels, calmly chewing on a banana as he considers his responses that come at length and with thought. So what then of the killer instinct, the supposedly essential ruthlessness required of top sports people and so beloved in F1?“What people want you to believe is you have to think you’re the best in the world, you have to think you can beat everyone,” he says. “That is a great attitude to have but I don’t think it’s the only attitude you have to have if you want to be a champion.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen (left) and Lando Norris went head-to-head for the title in 2024.Photograph: Ali Haider/EPA“I want to just enjoy my life. That’s kind of the attitude that’s maybe not as much of a killer instinct. I just don’t think you have to have that to be a world champion. I want to prove you can be a world champion and not have it. But I don’t want to be pushed around and I also never want to be seen as giving things up because I’m too nice. I’ll still fight for things and I’ll still take risks and I’ll still do whatever I know I can do to be a world champion but without losing the liberty ofwhoI am.”What may develop into an intense battle with Piastri or indeed defending champion Verstappen is likely to test this approach but Norris is adamant he will not take the easy route and obscure his personality beneath a simplistic show of bravado.There are certain things I would not do that other champions have done“I don’t have to show everyone I’ve got that kind of attitude,” he says. “I feel like people go around trying to put on a front and show people that you’ve got that attitude. I can easily go and pretend I’ve got a killer instinct and act like a bit of a dick that might give people that perception.“But there are certain things I would not do that other champions have done. I don’t have as much of a killer instinct as probably most of the drivers or most champions because I was just not brought up that way.”Norris is clearly liberated by feeling he can and should be open about this even knowing these words may be thrown back at him if he is found wanting.He admits to lacking confidence as a child. He grew up in Bristol, where his parents, Cisca and Adam, somewhat reluctantly indulged his need for speed after he became infatuated with a quad bike they bought him when he was five. Indeed they were so concerned for his safety as he hurtled round the garden they sold it, much to young Norris’s distress. However he was not to be denied and found his calling when he took to karting.Norris was happy with his own company and went racing at first not with any career in mind but simply because it was fun. However a relentless march through the ranks also left him questioning himself. He never spent more than one year in any category from karting aged 10 onwards and with every success, the new year would see a new challenge, a reset where the opposition always looked bigger and faster.“I’ve just never seen myself to be as good as Lewis [Hamilton] or even the guys I grew up with,” he explains. “Lewis, George [Russell], or Charles [Leclerc], or Fernando [Alonso], Seb [Vettel], these guys. I never saw myself being in a position of being in F1 in the first place.“For me it was just cool to be able to race against them, more than I want to prove that I’m better.”View image in fullscreenLando Norris in parc ferme after winning the opening race of this season in Australia.Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Formula 1/Getty ImagesHe has previously brought up his struggles with mental healthearly in his time in F1, of doubts fostered in part by this lack of confidence but it played a part in who he is; a determinedly self-critical character.“When I had the negative thoughts of everything and about my own performances, then I would start to think negatively about the next weekend when it’s not even arrived yet,” he says. “It was visible to see on the outside how negative I was and I still am. I’m still the kind of guy that will say: ‘I did a shit job today and I did terrible and I wasn’t good enough.’“Not many other people will probably admit to those kind of things but that will always be me. It was having a toll on me and my wellbeing.”This led to depression he sought help for which led him to taking a hard look at himself in order to then set about changing it, notably halfway through last year when the McLaren was upgraded to become a title contender and Norris entered the fight with Verstappen. The former world champion Nico Rosberg also contacted him with advice, revealing he had been through similar circumstances.“I am still very hard on myself, just probably a bit less publicly now than what I was in the past,” Norris says. “But I can also deal with things better than I could.”He believes he has come out stronger, which in turn puts him in better stead for the title challenge this year. Yet it is fascinating that Norris also feels speaking out on the subject has been of such great import, but that even in doing so he felt uncomfortable.View image in fullscreenThe McLaren of Lando Norris (pictured) and Oscar Piastri has been the fastest car on the track for the opening two races of the season.Photograph: Sopa Images/LightRocket/Getty Images“The worst bit of all of it is that I know how lucky I am to travel the world, get paid well. I can almost do whatever I want in my life and I know how lucky I am to be in that position,” he says. “So I feel like I don’t have the right sometimes to maybe complain or to say certain things as much as other people.“But for me, it’s certainly been a win talking about it because of the amount of messages that I got from people, saying how much having someone in my position and being able to relate to that has helped them.”His decision had far-reaching effects for both himself and others. “Even if it was just one message, that’s made me happier because when it’s mentioned that you saved their life because they wanted to end their life. I got quite a few of them; that makes me happier than winning a race,” he says. “That’s just my perception of life, that’s a bigger impact. Because you made a difference. Winning a race doesn’t make a difference.”There remains an awfully long way to go but with credit to Norris, a nice guy might yet take the title on his own terms.Explore more on these topicsLando NorrisMcLarenFormula OneMotor sportinterviewsShareReuse this content"

TheNBAhit back with a real fine.A day after Morantagain used his aiming-a-gun gestureto celebrate making three-pointers, the Grizzlies’ star was fined $75,000 by the league Friday. It’s the second time this week that Morant – who was suspended twice in 2023 for incidents with actual weapons – heard from the league about mimicking the act of using a gun during a game.The league called the gesture “inappropriate,” adding that “Morant was previously warned by the league office that this gesture could be interpreted in a negative light.”Stephen A Smith v LeBron James turns NBA’s narrator into a main characterRead moreThe first interaction with the league office resulted in that warning, after Morant and Golden State’s Buddy Hield made the gesture at one another during a Grizzlies-Warriors game on Tuesday. The warning from the league office was evidently ignored, since Morant made similar gestures in Thursday’s game.The NBA said it happened twice, though it appeared to have happened after all three of his made three-pointers. The third instance was not shown on the TNT broadcast of the game.Morant and other members of the Grizzlies have used the gun gesture numerous times this season, including during Thursday night’s game at Miami. Morant made a three-pointer in the first quarter of that game, then turned toward the Memphis bench with his left arm fully extended, his right thumb pointed in the air and his index and middle fingers pressed together.The other gestures were similar, again directed toward Memphis teammates.The two suspensions in 2023 cost Morant 33 games and about $8.3m in salary. The first was an eight-game ban for the live streaming of a video in which he displayed a firearm while in an intoxicated state at a Denver-area nightclub.The other was a 25-game ban after posing with a firearm in a car during another live-streamed video, when the league said Morant “wielded the firearm while knowing that he was being recorded and that the recording was being live streamed on Instagram Live, despite having made commitments to the NBA and public statements that he would not repeat the conduct for which he was previously disciplined.”Asked Thursday – after he made a game-winning shot at the buzzer to lift Memphis over Miami – about the criticism, Morant said he is “well aware” of what gets said about him.“I’m kind of used to it,” Morant said. “I was pretty much a villain for two years now. Every little thing, if somebody can say something negative about me, it’s going to be out there. So, yeah. I don’t care no more.”The Grizzlies next play Saturday at Detroit.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsMemphis GrizzliesnewsShareReuse this content"

Once you’ve grabbed your slice of league-wide media rights, made a vaguely colonial-sounding pre-season tour of the “Far East,” stitched up some sponsorship deals with a gambling company or a country’s tourism agency, and shipped as many shirts as the global merch market can handle, you hit the ceiling of your earning capacity. At that point, as a club, what do you do?You canraise ticket prices, which risks alienating fans and the local community you’re supposed to represent. You can try your hand at a fewmiserable little crypto or AI plug-insto build “engagement” among supporters or become a pioneer in the nascent field of fan “activations,” with limited potential returns. You canpromise to build a new 100,000-seat stadium, but that takes time and money and doesn’t solve your immediate (or even future, should you go into debt to finance the project) need for cash. You canflog off a hotel or twoto a sibling subsidiary of your parent company, though for that you need to start off with a couple of hotels. You can hope to sell to a monied investor, but the days of loss-indifferent billionaires making vanity investments in clubs seem over, and there are only so many publicity-hungry sovereign wealth funds to go around.Are some clubs cursed? The narrative can be as powerful as the truthRead moreEventually, a much cleaner, easier option presents itself: instead of building revenue, you can cut costs.The same spirit of austerity that is now rising with particular viciousness in the US under the Trump administration is beginning to sweep through European soccer. Elon Muskwith his chainsawand Sir Jim Ratclifferestricting lunchesat the Manchester United staff canteen are dual embodiments of a process, introduced under the guise of sustainability, likely to hurt and demoralize rather than improve and elevate.After years in which runaway inflation in player salaries and a near-total absence of financial regulation saw big clubs across Europe rack up unsustainable expenses and debts, a new era of fiscal rectitude is upon us. Planning, control, precision, and discipline are the path to on-field success now, and increasingly clubs seem eager to project the same values off the pitch as well. But if austerity on the pitch achieves a kind of stark, hairless, Guardiola-esque perfection, off the pitch it seems more likely to promote an emerging feudalism. It deepens inequalities between the corporate suite and the concourse, between football’s royals and its commoners.With 39% of the in-house staff laid off over the past 12 months in the service of a “transformation plan” to return Manchester United to profitability, Ratcliffe’s club – or rather, the club in which he remains a minority owner, a point that’s critical to any consideration of where the real economic malaise in this particular instance lies – is the poster child for this new spirit of austerity.Manchester United has long fancied itself the world’s most consequential football club, a self-image that on-field results over the past decade have failed to validate. In the new order of punitive penny-pinching, though, the club’s status as a market leader is comfortably earned.Other leading clubs across Europe have instituted miserly cuts in recent times: Chelseachoppedthe away fan coach subsidy a few years ago, snatching £10 from each traveling supporter at a time when the club was busy splashing almost £1bn on player signings. Amid Ligue 1’songoing broadcast crisis, Lyon isstudyinga plan to cut up to 90 staff members. With teams across France’s top two divisions reportedly facing combined losses of €1.2 billion, the fiscal savagery of deep cost cuts may not even be enough to save some of them. In Spain, which has a longer history of stringent financial regulation than England, the crisis is less acute and big teams like Barcelona have not yet resorted to mass layoffs, but the infamous “levers” the club is pulling to generate short-term revenue will inevitably hit its long-term balance sheet and staff redundancies may soon become necessary.Austerity is the poltergeist now lurking permanently in the background of modern football. On its own, of course, there’s nothing wrong with controlling costs: all clubs have to live within their means. But there are always choices involved in cutting spending, and in the new spirit of austerity it’s often the most vulnerable within a club – the cooks, the cleaners, the ticket sellers – who feel the axe first.At Manchester United, for instance, it’s notable that “superfluous” back office jobs have been eliminated while the real cause of the club’s dire financial straits remains undisturbed: the interest on bank loans incurred as part of the Glazer family’s leveraged buyout and exorbitant spending on player and executive recruitment. The club paid£36m servicing its debt last season, and cumulative interest payments on the debt generated to fund the Glazers’ 2005 acquisitionrecently hit $1bn.Ratcliffe hastriedto turn the £175,000 a year the club was supposedly paying its (still unidentified) in-house “body language consultant” into the scandal of the century even as the club, under his own watch, has shelled out £4.1m to get rid of sporting director Dan Ashworth and £10.6m to cut Erik Ten Hag loose. The club’s continuing servitude to the Glazers, who retain majority control, remains an immovable burden on the fiscal outlook. None of this matters, apparently, when there are rank-and-file staff members to fire and free lunches to cut.However selective the penny pinching may be, this new austerity is not purely about job cuts. It’s about socializing economic pain; making the matchday experience less accessible for ordinary working people is part of this process. This is by no means a new phenomenon; the saga over ticket hikes has been ongoing for years. But there’s every sign this grimy trade of profit for risk will intensify in coming years as owners begin to realize that running clubs at a profit is a fiendishly difficult task.Many of the measures taken at Manchester United and elsewhere may look like regular corporate downsizing. They are that, of course, but I believe there’s something additional at work here, that the socialization of economic pain has an explicitly ideological dimension that’s similar to the way that governments have pursued austerity as a form of economic “common sense” since the 1980s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAs political economists likeMark BlythandMartijn Koningshave shown, there’s a formula to the imposition of austerity at a national level that will sound familiar to anyone paying attention to recent financial maneuvering across European soccer. The disciplining authority – usually an incoming government, but sometimes an institution like a central bank or the IMF – must claim they inherited a calamity, that the situation is so dire that exceptional measures are necessary. The legitimacy of austerity is grounded in the argument that present restraint is the precondition for a glorious future of growth, investment, and generosity, enclosing society in what globalization’s water carrier-in-chief, Thomas Friedman, once called a “golden straitjacket.” While the needs of “ordinary people” are met with skepticism and subjected to the tightest cost-benefit analysis, even the most hallucinatory projections of financiers and tech titans are credulously taken as gospel.It’s notable how neatly this template maps on to the approach that Ratcliffe has taken at Manchester United, where the fiscal emergency is so acute, he has claimed, that the club would have run out of money by Christmas without the cuts he’s implemented, and where the pain of the present is sweetened by thefantasy– unfinanced and so far in the distance it’s exempt from the details of ordinary planning – of a throbbing, starchitect-designed “mini-city” that will rank as the “largest public space in the world” (is this good?), expand the club’s match-day capacity to 100,000, and bring laughter, joy and (no doubt) overpriced tacos to the long-suffering denizens of Manchester’s redder half. For those who are prepared to weather the economic storm, Ratcliffe is promising, sunnier days are ahead.But what if they’re not? The modern fantasy of austerity was born in the 1990s, when the end of the Cold War fed triumphalist narratives about the invincibility of market liberalism, and Third Way Democrat Bill Clinton’s fiscal cuts preceded a spurt in US growth and investment. Ratcliffe is a product of this era – he founded petrochemicals giant Ineos in 1998 – and incarnates its fossilized wisdom. Understanding the future trajectory of Ratcliffe’s Restructuring United is not an exercise in pure speculation, because he’s already tried to implement 1990s thinking in other parts of his business empire.Ineos acquired the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland in 2005 and almost immediately began cutting costs: retirement benefits were the first big target for savings, and eventually, after years of grinding workplace conflict, Ratcliffe secured ahumiliating victoryover the unions and workers agreed to freeze pay and strike action. When the refinery received its first shipment of US shale gas in 2016, Ineos’s in-house magazine InchhailedGrangemouth’s “renaissance”, projecting the plant would soon be making a yearly profit of £100m; Ratcliffe claimed the move “guarantees the security of thousands of jobs in Scotland”. Late last year Ineosannouncedit was shutting down the refinery owing to soft demand and soaring costs; more than 400 jobs will likely be lost when the plant ceases operation this summer. For most workers at Grangemouth, the 20-year austerity-borne promise of a beautiful future has ended up delivering nothing more than joblessness for many. For Ratcliffe and the plant’s owners, however, it’s been a rather more remunerative affair: recent reportssuggestthat the Ineos-backed joint venture that owns Grangemouth could earn around £6m from the sale of thousands of free pollution permits once the refinery closes this summer.Since the turn of the century austerity has been an economic and political disaster, leading to the decades of stagnation in growth and incomes across the developed world that are in part responsible for the rise of the far right – the very political forces now looking, in the US at least, to drive society even further into the ground with more austerity. The limp decline of the Grangemouth plant shows how suicidal austerity thinking at a smaller scale can be, and despite all his promises of a proud and gleamingly erect, tent-covered future, there’s good reason to suspect that Ratcliffe could lead Manchester United down a similar path (unless, that is, people become too mean to him online, at which point hemight walk away from the club).The vampiric snips that Ratcliffe has implemented make Manchester United look like a small club that’s getting smaller – and perhaps that’s the point. Eventually, in nominally seeking to heal the patient, the doctor can cut so hard that the patient bleeds to death. In the end, it might not be sustainability rules, underwhelming media rights deals, or football’s natural earnings ceiling that push Europe’s top clubs to the financial brink, but the business world’s old-fashioned zeal for economic punishment.Explore more on these topicsFootballBusiness of soccerManchester UnitedcommentShareReuse this content"

It was to be ready the next time teammates Khaman Maluach and Patrick Ngongba broke out water guns at the cold tubs.“I’m definitely ordering one as well,” Flagg said with a grin, a nod to the fact that he’s still “just being a kid.”Maybe so, but the 18-year-old’s game has been far more advanced than his age from the opening tip of his college debut. Scoring. Rebounding. Setting up teammates as a playmaker, then aiding them as a defender. He did it all amid high expectations as the potential No 1 overall NBA draft prospect, the driving force with a relentless competitive edge and mature focus for a team now two wins from a national championship.It is why Flagg was named The Associated Press men’s college basketball national player of the year on Friday, becoming only the fourth freshman to win the award in its 64-year history.USC’s JuJu Watkins wins AP women’s player of the year awardRead moreThe 6ft 9in, 205-pound forward from Newport, Maine, won a two-man race with Auburn star Johni Broome. Both players were unanimous first-team AP All-Americans with teams at the Final Four, and they were the only two to receive player-of-the-year votes, Flagg winning 41 of the 61.Flagg joins Duke’s Zion Williamson (2019), Kentucky’s Anthony Davis (2012) and Texas star Kevin Durant (2007) as freshman winners. Each went either No 1 or No 2 overall in the NBA Draft a few months later. Flagg is the eighth Duke player to win the award, most of any program.“He plays so hard, he’s competitive, a great teammate,” Duke coach Jon Scheyer said after the Blue Devils’ home finale, “and obviously his ability is special.”Flagg was just 17 when he arrived at Duke after reclassifying to graduate early from high school. Yet he has exceeded all hype as the nation’s top-ranked recruit, with Flagg leading Duke in scoring (18.9 points per game), rebounding (7.5), assists (4.2) and steals (1.4) while ranking second in blocks (1.3) entering Saturday’s national semi-final against Houston.“I hold myself to a high standard, high expectations,” Flagg told the AP. “Just because I know how much work I’ve put in and how many hours I’ve spent grinding and putting that work in … It’s those expectations of just trusting what you do and just doing it to the highest level.”And he repeatedly did that.View image in fullscreenCooper Flagg set the standard for true freshman this season.Photograph: Jared C Tilton/Getty ImagesHe scored an Atlantic Coast Conference freshman-record 42 points against Notre Dame. There was his highlight-reel transition dunk against Pittsburgh. The big game to help the Blue Devils beat Broome’s Tigers, along with going for 30 points in an NCAA Sweet 16 win against Arizona that Scheyer called “one of the best tournament performances I’ve ever coached or been a part of.”Cohesive play is the hallmark of this Blue Devils team, the only one ranked in KenPom’s top five for both adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency.It has offered ways for Flagg to improve in his first and possibly lone college season as he learned “the level of the details” required to thrive. It was ensuring he got in for pre-practice recovery sessions. Or listening when graduate transfer Mason Gillis and junior Tyrese Proctor pushed the importance of sleep, prompting Flagg to nix a high-school habit of late-night phone scrolling.March Madness: top seeds Duke and Florida move on to men’s Final FourRead more“As far as outside expectations, I couldn’t really care less,” Flagg said. “For me, it’s more about following the expectations of my teammates, my coaches, my family. Everybody’s human so I’m going to make mistakes. I’m not going to be at my best all the time.“But that’s what having great teammates and great coaches does for you. They just always have my back and are always there for me.”His mother, Kelly, almost envies how her son handles that.“I think he sees it but he really doesn’t let it bother him,” she told the AP. “And I wish I was more like that. He’s so comfortable with who he is, and he’s always been that way. That’s why he doesn’t get rattled easily, because he believes in himself and it doesn’t really matter to him what other people think.“That’s a special ability to be able to drown out the noise when the noise can be overwhelming at times for somebody like him. I’m really proud of him for being able to do that.”She and husband Ralph have kept a close eye on how he’s been doing after moving to North Carolina for this year while Ace, Cooper’s twin brother, completes his final season of high school basketball in Greensboro, an hour away. Flagg said it helped to have family close, including when he visited for a few days around Christmas and got multiple days in the gym with his father and brothers.“When you are able to step back and just take a break, it can be really good to just get your mind clear and kind of refocus,” he said.It showed up on the court, notably as he elevated his scoring (20.1 points, up from 16.9), assists (4.5, up from 3.7), shooting percentage (51%, up from 43.8%) and 3-point percentage (.434, up from 27.1) after 1 January.Indeed, Flagg seems wired for big moments when the stakes rise, something his mother has seen going back to his childhood. There was his hatred of losing from early on, such as demanding to keep playing after losing in a driveway game of H-O-R-S-E with Kelly – who played in college at Maine – or a board game like Trouble.Cooper Flagg looks like a future NBA superstar. He may choose to stay in collegeRead moreHe always wanted to be first to do anything even when it seemed a bit much, such as the family working with eldest brother Hunter to ride a bike without training wheels – only to have the then-three-year-old Cooper announce “I can do it, Momma” and back it up.When it came to basketball, he tested his parents’ nerves by constantly dribbling on the hardwood floors at home. But success came quickly, too, with whispers soon spreading around Maine about the prodigy playing up several grade levels.“When he was younger, if somebody stole the ball from him or he turned it over or got fouled or did something (wrong), we would say it was a 50/50 shot whether he was going to pick up a crazy foul or he was going to do something spectacular,” Kelly said. “And as he’s gotten older, it was more the chances of something really good was about to happen.”Flagg noted multiple times how much he has enjoyed Duke. He has talked about making connections and fitting in with other students he called “elite in their own respects.”That’s offered a respite from the spotlight, even as he’s featured in ads and commercials as a leading-man star for college basketball with players permitted to profit from their athletic fame. He is now used to requests for autographs and selfies, shrugging that “there could be worse problems to have.”Flagg has avoided saying he is making the expected jump to the NBA after the season. For now, there are more pressing things to deal with, from the Final Four to ordering that water gun.“I have to,” Flagg said. “What am I going to do? I’m going to be unarmed?”Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsNCAA TournamentNCAA Tournament 2025newsShareReuse this content"

I also thought we were developing in October and November, but we took risks. We’re getting closer to how we want to play against different opponents. We know a lot can change quickly, but I’m just very happy with the win and how we showed up.”Lucy Bronze and Keira Walsh were rampant as goals from both bookended those from Millie Bright and the substitutes Aggie Beever-Jones and Jess Park to condemn the team ranked 16 places below them.The win, England’s second from their opening three Nations League games, ensured they sit a point above Spain at the top of group A3, who secured a 3-2 win over Portugal in the earlier fixture.Ashton Gate was heaving and alive for the visit of the European champions as they continue their preparations for their title defence in the summer. If ever there was an advert for why England – men and women – should venture from beneath the Wembley arch from time to time, this was it, fans shoulder to shoulder outside the ground, faces being painted, scarves being bought, signs clutched in hands, eager to see their idols up close. The sold-out crowd made the stadium hum and the players matched their energy, the combination of Bronze and Beth Mead on the right electric, Walsh’s balls in to the Arsenal forward reminiscent of Euro 2022 and Lauren James a constant threat.View image in fullscreenAggie Beever-Jones celebrates after scoring England’s third goal.Photograph: Tom Sandberg/PPAUK/REX/ShutterstockIt took 21 minutes for Wiegman’s side to find the net but it had been coming, Alessia Russo having tested the strength of the upright within two minutes of kick-off as the home team dominated. James was the instigator, whipping a pinpoint ball to the head of Chelsea teammate Bronze who flicked it goalwards, a kind deflection off Amber Tysiak lifting it over goalkeeper Nicky Evrard and in. It was a well deserved goal for the right-back who, at 33, continues to demonstrate why she is one of the first names on the teamsheet, her energy levels and drive unmatched.England doubled their lead with the final touch of the half though and Bronze, again, was key, heading on a corner where Bright was on hand to bundle in.The crowd were lapping it up, Mexican waves sweeping from stand to stand as early as 25 minutes in and phone torches out as soon as the sun faded for impromptu light shows. There was a somewhat worrying change at half-time, with James replaced by Beever-Jones. “She had a small tweak on her leg so we didn’t take any risks and took her out straight away,” said the manager. “I don’t know how it is right now. I think it was her hamstring.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sheva put Ireland ahead with 48 minutes on the clock, her shot taking two deflections on its way into the net, and 13 minutes later it was 2-0 as Kyra Carusa converted a rebound after Leanne Kiernan's shot was saved.The third arrived with 16 minutes remaining, Jessie Stapleton heading in McCabe's corner. Another substitute, Amber Barrett, made her mark in stoppage time, celebrating her 50th cap in style with the fourth.

Northern Ireland drew first blood in Bucharest when Danielle Maxwell struck in the 33rd minute.

Denmark, ranked 12th in the world and 19 places above Wales, led through Signe Bruun's early strike after seven minutes but were pegged back before half-time by Holland.Wales had a wonderful opportunity to take the lead as Hannah Cain bore down on goal in the 70th minute, only for goalkeeper Maja Bay Østergaard to win the one-on-one duel. Denmark worked the same opening within 30 seconds and substitute Amelie Vangsgaard, who had squandered a clear-cut opening minutes earlier, slotted home past Olivia Clark in the Wales goal.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.England maintained their dominance in the second half but with a two-goal cushion the sting was taken out of the game a little, Wiegman’s charges were more calculated. They weathered the briefest of counterattacking spells from Belgium, who were without influential forward Tessa Wullaert, with substitute Féli Delacauw’s effort deflected onto the roof of the net and a dangerous cross from Jill Janssens missed by everyone, and added the third to kill the game moments later in retaliation.Mead and Walsh combined again and this time Beever–Jones was the recipient, slipping the ball into the back of the net.England were soon close to a fourth soon after, Walsh’s effort coming back off the post. Her fellow substitute Park did extend their lead 10 minutes later, latching on to the ball after Janice Cayman let it bounce before flying towards the box and slotting effortlessly past Evrard. Finally, in the 88th minute, Walsh had her goal, her first in 83 appearances for England, her effort taking a small deflection off Justine Vanhaevermaet as it headed into the net.“I was very happy for her because we want her to shoot more,” said Wiegman. “She has a very good shot and we want her to get higher up the pitch, which she did today. Now, we are joking it’s an own goal, but it’s her goal so I’m very happy for her.”At full time the crowd delighted in the show that had been put on for them. This was England’s biggest winning margin since February 2024, a statement of intent from the European champions and a sign things might be clicking into place at exactly the right time.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Nations LeagueEngland women's football teamBelgium women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The manager, who is fighting to continue into next season, described his job as different to anything he had experienced because of the “weight of things you’re trying to rail against”.They include the isolation of the post, how the Spurs manager is normally the lone spokesperson for the club, nobody from the hierarchy publicly defending its positions. This echoed the sentiments of some of his predecessors,especially Antonio Conte. Postecoglou did not name names but it is a matter of fact that the chairman, Daniel Levy, almost never gives interviews. The chief football officer, Scott Munn, and the technical director, Johan Lange, are similarly low-profile.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreOn a related note, Postecoglou considered how media pundits with affiliations to certain clubs will speak up in their favour, creating a more favourable climate for them. With Spurs, it is the opposite, everybody – including former players and managers – piling in on them.More broadly, Postecoglou suggested that whenever there was a bad season at Spurs, the default move was to change the manager, never mind the amount of positivity which had come before. That, he said, had to change. Postecoglou acknowledged that he would say this – it is plainly in his interests – but he hoped that people could take the point without prejudice.“I just don’t think it’s about the managers themselves,” Postecoglou said. “I’ve almost lasted two years. It’s pretty good for Tottenham! At some point, the club needs to stick to something. If I say it now it sounds self-serving and defeats the purpose, so maybe not now … but I think that if you want to change the course of your events, you need to change materially a lot of things in terms of the way your outlook is as a club.“It’s fair to say this year hasn’t worked out but that’s the other thing. We finished fifth last year. In another year, that would have been a Champions League spot. With people, it just doesn’t register. If you have five years at a club and you have maybe one or two disappointing years but you have three really strong years you’d say: ‘I’ll take that.’ But it seems like [at Spurs], you have one good year, you have one poor year and then that’s it. Let’s move on to the next.“That’s what I accepted so I can’t sit here and say: ‘Woe is me.’ It’s fair to say at the moment I’m not doing a good job of turning that mind-shift around. But I am a fighter. I will continue fighting until told otherwise. As has been rightly pointed out, there’s life after this for everybody, including Tottenham and including me.”View image in fullscreenAnge Postecoglou cups his ear after Pape Sarr’s goal which was later disallowed.Photograph: Robin Jones/Getty ImagesPostecoglou was frustrated thathis ear-cupping celebrationtowards the Spurs fans after Pape Sarr’s ultimately disallowed goal inThursday night’s 1-0 defeatat Chelsea became the major talking point, rather than the VAR processes that led to the over-rule. Postecoglou is a sworn enemy of the technology, feeling it is ruining the game. But he recognised the reaction as being very much of a piece with life at Spurs.“People tend to focus on the internals of Tottenham rather than the externals,” Postecoglou said. “Whether that’s the fan disenchantment – that’s internal. External is what happened with the decisions. It seems like every fight ends up being an internal fight at this club. There’s never any defending of the club or the club defending itself.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You probably hear too much from me. It doesn’t have to be just from people at the club, either. I hear plenty of people talking and defending other clubs but it seems with Tottenham, wherever there’s a sore there’s a real pile-on to stick a finger in that sore and then we accept our fate.“In the time I’ve been here, we’ve had two decisions that have gone for us against Liverpool and there has been a national campaign, almost.”Postecoglou was referring mainly to the reaction that followed the Luis Díaz goalthat was mistakenly disallowedby the VAR team in last season’s Premier League fixture at Spurs’s stadium. The other flashpoint came this time out in the Carabao Cup semi-final, first leg, also at Spurs, when Postecoglou’s midfielder Lucas Bergvall was surprisingly spared a second yellow card. Hewent on to scorefor 1-0.“You guys [in the media] know the landscape better than I do but it seems like … I never switch on and hear any sort of strong voice [for Spurs]. The only voice you hear is me. When we’re talking about the bigger clubs, there seems to be a lot more voices. And not always defending them. You need scrutiny and constructive criticism, as well. We definitely get enough of that. But we never get any of the other stuff.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurAnge PostecoglounewsShareReuse this content"

Sheffield Wednesdayannounced their latest financial issueson Monday after failing to pay their players on time at the end of March, putting the Championship side under a dark cloud.This is the latest cause for concern among Owls supporters who have become increasingly frustrated by the ownership of Dejphon Chansiri, and the longer the players are not remunerated the greater the risk of punishment. An English Football League charge could come next week if the players remain unpaid. A fine, transfer ban or points deduction would then be among the options open to the league, which is in dialogue with Wednesday, if the matter is not resolved quickly, which the club is confident it will be.Sheffield Wednesday fail to pay players due to ‘temporary cashflow’ problemsRead moreThere has previously been the late payment of tax bills, a six-point deduction in 2020 for breaching the EFL’s profitability and sustainability rules anda threat last Augustto ban anyone who attended Hillsborough in a fake shirt. In 2023 Chansiri said he wouldstop funding the clubafter criticism from the fans. It is rarely dull.This week’s issue, Wednesday said, arose because there are “significant sums of money owed to the chairman’s businesses”. Chansiri, to his credit, has put in about £3.5m a month in recent years to keep things ticking over. Fans are asking whether he has the means to continue funding the club after overseeing a total loss of £151.4m since taking ownership in 2015. They want clarity before Saturday’s game against Hull at Hillsborough. Borrowing stands at £68m according to the latest accounts.Wednesday have a very different approach to other clubs, organising season-ticket renewals at about Christmas time. This meant the club received a lump sum at the start of the year and makes it more puzzling as to why there is not enough money to fund monthly salaries. TheSheffield WednesdaySupporters’ Trust released two statements this week criticising the way the club is being run.“We’ve asked the club to please come forward with a plan; a documented plan of action in regards to how we move forward and stop this happening again, with details of how he’s going to fund it, how he’s going to do it, if that’s what he’s going to do – if he has a plan,” says the trust’s chairman, Ian Bennett. “If he doesn’t or can’t carry on funding the club in the way that’s needed … the window of opportunity to sell is now.”The past decade has brought a mixed approach from Chansiri, starting with heavy spending on the squad. They made it to theChampionshipplayoff final at the end of his first full season but lost to Hull. The following year the Thai businessman broke the club’s transfer record to sign Jordan Rhodes in an attempt to reach the top flight but Wednesday have been unable to make the leap. Instead, after relegation in 2021, they spent two seasons in League One as budgets tightened. Wednesday appeared to be heading for relegation to the third tier again last season with the Championship’s cheapest squad until the inspired appointment of Danny Röhl in October 2023.View image in fullscreenDanny Röhl has been a success at Sheffield Wednesday but the club could lose him in the summer.Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PA“It’s a shame, really,” says Bennett, reflecting on the Chansiri era. “If he’d have been successful he’d have been seen as the messiah, and now he’s seen as a pariah; that’s the bottom line. I think for the fanbase, this is the straw that broke the camel’s back, and I think the fanbase has finally realised that he’s not a good owner. He might be a decent fella, he might have got all good intentions, but the way the club’s run is not right.”Amid the turmoil the team look settled, sitting 12th, five points off the playoffs. A key reason is Röhl, a novice when he arrived. Under Chansiri there have been nine permanent managers but Röhl has brought stability. He had no playing career to speak of and his previous coaching experience was on the staff at RB Leipzig, Southampton, Bayern Munich and Germany but he quickly turned performances around.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He saved us last season, he’s got us into a position with basically no money, no investment. And a team of, and not being disrespectful to them, but mainly League One players, he’s got them operating at a high level in the Championship.”The club is regarded as ripe for investment in football finance circles and there is a constant flow of interest in big Championship clubs as buyers seek a route to the Premier League. They are an attractive option on paper considering the size of the fanbase and stadium but agreement would be needed on money owed and there are issues regarding Hillsborough. The club’s home since 1899 is costly to maintain but building a new stadium would add a huge cost for any buyer. Moreover, the stadium is not owned by the club but by Sheffield 3 Limited, which is controlled by Chansiri.It is understood that whereas Chansiri has received expressions of interest in the past and talks have never progressed because there has been no desire to sell on his part, his stance has softened and he would listen to bids.As supporters become increasingly worried about the future, the club faces a crucial period. Stability is needed off the pitch, with Chansiri or in a new era.Explore more on these topicsSheffield WednesdayChampionshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Owen agreed it would still be special for Liverpool to win the title for a record-equalling 20th time but with the caveat that the two cup defeats in six days would leave “a bitter taste”.It’s unfair to blame Liverpool for being the best team: that’s how you win titles | Barney RonayRead moreSlot, on course to win the Premier League by a comfortable margin in his first season in English football, believes a formerLiverpoolplayer who never won the title with the club should not require a history lesson.“Let me understand it right, Virgil was a bit frustrated because it came across as it’s not enough toonlywin the Premier League?” asked the Liverpool head coach when details of Owen’s post-match interview with Van Dijk were put to him.“Michael did play for us didn’t he? So he is aware of the fact that in 35 years we won the league once? There is your answer. If you can win the league with this club then, phew, nothing else matters I would say. If you do it 10 times in a row then I could understand that people say: ‘Oh but you only win the Premier League.’ If [Manchester] Cityonlywon the Premier League then I could understand people saying: ‘It’s not a good season for City.’ But if, at this club, you can compete for it and let alone win it, then it is a strange question to ask in my opinion. If Virgil has this opinion as well then I agree with him.”Slot also dismissed the theory that this season’s Premier League is easier to win because of City’s dramatic decline and Arsenal’s failure to mount a consistent challenge. He insisted the league was stronger than ever and that it as an outstanding achievement by Liverpool to have 73 points from 30 games and to have lost only once.“I think the league is better than it ever was,” Slot said. “That’s what I hear a lot because the strength overall is getting better. I think even Pep [Guardiola] said there will not be a team again as long as he lives that gets more than 100 points and wins the league four times in a row because so many more teams are having so many more good players.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He joins Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus and Riccardo Calafiori on the sidelines, although there was better news forArsenalon Jurriën Timber and Ben White before Saturday’s game at Everton.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreArteta said both were in contention but that no risks would be taken before Tuesday’s Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid. Injuries to key players have undermined Arsenal’s title challenge and Arteta said it was time to recognise that some are at breaking point given the expanded Champions League, thenew Club World Cup this summerand plans to shift the start of the Africa Cup of Nations to December.“If we demand the players to play more games in more competitions with more travel and more intensity the only solution to deal with it is more players,” the manager said. “I don’t see any other solution. I think it’s been building up for a while and during the summer there are always competitions and then you have the African cup. We’re going to have a new competition coming up now [the Club World Cup] this summer as well, so this is all adding up.“Every month the intensity, the quality and the pressure is increasing and it’s great because we are making the game and the sport known in the world and the quality that we can deliver is high. But I think we have to be very conscious that there are certain limits that the players can do.”Arsenal played 17 games in December and January compared with 11 last season owing to extra commitments in the Champions League and Carabao Cup,where they reached the semi-finals. Arteta outlined how challenging this campaign had been by citing the example of Gabriel. He said the defender was taken off during Arsenal’s win over West Ham in November with a grade one hamstring tear but felt fit enough to return against Fulham six days later.“We decided not to play him,” Arteta said. “On day 12 [against Everton], he plays. But I was very tempted on day six to play him. If I would’ve played him on day six and he has the injury that he’s sustained now against Fulham and he misses four months, [makes a throat-cutting gesture] I would be hammered. So sometimes you protect the player due to knowing this could happen. And then when the player is totally protected, then this happens as well.“There is an element that we cannot control. So we try to do our best.

Tarkowski was booked for a reckless 11th-minute tackle on Alexis Mac Allister in the derby and Howard Webb, head of Professional Game Match Officials Limited, has admitted to Liverpool the challenge wasworthy of a red card.James Tarkowski should have been sent off against Liverpool, admits PGMOLRead moreThe central defender apologised to Mac Allister after the game and Arne Slot, Liverpool’s head coach, welcomed the admission of an error from PGMOL. But that has not stopped abuse of Tarkowski and his family.“Everton Football Club is aware of threats made towards James Tarkowski, and his family on social media,” a club statement said. “Such behaviour is completely unacceptable and has no place in football or society.“The club is liaising with James and his wife Samantha, and stands ready to engage with the social media companies and assist the police with any potential investigation. Everton strongly condemns any form of online or offline intimidation, threats or abuse directed at players, staff, or their families.Everton’s manager, David Moyes, also condemned the treatment of Tarkowski on Friday. “It’s not acceptable for anybody in any walk of life,” said Moyes. “We have to hold our hands up and after looking at it again I believe that it could have been a sending-off but I don’t think that means you get abused online because of that. It’s part of football. He made, which looked at the time I thought, a really good tackle, but looking at it again, I think it was a bit reckless.”Samantha Tarkowski wrote on Instagram that she had no choice but to call out the abuse that followed the derby, even though “we usually just laugh it off”. She posted: “The level of abuse my husband is receiving – wishing death on him, vile comments about me, about us as a couple, and about him as a person – is beyond disgusting.“People forget that he is more than just a footballer. He is a husband, a father, a brother, a friend, and most importantly, the father of our two children. He goes out there and does his job and does it very fucking well yet he’s subjected to so much hate. For those acting like he deliberately set out to hurt someone – r u serious?! Football moves at speed, and tackles are split-second decisions. No player goes out there to injure someone and do you think any player would feel good about it if they did?“But the pure shit messages, the threats? That’s intentional. That’s on you. Football is a sport, but the way some so-called ‘fans’ behave is disgraceful. The abuse, the threats – it’s not passion, it’s pathetic. We’re real people, and this goes far beyond football.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He maintains Diogo Jota’s goal should have been disallowed for offside against Luis Díaz even though, according to Ifab laws, the Colombia international was not in Tarkowski’s line of vision or making a clear attempt to play the ball from an offside position.“I think they are trying to let the game flow and not bring back every offside, but when the incident led to a goal they should have said: ‘Hey, this is offside,’” Moyes said. “I understand a lot of the stuff about Tarky but I found it quite hard that more of the media did not pick up on that. No one talked about the thing that changed the game. They are quite happy to talk about the VAR decision but not the decision that altered the game.“They are saying he is not in his line of vision but Tarky had worked to get a player offside and the ball is played to him. We held the box and a player has not got out the box. I could understand if he was stood on the other side of the pitch and not interfering with the play in any way. I can only see that they’ve hid behind the words, and that’s what they’ll do now.”Explore more on these topicsEvertonLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Dazn remains confident of securing an agreement, with Channel 4 or Channel 5 the most likely partners.Infantino’s $1bn prize: act of commercial disruption disguised as benevolence | Barney RonayRead moreAn industry source told the Guardian that Dazn viewing figures varied depending on the content but that its typical audience for live sport in the UK was in the low ten thousands. Dazn does not disclose viewing figures but its latest accounts say it has a global reach of 60 million premium users and 300 million monthly users.Manchester City and Chelsea will represent the Premier League at the tournament, where the winners will receive prize money of up to £97m for seven matches. Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami are among other participants.The BBC declined to enter negotiations and talks withITVhave not progressed beyond an exploratory conversation last month. The subscription channels Sky Sports and TNT Sports, rivals to Dazn, have shown no interest.The BBC is understood to have dismissed the proposal out of hand owing to the difficulty of promoting a commercial channel given its public service remit. As previously reported by theDaily Telegraph, ITV submitted a proposal to Fifa to carry Club World Cup games without paying a rights fee before the Dazn deal was agreed.BBC and ITV will share coverage of the Women’s European Championship for the first time as England’s Lionesses defend their title in Switzerland. The Club World Cup begins two days before the Euros quarter-finals get under way.Dazn is understood to be seeking a sublicensing arrangement in which a free-to-air broadcaster will take all 63 matches, to secure maximum exposure for its brand. Channel 4 broadcast 20 England’s men’s games live in 2023 and 2024 and has secondary rights for some Women’s FA Cup matches, and Channel 5 previously showed EFL highlights.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dazn is planning to send a production team and presenters to the US for the most high-profile football event it has covered. The London-based platform, owned by the billionaire Len Blavatnik, is better known in the UK for its coverage of world title boxing in Saudi Arabia, but has the rights for the Premier League, La Liga, NFL and NBA in other European countries.Dazn’s links to Saudi Arabia appear to be underpinning the financing of the Club World Cup, with the kingdom’s Surj Sports Investment group last month confirming it had taken minority stake in the company valued $1bn. Fifa subsequently announced the prize and appearance fundwould also be $1bn, with City and Chelsea receiving £29.6m for taking part.Explore more on these topicsClub World CupFifaBBCITVnewsShareReuse this content"

T-shirts, ice-creams, arm-crispingly warm. At Chelmsford, where nearly 2,500 came through the turnstiles, feet in the queue before half past nine, the champions were in town.ButSurrey, seeking their fourth title on the bounce, didn’t have things their way againstEssex. They lost the toss on a flat pitch, and first Paul Walter, then Jordan Cox, batted with a bounce and a song. Cox, who was due to make his Test debut in the winter at Christchurch only to be thwarted by a broken thumb, played with bellicose beauty. He drove Dan Lawrence into the boundary boards with a thud to reach his century, watched with purring admiration by Graham Gooch. When he was finally out for 117, including 21 fours, Chelmsford rose. As they did for Walter, the stand-in opener while Dean Elgar is on paternity leave, who fell five short of a hundred – a firstSurreywicket for Matt Fisher. The home side ended the day on 356 for four.Things weren’t going so well for England’s Zak Crawley, who lost his stumps in spectacular style to theNorthamptonshirenew boy Liam Guthrie, out for one. Tawanda Muyeye’s 72 then helpedKentto a respectable 231, before Northants were fleeced to 118 for seven.At the Rose Bowl, Jonny Bairstow’s first day asYorkshirecaptain didn’t unfold entirely as planned as they were skittled for 121 byHampshire. Shadow in the corner Liam Dawson snaffled three for eight, and there was a first wicket for Sonny Baker, who had Bairstow caught flaming to third man, bothered by an insect. In reply Hampshire were 165 for five at the close of play.It was shaping up to be Ethan Bamber’s day at Edgbaston whenWarwickshire’s winter signing from Middlesex burst out of the traps with three new ball strikes. But bar a wicket on debut for the 18-year-old leg-spinner Tazeem Ali, things took a downward turn for the hosts thereafter as a succulent career-best 140 from Tom Clark, and a pugnacious 116 not out from the captain, John Simpson, bent the script the way ofSussex, who finished on 386 for five. A statement day for the Division One newcomers; a slightly concerning one for the more established hosts without the injured Oliver Hannon-Dalby and Chris Rushworth.Colin Ackermann had some birthday luck on his way to the first century of the year, bowled for 80 only for the bails to settle back in their groove.Durhamploughed on towards 400 despite four wickets forNottinghamshire’s Australian Fergus O’Neill.At Taunton, Kasey Aldridge’s five wickets ruined a goodWorcestershirestart as they lost nine for 52 and were all out for 154. Half centuries from the Toms Abell and Banton then rescuedSomersetfrom a precarious 39 for three to finish on 187 for four.The big name Division Two game at Lord’s swung merrily; Sam Robson and Max Holden easingMiddlesexto 127 for one before theLancashiredebutant Ollie Sutton (two for 57) and Tom Aspinwall (four for 32) took charge.Leicestershirebowled outGlamorganfor 229, the on loan Shoaib Bashir bowled by Rehan Ahmed for 20 whileDerbyshire’s Luis Reece grabbed six for 52 againstGloucestershirebefore Caleb Jewell’s 61 from 48 balls showed why he was in Mickey Arthur’s little black book.Share"

Nothing about this is easy to write, but as football players, we all know this day eventually comes. That day is here – and you deserve to hear it from me first.“Football led me to all of you – and to this city. Chasing my dream, not knowing this period would change my life. This City. This club. These people… gave me EVERYTHING. I had no choice but to give EVERYTHING back! And guess what – we won everything.“Whether we like it or not, it’s time to say goodbye. Suri, Rome, Mason, Michele, and I are beyond grateful for what this place has meant to our family. ‘Manchester’ will forever be on our kids’ passports – and more importantly, in each of our hearts. This will always be our HOME.“We cannot thank the city, club, staff, teammates, friends, and family enough for this 10-year ride.

My body seemed to make this decision before my mind accepted it, but I now truly know this is the right thing for me at the right time.”Will a fifth year become the norm for women’s college basketball stars?Read moreThe second overall pick in 2013 by Chicago, Delle Donne spent a dozen years as one of the faces of the WNBA. She played the last six seasons of her career in Washington – she opted out of 2020 because of health concerns – and turned down a contract in February 2024 to step away from basketball.She averaged 19.5 points and 6.7 rebounds in 241 regular-season games. She also played in 40 playoffs games, where she averaged 17.9 points, 6.1 boards and 2.3 assists.“Words cannot adequately express how thankful I am to my family, all of my incredible teammates, friends, executives, sponsors, staff and most importantly the amazing fans that have accompanied me on this journey,” she wrote. “This game has been my life, and I am grateful for the memories and how much it’s given me.

After a years-long tussle over whether or not to ban the app in the country, the deadline for the company to divest or sell its assets to a non-Chinese owner is up again on 5 April.Donald Trumphas said hisadministrationis “very close” to a deal for the app.A handful of potential buyers have said they’re interested in the tremendously popular social media app and various news reports have floated other types of deals, including an investment from the Trump-friendly venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz or a bid from Amazon. The presidentsigned an executive orderin January to postpone a ban-or-divest deadline until April; earlier this week he said he would “like to see TikTok remain alive”. But the path forward for TikTok, and its 170 million US users, remains murky.After announcingsweeping tariffs on dozens of countries including China, Trump hinted on Thursday aboard Air Force One that he might lessen the trade penalties if ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, were to approve a sale.“We have a situation withTikTokwhere China will probably say we’ll approve a deal, but will you do something on the tariffs. The tariffs give us great power to negotiate,” he said.ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell the app and in court filings said that divestiture “is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally”. ByteDance and TikTok did not return requests for comment.Trump to consider final proposal on TikTok as US ban deadline loomsRead moreThe idea of banning TikTokoriginated with Trumpin 2020, who said the Chinese-owned app posed a danger to national security. It quickly became a bipartisan issue and Congress overwhelmingly voted to ban the app last year. In January, the US supreme court sided with Congress andunanimously upheld a federal lawrequiring TikTok divest or be banned. The deadline was initially set for 19 January.The night before the deadline, TikTok shuttered the app with a message that read: “Sorry, TikTok isn’t available right now.” Apple and Google also removed it from their app stores because under the federal law they would be penalized for distributing it. In its message, the social media company said: “We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!”On 20 January, Trump’s first day in office, he issued the executive order that extended the ban-or-divest deadline by 75 days. Now that cutoff date is looming.While initially proposing to ban TikTok, Trump made an about-face last year while campaigning for president, having joined the app and amassed millions of followers. In September, he posted to his Truth Social account “FOR ALL THOSE THAT WANT TO SAVE TIK TOK IN AMERICA, VOTE TRUMP!” Since then, he’s been working to make good on that pledge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those include plans from a long list of investors in the private equity, venture capital and tech industries. Among those investors are asset manager Blackstone, business software company Oracle,e-commerce giant Amazon, a crypto foundation and the founder of OnlyFans. Oracle is reportedly leading a coalition bid with several investors, including Andreessen Horowitz,according to the FT.Oracle, which was co-founded by Trump ally Larry Ellison, has been looking to buy a lucrative stake in TikTok for years. The software company already housesall of TikTok’s US user dataon its cloud infrastructure platform, a deal that came about in 2022 to address security concerns.“It is highly unlikely that TikTok will go dark again. All signs point to a deal or another extension,” said Kelsey Chickering, a principal analyst for Forrester. “If TikTok divests in the US, the real question is whether its algorithm comes with the sale. TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand – it’s simply not as powerful.”Explore more on these topicsTikTokDonald TrumpUS politicsSocial mediaShareReuse this content"

The Quarterback Next Door. Revenge of the XXL Wife. My Secret Agent Husband.These may sound like cringey fantasies, but they’re actually titles of “vertical dramas”, a new form of episodic television that is gripping millions around the world.The genre, which originated inChinaand has been called “TV for the Tiktok generation”, consists of minute-long episodes designed for smartphones. It has experienced such a boom that the market is predicted to be worth $14bn (£11bn) by 2027.“The rise means that there are a lot of audiences who haven’t been satisfied by the current supply of the media market,” Zhou Yuan, the founder of the Beijing-based vertical film production house Content Republic,told Hong Kong’s Filmartlast month.Duanjus – Chinese for micro-dramas – began their life on social media beforetransforming the national audiovisual market in China. Chinese companies are now working with foreign production companies to export the form, buoyed by a slew of new streaming apps such as ReelShort, ShortTV, DramaPops and FlexTV.Last November, the California-based, Chinese-backed ReelShort overtook TikTok as the most popular product in the entertainment section of Apple’s app store in the US – and has been downloaded more than 30m times since its launch in 2022.“Some people said: ‘I can’t believe someone would pay for this,’” Joey Jia, the head of Crazy Maple Studio, the company behind ReelShort,told the Washington Post. “Our answer is: You think you understand the entire entertainment market? You don’t.”View image in fullscreenA poster for the romantic soap If Loving You Is a Sin Then I’ll Go to Hell.Photograph: Reel ShortViewers are attracted to many of the tropes that BookTok readers recognise, such as enemies to lovers, secret billionaires and werewolves. They report becoming hooked by the clickbait titles, cliffhangers and eyebrow-raising scenes. Apps will usually offer a handful of episodes for free, before requiring a paid subscription. Much like a video game, ReelShort allows its users to purchase “coins” to access episodes.Jen Cooper, the British founder of the website VerticalDramaLove, was drawn to the format because of her love for romantic movies and comedies.“Last April, I was going through a really difficult time personally. I couldn’t relax or focus enough to watch full-length dramas any more,” the former bookseller said. “One day I was scrolling TikTok and saw an ad that made me go, ‘what?!’.”She ended up watching her first vertical drama, You Belong With Me, about a jilted woman who gets together with her ex’s uncle. “It’s full of classic tropes, but at the heart of it is a gorgeous love story with some genuinely funny moments,” she said.After that, Cooper “went down the rabbit hole”. She set up an Instagram account to write reviews and connect with those within the industry, and quickly formed a community. The interest was so huge that when she set up fan awards, she received more than 16,000 votes from around the world in just one week.Cooper learned that many others discovered verticals during difficult times in their life. “I’ve heard from fans who are bereaved, living with serious health conditions, or acting as carers. The audience is largely women, from early 20s to 60s. I’ve spoken to a student in Pakistan, a bed-bound older woman in Italy, and a single mum whose husband died from an overdose who tunes in while doing the housework.”The common appeal for all of them is escapism; a quick and guaranteed dopamine hit when life feels overwhelming. “People want to see good triumph over bad, and – let’s be honest – very attractive people falling in love.”Defne Turan, a production manager for London-based Sea Star Productions, which makes verticals, said the format was “the way of the world now”.The company had been receiving applications from film-makers and actors who wanted to be involved, she said. “It’s a new genre and I believe it should be handled with as much care as any other part of the industry. Just because it’s different and fast-paced doesn’t mean the standards are any less. We use industry-standard cameras and lots of the production crew and make-up artists have all worked on big productions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At a time when strikes and cutbacks have made work hard to come by, they provide consistent jobs. Verticals are typically filmed in seven to 10 days, with two cameras capturing scenes in a single take.View image in fullscreenTeig Sadhana, an Australian-British actor, says the format has provided him with regular work.Photograph: courtesy of Teig SadhanaTeig Sadhana, 29, an Australian-British actor based in New York, began working in verticals after graduating from the Stella Adler Studio of Acting last year.“I applied to an ad on a pretty standard acting job site,” he said. “I didn’t know what a vertical was, I just needed the pay cheque.” He had a brief call with a director, and a few days later was on location in Pennsylvania to shoot Glory of Revenge.“Since then I’ve made 10 films across all the major vertical platforms, worked with incredible professionals, and am finding some of the joys and comforts of having regular work. Not an easy thing to manage so quickly out of the conservatory.”He said he initially struggled to make sense of a format with limited room for character development, but that it helped to avoid “overcomplicating it too much”.Nic Westaway, a former star of the Australian TV soap opera Home and Away, who now appears in the hit vertical The Double Life of Mr President, told Filmart: “In Australia, I played one character for nearly four years, nearly 400 episodes; but in the last nine months I’ve got to play 14 different characters in 14 different crazy verticals.”According to Zhou, Content Republic is aiming to have 400 verticals in production each year: 200 for the Chinese market and 200 for an international audience.Whether the novelty will wear off is yet to be seen (Quibi shut down after six months), but even traditional media companies are monitoring the trend as they look to appeal to younger viewers with diminishing attention spans. In 2023, Paramount Pictures briefly released Mean Girls on TikTok in 23 snippets.“It’s a space we’re watching closely, with plenty to learn from how audiences and creators are embracing it,” Sacha Khari, Channel 4’s head of digital commissioning, said.Explore more on these topicsDramaSmartphonesTelevisionMobile phonesChinaSoap operaAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One of the show’s stars this week saidthe UK should follow Australia’s leadin banning children aged under 16 from social media platforms.The ban has been praised in the US and UK, and is described as “world-leading” by the Australian government. Time magazinethis week praisedthe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, for a “remarkable” policy that was “politically uncontroversial” on the basis that both major parties supported it.Left unsaid was all the criticism raised by mental health groups, LGBTQ+ groups and other campaigners during the rushed process to pass the bill in parliament last year. The committee reviewing the bill only reviewed the legislation fora single day, despite over 15,000 submissions being received.Author Jonathan Haidt, who reportedlylobbied politicians in Australiato push the policy before it was adopted and privately dismissed critics of his approach, told theNew York Times this weekthat “it’s going to work. It doesn’t have to be perfect at first, but within a few years it will be very good”. If it worked in Australia, it was going to go global “very quickly”, he said.But nine months out from the policy coming into effect, Australians are still in the dark about how our ban – which waspassed by the parliament in November 2024– will work. And that’s likely to remain the case up to the federal election on 3 May.A trial of age assurance technology is under way, with schoolchildren still being recruited to participate just weeks before the first report is due.Australia passes world-first law banning under-16s from social media despite safety concernsRead moreThe under-16s social media ban is due to come into effect in December, but the government faces a number of hurdles before then, including figuring out what tech to use, and whether the platforms – emboldened by the apparent backing of Donald Trump – will comply.The Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS), a UK-based company recruited by the Albanese government to conduct an assessment of the technology used to determine whether people are the age they say they are when accessing social media, is due to provide a preliminary report to the government by the end of April.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterWhile the report is said to be on track to be delivered this month, Guardian Australia has confirmed this preliminary report will not be released publicly by the company. A spokesperson for the communications department said the report was never intended for public release and is designed “to afford procedural fairness to trial participants” on any changes that need to be made.The final report is due just two months after the preliminary report in June, before the communications minister – whoever it will be after the federal election – will get to decide which platforms it applies to, and what technology is appropriate.ACCS has begun recruitment of school-age children to test out the various technologies, but there is an education and consent process still under way.From there, schoolchildren will test out age estimation (where tech estimates how old a user is), assurance (where a parent or guardian confirms an age) and verification (using some sort of identity document verification) technologies.The children will act as “mystery shoppers” and attempt to access a purpose-built online platform through the various age assurance methods, documents released by ACCS state.This process leaves just weeks to get the trials conducted, analysed, and a final report prepared for government.The ban is not a major focus of the federal election campaign – it had bipartisan support, after the Coalition pushed for it for months until the Labor government relented.However, there are still major concerns over how the ban will work, and who is included.TikTokand Meta, for example, are angry over the carve out YouTube received. The government’s messaging on why this exemption was allowed has been mixed.The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said last year that YouTube would be included in a range of services exempt from the ban on health and education grounds. But in the draft wording of the document that sets out what services are exempt, YouTube is granted an exemption on its own, while health and education services are another carve out.In response to questions in Senate estimates from the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young last month, the department said the exclusion was “consistent with broad community sentiment, which highlights the value of YouTube as a tool for education and learning”.Evidence shows most children under 13 accessing social media are accessing YouTube.A report from the eSafety commissioner last month stated more than 80% of children aged between eight and 12 are accessing social media, despite the current minimum age requirement being 13.However, this figure was largely skewed by children accessing YouTube, either by watching while logged out, or using a parent or carer’s account. When YouTube is excluded, the figure is closer to 44%.TikTok and Snapchat are second and third behind YouTube (68%) on 31% and 19%, respectively.Social media firms criticise ‘irrational’ exemption of YouTube from Australia’s under-16s banRead moreIt is also worth noting that the stakeholder advisory board overseeing the trial has some members who have long called for bans or restrictions on online pornography, and have called for online censorship. But missing from the board are digital rights and privacy groups.Those organisations have subsequently been invited to apply to join the stakeholder advisory board, after inquiries from Guardian Australia, but as of yet do not appear to be included.Whether all this results in a report that the government can rely upon and implement before the end of this year remains to be seen, as does whether the social media companies will be willing players.The inconsistent treatment of some platforms over others might lead to companies such asMeta– which has already approached the Trump administration over their treatment by the Australian government – to seek the US government to push back on the ban before it comes into effect.But this week, Albanese, and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said the ban was not up for negotiation.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyAustralian politicsSocial mediaMetaTikTokanalysisShareReuse this content"

Already this year we have seen the arrival of the seventh mainlineCivilizationgame, the 14th entry in theAssassin’s Creedfranchise, and, most brain-melting of all, the 27thMonster Huntertitle. But look: here’s a magical-realist tale set in a moody, hurricane-ravaged imagining of the American deep south, whose title, crucially, bears no numerical suffix.South of Midnight makes a brilliantly atmospheric first impression. Winds bludgeon flimsy abodes; rain lashes down on tin roofs; the world is rendered with the macabre and crooked details of a Tim Burton film. Within minutes, a house – that of high-school athlete Hazel and her mother, a social worker – is carried away along a roiling flooded river. Playing as Hazel, you give chase, bounding with a lanky teenage gait across various platforms until the storm abates. In its wake lie miles of stagnant, fetid swamps. At one grisly point, you explore a farm stacked with the carcasses of pigs who did not survive the typhoon.As a protagonist, Hazel more than holds her own against this vivid and unusual (for video games, at least) world. With mere flicks of her wrists, connected to which are metaphysical scythe-like blades, Hazel rips through reality itself. For this spunky, determined young woman is a Weaver, adept at magically dispelling unsavoury spirits lurking amid the weeping willows and glinting glass bottle trees of her southern home. As a Weaver, she is able to see an enormous cosmic grand tapestry where myth, reality, time and space collide; peering into the past, she learns of ancestors who helped free slaves and of tragic child deaths.View image in fullscreenVivid and unusual … South of Midnight.Photograph: Xbox Game StudiosSprinting with energy, South of Midnight lays out its imaginative stall: action-packed chapters whisk the player from sweltering bayous to chilly mountains that feel as if they are edging towards Appalachia. The atmosphere is thick – at times, laying it on a little too thick: your friendly guide to this folkloric romp is a gigantic catfish who speaks with a distinct Creole drawl about, among other things, the classic southern dish grits.But in the actual playing, South of Midnight is simply thin. With its mostly linear mix of 3D platforming and melee combat, the game evokes PlayStation 2-era titles. Yet neither element has much personality. The brawling looks stylish, ending with brutal finishing moves in which Hazel unravels her wraith-like enemies’ very fabric of being. Really, it lacks the depth and expressive possibilities of titles such as God of War. Platforming feels floaty until you are vaulting from one conspicuously painted white ledge to another: then it just feels prescriptive and clunky.What great lengths the team of visual artists, sound designers, and scriptwriters at Microsoft-owned studio, CompulsionGames, went to in creating this rugged, earthy place, only to have it undone by gameplay of often mind-numbing smoothness. At various points, you must flee from a nebulous, mist-like entity. But these sequences are so straightforward as to lack any dramatic tension. They repeat many times throughout the game’s approximately 12-hour duration, only increasing a little in difficulty each time.Other loops grate as the hours stack up: clear this area of oozing corrupted matter (a visual manifestation of the land’s pain and trauma); watch another lightly animated flashback. This lovingly illustrated depiction of the south is rich and arresting yet the game is rote.What you’re left with is a game whose best ideas are all optics. The fairytale southern style plays out like a modern, YA take on Toni Morrison’s fiction while summoning some of the whimsical, damaged beauty of 2012’s Beasts of the Southern Wild. The soundtrack is a rambunctious collage of howling blues, twanging folk and lilting jazz. Compulsion Games bottled much southern magic during the making of this seemingly risky gambit for Microsoft, yet failed to take risks where it really mattered: this unique setting deserved more.South of Midnight is released 8 April, £39.99 or GamePass subscriptionExplore more on these topicsGamesXbox series S/XreviewsShareReuse this content"

Nintendo is banking on the answer being: go bigger. Double the number of racers to 24. Increase the number of characters (60 in total). More weapons. And, most eye-catchingly, more exploration.That’s not a term you’d associate with the closed circuit, three-lap formula that the series has perfected over the last three decades, but in Mario Kart World, the flagship launch title for the forthcoming Switch 2,Nintendois tearing down the tyre barriers and offering players a Forza Horizon style open world. It’s not exactly a total reinvention of the wheel, but it’s as big a change to the format as any since the series began. Given physical copies of Mario Kart World will retail at £75 though, is it enough?I got a chance to spend time playing the new game and my immediate impression was that it’s what you’d expect from a next-gen Mario Kart title. It’s familiar, incredibly polished, plays flawlessly no matter what carnage ensues and it looks awesome. As I hurtled through the courses, the temptation was to slow down and take in all the small, quirky details.View image in fullscreenInternet-famous … the Moo Moo Meadows cow.Photograph: NintendoPresumably there will be an opportunity to do just that in the free roaming element of the game. I didn’t get much of a chance to explore this – it was essentially the lobby while we waited for 24 players to join. What I did get to experience were two modes. The first was Grand Prix. This is your traditional Mario Kart affair: start, three laps, finish. The slight tweak here is that rather than having closed circuit courses, these are sprints across the world map: you’ll be in Boo’s cinema one moment, a prehistoric jungle the next. I opted to play as the cow from Moo Moo Meadows, the internet-famous breakout star of the recent Nintendo Direct, driving a tractor called Big Horn.As a seasoned Mario Kart player (to put it mildly), I found that it plays exactly as you’d expect. Muscle memory takes over: you skid (though it’s less agile than in MK8D, presumably to account for wider tracks); you throw shells at opponents; you scream in frustration when you get struck by lightning just as you were about to use a boost. The level design is beautiful and each track seems packed with alternate routes and little secrets. I can’t escape the feeling that the wider roads may mean the game loses some of its claustrophobic carnage, and that the emphasis will be on weapons rather than driving skill in this iteration of the series, but I can live with that. Regardless, I win my first race – I want that on record – and a glorious crown is bestowed upon my cow.In my time with the game, I also had one race in Knockout Tour mode, Nintendo’s battle-royale-style take on the series. As you progress along the course you’ll encounter checkpoints on the horizon; when you cross these, the bottom four racers are blocked from continuing and drop out. This continues until the final stretch of track where the remaining four race to the podium. Not realising I would be racing 23 other journalists in the room with me, I opted for the comedy choice of racing as Wiggler in a pink cruiser, which, from a kart configuration standpoint, is a terrible choice. Had I realised the stakes I would have gone Wario/monster bike, but it’s my own fault for assuming it was a race that didn’t matter. They all matter.Knockout Tour mode is exhilarating. If, like me, you believe you’ve achieved God-like status at MK8D and can run through each course in your sleep, if you’re used to cruising in first place without so much as a single banana to your name, then prepare yourself. In knockout mode you can drop from first to 24th in an instant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Weapons feel more significant (I lost count of how many golden mushrooms, bullet bills and star powers I went through), skidding and handling less so, given the greater width of each track. Amid all the frenzied chaos, I had no idea how long the race lasted – I think somewhere between three minutes and three hours. Seeing the checkpoints and knowing I was only one horribly timed red shell away from dropping out prompted heart palpitations; clearing the checkpoints brought relief. It was a rush. I finished fifth, failing to qualify for the final section. This mark of shame aside, my initial impressions of knockout mode are that it’s an exciting reinvention of the format and there is a strong chance it’s about to become my entire personality.Explore more on these topicsNintendo SwitchSuper MarioNintendoGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The genetic testing companyfiled for bankruptcylate last month and the California attorney general and others have recommended that users delete their data lest it be acquired by less scrupulous companies as the company is stripped for parts during bankruptcy proceedings.I was one of the company’s earliest customers and had used their service to genotype not just myself but my entire extended family. I even got my kids’ babysitter a kit.Most of what the company told me I already knew and was of little consequence: I like the taste of cilantro, and my wife doesn’t. I’m a morning person, and she’s a night owl. Mosquitoes prefer her blood to mine. But it also told me things that I didn’t know: that my two oldest children were only 44% “related” (eg below the average of 50%) – which explained a lot! That my father’s mother may be of Native American ancestry, keeping family lore alive. And, most shockingly, that my ex-father-in-law was half Ashkenazi Jewish; who he thought his father was turned out to be wrong.But the most important use of the data goes beyond discovering long-lost family members or confirming traits we already knew we had. By clicking on “download raw data” before deleting my account, I was able to obtain the string of Cs, As, Ts and Gs that make up a million or more locations on my genome. I can then upload this text file to an independent server to calculate polygenic indexes for myriad traits: everything from my risks for coronary artery disease, dementia or ADHD to my weight, educational attainment or (lack of) musical ability.I think of these scores as the Fico credit scores of human biologyI think of these scores as the Fico credit scores of human biology. They predict (very noisily) how you, your child or even your embryo will fare in the world. Some, like the index for height, do a good job. Others – say, the index for extraversion – aren’t much better than a series of coin flips. Education, the index I have studied the most in my research, falls in the middle.This data is useful and getting more so each year as it is refined by scientists. These scores – or the data on which they are based – are not the type of information you want to fall into the hands of corporate actors that have only their bottom lines at heart. The unwinding of 23andMe, then, provides a window of opportunity to rethink our policies on these new tools.The 2008 Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (Gina) bans the use of genetic data by health insurance companies and employers. It was enacted back when human genetics was mostly thought about within the “OGOD” paradigm: one gene, one disease. You were going to get Huntington’s disease or you weren’t. But the following year, the first genome-wide polygenic index was calculated – for schizophrenia – and shifted how we think about genetic prediction. Now, even if I don’t have a rare mutation, my data can predict much about me that would be useful to for-profit companies.Moreover, the law says nothing about life insurance companies, long-term care insurance or car insurance. It does not address schools, who could potentially use the data in admissions or placement decisions. And the law is mum on whether and how polygenic indexes might be deployed in sperm or ova banks and fertility clinics.The public policy solution to this brave new world of genetic prediction might seem simple (and pressing in the light of 23andMe’s collapse): amend the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act to cover all these other use scenarios. But that option, as tempting as it may seem, creates its own problems. Just because 23andMe couldn’t make its business model work doesn’t mean that the era of direct-to-consumer genetic testing is over. More and more Americans are spitting into a cup to get results from Ancestry or FamilyTreeDNA or another service. When they figure out how to download their raw data and calculate their own polygenic scores, they can act on that information.My own public opinion research shows that Americans don’t like when other people use their genetic data to pass judgment on them – by, say, adjusting their premiums for car insurance based on their risk-taking index. But they themselves want to use this information to improve their lives.That gets complicated, though. A study from 2009 found that people who discovered they had a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer’s were more likely to say they’d buy this kind of insurance.Seems rational, right? It is – but when the people most likely to use insurance are the ones rushing to buy it, the whole system goes sideways. Premiums spike, healthier people bail and what’s left is a high-risk pool that just gets riskier – and more expensive – until the market basically eats itself. Economists have a name for this. It’s called a death spiral.So, what do we do? We can’t exactly ban people from accessing their own genetic information. That genie is out of the bottle. And telling insurers they can’t look at it either might seem fair, but it doesn’t really fix the problem. A better approach – especially when it comes to long-term care – is to borrow a page from car insurance: require everyone to participate. But added to that, we would have to ban premium adjusting based on genetic risk – ie extend Gina.The bigger picture here is that we’re moving toward a society where genetic information is just part of everyday life – a geno-society, you might say. And if we’re going to live in a world where people know their risks before the symptoms even show up, we need insurance systems and regulations that are ready for that reality. Because if we wait too long, we may not have a market left to reform. It might not just be 23andMe filing for bankruptcy.We can’t pretend it’s 2003, before the Human Genome Project had finished its work. If we decide that individuals should enjoy a right to their genetic information – as many people want, to empower fertility decisions and so on – then we might use the demise of 23andMe to rethink how this data is collected and maintained. Might we want, for example, to mail out home-testing kits the way we did for Covid, so that everyone can get their genetic data for free? Might we want to create a public, protected database that can’t be sold to private equity and is only accessible to the users themselves and people they designate (such as their doctors or, possibly, researchers)?I realize that in the short term, new investments in science are going to be hard to come by. And trust in government is near an all-time low. But we can at least start the discussion now of how we want to navigate this new world of genetic prediction.Dalton Conley is Henry Putnam university professor of sociology at Princeton University and author of The Social Genome: The New Science of Nature and NurtureExplore more on these topicsGeneticsOpinionInsurance industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Once you’ve grabbed your slice of league-wide media rights, made a vaguely colonial-sounding pre-season tour of the “Far East,” stitched up some sponsorship deals with a gambling company or a country’s tourism agency, and shipped as many shirts as the global merch market can handle, you hit the ceiling of your earning capacity. At that point, as a club, what do you do?You canraise ticket prices, which risks alienating fans and the local community you’re supposed to represent. You can try your hand at a fewmiserable little crypto or AI plug-insto build “engagement” among supporters or become a pioneer in the nascent field of fan “activations,” with limited potential returns. You canpromise to build a new 100,000-seat stadium, but that takes time and money and doesn’t solve your immediate (or even future, should you go into debt to finance the project) need for cash. You canflog off a hotel or twoto a sibling subsidiary of your parent company, though for that you need to start off with a couple of hotels. You can hope to sell to a monied investor, but the days of loss-indifferent billionaires making vanity investments in clubs seem over, and there are only so many publicity-hungry sovereign wealth funds to go around.Are some clubs cursed? The narrative can be as powerful as the truthRead moreEventually, a much cleaner, easier option presents itself: instead of building revenue, you can cut costs.The same spirit of austerity that is now rising with particular viciousness in the US under the Trump administration is beginning to sweep through European soccer. Elon Muskwith his chainsawand Sir Jim Ratclifferestricting lunchesat the Manchester United staff canteen are dual embodiments of a process, introduced under the guise of sustainability, likely to hurt and demoralize rather than improve and elevate.After years in which runaway inflation in player salaries and a near-total absence of financial regulation saw big clubs across Europe rack up unsustainable expenses and debts, a new era of fiscal rectitude is upon us. Planning, control, precision, and discipline are the path to on-field success now, and increasingly clubs seem eager to project the same values off the pitch as well. But if austerity on the pitch achieves a kind of stark, hairless, Guardiola-esque perfection, off the pitch it seems more likely to promote an emerging feudalism. It deepens inequalities between the corporate suite and the concourse, between football’s royals and its commoners.With 39% of the in-house staff laid off over the past 12 months in the service of a “transformation plan” to return Manchester United to profitability, Ratcliffe’s club – or rather, the club in which he remains a minority owner, a point that’s critical to any consideration of where the real economic malaise in this particular instance lies – is the poster child for this new spirit of austerity.Manchester United has long fancied itself the world’s most consequential football club, a self-image that on-field results over the past decade have failed to validate. In the new order of punitive penny-pinching, though, the club’s status as a market leader is comfortably earned.Other leading clubs across Europe have instituted miserly cuts in recent times: Chelseachoppedthe away fan coach subsidy a few years ago, snatching £10 from each traveling supporter at a time when the club was busy splashing almost £1bn on player signings. Amid Ligue 1’songoing broadcast crisis, Lyon isstudyinga plan to cut up to 90 staff members. With teams across France’s top two divisions reportedly facing combined losses of €1.2 billion, the fiscal savagery of deep cost cuts may not even be enough to save some of them. In Spain, which has a longer history of stringent financial regulation than England, the crisis is less acute and big teams like Barcelona have not yet resorted to mass layoffs, but the infamous “levers” the club is pulling to generate short-term revenue will inevitably hit its long-term balance sheet and staff redundancies may soon become necessary.Austerity is the poltergeist now lurking permanently in the background of modern football. On its own, of course, there’s nothing wrong with controlling costs: all clubs have to live within their means. But there are always choices involved in cutting spending, and in the new spirit of austerity it’s often the most vulnerable within a club – the cooks, the cleaners, the ticket sellers – who feel the axe first.At Manchester United, for instance, it’s notable that “superfluous” back office jobs have been eliminated while the real cause of the club’s dire financial straits remains undisturbed: the interest on bank loans incurred as part of the Glazer family’s leveraged buyout and exorbitant spending on player and executive recruitment. The club paid£36m servicing its debt last season, and cumulative interest payments on the debt generated to fund the Glazers’ 2005 acquisitionrecently hit $1bn.Ratcliffe hastriedto turn the £175,000 a year the club was supposedly paying its (still unidentified) in-house “body language consultant” into the scandal of the century even as the club, under his own watch, has shelled out £4.1m to get rid of sporting director Dan Ashworth and £10.6m to cut Erik Ten Hag loose. The club’s continuing servitude to the Glazers, who retain majority control, remains an immovable burden on the fiscal outlook. None of this matters, apparently, when there are rank-and-file staff members to fire and free lunches to cut.However selective the penny pinching may be, this new austerity is not purely about job cuts. It’s about socializing economic pain; making the matchday experience less accessible for ordinary working people is part of this process. This is by no means a new phenomenon; the saga over ticket hikes has been ongoing for years. But there’s every sign this grimy trade of profit for risk will intensify in coming years as owners begin to realize that running clubs at a profit is a fiendishly difficult task.Many of the measures taken at Manchester United and elsewhere may look like regular corporate downsizing. They are that, of course, but I believe there’s something additional at work here, that the socialization of economic pain has an explicitly ideological dimension that’s similar to the way that governments have pursued austerity as a form of economic “common sense” since the 1980s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAs political economists likeMark BlythandMartijn Koningshave shown, there’s a formula to the imposition of austerity at a national level that will sound familiar to anyone paying attention to recent financial maneuvering across European soccer. The disciplining authority – usually an incoming government, but sometimes an institution like a central bank or the IMF – must claim they inherited a calamity, that the situation is so dire that exceptional measures are necessary. The legitimacy of austerity is grounded in the argument that present restraint is the precondition for a glorious future of growth, investment, and generosity, enclosing society in what globalization’s water carrier-in-chief, Thomas Friedman, once called a “golden straitjacket.” While the needs of “ordinary people” are met with skepticism and subjected to the tightest cost-benefit analysis, even the most hallucinatory projections of financiers and tech titans are credulously taken as gospel.It’s notable how neatly this template maps on to the approach that Ratcliffe has taken at Manchester United, where the fiscal emergency is so acute, he has claimed, that the club would have run out of money by Christmas without the cuts he’s implemented, and where the pain of the present is sweetened by thefantasy– unfinanced and so far in the distance it’s exempt from the details of ordinary planning – of a throbbing, starchitect-designed “mini-city” that will rank as the “largest public space in the world” (is this good?), expand the club’s match-day capacity to 100,000, and bring laughter, joy and (no doubt) overpriced tacos to the long-suffering denizens of Manchester’s redder half. For those who are prepared to weather the economic storm, Ratcliffe is promising, sunnier days are ahead.But what if they’re not? The modern fantasy of austerity was born in the 1990s, when the end of the Cold War fed triumphalist narratives about the invincibility of market liberalism, and Third Way Democrat Bill Clinton’s fiscal cuts preceded a spurt in US growth and investment. Ratcliffe is a product of this era – he founded petrochemicals giant Ineos in 1998 – and incarnates its fossilized wisdom. Understanding the future trajectory of Ratcliffe’s Restructuring United is not an exercise in pure speculation, because he’s already tried to implement 1990s thinking in other parts of his business empire.Ineos acquired the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland in 2005 and almost immediately began cutting costs: retirement benefits were the first big target for savings, and eventually, after years of grinding workplace conflict, Ratcliffe secured ahumiliating victoryover the unions and workers agreed to freeze pay and strike action. When the refinery received its first shipment of US shale gas in 2016, Ineos’s in-house magazine InchhailedGrangemouth’s “renaissance”, projecting the plant would soon be making a yearly profit of £100m; Ratcliffe claimed the move “guarantees the security of thousands of jobs in Scotland”. Late last year Ineosannouncedit was shutting down the refinery owing to soft demand and soaring costs; more than 400 jobs will likely be lost when the plant ceases operation this summer. For most workers at Grangemouth, the 20-year austerity-borne promise of a beautiful future has ended up delivering nothing more than joblessness for many. For Ratcliffe and the plant’s owners, however, it’s been a rather more remunerative affair: recent reportssuggestthat the Ineos-backed joint venture that owns Grangemouth could earn around £6m from the sale of thousands of free pollution permits once the refinery closes this summer.Since the turn of the century austerity has been an economic and political disaster, leading to the decades of stagnation in growth and incomes across the developed world that are in part responsible for the rise of the far right – the very political forces now looking, in the US at least, to drive society even further into the ground with more austerity. The limp decline of the Grangemouth plant shows how suicidal austerity thinking at a smaller scale can be, and despite all his promises of a proud and gleamingly erect, tent-covered future, there’s good reason to suspect that Ratcliffe could lead Manchester United down a similar path (unless, that is, people become too mean to him online, at which point hemight walk away from the club).The vampiric snips that Ratcliffe has implemented make Manchester United look like a small club that’s getting smaller – and perhaps that’s the point. Eventually, in nominally seeking to heal the patient, the doctor can cut so hard that the patient bleeds to death. In the end, it might not be sustainability rules, underwhelming media rights deals, or football’s natural earnings ceiling that push Europe’s top clubs to the financial brink, but the business world’s old-fashioned zeal for economic punishment.Explore more on these topicsFootballBusiness of soccerManchester UnitedcommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s why his team is using SignalKevin CarrollUsing the platform was dangerous and wrong – but officials appeared to prioritize shielding themselves from litigationFri 4 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 10.02 EDTShareNo senior US government official in the now-infamous “Houthi PC Small Group” Signal chat seemed new to that kind of group, nor surprised by the sensitivity of the subject discussed in that insecure forum, not even when the defense secretary,Pete Hegseth, chimed in with details of a coming airstrike. No one objected – not the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who was abroad and using her personal cellphone to discuss pending military operations; not even the presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, who wasin Moscowat the time. Yet most of these officials enjoy the luxury of access to secure government communications systems 24/7/365.Reasonable conclusions may be drawn from these facts. First, Trump’s national security cabinetcommonly discusses secret informationon insecure personal devices. Second, sophisticated adversaries such as Russia and China intercept such communications, especially those sent or received in their countries. Third, as a result, hostile intelligence services now probably possess blackmail material regarding these officials’ indiscreet past conversations on similar topics. Fourth, as a first-termTrump administrationofficial and ex-CIA officer, I believe the reason these officials risk interacting in this way is to prevent their communications from being preserved as required by the Presidential Records Act, and avoid them being discoverable in litigation, or subject to a subpoena or Freedom of Information Act request. And fifth, no one seems to have feared being investigated by the justice department for what appears to be a violation of the Espionage Act’s Section 793(f), which makes gross negligence in mishandling classified information a felony; the FBI director, Kash Patel, and attorney general, Pam Bondi, quickly confirmed that hunch. Remarkably, the CIA director John Ratcliffe wouldn’t even admit to Congress that he and his colleagues had made a mistake.The Trump team group chat news is obscuring an essential question | Mohamad BazziRead moreThe knock-on effects of this are many. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, needs to address his colleagues’ characterization of European partners as “pathetic” with foreign ministers now dubious of the US’s intentions. Allies already hesitant to share their countries’ secrets with the US, because of valid counterintelligence concerns regarding Trump’s affinity forVladimir Putin, will clam up even more rather than risk their sources being compromised by Trump’s appointees. Gabbard and Ratcliffe may have perjured themselves before Congress regarding whether their Signal chat included classified national defense information; certainly, their credibility on Capitol Hill is shredded. As a former CIA case officer, I suspect these directors’ own subordinates will prefer not to share restricted handling information with them going forward. Hegseth, confirmed as secretary by a vote of 51-50 despite concerns over his character and sobriety, lost any moral authority to lead the defense department by reflexively lying about his misconduct, claiming that the story by Jeffrey Goldberg, the unsuspecting Atlantic editor improvidently included in the text chain, is somehow a “hoax” despite the fact the White House contemporaneously confirmed its authenticity.Trump dismisses this scandal, nowunder investigationby the Pentagon’s inspector general, as a witch-hunt, and his followers will fall in line. But every senator who voted to confirm these national security officials, despite doubts regarding their temperaments and qualifications, quietly knows that they own part of this debacle. For fear of facing Republican primary challengers funded by Elon Musk, these senators failed in their solemn constitutional duty to independently provide wise advice and consent regarding nominations to the US’s most important war cabinet posts. How would the senators have explained their misfeasance to service members’ bereaved families – their constituents, perhaps – had the Houthis used information from the Signal chat, such as the time a particular target was to be engaged, to reorient their antiaircraft systems to intercept the inbound aircraft?I happen to have served inYemenas a sensitive activities officer for special operations command (central). Conspicuous in their absence from the Signal chat were uniformed officers responsible for the recent combat mission: the acting chair of the joint chiefs of staff Adm Christopher Grady, central command’s Gen Michael Kurilla and special operations command’s Gen Bryan Fenton. These good men would have raised the obvious objection: loose talk on insecure phones about a coming operation jeopardizes the lives of US sailors and marines standing watch on warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, naval aviators flying over the beach towards the target, and likely special operators, intelligence officers and human sources working in the shadows on the ground.The Signal chat exposes the administration’s incompetence – and its pecking order | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreYou don’t need 30-plus years in uniform to know that holding a detailed yet insecure discussion about a pending military mission is wrong; the participants in the chat knew, too. They just didn’t care, not as much as they cared about keeping their communications from being legally discoverable. They’re safe in the knowledge that in a new era without benefit of the rule of law, Patel’s FBI and Bondi’s justice department will never bring charges against them, for a crime which uniformed service members are routinely prosecuted for vastly smaller infractions. As the attorney general made plain in her remarks about this matter, federal law enforcement is now entirely subservient to Trump’s personal and political interests.Most senior US government officials in 2025 are, unfortunately, far gone from the fine old gentleman’s tradition of honorable resignation. But participants in the Signal chat should consider the Hollywood producer character Jack Woltz’s pained observation to the mafia lawyer Tom Hagen in The Godfatherabout his indiscreetly wayward mistress: “A man in my position cannot afford to be made to look ridiculous.” Trump, the justice department and the Republican Congress may not make them resign, but to the US’s allies and adversaries, and to their own subordinates, these officials now look ridiculous.Kevin Carroll served as senior counselor to the former homeland security secretary John Kelly and as a CIA and army officerExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionSignal group chat leakTrump administrationUS militaryUS foreign policyVladimir PutinDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

I’m afraid the answer is bothMarina HydeAmid claims that a chatbot helped shape the key calculations, the president is now off playing golf. He’ll find the world economy in a bunkerFri 4 Apr 2025 08.01 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 12.01 EDTShareThere’s a scene in the very first episode of Yellowstone where the casino-owning Native American chiefexplains the basic financial logicof all casinos to an uncomfortable politician: “The gamblers’ money is like a river – flowing one way. Our way.” Oh no, hang on, wait … Not all casinos. In fact, it could be that when all is said and done, the historians looking for that one key fact to illustrate the eventual legacy of Donald Trump will not go with his two stunning presidential election wins. Instead, they’ll point out that in the 90s, he literally managed to bankrupt casinos. To repeat: this is a man who somehow contrived tobankrupt multiple casinos. Is he the guy to reshape the entire global economic order of the past century? Let’s find out! Either way, only 45 months of his presidency left to go.Anyway: tariffs. Rather than using actual tariff data, the United States of America this week appeared to have genuinely used a basic ChatGPT-style model tocalculate the tariffsit would immediately impose on friends/foes/arctic wildlife. This was called either “liberation day”, or the “declaration of economic independence” (sadly not abbreviated – yet – to DEI).It was hosted in the White House Rose Garden by ancient gameshow MC Donald Trump, who was accidentally wearing his indoors makeup outdoors. Like many, I’ve tried to mentally detach from the fact that we live in a time when the US defence secretary has a neck tattoo or whatever, but it makes me feel at least partially alive that the presidential paint job still occasionally retains the power to horrify. Trump leered his way through his tariff presentation while appearing to have been made up by the technique that provided the climax to Joe Wilkinson’s RNLI speech on Last One Laughing (If you saw it, you know). It’s not so much foundation any more as cosmetic bukkake.Forgive me, back to the economics. We know that Trump has always been obsessed with starkly simple numbers. Network TV ratings. The overall trade balance in goods (not services). And – before this week – the stock market. But now, like Bruno, wedon’t talk about the stock market, no no no … Certainly not since itdropped 1,679 pointsin one day alone (the day after Trump announced the tariffs). Although please enjoy the purehilarious happenstance of schedulingwhich meant that that day’s opening bell to signal the start of trading on Wall Street had been rung by the staff of wingnut media outlet Newsmax and Rudy Giuliani. Ding, dong – now just watch those stocks crap the bed. Seriously, Rudy – everything you touch! Then again we do have to remember that it was Trump himself who last year declared that “stock markets are crashing, jobs numbers are terrible, we are heading to World War III and we have two of the most incompetent ‘leaders’ in history. This is not good!!!”Is he still marking presidencies on the same metrics? Alas, reporters are going to need to shout that inquiry over the fairways, as Trump has now repaired to one of his Floridian golf courses to host the first domestic event of 2025 on the Saudi-owned LIV Golf tour. It’s called class: look it up. And no doubt it’ll be fun discussing falling oil prices with whoever is over from Riyadh for the event.Trump did offer one last comment on the tariffs before donning his big-boy golf pants. “The operation is over,” he said. “The patient lived, and is healing. The prognosis is that the patient will be far stronger, bigger, better and more resilient than ever before.” A speech I am positive I have heard delivered word-for-word on The Simpsons by ultra-shady physician Dr Nick. Meanwhile, in the back of shot, a Frankenfigure with a fish’s head grafted to a man’s body sits bolt upright, convulses wildly and dies within three foot of the operating table. Listen, you can’t save ‘em all.Incidentally, Trump is not the only one reaching for medical metaphors. Take the chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, who this morning observed mildly: “We often hear that when the US sneezes the global economy catches cold. This is not the US sneezing. This is the US cutting off its own arm. The self-inflicted economic cost naturally weakens the dollar.” Mm. One indication that an economic plan is going badly is that there’s no one responding to the above by going “ooh, but is cutting off your arm even a bad thing?”. Different circumstances, of course, but there was a similar mood in the air in the UK after Liz Truss’s “mini-budget”.Speaking of Blighty, Keir Starmer seems to have continued his policy of not poking the bear, and indeed to pretend to really enjoy it when the bear pokes you really hard somewhere really painful. According to Trump, Starmer is “very happy” about the 10% tariff kick he just took up the UK’s backside.Still, perhaps there are already signs of slight directional pivots in the West Wing. Having watched global markets tumble while the White House absolutely insisted that the tariffs were not lazy ChatGPT-assisted gambits to provoke immediate trade negotiations, it wasn’t too long before Trump’s son Eric was venturing on to X with a take. “I wouldn’t want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with @realDonaldTrump,” gibbered Trump minor. “The first to negotiate will win – the last will absolutely lose,” he continued. “I have seen this movie my entire life …” Weird, because I don’t remember this particular scene in the aforementioned Trump casino movie – or indeed several epic flops in the franchise.Yet this was also a week where we were reminded that life is not just about the adult sons with whom we are saddled, but the adult sons we choose. Fire up the elegy muzak, then, for there is sadness in the air. Reports – hotly denied, which means nothing – suggest that Elon Musk will fairly soon beleaving his postat the “department of government efficiency” and returning to the private sector. Yeah, let that sink out. And then try to picture his Doge leaving party. “Sorry boys, tariffs mean we can only afford US beer. And, unfortunately, we eliminated spending on paper cups. On the plus side, the president’s makeup artist is just going to spray Bud Light in the general directions of your mouths, and she has a 30% accurate aim. Open wide, victors!”All of which would seem to conclude this week’s look at Trump’s river, which a) is a river of effluent and b) only flows one way. Our way. What can I tell you?

And firms are surrenderingFri 4 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 08.34 EDTShareIf you are systematically engaged in lawbreaking, lawyers can be very annoying. They sue, and their suits may lead courts to declare your actions illegal.So Donald Trump, who has launched his second term with a blizzard of blatantly illegal actions, many of which have beensuspendedby the courts, has decided to address the problem at its root. He’s targeting lawyers, punishing them for doing nothing more than filing lawsuits he opposes, or hiring lawyers he does not like. He has issued unprecedented executive orders penalizing five of the nation’s major law firms, and more are likely to come. These tactics, blatantly illegal, are designed with one goal in mind: to chill lawyers’ willingness to challenge his illegal actions. They are a fundamental attack on the foundation of the rule of law. And they are achieving their purpose, not because they are legal – they obviously are not – but because too many law firms are surrendering to Trump’s illegal demands.These measures take a page from the book of other autocrats around the world. Just last week, the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s governmentdetainedlawyers for representing people protesting the arrest of his main political rival, Istanbul’s mayor. Erdoğan’s attacks on the legal professionstretchback more than a decade. Putin’s Russia ispersecutinglawyers for the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny simply for carrying out their professional duties. And in Maduro’s Venezuela, lawyers defending political detainees are beingsubjectedto surveillance, threats, arrest and smear campaigns,increasinglyleaving the detainees without access to counsel of their choice.These tactics are designed with one goal in mind: to chill lawyers’ willingness to challenge his illegal actionsTrump’s executive orders make no attempt to hide their unconstitutional retaliatory motive. They single out individual law firms by name, complain about the firm’s cases and association with individuals Trump regards as his enemies, and impose a series of sanctions: lifting security clearances for all their lawyers, barring federal business with them, excluding them from federal buildings (which means they can’t even go to court) and requiring federal contractors to disclose whether they have used the firm. In anorder targeting WilmerHale, one of the nation’s most prestigious law firms, Trump complains that it hired Robert Mueller, the former FBI director who investigated possible Russian interference in the 2016 election.Anotherorder, directed against the law firm Jenner & Block, targets its pro bono representation of transgender individuals and immigrants. Still anotherorderpunishes the law firm Perkins Coie for, among other things, filing suits challenging voter identification laws as impermissibly barring access to the ballot. Andanexecutive memorandum, issued on 22 March, threatens to sanction lawyers and their firms – including in particular those at the immigration bar – who litigate against the federal government. The order directs the attorney general to review all lawsuits against the federal government over the past eight years and going forward, and to recommend to Trump sanctions against lawyers or firms involved in cases the attorney general deems frivolous.These orders are blatantly unconstitutional. Filing lawsuits to vindicate voting rights, LGBTQ+ equality or fair treatment of immigrants is protected by the first amendment, which guarantees the right to “petition for a redress of grievances”. And law firms also have a first amendment right to choose whom to hire as partners, regardless of what Trump thinks of their lawyering skills. The orders are classic government retaliation for the exercise of first amendment rights. WilmerHale, Jenner and Perkins Coie each immediately challenged the orders in federal court, and in each case judges have blocked the order the day the suit was filed. The government has no evencolorable defensefor what the president is doing.But, disturbingly, four other major firms – Paul Weiss, Skadden Arps, Milbank and Willkie Farr –have succumbedto Trump’s illegal demands, the latter three even before an executive order was issued against them. Shockingly, each firm has agreed to commit millions of dollars in pro bono work to causes that Trump supports, as well as accepting lawless intrusions on their hiring and employment practices. The firms could have sued, and would certainly have prevailed had they done so, for the same reasons the other three firms won. No judge would uphold such orders. But the firms chose instead to compromise, fearing that, even if they won in court, they would lose in the market, as clients who needed to do business with the federal government would abandon them for firms that had not been placed on Trump’s “enemies list”. They put their considerable take-home pay over their principles – and have been roundly and justly criticized within the legal community for having done so. This is precisely the kind of “anticipatory obedience” that the Yale historian Timothy Snyder and New York Times columnist M Gessen warn marks the beginning of autocratic takeovers.If the United States is to be governed by the rule of law, lawyers and law firms cannot bow down to such unlawful assaults on the legal profession’s independence. Their duties as officers of the court require them to stand and fight. If lawyers are afraid to challenge unlawful actions by the administration, Trump will be free to act extra-legally. It has long been a bedrock of the American system that anyone harmed by official action can challenge that action in court, even where the official is the president himself. But that depends on lawyers maintaining their independence.Trump’s first two months have seen widespread attacks on those most vulnerable – immigrants, transgender individuals and members of other minority groups. Lawyers and big corporate law firms are not exactly the vulnerable themselves. Trump is attacking them because they can defend the vulnerable, and block his illegal actions in court. His executive orders have in particular objected to the firms’ pro bono work, done without fee, for indigent clients, often seeking to hold the government accountable. One by one, Trump is picking off his potential opposition, publicly reveling in its growing acquiescence. As each law firm folds, looking only to its own bottom line, it undermines not only its own standing, but the legal profession itself.By contrast, the three law firms who have challenged Trump’s executive orders – and the lawyers who have taken on their cases – are fighting not only for their own rights, but for the rule of law. Their principled resistance is precisely what we need if the United States is to remain a constitutional democracy.David Cole is a professor at Georgetown Law and former legal director of the ACLU.

Continually nudging me off centre. Even though the world appears much as it did before my mum, Rosemary, died, everything feels slightly out of kilter. Not quite right. Not as I remembered it. Sometimes, I even have to double-check the chair is where I thought it was. The physical merges into the metaphysical. Most of the time I feel OK. Tell myself that it was the right time for her time to die and that no one can feel cheated at 101. That it is a blessing she is no longer subject to the terrors of her dementia. That she is at peace. I just get on with my work and spend time with family and friends.At other times, I feel overwhelmed with sadness. Struggling to come to terms with the finality. Unable to quite believe that the only time I will see my mum again is in my dreams. Consumed with regrets for the things I was never able to say, before and after the Alzheimer’s took hold. In the meantime, we get on with the death admin, of which there is surprisingly little. My sisters have registered her death and organised the small cremation service but there is no house to pack up and sell. We did all that years ago when she moved into the care home.Everything my mum owned was tucked away in the single room of the home where she lived. Just a few chairs and a small bookcase, some clothes and old photo albums. I felt in something of a daze as we went through my mum’s belongings. Now I regret some of the decisions I made. I found a small folder of random letters I had sent her, mostly ones I had written to her as a child. I found them too painful to re-read so I chose to throw them away. I wish I had hung on to them. As a mark of respect, both to her and to my younger self.TuesdayThere have been an increasing number of articles written warning Britons not to visit the US. I don’t feel as if I have a choice in this. My daughter lives in Minneapolis and I want to be able to visit her over the next four years. Or longer, ifDonald Trumpsomehow manages to tear up the constitution and award himself a third term. As things stand, I have no idea if I have any reason to be worried. I’m certainly not about to stop making fun of the Sun-Bed King or commenting on his influence on global politics. I can imagine border security have more important things to do than prevent a Guardian journalist going on holiday to visit his family.But maybe I’m being naive. After all, even the UK government is going out of its way not to rock the boat. Keir Starmer has been desperate not to do anything to upset The Donald, even when the US administration was about to impose tariffs. He doesn’t even fight back when JD Vance and Marco Rubio suggests the UK is stifling free speech. The irony. Rachel Reeves has gone further still. Inher spring statementlast week, she couldn’t even bring herself to mention Trump by name. In her section on “global headwinds”, she was happy to call out Vladimir Putin. But the section on tariffs was rather garbled, with no references to Trump in person; nor are any other members of the cabinet prepared to do so. Trump is He Who Must Not Be Named. For the time being, then, I will just carry on as normal. I’m due to renew my ESTA in a few months’ time so we’ll see how that goes. One step at a time.WednesdayI have a feeling thefour Beatles biopicsthat director Sam Mendes announced in Los Angeles this week may not be for me. One, maybe, out of curiosity. But four, each devoted to one member of the band, seems like overkill. It’s not as if the music is going to change much from film to film, though I guess Mendes will have prepared separate soundtracks, and the bottom line is I can’t see myself sitting through a film dedicated to Ringo.I’m just not a Beatles obsessive. I was well drilled by my eldest sister, Veronica. Back in 1964, when I was eight years old, she told me there was a choice to make. You were either a Beatles fan or a Rolling Stones fan and there was no crossing the divide. Veronica was a Stones girl through and through. She bought all their LPs and singles and was allowed out to see the band play at Longleat. My dad was a curate in nearby Westbury and the gig was a short drive away. I pleaded with my mum to be allowed to go as well, but was firmly put in my place.My first ever gig would have to wait a month or so. The Hollies were scheduled to also play Longleat and by now my mum had been ground down. I was in. Sadly, I had to make do with Heinz and the Wild Boys because the Hollies cancelled. But, from the age of eight I, too, was a Stones fan.The Beatleswere the safe choice. The Stones had an air of danger. I lived out a parallel life to my middle-class childhood through Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. It never occurred to me they would be still going 60 years later and that the Stones and the Beatles would both become about as establishment as you can get.View image in fullscreen‘Is this the Camberwell carrot?’Photograph: Aaron Chown/ReutersThursdayOne of the less-reported knock-on effects of Labour’s landslide victory last July has been on select committees. In theory, these are where ministers and officials are held to account. Far more so than in parliament, where questions are so easily left unanswered. When I first started political sketch writing, there were three standout committees. There was the home affairs committee, where Theresa May was time and again put under scrutiny as home secretary, and the public accounts committee. Heaven forbid anyone tried to pull the wool over the eyes of its chair, Margaret Hodge. But best of all was the Treasury committee under the forensic Andrew Tyrie, aided and abetted by his attack dogs,Rachel Reevesand Wes Streeting. It was always box office, no more so than when Dominic Cummings was completely exposed as a fraud. Chancellors used to be genuinely anxious before an appearance, unsure if their budgets were about to unravel in real time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because Labour have such a massive majority, they get to take the lion’s share of the places on every committee. And, inevitably, many of the committee members are also new MPs. Men and women who don’t quite know yet how the system works; who are reluctant to properly interrogate senior ministers from their own party.A case in point was the chancellor’s appearance before the Treasury committee to answer questions on her spring statement this week. The last person Reeves would have wanted to face was her former self, because then she would have been forced to defend her benefits cuts and say what she would do if her fiscal headroom again went awol. But Reeves had no such worries. All the Labour MPs asked tame question – “Have you thought about this?” “Yes, I have” – and the two Tories were more spaniel than rottweiler. Rachel went into the hearing with a smile on her face. She came out laughing. You couldn’t blame her.FridayNext Tuesday is my mum’s cremation. It will be a small affair with just my sisters and me, partners, and Anna and Robbie. For the music, we have chosen two piano pieces that my mum used to play: a Schubert Impromptu and Chopin’s Raindrop prelude. As her wicker basket leaves the chapel, Richard Strauss’s Morgen! will be playing: a beautiful song she loved and passed on to us. There will be tears.We are planning a bigger service to inter her ashes next to my dad some time in May, though we’re not sure how many people to expect. Mum outlived almost all her family and friends, though maybe a few of the younger generation will come. It’s a tough time, made worse by the illness of my dog,Herbert Hound. We had hoped to have him around for the summer at least, but he is fading fast and I fear his life is measured in weeks at best.He spends most of his time asleep, hardly eats and has trouble weeing. The only upside is that he doesn’t appear to be in any pain. It feels as if Herbie is looking at us in a different way. Distant, yet strangely intimate. As if he knows his time is short. One of the few consolations in all this loss has been you, the readers. Over the past two weeks, I have received so many kind emails from strangers. Too many to reply to them all, but greatly appreciated, nonetheless. I thank you all. It has also been wonderful to meet so many of you at events I have been doing round the country. I have three more upcoming. At the Marine Theatre in Lyme Regis on Good Friday, the Bloomsbury Theatre in London on 24 April and at the Norwich Arts Centre on 1 May. Please do come. I would love the chance to talk to you and thank you in person.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekUS politicsRachel ReevesThe BeatlesDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, the world’s richest person faced an unmistakable rebuke from the public when voters in Wisconsin rejected his preferred candidate for a vacant state supreme court seat there: Brad Schimel, the former state attorney general, on whose campaign Musk had spent more than $25m – lost in a landslide to the liberal Susan Crawford. He must have been devastated, a thought which liberal Americans greetedwith relish. The Democratic party’s official account on Musk’s X posted a photo of Musk with the caption “loser”. All that money wasted. Maybe he cried.In addition to his lavish expenditures, Musk had made himself the center of the race in a deliberate and ill-advised fashion. He appeared at a rally in Green Bay wearing a cheese hat – a deliberately silly article donned by fans of sports teams in the dairy-producing state. He paid for in-person canvassers at a rate of $25 an hour, three times the minimum wage. And in an illegal gesture that the Wisconsin supreme court declined to stop, he handed out giant, novelty $1m checks to voters who signed a petition against “activist” judges – a thinly veiled cash-for-votes scheme, somethinghe also did in Pennsylvaniaahead of the 2024 presidential election.The Florida and Wisconsin election results are a warning for Trump and Republicans | Lloyd GreenRead moreBecause of Musk’s unrelenting visibility, the race became largely a referendum on his character and on his Doge project of draconian and indiscriminate federal government program cuts in Washington. The result was decisive: Crawford, the liberal, branded her campaign “the people vs Elon Musk”, and won by about 10 points.AsDonald Trumpand his allies tighten their grip over executive bureaucracy and entrench their influence on the federal judiciary, state level politics – and particularly state courts – have become one of the few available venues where liberal activism can hold sway. The state supreme court race in Wisconsin is an uncommonly influential one, with Crawford now poised to join a bench of colleagues who will rule on abortion access, congressional redistricting for the state’s US House seats and on a case in which Musk has a personal financial stake, regarding how Tesla can operate dealerships there. (Schimel, Musk’s beneficiary, refused to say that he would recuse himself if seated for this last case.) The high stakes – both for his personal fortune and for the Republican party for which he is now one of the largest financial sponsors – led Musk tocast the raceas a battle for “western civilization” and “the future of the world”. Democrats have not won quite so much as that in Crawford’s victory, but her vote on the court will be indispensable to efforts to restore and protect women’s rights, and to re-establish fair elections in Wisconsin, a state where most of the congressional districts have long been gerrymandered out of competitiveness. Her victory also offers a road map to other judges and politicians, who may have once feared that Musk’s billions meant they could not oppose him and survive an election. Crawford’s example proves that they can.But perhaps more usefully, the race may offer a model for the sclerotic, beleaguered, and lately largely defeatist national Democratic party, which so far has mostly responded to Trump’s return to Washington with a mixture of fear, anger at their base and a kind of cowing submission I can only describe as canine. InWisconsin, Musk proved to be a useful target, an elegant distillation of everything that is wrong and repulsive about the rightwing worldview into one man. His person became a symbol of corruption, of oligarchal seizure of political power, of the rich’s cavalier insult to the little people they feel entitled to control, and of the singularly off-putting quality of a too-online techno-reactionary elite, a group of men who believe themselves much smarter than everybody else but seem to have no grasp on how they appear to others.Musk has been feared, by Democrats, for his bottomless money. But perhaps they should embrace him as a symbol for his sheer odiousness. Voter motivations are hard to track and the data about them is easy to manipulate; just ask any of the Democratic strategists currently squabbling over their various preferred theories of why the party lost in 2024. Butanecdotal evidence out of Wisconsinsuggests that voters were angered at Musk’s Doge cuts to government programs and creeped out by him personally. He seems eager for the spotlight, eager to be the center of attention, eager to make it clear that he has bought the presidency, bought the Republican party and wants to buy you, too. And voters, to their credit, do not particularly like the idea of being owned and dominated by such an annoying and repulsive nerd.To observers, part of what has been so frustrating about the Democrats’ inaction in the face of Trump’s authoritarian takeover is how easy it would be to make a case against those who are destroying our country for their own gain. Musk, deputized to effectively run the executive branch while Trump himself spends his time deploying law enforcement against his enemies and golfing, has presented a grim spectacle, heavy handed with symbolism: the world’s richest person, in a fit of irrepressible arrogance and greed, is stealing from the people, dismantling the programs that give them food and medicine and security in their old age – stealing their educations, their health, their food, their warmth, their art, their science, their futures. It is a morally repugnant operation, shameless and gruesome, and it is carried out by a man who is a personal vacuum of charisma, who laughs, stupidly and at himself, while he steals from us. He is an easy character to hate.Hate has its uses. The Republican party has organized itself almost solely around hatred since 2016. Trump rallies his followers in hatred of immigrants, of women, of transgender people, of a nebulous and imprecise “elite” who seem to be winning in a world where everyone else can only lose. This is a misdirected hate, targeting people who are not responsible for Americans’ suffering and whose punishment cannot end it. But it has been a very politically effective hate, one that has restored Trump to power he may never relinquish.The Democrats have been reluctant to embrace their own brand of hate in return, and understandably so. But Musk represents a unique opportunity to turn Americans’ anger where it belongs: towards the oligarchs, the smug rich, the arrogant and stupid men who are ruining our lives in order to further enrich their own. Perhaps this anger can become a new rallying point for the beleaguered Democrats. There has rarely been a more deserving target.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionUS politicsWisconsinDemocratsTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Not just that one person. There are a lot of such people. You can read about them in every newspaper. But that one person with real power who’s willing to risk something costly in defiance. That one university president who’ll say, fuck you and your money. That one Democrat who’ll say, fuck you and your threat to my re-election or that of my party. Everyone’s looking for our Tank Man, staring down a column of tanks, all by himself, inTiananmen Square.Why don’t we see that person? Where is our Tank Man? (And, no, I don’t thinkCory Booker doing a marathon-length filibuster counts.)The reason we don’t see that person is that we’re asking the wrong question. There’s a reason there are so few lonely individuals willing to stand up to the machine. It’s not just simple cowardice or craven self-interest, though that might explain some of it. There’s something deeper at work.It’s hard to take a risk, but it’s especially hard when you feel like there’s no point, that you’ll fail, or worse, that you’ll be the only one out there doing it. When you’re the only one doing it, you run a risk much worse than failure. You run the risk of doing something pointless. Everything in our nature cuts against the grain of pointlessness. Yes, history might remember you, but what is history? To risk pointlessness is to risk foolishness, frivolousness, fatuity, inanity. It can even feel like moral slovenliness.The Guardian view on Donald Trump’s tariffs: a spectacle of struggle and control | EditorialRead moreTake Roy Huggins, one of my favorite villain-heroes of the blacklist era. You’ve probably never heard of him. In his time, he was a screenwriter, producer and director of some note. He was responsible for The Fugitive and The Rockford Files. He also named names, after initially refusing to cooperate with the government.Why did he do it? He had a lot of reasons. But this one has always stayed with me:When you’re thinking of becoming a hero, you feel like a slob. You feel, do you really have a right to do that?It’s a perplexing question: do I have the right to become a hero? One doesn’t usually think of heroism as a right. Why does Huggins frame the question that way? Because he thinks of heroism as some sort of extravagance, some sort of selfishness, a kind of grandstanding that comes awfully close to vanity.The philosopher Thomas Hobbes had some thoughts on this matter, how easily the quest for glory, which had traditionally been considered a virtue, could slide into vaingloriousness. And the philosopher Max Weber had a similar intuition: how easily the tragic hero becomes a kind of narcissist, preening in front of the mirror.I think Huggins is getting at something like that slide, from glory to vainglory, from heroism to vanity and narcissism. It’s why he immediately follows up his question on the right to heroism with the question: do I have the right to be a slob?That’s what made him afraid. He could imagine taking on a heroic act if he thought it might achieve something, even in failure. But to think that the act would be completely extinguished by failure, by its pointlessness, that was too much.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

That’s what made it worth the risk.I’ve always hated the romance of heroism, the futile gesture of protest and defiance, particularly of the individual. It reeks of what Lenin hated about intellectuals, who “undertake everything under the sun without finishing anything”. He called that a kind of “slovenliness”, incidentally.But I can see the underside of my dislike.

But giving up on transatlantic relations is not the answerFri 4 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 04.57 EDTShareIreland believes in open, free trade and has build a strong, resilient economy by being the most globalised in Europe. We are a trading country. That is why the announcement on tariffs came as such a disappointment to us.Imposing tariffs to force companies to locate in the US will fundamentally change how the world sees it. US economic dominance has not been built on scale or purchasing power alone, but on relationships and alliances, something it is now damaging. “Liberation day” risks forcing a realignment of how global trade operates, without the US at its centre, as countries rethink their relationship with the US and seek new, more reliable partners.Last year, Irelandexported €72bnworth of goods to the US. So a 20% tariff is huge. It could have been worse. For now, pharmaceuticals, which represent60% of those exports, are exempt. However, that may only be a temporary reprieve.Business leaders are predicting that if the tariffs remain unchanged they could have an impact of reducing Irish exportsby 2-3%over time: serious but not catastrophic. The Irish economy has shown a remarkable ability to adapt to international challenges and opportunities in the past, and it will do so again by supporting businesses under pressure, focusing on competitiveness and diversifying exports into new markets.Donald Trump’s justification for targeting the EU with a 20% tariff is mystifying. He claims the EU is charging the US 39% in tariffs. However, the average tariff applied to trade on both sides is less than 2%. In 2023, the US collected about€7bn in tariffsonEU exports of €502bn, and the EU collected about €3bn on US exports of about €344bn. It’s hardly justification for a trade war.The question now turns to how we respond. With EU membership, Ireland’s trade policy is EU trade policy, so we have been focused on influencing opinions in Brussels. The EUwon’t respond immediatelywith counter tariffs. It will wait and build consensus on how to respond in a way that’s considered and measured. Most importantly, the EU will seek dialogue and negotiation with the White House to address legitimate US concerns, where they exist, but also to mitigate against the most damaging impacts of the new US approach.If negotiation fails, the EU needs a firm response. Trump respects strength not weakness, and has a history of altering decisions when confronted with consequences for US interests. The EU has powerful cards to play, and while it will be cautious by nature not to escalate tensions, it will also not allow unjustified, aggressive US tariffs to go without consequence.Ireland should urge restraint and a response primarily aimed at defending the interests of our businesses and citizens. That means keeping reciprocal tariffs to a minimum. This is particularly the case as the island of Ireland faces the complex challenge of different tariff rates applying to Northern Ireland, as part of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, 10% and 20% respectively. As if the Windsor framework wasn’t complex enough, we now have toresolve further challengesto protect an all-island economy that works for North and South.Perilous and chaotic, Trump’s ‘liberation day’ endangers the world’s broken economy – and him | Martin KettleRead moreThe EU response should be less about retaliatory tariffs and more focused on our own competitiveness, productivity and ability to diversify away from the US market. While the US retreats from global trade, the EU should do the opposite, accelerate new trade deals and lead on promoting globalised supply chains with reliable partners.Trump has the power to determine US policy on trade, but we should not allow him dictate our relationships with the rest of the world. Canada, Australia, Japan, the UK, India, Brazil, China, the Gulf and many other countries will be looking for new trading opportunities as the US turns its back. The UK in particular should be a priority for EU leaders, in a post-Brexit context, to progress on improving trading conditions for both sides. I hope the UK will share that endeavour.There will be voices calling for an aggressive response to the Trump administration, to cut off efforts at transatlantic trade deals and a doubling down on what has been termed “strategic autonomy” for the EU without the US. This would be an expensive mistake.We should not give up on transatlantic relations; they are essential for trade, stability and security in the future. We are living through an enforced reset, but while adapting we must always keep the door open to dialogue and improved relations. In other words, be the adult in the room.Finally, the US is bigger than Trump. The EU must remain open to and supportive of American companies and interests. Their innovation, investment and employment is a huge asset toEurope. Let’s continue to invest in that relationship.Simon Coveney is a former deputy prime minister, foreign minister and enterprise and trade minister of IrelandDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Retaliation at this point makes no senseFri 4 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 06.49 EDTShareThe tirade was astonishing. On Wednesday afternoon the world watched as the leader of its most powerful nation accused friends and foes alike of having “looted, pillaged, raped, plundered”, and simultaneously waved a bogus list of tariff imbalances. The playground paranoia was cringeworthy. What onearthwas going on?The answer can only be that Donald Trump is America’s elected president for the next four years. He says hewants to endthe military conflicts the US has fought or sponsored round the globe for a quarter of a century. We are waiting for that. Meanwhile, he is waging an economic war on world trade, a response that his biographer and ghostwriter, Tony Schwartz,blames on his childhood: “a life spent feeling like a victim … any time he does not totally dominate he feels ripped off”.The immediate question is how Britain should respond. At this moment British and US trade negotiators, some presumably crippled with embarrassment, have been struggling to reach a bilateral trade agreement of sorts. Rumours are that it was near completion though Trump had yet to agree. Since Trump has already placed Britain among the countries to be least hit by the tariffs, retaliation at this point makes no sense. Britain would be acting outside the EU and it would have minimal impact.History is never the point in diplomacy, but in tariffs it offers lessons. What Trump calls reciprocity is nothing of the sort. It is competition. The countries he is hitting hardest are in China’s sphere of interest in south-east Asia. These are doing to the US exactly what America did to Europe at the end of the 19th century, working feverishly to undercut its competitor on costs. This plunged 1890s Britain into a deep and lastingagricultural depression. Britain retaliated with tariffs dressed up as imperial preference.Similar devastation followed President Herbert Hoover’s notoriousSmoot-Hawley Actof 1930. Seeking to answer the Wall Street crash, he imposed tariffs on imports that ran from about 20% to as high as 60%. The resulting bout of retaliation from European and other nations ensured that a downturn became a deep global depression. Is there no historian in the White House – or at least in the capitals of Europe? The lesson of Smoot-Hawley is don’t initiate, but above all, don’t retaliate.View image in fullscreenAfter Trump’s announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was on the floor at the opening bell of the NYSE in New York, 3 April 2025.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPAAs for Trump’s claims of the US being “pillaged”, he may have factored into his balance sheet the activities of his favourite pirates, those of America’s digital empire. Inadequately regulated and all but free of tax, they are widely accused of spreading social and psychological devastation among the world’s young people. Should they not be tariffed? That is without even starting on the service sector, inclusion of which would massively distort Trump’s concept of reciprocity.Students of classical economics are taught thatAdam Smithwas right. Free trade led to increased specialisation and market competition. It was tough but fair, and was to the advantage of all. The end of the postwarBretton Woods systemin the 1970s ushered in a world of ever freer trade, and eventual globalisation. The world’s increasing reliance on the dollar led to a recklessness that tottered then recovered in 2008. Ever freer trade remains a bulwark of world prosperity.What Trump is doing has long been the left’s answer to globalisation. It asserts that the benefits of freer trade flowed to the rich, while the poor needed protection from competition, fair or unfair. This is Trumpism. He is defending his domestic industries against what he understandably sees as an existential menace, particularly from south-east Asia. He is making his consumers pay more for their goods, supposedly repaying them with lower taxes. It did not rescue them in the 1930s.World trade has become a robust phenomenon. Since 2022 it has adjusted with relative ease to Nato’s sanctions against Russia and its supporting coalition. The chief beneficiaries of sanctions have been the so-called Bric nations (Brazil, Russia, India and China), who grow in strength by the year. Meanwhile ahuge energy costhas been borne by Europe, with no change whatsoever in Russia’s policy in Ukraine. But the truth is that trade does not do what it is told by governments. It finds ways of dodging regulatory obstacles and defying economic forecasters. Trump might partially mitigate this week’s damage by ending sanctions forthwith.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Today in Focus Extra – podcastRead moreWhat happens next is clearly open to doubt. Pessimists assume that in some degree Trump’s tariff regime will stay. That did not happen after Trump 1.0. There is every sign that he is mercurial, and this may even prove to have been peak Trump. The “economic emergency” powers under which he is operating are shaky andsubject to legal challenge. His behaviour has so damaged America’s government and reputation – slashing his civil service, sacking aid workers against the backdrop of the Myanmar disaster,devastatingthe stock market – that opposition from Washington to Wall Street must steadily emerge. Congress will face its electors in under two years, and party leaders must choose candidates for the succession in little over three. Trump tried to defy the constitution in 2021. He will not do so again.As for Britain, everything says play it long. Yes, there is a temporary advantage in London being free to negotiate with the US separately from Europe. Something might come of it. But the effect can only be to weaken Europe’s negotiating strength as a whole.The best hope is that this is not another 1930s or 1890s, but a rush of American blood to the head that will pass. Trump will have reduced the world’s trade with the US and consequently strengthened other countries’ links with each other. Meanwhile, businesses everywhere will have had an almighty shock. They will have been forced to pause and ponder their future. That, at least, is a silver lining. But for now, history screams one message: don’t retaliate, always negotiate.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionTariffsDonald TrumpUS economyGlobal economyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s how Trump’s tariffs could change thatNathalie TocciWith populist leaders on the back foot and EU support at its highest in years, the US trade war could be an opportunity for the unionFri 4 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 09.22 EDTShareDonald Trump has unleashed a trade war on the world, and Europe, considered by Washington to be among the “worst offenders”, is a major target.After hitting European steel, aluminium and cars, this week Trump announced sweeping 20% tariffs on almost all EU imports. Europeans have seen this coming for a long time. Well before his re-election, officials in Brussels were drawing up plans on how the EU might respond to Trump 2.0 and a possible transatlantic trade war.What might the political fallout inEuropebe? The good news is that Trump’s trade war puts Trump-friendly far-right forces in Europe in a terribly uncomfortable position. It’s one thing for the European far right to support Trump in principle, or to support the administration’s tyranny over peoples it doesn’t care about, be it Ukrainians, Canadians, Mexicans or Palestinians. It’s quite another to defend Trump and his policies when the victims are countries that these far-right parties supposedly represent.Far-right leaders in Europe have adopted two approaches. The most populist among them have remained as obsequious as ever. Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League party in Italy, claimed that Trump’s tariffs represented an “opportunity” for Italian business, without specifying why and how. And if that opportunity is not seized, it will presumably be because of the “grave mistakes” made by Brussels, as the Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, declared. Most other far-right leaders, however, are on the back foot, aware that they are damned if they speak in favour of Trump and damned if they don’t. Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who called the decision “wrong” while meekly arguing in favour of transatlantic talks (as if this were not the position of the European Commission), is clearly uncomfortable.Another political upside of Trump’s transatlantic trade war on Europe is that it could strengthen unity. This effect is already on display. Squeezed in between Russia’s war and US betrayal, Europeans have rediscovered their support for the EU. The latest Eurobarometer revealed that74% of Europeansbelieve their country’s membership of the EU is a good thing, the highest figure in 42 years. Intuitively, citizens understand that by sticking together the EU can better defend their interests. And nowhere is this more true than in the area of trade, an exclusive competence of the EU. This means that the union can develop and deploy a coherent counterstrategy to Trump’s trade war that represents the bloc as a whole, with its second-largest economy in the world and more than 450 million citizens. On trade and the economy, the US can hurt the EU a lot, but the reverse is also true.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, gave a preview of the EU’s response. While pursuing negotiations with Washington, given that avoiding a trade war remains the foremost goal, the EU is preparing to retaliate, diversify its trade relations and deepen the single market. Interestingly, von der Leyen responded to Trump’s “liberation day” from Samarkand, where the first EU-central Asia summit is being held. In the same spirit, the entire college of commissioners for the first timetravelled to Indiain February to explore deepening ties with Delhi. António Costa, the president of the European Council, also in Uzbekistan, called for the speedy implementation of the EU’s recently signed trade deals with Mercosur and Mexico.Retaliation towards the US may include sectoral tariffs that could be phased over time. More significantly, the EU is considering countermeasures in services, where, unlike in goods, the US enjoys an annual surplus ofmore than €100bn(£84bn) with the EU. This could include measures such as the suspension of intellectual property rights and the exclusion of US companies from European public procurement tenders.If US escalation continues, demanding for example that the EU lower its VAT, scrap digital taxes or loosen the digital services and digital markets acts, EU retaliation could go as far as activating its trade “nuclear” option, known as theanti-coercion instrument. Developed primarily with China in mind, the instrument could now be deployed against the US if an agreement is not reached. This would seriously limit the access of US service companies to the EU single market. So far the EU has allowed itself more time, refraining from responding immediately after Trump’s tariff appetiser on steel and aluminium. The delay is aimed at exploring all options to reach a quick deal and, above all, find agreement with member states (or at least a majority of them), bearing in mind that not all countries are affected equally, with Germany, Ireland and Italy standing to lose the most from a trade war with the US.This is where the main risk lies. So far theTrump administrationhas been anything but subtle. But precisely because of the differentiated economic impact of tariffs, a more sophisticated and dangerous US approach would be that of sowing divisions by leveraging relations with far-right governments in Europe. Washington could try to woo Rome, for instance, where Meloni’s Trump-friendly government could be tempted to break EU unity and accept a favourable bilateral trade deal with the US. In principle it cannot do this, given that trade is an EU competence. But seen from Washington, breaking EU law (and the EU in general) is precisely the point. The US vice-president, JD Vance, is expected to visit Italy over Easter, which makes the threat palpable.Breaking European unity might not be confined to the EU. Recent months have seen growing strategic convergence across the Channel, especially over Ukraine. The “coalition of the willing” includes France and the UK in the driver’s seat, probably joined by Germany and Poland soon. This may open the way to a broader agreement between the EU and the UK. Trump’s trade war could put the spanner in the works of this strategic realignment, which includes security but also the economy. So far Washington has not been smart enough to go down this route.

ALP members are demanding an answerPaul DaleyThe drums of Labor dissent are beating. Compounded by new US tariffs, they’ll get louder if Albanese is returned on 3 MayThu 3 Apr 2025 20.21 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 05.38 EDTShareWell before Donald Trump unveiled his country’s punitive tariffs, the graffiti was being figuratively scrawled on Labor’s walls, a reflection of the deep disquiet of party members about the continuation of the$368bn Aukus dealwith the US.The message has been simple.RETHINK AUKUS NOW.After Trump’s 10% tariff announcement (cloaked as it was in nauseating terms about“wonderful” Australia), prime minister Anthony Albanese was quick to say “this is not the act of a friend”. Something of an understatement, that, though a welcome one for many of Albanese’s supporters who, with good reason, now view Trump’s America not only as a perfidious ally but also a downright dangerous one.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterDangerous? Listen to what the man says about acquiring – “taking” – Greenland, the Panama Canal, Gaza and even Canada as a 51ststate. Must we wait gormlessly for the proof that he’s doing more than talking tough?Look at how he wants to defy the US constitution to somehow snatch athird presidential term. Consider, also, his philistine attacks on revered US cultural institutions including ivy league universitiesand the Smithsonian, an illustration of the man whowould be king’sfervour forrewriting his nation’s history– a foundational pillar of authoritarianism.2:27Trump announces sweeping new tariffs, upending decades of US trade policy – videoAnd then wonder where that leaves Australia, a rusted-on middle-power at the bottom of the globe seemingly wedded - unquestioningly, financially, strategically and in terms of interoperability with the US military for continental defence - because of its undying commitment toAukus.That is why, across this country, Labor’s various organisational elements – including branches and federal electoral councils – are in revolt against the federal parliamentary party’s unwavering support of Aukus, while America threatens and cajoles the world, and wreaks havoc on its economies.At least 100 of these ALP organisational elements, many in Labor electorates, have passed resolutions condemning Australia’s continued commitment to Aukus and demanding a change in policy. The organisation, Labor Against War, has written to all federal members and senators, and election candidates, decrying America’s hostility to traditional allies and urging a rethink on Aukus.Former Labor senator Doug Cameron, the national patron of Labor Against War, recentlydescribed a growing internal party concern“about developments in the US under Trump and how the US government cannot be relied upon to either deliver these submarines or come to Australia’s assistance if something happens”.Further uncertainty about the veracity of America’s nuclear submarine program, which is already behind schedule, has been sparked by indiscriminate cutting of the US public service, courtesy of Elon Musk’s department of government efficiency sackings. The New York Times reported, “a half-dozen staff members left a unit in the agency that builds reactors for nuclear submarines”.“I’m sure that there would be ministers and members of caucus who are extremely concerned about this,” Cameron said.Cameron is correct. With every increasingly erratic utterance from Trump, each act of aggressive cultural and territorial posturing, and with every slight to traditional allies, concern about Aukus intensifies among Labor ministers and backbenchers alike.There also remains a simmering disquiet in the parliamentary party about the process – or lack of it – by which, after a two-hour briefing while in opposition in 2021 (absent of what might be considered requisite paperwork given the enormity of the decision), the shadow ministry signed up to Aukus and it became Labor policy without caucus support.As Labor’sKim Carr wrote in 2023: “Labor MPs were expected to leap into bipartisan support for the Aukus deal.”A senior Labor figure describes the concern thus: “I haven’t spoken to anyone inside the Labor Party – that includes the [federal] parliamentary party. . . who’s been able to say they support it [Aukus] without qualification since Trump’s re-election and the subsequent madness. This was a policy born out of an acute caution of being seen to say anything critical of the US when [Joe] Biden was president and it has continued since, and now in an election, out of fear of being labelled weak on national security.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’ll get louder if Labor is returned on 3 May.Meanwhile, come what may in the White House, a feckless bipartisan policy of supporting Aukus - along with an unquestioned, sanctified, US-Australia alliance - will continue together with the transparentgaslighting of the Australian public.Instructively, it was barely a week ago that Albanese eveninvited Trump, though he’s not acting like a friend today, to visit Australia.I can almost hear the shouting in the streets.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistThis article was amended on 4 April 2025.

Here’s my plea to the international communityThin Lei WinWe have had to be resilient because no one has come to our aid. Myanmar needs tangible support before the humanitarian crisis claims even more livesFri 4 Apr 2025 19.03 EDTShareTwo thoughts entered my head as soon as I saw thatMyanmar, my home country, had been hit by an earthquake: “Is everyone OK?”, followed by, “We just can’t catch a break”.My loved ones thankfully turned out to be badly shaken but physically OK. There were material losses but nothing compared with what so many others aregoing through.The quake on 28 March was both powerful and shallow, a combination that tends to unleash devastation. But it is crucial not to attribute solely to the quake the terrible and heartbreaking images and stories trickling out of Myanmar, of peopleusing bare handsto rescue trapped survivors anddesperate pleasfor medical assistance for the injured.What is turning this natural disaster into a full-blown humanitarian crisis is the actions of the military junta which seized power in February 2021.In the span of four years, I saw my country descend from a promising, if flawed, democracy into one struggling with a “profound polycrisis”. Even before the quake hit, half the population was living below the poverty line, the currency has lost 70% of its value, and more than one in three people need assistance, according to the United Nations. Our healthcare infrastructure is in tatters while the rates of infectious diseases havesoared.How will Myanmar’s earthquake impact the civil war? – podcastRead moreThe army, meanwhile, was busy terrorising its own citizens:bombing communities,burning villagesandcutting off communications.So many ofthe areas most affected by the quake, located in the Buddhist heartland of Sagaing and Mandalay where my family used to go on regular pilgrimages, were already highly vulnerable after four years of intense clashes and coming under the junta’sregular bombardment. In factnearly half of Myanmar’s displaced population of 3.5 millionare in quake-hit areas, which were the military’s former prime recruiting grounds but now are a resistance stronghold.These communities have been further hollowed out as young people fled to avoid the conscription law and the junta forced civil society groups andprivate hospitalsto close. These groups would normally be the first responders in natural disasters.Communication and electricity blackouts have also made it difficult to establish the full scale of the damage in some areas. Without internet access, local journalists have to rely on patchy mobile phone coverage.I’m glad the military made a rare appeal for international help, unlike in the aftermath ofCyclone Nargis in 2008or more recently in 2023 withCyclone Mocha. But I have serious doubts about itswillingness and abilityto provide aid effectively and impartially, given its history of blocking aid, and since some of the hardest hit areas are not under its control.Asian countries riven by war and disaster face some of steepest Trump tariffsRead moreI believe aid should not be conditional or political but I’m also not naive. The junta is likely to take advantage of this latest tragedy to portray itself as Myanmar’s legitimate government, seek to reinforce the myth it is the only institution that can hold the country together, and get broader support for itsupcoming elections.It has already shown a desire to have its cake and eat it: international aidwithout the scrutiny from international journalists, citing travel and accommodation challenges. Having spent years of my early career chasing disasters around South-East Asia, I know these things don’t deter journalists.The junta is illegitimate. Whenever given the chance, Myanmar people have repeatedly shown they do not want military rule. I’m glad there is finally some international attention on Myanmar and I hope it is accompanied by substance, given the UN’s assistance plans for Myanmar have beenconsistently woefully underfunded. Worse, a significant portion of the funds came from the United States,much of which is now goneafter the Trump administration’sdismantlingof USAID.Here’s my plea to the international community: Please push the junta to reverse its flimsy excuse for not allowing foreign journalists into the country, to honour the ceasefire it has finally announced days after pro-democracy groupscommitted to do so, to stop airstrikes of the kind it launchedhours after the quake, and toallow unfettered accessfor aid and aid workers.Please do not rely on the junta alone to deliver aid. Please work with a variety of actors, including local groups with access to some of the most disconnected areas. Volunteers on the grounds are already worried about diseases spreading if the dead bodies are not removed soon because April showers usually accompany our new year, which starts next Sunday.Much has been made of the Myanmar people’s resilience in the face of never-ending misfortune, but I have come to resent the term. We are resilient because we have had to be, because no one else has come to our aid.We should not have to endure this alone. Myanmar needs tangible, sustained support from the international community before this disaster claims even more lives.Thin Lei Win is an award-winning multimedia journalist who was born and raised in Myanmar.

Increasingly, that is under threat, but it must be defendedFri 4 Apr 2025 10.48 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 10.51 EDTShareIt was unsurprising that Benjamin Netanyahu praised Viktor Orbán’s “bold and principled” stand, in response to Hungary’s announcement yesterday that it will leave the international criminal court (ICC). More dismaying is that too few governments seem ready to stand up against impunity at a time when, because of Donald Trump, the very existence of the Hague court is under threat.Hungary’s leader described the ICC as “a political forum”; the Israeli prime minister, during his defiant visit to Budapest this week, complained of a “corrupt organisation”. That is all logical enough. Four months ago, the courtconfirmedan arrest warrant for Netanyahu for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. He could hardly be expected to praise his own indictment.But other European governments also seem ready to play the role of “Orbán-lite” when it comes to Gaza. They have praised the warrants for Vladimir Putin and his associates in the past two years, but recoil from acting on a similar warrant for Netanyahu. Trump, meanwhile,announced sanctionsagainst those who dare to cooperate with the court.Germany’s Green foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has been an almost lone voice in describing Netanyahu’s visit to Hungary as “a bad day” for international law. Her colleague, the then chancellor Olaf Scholz, repeated that he “cannot imagine” Netanyahu being arrested in Germany. The incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has said it would be “completely absurd” for Netanyahu not to be able to visit Berlin. France, traditionally a strong supporter of the ICC, has argued that Netanyahumight enjoy immunity– despite earlier praising the Putin warrant as a welcome reminder that “no one should escape justice”. Downing Streetslapped downthe foreign secretary, David Lammy, for echoing the ICC in asserting breaches of international law.And yet, as ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan points out, perceived unequal approaches are one of the biggest dangers for international justice itself. When I met Khan in The Hague just after his requested warrant for Netanyahu (as well as for Hamas leaders for their “unconscionable” crimes), he quoted King Lear: “Robes and furr’d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold, / And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks.” Khan said he was determined to confront that problem.Those who loathe the idea that political leaders with “furr’d gowns” and powerful connections might somehow be held accountable like to argue that Khan must be a biased prosecutorgone rogue. And yet, the ICC spent a decade chewing the issues over before giving a green light to an investigation. Asrevealed in the Guardianand the Israeli-Palestinian+972 Magazinelast year,Netanyahu became “obsessed” with the court’s work. In one bizarre incident among many, Khan’s predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, wasambushed in a Manhattan hotel suiteby the head of the Mossad. The one thing Israeldidn’tdo was launch credible investigations or prosecutions of alleged crimes, which, following the core principle of “complementarity”, would have spelled an end to ICC investigations.Khan’sadvisers includeda former British chief military prosecutor, a former ICC judge, and a former senior Israeli ambassador who is also the former president of the Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal.A panel of judges spent six months examining Khan’s request before giving theirunanimous approval(the Putin warrant, for comparison, took three weeks to confirm). In short: any politician who challenges the legitimacy of the Netanyahu warrant may be revealing more about their own biases than those of the prosecutor and his colleagues. To quote the Israeli daily Haaretz, the arrest warrant is “neither antisemitic nor a modern-day blood libel”, but a simple call for justice – important for Palestinians, for Israelis and the world.In some ways, the ICC seems stronger than ever. Last month, former president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte wasarrested at Manila airportand delivered to The Hague, in connection with the killing of thousands in his “war on drugs”. In 2023,Putin cancelled a trip to South Africabecause of the arrest warrant against him. Even Netanyahu, despite all his bluster, took alonger routewhen he flew to meet Trump in Washington in February, fearing he might be arrested if he needed to touch down in Europe. The possibilities of international justice, in other words, have grown.But that is not enough. The dangers posed by a vengeful and justice-hating Trump cannot be ignored. Last month, the president of the ICC called for the European Union not to “abandon the court and … the hope of the victims”. She demanded a more robust response to Trump’s sanctions. So far, there has been little sign of that. There is no shortage of issues, from tariffs to the war in Ukraine, where politicians are grappling with how to deal with the unhinged proposals that pour out of the White House almost daily. But confronting Trump’s attempts to destroy the rule of law worldwide cannot be just an optional add-on, once everything else has been dealt with. The events of this week need to be a wake-up call.Robert H Jackson, US chief prosecutor at Nuremberg, said we cannot afford to ignore the gravest crimes, because “we cannot survive their being repeated”. That remains true today. If this court is allowed to fail now – “an idea whose time has come”, as Germany described it at the time of the court’s foundation – it will be impossible to replace. That has implications for the whole world.Steve Crawshaw is the author ofProsecuting the Powerful: War Crimes and the Battle for Justice.

So what happens to your old jeans when you donate them? And how can consumers play their part to minimise waste in the process?The golden rule for wardrobe cleanoutsStandards for what is resellable in Australia are high. When you’re doing a wardrobe cleanout the golden rule for donation is: would you gift it to a friend?Antidote to fast fashion: eight ways to spot durable garmentsRead moreIf you make your donation directly to a charity store, the staff will sort through the garments to determine what, if any, can go straight on the shelves. Anything not kept by a store or that gets dropped into a charity bin will go to a redistribution centre. According to Peter Allan, the executive officer of the ReFuture Foundation, about 16% of everything that ends up at aredistribution centre is kept and sold locally.But according to Virginia Boyd, the director of retail for Vinnies New South Wales, this can increase to as much as 40% or 50% when donations are made in store rather than being dumped out the front or dropped off in clothing bins. “When people leave stuff outside, the weather gets to things and that really impacts the keep rate,” she says.The most efficient way to dispose of unwearable garments is to arrange a collection through Upparel or Textile Recyclers Australia.Get Guardian Australia environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as an emailSo where do most clothes end up?What doesn’t get selected for local resale gets sorted and graded at centralised facilities. According to theAustralian Fashion Council(AFC), sorting significantly increases the value of each item of clothing – unsorted the value per item is around 20-25 cents; when sorted this can increase to 80-85 cents per item.The same AFC report found that at this stage, about 14% of donations are deemed unwearable because they are soiled or torn and are sent to landfill. The rest – about 100,000 tonnes – is purchased by, and exported to, major sorting facilities overseas. More than half goes to the United Arab Emirates, a quarter is sent to Malaysia, and the remainder goes to countries including Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and the Solomon Islands. Here the garments go through yet another round of sorting and are divided into two categories: wearable and unwearable.The wearables and unwearablesAccording to Charitable Reuse Australia, 22% of the textiles exported are deemed non-wearable by the sorting facilities and are downcycled into cleaning cloths or rags, some of which are reimported back into Australia and sold at retail. Another 6% is declared contamination or waste and is discarded.Castoffs to catwalk: fashion show shines light on vast Chile clothes dump visible from spaceRead moreAccording to Allan, “around two thirds of the clothing is deemed wearable by the sorting facilities”. This is then separated into grades based on the condition and categories according to the appropriate age, gender and climate. “The sorting facilities end up with bales of wearable clothing sorted into 400 different categories,” he says.These are sold to secondhand clothing markets in Africa, eastern Europe or southern Asia where they may be purchased and worn by the local community (so long as the sorting was effective). But it’s at this point that visibility over exactly where Australia’s clothing donations end up is lost.Waste colonialismWhile there are clear benefits to the global secondhand clothing market (including providing affordable clothing and livelihoods to developing communities, environmental benefits from extending the life of clothes, and the trade is worth around$50m domestically), it is not without its critics.Reports of clothing dumps in theAtacama Desertand on thebeaches of Ghanahighlight the burden of clothing waste created by wealthy countries such as Australia. Especially since we arethe biggest consumers of cheap fashion in the world.Despite the lack of visibility into the final destination of Australia’s clothes, Allan insists the impacts of the trade are positive. “We have anecdotal evidence from people receiving clothing in those destination markets that less than 5% is not wearable,” he says.But Liz Ricketts, the founder of The Or Foundation, a not-for-profit that works out of Kantamanto markets in Ghana, says it’s important to draw a distinction between what arrives as waste – which might be as low as 5% – and what leaves the market as waste. Theirresearch indicatesthis is as high as 40% per bale.What about recycling?‘The missing link’: is textile recycling the answer to fashion’s waste crisis?Read moreAlthoughtextile-to-textile recycling is possible, no one has managed to figure out the economics of taking used clothing and turning it into new textiles. Arecent reportfound just 0.3% of the materials used by the global textile industry come from recycled sources. For instance, the 10,000 tonnes of textiles being recycled in Australia every yearmostly becomeplastic pellets, cellulose or insulation. And while Seamless, Australia’s clothing stewardship scheme, is underway, the lack of onshore infrastructure and cost of manufacturing here present significant barriers to establishing local textile-to-textile recycling.But there is hope. The environmental not-for-profit Canopy is working to establish the financial and physical logistics to build global and regional supply chains that can turn discarded textiles into new fibres at scale.“India, China and south-east Asia are key regions for scaling circular, low-carbon materials,” says Nicole Rycroft, Canopy’s founder and executive director. “‌What we need now is speed and scale.”And to stop buying so many new clothes in the first place.Explore more on these topicsAustralian fashionChange by degreesRecyclingWasteEthical and green livingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why spend more on older children, when we know spending earlier is most effective?Fri 4 Apr 2025 05.05 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 10.32 EDTShareDespite the rampaging rogue state across the Atlantic, around the cabinet table ministers push on with their plans. Too often ignored in all this sound and fury, there is some good news. This week Bridget Phillipsonawardedthe first 300 primary schools funding to set up nurseries that will add up to 4,000 places by the end of September. In the great dash for growth, growth, growth the OBRpredictedan extra 0.2% of GDP due to the provision of free nursery hours for under twos, which are now coming on stream.Nurseries may lack the glamour of mighty infrastructure projects, but the growth effect is immediate, letting more parents work, or work more hours. But the overriding motive of Labour’s early years push is to drive life chances of children whose future is too often determined long before they reach primary school.Fulbridge Academy in Peterborough (which Phillipson visited earlier this week) iscelebratingits grant of £150,000 to extend space for its nursery, raising numbers from 16 to 70 children in time for September. The head of school, Sam Smee, hopes for funding in time to raise this to 120 places, “so that all our children in reception can come through from places in our nursery, with no difficult transition, and we know all families right from the start”. He says four out of five deprived children who arrive in reception without attending nursery never catch up with the rest: “Even in year 6, it’s easy to recognise which children went through nursery from the start.” That’s no surprise, with voluminous evidence on the lifetime effect of good nurseries: the IFS, tracing children from the (mostly lost) Sure Start centres of the last Labour government,foundchildren had fewer hospitalisations and better GCSE results.This bright, spacious school, with extraordinary corridors decorated with fantasy scenes and woodlands, has room to expand. Nursery children attend forest school every week, and the advantage of being part of a large school means they are able to use the PE, sports, soft play, dance, drama, music and art teaching facilities used by the rest of the children. Maintained nurseries and nurseries within schools take considerably more Send children than those run mainly for profit: Fulbridge has 10% Send children in the nursery; thenational averageis 4.8%.View image in fullscreenBridget Phillipson at Fulbridge Academy.Photograph: Fulbridge AcademyThis is only the first tranche of new school-based nurseries, and there’s still a shortage. Coram Family and Childcare’s24th annual Childcare Surveyfinds the extra free hours means a part-time nursery place for under-2s in England now costs 56% less than in 2024. But most councils – 79% – have enough places for at least three-quarters of their eligible nursery age children. “Nursery deserts” remain in the poorest areas, where it’s unprofitable for the private sector, so these first 300 chosen schools are mostly in the North and Midlands. Peterborough council tells me they will still be 200 places short next September.There’s a waiting list of 20 children at Fulbridge, where 80% of the children have English as an additional language, half are of Pakistani heritage, with many others from eastern Europe. Thirty-two percent are on free school meals (24% is the national average), with a fifth living in multiple-occupancy housing and many families taking home food parcels provided at school by Fair Share. The breakfast club here has been free for a while, financed by Greggs, but the promised free breakfast clubs are rolled out to the first 750 schools this week, saving families £460 a year. In September every eligible child will get 30 free hours from nine months to age five, saving families an average £7,500 a year.From when she was made shadow education secretary, Phillipson always said early years would come first, because every pound spent on the youngest makes the most difference to the rest of their education and their lives. She gave the biggest uplift so far in the early-years pupil premium for poor children. But she intends far more. After suffering six education secretaries in five years, (Gavin Williamson,remember him?), she has fixed a course that may take years to prove her success. It took 15 years before the IFS could prove what Sure Start did for GCSE results among poorer children. Labour says it has the patience, as with major infrastructure projects, housing and green energy. Growth – physical and human – takes time.There is a very long way to go still to reverse the upside-down pyramid of education priorities, where more money is spent on a child where it makes least difference: nurseries add most human value, universities add least. Take that pupil premium – even with the uplift it’s worth just £388 for each poor nursery child but £1,480 for school-age deprived children. Why? Most nurseries don’t have trained teachers or graduates with thorough understanding in how to encourage development, speech and language, following the play-oriented early-years curriculum, which is very different from school teaching. (When I visited Sweden I found everyone working in a nursery is an early-years teaching graduate). Early vocabulary, oracy, expression, understanding, describing and reasoning should get the most intensive, skilled educators, not apprentices and the lowest paid in all education. The jumble of private providers need transforming into Fulbridge-style primary-linked nurseries.But first, put right the shocking “eligibility” criteria for nursery hours. By far the most disadvantaged children have no working parent. They may be mentally or physically ill, they may be foreign speakers culturally barred from working, or not working for any number of good or bad reasons, but their children are the ones needing most help from the youngest age. Yet any child with no working parent is barred from full-time nursery: they get just 15 hours, not 30. And yes, says Smee, those missing 15 hours make the most difference to the children with the hardest family backgrounds. Why punish young children for their parent’s lack of work? Phillipson knows she has plenty more to do.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionBridget PhillipsonEarly years educationSchoolscommentShareReuse this content"

To turn back extremism masquerading as populism, I believe there are lessons we can learn from our battle against the extreme right in Barking in 2010, whenwe crushed the BNP.The context is different. There was little social media before 2010; we hadn’t been through a pandemic; there was no major war in Europe and no serious challenge to a rules-based international order.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian Design/Guardian Design / Getty ImagesBut there were factors at play then that are relevant today. Turnout at elections was on the decline. In Barking, east London, the 2001 general election voter turnout was 45.5%, down from 61.7% in 1997. Our research revealed that it was anger, not apathy, that kept people at home. Anger that the politicians were not listening to what mattered to voters; anger at theloss of local jobsat Ford in Dagenham; anger that successive governments had not built decent, affordable housing for local families; anger at the way immigration was transforming the local community yet politicians refused to even engage in a debate on the issue.View image in fullscreenBarking & Dagenham Post reporting on the annihilation of the BNP at the polls, on 12 May 2010.Photograph: Barking & Dagenham PostBy 2006 this anger found a home as voters began to turn to the BNP. The BNP stood 13 candidates at the 2006 council electionsand won 12 seats. Had they stood more candidates, we would have had the first BNP-controlled council in Britain.In 2006, the Barking Labour party had lost voters’ confidence. We spent too much time looking inwards, talking to ourselves, and too little time connecting with our voters, listening and reflecting their priorities. And we did far too little to challenge some of the blatant lies that the BNP peddled and that spoke to people’s frustrations, lies of the type now amplified by social media. For instance, the myth that the Labour government wasencouraging “Africans to move to Essex”became accepted orthodoxy, just as lies about Ukraine starting the war with Russia are becoming today.Our task was to rebuild trust with our voters, and it took four years of hard and focused work to get there. Had we left it to the short campaign, we would have failed and Barking would have elected a BNP MP.Labournationally was losing support and we were heading towards the end of the Labour government. So campaigning on national issues in Barking was not our answer.Around the worldLoading...But we understood that all politics starts from the local. People care passionately about what is happening in their immediate environment. They are not interested in the Westminster obsessions; they care about car parking, litter, the siting of a bus stop. National issues are only important to voters if they have a local impact. Between 2006 and 2010, immigration and the lack of affordable housing were the two key national issues my constituents cared about.We focused completely on what mattered to our voters, and I transformed the way I worked. Everything had to help me reconnect with my voters. I stopped attending endless party meetings and town hall events. I focused on connecting with as many voters as I could.This is my three-point plan for standing up to the far right and the billionaire bullies | Sadiq KhanRead moreI wrote directly and often to voters, asking them to coffee mornings and street meetings. I sought their support on local campaigns, such as getting a bus route diverted to a hospital. Communicating directly with people was central to our strategy. Those that came to our coffee afternoons got a decent cup of coffee and chocolate biscuits, and we listened to their concerns; we did not preach our agenda. Listening was fundamental, and at every coffee afternoon some local issue invariably emerged. We then tried to sort out the problem. We acted on what we heard, then we communicated our action back to all the voters we had invited, even if they did not all attend. We created a virtuous circle through communicating, listening, acting and communicating that helped us rebuild trust.We also engaged openly in the difficult issues, including immigration. Not by labelling those with concerns as racist, not by promising to turn back the clock and cut immigration, but by working to understand what was causing the hostility and trying to respond to legitimate concerns. So, for instance, we argued that with so little social housing available, it was right that a family’s connection with a local community should receive some weighting in the rationing of social housing, as well as the family’s housing need. That was contentious with the left, but we wanted to burst the toxic bubble by responding to what people believed created unfairness. And we always made the positive case for immigration and the diversity it brought, for instance by taking inclusive photos on St George’s Day.The vindication for our approach came with the triumph of smashing the BNP,expelling all the BNP councillorsand creating the circumstances that led to the disintegration of that party.Today, social media has undoubtedly played a significant role in the rise of the populist right, enabling those with extreme political beliefs to find communities of like-minded people who will amplify the hatred and launder it through disinformation and lies.But the current obsession with social media as a channel for political communication should not blind us to the dictum of the great US Democratic politician Tip O’Neillthat “all politics are local”. I hope current politicians and communities, facing the challenge online and on the streets, can draw from our experiences in 2010. It is possible, indeed it is necessary, to channel voters’ concerns into mainstream political discourse; to stop communities being infected with hatred and lies.Margaret Hodge is a life peer and was the MP for Barking, east London, for 30 years"

Eventually must come acceptanceGet ourafternoon election email,free appordaily news podcastThu 3 Apr 2025 23.42 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 01.38 EDTShareDonald Trump’s announcement of a “liberation day”, involving the imposition of tariffs on almost every country in the world, is one of a series of measures which call for an urgent reorientation of Australia’s economic and foreign policy. It is, in effect, a commitment to remove the United States from the global economy, which is seen by Trump as unfair and exploitative of Americans.The 10% tariff imposed on Australian exports is not of great concern in itself. The US is only our fifth-largest export market and would be ranked even lower by measures that aggregated the EU and Asean trading blocs. Moreover, the inevitable retaliation by other countries against US exports, particularly in agriculture, will remove a major competitor for Australian exports.Global markets in turmoil as Trump tariffs wipe $2.5tn off Wall StreetRead moreThere will be much bigger effects from further rounds of escalation. In Trump’s first term, when his presidency was seen as an aberration, EU retaliation was limited to symbolic measures directed at Trump supporters, such as tariffs on Kentucky bourbon. These have been threatened again. But now it is America rather than Trump alone that is seen as an enemy by Europeans, a sentiment increasingly reciprocated by Trump’s Republican supporters.And with Trump now announcing plans for a third term (and implicitly a presidency for life), the idea of waiting him out has ceased to be meaningful. Instead, the EU is looking at invoking its anti-coercion mechanism, initially developed in response to China’s ill-fated experiment in “wolf warrior” trade policy. That would hit the US where it hurts, in digital and financial services, leading to yet further retaliation.American withdrawal from the global economy goes far beyond tariff policy. The US has withdrawn from a wide range of international organisations and treaties, abandoned international development aid and cancelled scientific research funding for joint projects in Australia and other countries. The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and even the United Nations could meet the same fate. In any case, the continued location of these bodies in the US seems increasingly untenable, as the country slides from semi-democracy into autocracy.Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s domestic policies, including the assault on universities and the rejection of medical science, are setting a course for long-term economic decline. Whereas the US has traditionally attracted the best and brightest researchers from around the world, the direction is now reversing. Although the idea of emigration is an illusion for most Americans, scientists fleeing the regime will find a warm welcome in many places, just as the US welcomed a similar wave of scientific émigrés from Germany in the 1930s.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterBut there is no sign that any of this is deterring Trump, or his supporters. Although Republicans have suffered some modest electoral reverses recently, Trump’s approval ratings are still higher than those of his departing predecessor, Joe Biden. The idea that America should stand alone, while dictating terms to “lesser breeds without the law”,seems to have strong appeal.The closest recent parallel to Trump’s liberation day rhetoric is the North KoreanJucheideology. Although hard to translate, it is often rendered in English as “self-reliance”, “autonomy” and “independence”. Economists use the term “autarky”. Unlike in North Korea, a shift to autarky will not reduce the US to miserable poverty. A withdrawal from the global economy will produce a short-run recession and long-run stagnation in the US, but not necessarily an economic collapse.Trump’s ‘idiotic’ and flawed tariff calculations stun economistsRead moreHow should Australia respond to these developments? Unsurprisingly, the initial response has been denial, followed by (notably unsuccessful) bargaining. We are now beginning to see anger and depression, as the reality of the situation sinks in.Acceptance will come with the recognition that the US is no longer part of our economic and geopolitical future. This creates an opportunity to finally engage fully with our region and become, politically and economically as well as geographically, an Asian nation. The crucial steps here are to seek membership of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and to find a balance between the would-be hegemons of our region, the US and China. This can’t be done until we abandon both the idea that the US is a friend, and the alliances inherited from the era when this was true.Breaking with the US will be painful in all sorts of ways. But the break is coming whether we like it or not. Rather than pretending that the return of US democracy is just around the corner, we should welcome the opportunities of becoming a full participant in the most dynamic region in the global economy.John Quiggin is a professor at the University of Queensland’s school of economicsExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionAustralian economyInternational tradeTrump administrationTrump tariffscommentShareReuse this content"

The creator and star-studded cast of Black Mirror talk about why this season is the most moving and vulnerable yetFri 4 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTShareCharlie Brooker has been contemplating the passing of time, and he’s not happy about it. We’re on set at Shepperton for USS Callister: Into Infinity, the sequel to the 2017 space opera from his terrifying tech anthology Black Mirror. “The cast don’t seem to have aged at all,” he grumbles, “whereas I am a wizened old gentleman.”There is a more reflective, almost nostalgic tone to this seventh season. The episode Plaything flashes back to Brooker’s early years as a gaming journalist in a Bandersnatch-adjacent slice of computer-induced madness; Eulogy immerses Paul Giamatti in his memories as he literally enters decades-old photos; gaslighting parable Bête Noire forces Siena Kelly’s chocolatier to reckon with youthful misdemeanours; Hotel Reverie starsEmma Corrinas a 1940s matinee idol falling forIssa Rae’s modern film star, who plays her white, male love interest in an AI remake of a vintage romance.“Quite a lot of the technology is being used to relive things or bring them back into the present,” concedes Brooker. “It wasn’t conscious, but then I have a lot more past than future. There’s probably more social commentary and more emotive or vulnerable episodes. That doesn’t mean we don’t go to disturbing places or deliver those chills, but people come toBlack Mirrorexpecting to be surprised, so you can’t give them exactly what they want. I’d say there’s a little less dystopia. If you want that, there’s a 24-hour panel showing it calledyour window. You don’t necessarily want to see something saying: things are going to get worse.”View image in fullscreenBridge work … (from left) Billy Magnussen, Osy Ikhile, Paul G Raymond, Cristin Milioti and Milanka Brooks in USS Callister: Into Infinity.Photograph: Nick Wall/NetflixBrooker, fed up with Zoom (him) and Roblox (his sons, now 13 and 11) during the pandemic, opted to sideline tech in favour of other genres for season six, notably the bleak horror of Mazey Day, Demon 79 and Loch Henry. This year brings a return to what Brooker terms “trad” Black Mirror: the science that could yet come to define our lives.Nowhere is this clearer than in Common People, an allegory of private healthcare and the concept of “enshittification”. Chris O’Dowd agrees to revolutionary, life-saving treatment for his wife (Rashida Jones) but, over time, the excessive price tag leaves them in penury even as the aftercare gets shoddier and Jones becomes a walking pop-up ad. Likewise, USS Callister: Into Infinity. Thefirstepisodesaw sad-sack coding genius Robert Daly (Jesse Plemons) use his co-workers’ DNA to trap their clones in his multiplayer game Infinity, where he could torment and abuse them at will. Following a revolt led by both real and virtual versions of Cristin Milioti’s programmer Nanette and, more reluctantly, the avatar of toxic CEO Walton (Jimmi Simpson), Daly was killed and the cloned crew ventured into a universe that, we now discover, isn’t the paradise they imagined.“They’re in a minute-by-minute scrap for survival,” reveals Brooker. “Everyone else there is a player in a game who will idly blow your head off if they see you, whereas the clones can bleed and die.”While Plemons’s absence is felt on the set of the Callister’s bridge, consolation comes in the shape of Simpson, filthy, hirsute and gamely rocking a loincloth exposing both real buttock and prosthetic scrotum. Back in his trailer, fully clothed and cleaned up, Simpson is delighted by the effect. “It made sense because Walton has been stripped of everything. He’s a buffoon, so throw in some bullocks [sic] and lock that giggle in. I’m here for whatever sight gag they want. I’d be a short-order cook for Charlie if that would make him happy.”Simpson’s devotion is shared by Milioti, whose plans for a Callister reprise with Brooker were derailed by Covid, strikes and schedule clashes. In the interim, her performance as the fabulously monstrous Sofia Falcone in The Penguin has made her a star. “I filmed this two weeks after wrapping The Penguin, so it felt like being ricocheted into a whole new world,” she says. “Sofia and Nanette – both of her! – certainly felt very different to embody.”View image in fullscreenClone wars … Jimmi Simpson and Cristin Milioti in USS Callister: Into Infinity.Photograph: Nick Wall/NetflixInto Infinity’s aesthetic is now more inspired by theStar Trek of JJ Abramsthan the Shatner era of Big Acting and sexual objectification that was the touchstone of the original episode. Everything is a little shinier. An LED wall has replaced green screen for the ship’s windows, enabling the actors to respond to images in real time as they flash up. The teleporters glow, the controls are responsive (dials can be twiddled, joysticks grabbed and levers thrust forward for that hyperwarp effect) and the sliding doors really do go whoosh – at least when Milioti’s around.“It is an incredible feeling to experience your own brain being tricked,” she says, laughing. “There’s something about a 3D-printed space laser that immediately makes you eight years old again. It’s so difficult to not make the sound, so I did. Constantly.”Black Mirror has always sprinkled Easter eggs liberally around its many worlds (Into Infinity includes a news ticker update on Michael Callow, Rory Kinnear’s PM whose porcine intercourse launched the show with a bang in 2011), but until now has never repeated itself. Brooker, whose only returning character of note has been the antithesis of evolution,Philomena Cunk, responds to the charge with mock incredulity – “we’ve never repeated ourselves before, so it’s actually a very new thing to do …” – but writing the crew’s further adventures proved irresistible after the first episode’s cliffhanger.USS Callister is the only Black Mirror so far seen by Brooker’s sons, after he belatedly realised this “relatively benign” instalment was in fact “pouring nightmare fuel into their brains”. It also aired just as news of Harvey Weinstein’s abuse broke, making it one of Brooker’s most prescient episodes in its exposure of incel culture in gaming and beyond.“We flip the toxicity discussion in this episode,” says Brooker’s fellow executive Jessica Rhoades. “There’s a scene where a character, who sees themselves as a nice person, cannot contemplate another version of themselves. It speaks to nice-guy culture with a real understanding of someone’s isolation, while also asking: why should your loneliness and anger dictate what happens to my body? But that’s a little more in the background this time.”Simpson, a lapsed gamer, has form in cerebral futurology withWestworldand Apple TV+’sDark Matter. “I will never tire of doing sci-fi,” he says. “Anything can happen and it’s all relevant. In Callister, Charlie’s looking at what it means to be you: whether we’re defined by how we treat others, their perceptions of us or by something like a soul.”“What would it mean to have a complete copy of you running around this universe?” adds Brooker. “Are they experiencing real emotion? Do they deserve our empathy? We’ll be dealing with that more and more as AI gets more sophisticated. We already project a lot on to it and there’ll come a point, presumably, where it will qualify as a living thing.”Milioti sounds a note of caution. “We’ve made so much art warning ourselves about what could happen, and now it’s happening. I understand the benefits of some AI but, because it’s been designed by us, it will be flawed like us. Sometimes that means it comes up with a stupid summary of a movie. At other times, will it want to destroy in the way we want to destroy? I don’t understand why you would want to introduce this into the world when we still have ancient animal brains. It makes me really anxious, the idea of creating content at all costs and profit being more important than people.”Does Into Infinity place the blame for this age of anxiety at the feet of tech bros? From Musk to Bezos, they certainly seem to share Daly’s petty grievances and Walton’s venal avarice.“There’s definitely an element of that,” agrees Brooker. “But it’s just big business and the age-old thing of money and power corrupting. The optimistic part of me, which is admittedly undeveloped, would like to think people don’t go into things with malevolent intentions. And it frustrates me when people describe the show as a warning about the use of technology because the technology is neutral. It might be misused, but it might also be something that gets us out of this fucking mess. You can’t put the genie back in the bottle, so it’s about dealing with a new set of circumstances. We just can’t lose people from the equation.”As a family man, Brooker – “the most empathetic father I’ve ever seen,” reckons Rhoades – has some extra skin in the game. “If I play my hand too overtly, my sons will get all secretive about this stuff,” he shrugs. “Luckily, they haven’t got bogged down in the Andrew Tate world of algorithms spewing up shit, but I do worry about them sitting there in front of YouTube and then before you know it …” He grimaces. “I’ve installed all the parental controls you can, but it’s more that I’m struggling to keep up with the weird things they’ll come out with. [Bizarre YouTube animation] Skibidi Toilet is their pop music, their equivalent of ‘Turn that noise down!’ I’d have been into that at their age, I reckon.”It could be worse. They could be back watching their dad’s handiwork. “When one of my sons was about six, he came back from school and said: ‘Dad, do you do a show called Black Mirror?’ And I went: ‘Yeeeees … What do you think happens in Black Mirror?’ He said: ‘Is it where a man loves a pig?’ And I thought: ‘Oh, Christ …’”Season seven of Black Mirror is on Netflix on10 April.Explore more on these topicsBlack MirrorCharlie BrookerScience fiction TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 2019, he settledin a 17th-century farmhouse in the Pays d’Auge countryside, south of Deauville, Normandy.The 2020 lockdown led him to produce a continuous 90-metre frieze of iPad paintings inspiredby the Bayeux tapestrynearby.

This was sometimes a criticism. InFrance, though, Hockney found a tradition of other painters giving an enchanting view of the world: Matisse, Bonnard, and his neighbour in Normandy, Claude Monet.”View image in fullscreenPortrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), 1972.Photograph: Jenni Carter/David Hockney, ©Art Gallery of New South WalesYet an exhibition of the size and scale of David Hockney 25 can only in part be explained by mutual admiration. For the show, Fondation Louis Vuitton is loaning works from museums around the world – signature paintings such as A Bigger Splash and Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy from the Tate, and the panoramic A Bigger Grand Canyon from the National Gallery of Australia – creating transport and insurance costs that would be hard for other institutions to shoulder.The Gehry-designed private museum, sponsored by the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH and headed by one of the world’s richest people, Bernard Arnault, opened in Bois de Boulogne in 2014.“When the Fondation Louis Vuitton hosts a show these days, there is almost no competition”, said Thaddaeus Ropac, an Austrian gallerist. The museum’s most successful show to date, 2016-17’s Icons of ModernArt, drew 1.3 million visitors.View image in fullscreenOne of a series of Hockney’s iPad artworks from 2020.Photograph: David HockneyThe opening of Fondation Louis Vuitton kickstarted a proliferation of similar private exhibition sites, such as the Bourse de Commerce – Pinault Collection, by the billionaire founder of luxury group Kering, François Pinault, which opened in 2021. The Fondation Cartier is setting up a large contemporary art space on the historic Place du Palais-Royal in Paris, right across from the Louvre, that will open to the public in autumn.“Paris has developed in a way I used to think was not possible”, said Ropac, who has galleries in Paris and London and commutes between the two European capitals. “We haven’t seen such a concentration of new museums anywhere else inEurope, or even in the US recently.”Britain remains the largest market for art in Europe by some distance: according to the 2024Art Basel & UBS art market report, France’s estimated share of the previous year’s global art sales was 7% compared with Britain’s 17. But the trend and the ambition are with the French capital.“Paris used to be the art capital of the world in the early 20th century,” said Clément Delépine, the director of Art Basel Paris. “Then we lost that status to London and New York. Now there’s a shared assumption that we can collectively reposition our city.”Explore more on these topicsDavid HockneyPaintingParisFranceArtEuropeFrank GehryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why are their efforts so little known?Kevin Le GendreFri 4 Apr 2025 08.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 12.04 EDTShareThe Ethiopian famine of the early 1980s was one of the defining news stories of the decade, an exposure of the stark divide between developed and developing nations, still referred to at the time as the Third World. It is a received wisdom that the general public in Britain learned about the crisis when shocking images of emaciated men, women and children were shown on BBC news reports. This is not entirely true. In fact, plenty of Rastafarians were already aware of the situation.The east African country was their spiritual home – many in the movement viewed its former emperor Haile Selassie as their messiah – and a place free from the iniquities of the west. “A lot of Rastafarians went to Ethiopia [before they] came to London,” says the musician and campaigner Leon Leiffer. “I knew many of them, and there was a rumour going around that things were really bad because of the drought. We heard it like thatbeforethe mainstream media. And I had the idea to do something to help before we saw anything on the BBC.”Leiffer, a member of the influential reggae vocal harmony groupthe Blackstones, is the great social activist you may never have heard of. He was the driving force behind Brafa (British Reggae Artists Famine Appeal), an ensemble that featured, among others, renowned Jamaican vocalist Dennis Brown, roots heroes Aswad and Janet Kay, the queen of lovers rock, that uniquely British strain of romantic reggae. This month marks the 40th anniversary of the release of the group’s charity single, Let’s Make Africa Green Again, created to raise money for famine relief efforts in Ethiopia at around the same time as another, far more notorious charity single.View image in fullscreenRedemption song … Janet Kay and Ken Parker.Photograph: David Corio“We were always singing about Africa, so we thought: let’s put our money where our mouth is,” Leiffer, a friendly 72-year-old with braided grey hair, says over tea in his front room in Leyton, east London. He had initially decided to stage a concert to raise money for famine relief but finding a venue and sponsorship proved too difficult, so the fallback position was to make a record, the proceeds of which would be sent to Ethiopia via Save the Children. Leiffer, who came as a teenager from Jamaica to Britain and pursued a career in music, duly assembled a team consisting of several Rastafarian artists, such as singer Gene Rondo, drummer Jah Bunny and bassist Elroy Bailey, as well as vocalists including Leiffer’s wife Fay Addison and his Blackstones bandmates Tony Douglas and Ken Kendricks.On the day of the recording I said to everybody: Let go of your ego! Any artist was welcomeThis was very much a grassroots operation, and word spread of the plan to make a charity record at popular community centres such as Roots Pool in Hackney, east London, where, as Leiffer recalls, you were as likely to see reggae royalty such as Dennis Brown as you were a “notorious local gangster”. One musician alerted another, and Brafa soon put together an all-star UK reggae cast.Finding a studio willing to give free session time was a problem, but Leiffer and Rondo lucked out through a chance encounter with Eddy Grant, the innovative Guyanese singer who had had a big hit with Electric Avenue. Grant agreed to lend the group his own east London studio, and with that manna from heaven the project motored forward. Leiffer and Rondo combined lyrics from their previous songs, one of which hailed Africa as “paradise”, and they soon had the tune for Let’s Make Africa Green Again.View image in fullscreenHearing aid … (l-r) Tony Douglas, Trevor Walters, Dennis Brown and Winston Reedy.Photograph: David Corio“On the day of the recording I said to everybody: ‘Let go of your ego!’” recalls Leiffer. “Any artist was welcome, all they had to do was come to the studio and take part. And there were people singing who had never sung on a record before. People walked by, like at carnival time, and we’d say come in, we want you to sing on the chorus. It was anopen house, a special thing. We had all kinds of folk with us. There were over 200 people involved, including local schoolkids.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

As far as Leiffer was concerned, the priority was for everybody, both in the reggae and wider Black British community, to pull together and do their bit regardless of who they were. Needless to say,Band Aidhad captured the world’s attention in November 1984 with Do They Know It’s Christmas? but Leiffer did not feel they were in competition with that song. However, on the vexed issue of the lack of Black British representation in the aforementioned project and its follow-up concert Live Aid – notwithstanding the presence in the latter of pop-jazz star Sade – he has strong views, and believes the argument that reggae artists were simply not big enough to make the bill doesn’t cut any ice.“I’d say Bob Geldof and Midge Ure have good hearts,” says Leiffer. “They did fantastic. But to have Aswad in the international charts, and [lovers rock star] Trevor Walters, Eddy Grant, Janet Kay all enjoying major commercial success and not be involved … They didn’t call us for Live Aid and they didn’t call us for the recording. We had gifted, talented people and we had something to offer, and I think they should have reached out to us. Soon after our record was made, I was coming from the BBC and saw Geldof walking to Radio 1 and I said: ‘Wh’appen Bob?’ He acknowledged me but made no attempt to stop. I got the feeling of a brush-off.”While Black newspapers such as Caribbean Times and The Voice (who had offered up their office, with an all-important fax machine, for practical help), and music magazines such as Black Echoes and Blues & Soul ran features, there was scant coverage in the national press. Leiffer remembers an article “the size of a postage stamp” in the Sun, though he has fond memories of appearing on Janice Long’s Radio 1 show to promote the single.View image in fullscreenTooting their own horn … (l-r) Ruddy Isaacs and Aswad.Photograph: David CorioDespite selling well to reggae fans, the song did not make the national pop chart. Still, Brafa soldiered on and finally was able to hold a benefit concert in Shoreditch Park, east London in May 1986 that featured many of the artists on Let’s Make Africa Green Again. It drew a crowd of more than 10,000 people, raising £8,000. Although one headline called it “Live Aid reggae style”, the event also showcasedBlack British culturein the broadest sense, including appearances by notable sports people such as Olympic sprinter Mike McFarlane and boxer Dennis Andries. The concert countered the largely negative image that clung to Black British youth just a few years after the Brixton and Toxteth riots, which may well have contributed to the mainstream media snub of Brafa.How Live Aid reinvented pop musicRead moreSome recognition did eventually arrive, though. In 2021, the forecourt of the Britannia Leisure Centre on the border of Shoreditch Park wasnamed Brafa Squarein honour of Leiffer and his collective. Today, he is still focused on making music and the Blackstones recently enjoyed radio play on US reggae stations with their single Ting a Ling. Looking back, he feels a sense of achievement in what he, Gene Rondo, who died in 1994, and others did.“We were well received, maybe not on the level of Band Aid, which I understand,” he says. “We could have had more coverage. Of what we did, though, I am hugely proud. I remember the struggle, and all the good times.”Explore more on these topicsReggaeBlack British cultureBand AidfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These so-called “water-cooler moments” were characterised by buzzy chatter, as colleagues chewed over what they’d seen on TV the night before. “Who shot JR?” they asked. “You can’t killeveryoneat a wedding!” they cried. Tissues were passed around because “She got off the plane!.”Today, there are too many streaming apps and too few days in the office for people to catch up in quite the same way. Instead, online forums dedicated to dissecting TV episodes are thriving: on Reddit, more than 776,000 people have joined a subreddit aboutThe White Lotus, while 765,000 discuss everything that happens in Ben Stiller’s dystopian workplace thrillerSeverance. Like colleagues around a cooler, people praise their favourite characters and share theories about what will happen next. Unlike colleagues around a cooler, they also accuse each other of being stupid, bigoted and perverted.There’s no HR here, so who supervises almost a million people as they contribute their opinions – ensuring they stick to strict subreddit rules ranging from “no spoilers” to “no politics”? The answer – a lot of the time – is: Will Smith.No, not that one. Will Smith is a 38-year-old from North Carolina who works for an airline. In his spare time, he also moderates 22 subreddits, including ones for House of the Dragon, The Boys, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, Severance andThe White Lotus. “If I’m moderating it, it’s because I like the show or the movie,” Smith says. “I just want a place to be able to hang out with other nerds and talk about stuff while being respectful to one another.”View image in fullscreenSource of controversy … Miss Huang (Sarah Bock) in Severance.Photograph: Jon Pack/AppleA single episode ofSeverancecan inspire up to 40,000 comments, so Smith spends three to four hours a day moderating. “Some nights we are getting 10m visits on [the Severance] sub and we have six moderators,” Smith says. An auto-moderating bot flags banned terms (such as hate speech, slurs and explicit content) and these comments are placed in a queue that Smith works through as soon as he wakes up. If one user in particular regularly gets flagged, moderators might issue a temporary or permanent ban. People can also get kicked out for spamming. Recently, a user was banned from the Severance subreddit for claiming to have read a leaked script and repeatedly insisting that the cis male protagonist was pregnant.Both The White Lotus and Severance are shows filled to the brim withsymbolism, foreshadowing andhidden Easter eggs, which means a large number of posts on these subreddits are theories. They range from thejaw-droppingly perceptiveto the downright daft. “People get so attached to characters or theories that they want their take to be the correct one, and sometimes that means everyone else has to be wrong,” Smith says. “It’s like having a favourite sports team.”In March, users of the Severance subreddit accused each other of racism. In Severance season two, a new character, Miss Huang, was introduced. Some theorised that she must be the daughter of another character, Gemma Scout, while otherspointed out that“there is no logic or any kind of evidence behind this ‘theory’ other than the fact that both characters are Asian”. In the latest series of The White Lotus, a matriarch butchers the Thai language before briefly speaking it confidently – some claimed she was secretly fluent and actual Thai speakers had to disabuse them of this notion. “Please stop telling Thai speakers they do not know their own language,”one user wrote.During season one of Severance, there was a sense of camaraderie. Now, debates can become more contentiousModerators allow users to have these heated discussions, but have to act when things become uncivil. “Folks can argue back and forth respectfully and the comments and threads can remain up, but once they devolve into personal insults the mods step in,” Smith says. “We like to live by the rule that attacking the post or theory is fine but attacking the person crosses the line.”One of Smith’s fellow mods on the Severance and The White Lotus subreddits is a 45-year-old pharmacy worker from Indiana who asked to be identified only by the initials MC. “As someone who is multiracial with a mother from Japan, the Miss Huang conversation was difficult to navigate,” she says. “Part of being a mod is ensuring my personal feelings don’t cloud my judgment when reviewing the sub, and sometimes you have to let the conversation happen so it won’t crop up again later.”Meanwhile: is it sexist to dislike Severance season two, episode eight because of its reveal about a super-smart female character? Should you be locked up if you’re not sufficiently troubled by the age-gap relationship in The White Lotus season three, episode five? “You can talk about how you think thecharacterin a show is a paedophile,” says Smith. “But if somebody comes through and is like, ‘They’re both of legal age, it doesn’t bother me,’ and somebody replies, ‘Well, you’re a paedophile too then!’, then no.” The debates that crop up are often unpredictable. “You can’t just make rules on day one and think these are going to take care of everything.”For example, The White Lotus subreddit has a “no politics” rule, but this was essentially unenforceable after characters discussed voting for Donald Trump in a recent episode. “I think in those scenarios you have to be flexible with the rules,” Smith says. Moderators try not to alter the rules while a season is still airing, instead taking notes of issues that repeatedly crop up so they can make changes between seasons.View image in fullscreenRadar, Irving’s dog in Severance.Photograph: AppleOf course, TV dramas begetting online drama is not the whole story.

Moderating is unpaid work, so it’s this passion that keeps MC modding for around 30 hours a week, wrapped up in blankets and resting her hand on a cat-shaped wrist rest. “Moderating can be a bit like housekeeping. It has to be done, and usually goes unnoticed until it’s not done. The most rewarding part for me is when someone spontaneously says how much they love a sub.”There are perks with the work: Smith now has industry contacts and has been flown to media events to see exclusive previews of shows. He also recently receivedpromotional merchandisefrom Apple TV+, including a pair of AirPods. While some friends and family initially might have found his commitment to moderating a bit “ridiculous”, things changed after Amazon flew him to London for the second time. “From there on, I think everybody thinks Reddit is the coolest thing ever.”Between the lines: what do White Lotus characters’ book choices tell us?Read moreIt’s likely that moderating will only get more difficult as time goes on: membership of the Severance subreddit has tripled this year while The White Lotus sub has grown from just over 200,000 membersin 2023to its 776,000 now. “During season one [of Severance], there was a sense of camaraderie,” says Daniel Dang, a 27-year-old from California who moderates the Severance subreddit as well as ones for Better Call Saul, True Detective, The White Lotus and more. “Now, with more people trying to crack the show’s secrets, debates can become more contentious, and it’s harder to maintain that same sense of unity.”Dang adds that “quality control” is another issue – fans themselves accuse each other ofposting “dumb” theories. The moderator believes that “smart” shows “often create a sense of intellectual superiority among their audiences” which can lead to “defensiveness, arguments and, unfortunately, a lot of moderation work.”But while it’s now acommon refrainfor people to accuse others of lacking “media literacy”, Dang believes TV subreddits prove the very opposite. “I disagree with that sentiment,” he says. “Discussions around pacing, story structure and character development are common in these communities, which suggests that media literacy is very much alive.”Your office might not have a water cooler – you might not even have an office to grab a drink in – but it’s clear that, nonetheless, water-cooler moments are not dead. The cooler is virtual now, and the conversations happening around it are still very real.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe White LotusRedditSuccessionSeveranceSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We could certainly do with a bit of that now, although to fix our current impasse would probably take more than a love affair between a fated British fighter pilot and a steely American radio operator.View image in fullscreenStairway to heaven … Kaylah Copeland as June and Thomas Dennis as Peter.Photograph: Andrew BillingtonIt is a metaphysical story in which the life of Peter Carter (Thomas Dennis in the David Niven role) hangs on a heavenly court case and the love of June (Kaylah Copeland), whom he meets only after falling from the skies without a parachute. If this stage adaptation does not explain why we should revisit a story so deeply rooted in an era of loss, grief and reconciliation, it is no less intelligent and ambitious for it.In a script loyal to the idiosyncratic original, writer and director Theresa Heskins makes one key intervention. Drawing on a large cast of actor-musicians, she punctuates the production with period songs, the better to capture the mood of melancholy and high spirits experienced by a generation stalked by death while being compelled to live in the moment.That, at least, is the theory. Under Akintayo Akinbode’s musical direction, the players are more sombre than celebratory, the vocals are often muted and even In the Mood has a maudlin air. The songs, though, are well chosen. The sentiments of numbers such as Blue Skies and When the Lights Go On Again fit the story’s theme of hope for better times. “We kiss and the angels sing,” croons Polly Lister, reflecting the blend of earthly and heavenly.The director’s fidelity to the movie includes its switches from Technicolor to monochrome. There is no naked Pan-like goatherd, but there is a foppish French revolutionary official (Michael Hugo) and a stairway to heaven ingeniously suggested by the illuminated spokes of Laura McEwen’s rotating set. What is missing is a sense of purpose. It is a reverential adaptation that emulates the strangeness of the original without striking out with a similar boldness of its own.At theNew Vic, Newcastle-under-Lyme, until 19 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreMichael PowellreviewsShareReuse this content"

Val was playing Alexander’s father, Philip II of Macedon. Oliver wanted the Macedonians to have Celtic accents in contrast to the Greeks, who looked down on the Macedonians, as the English have only too frequently done to neighbours of the UK. We were prepping in Morocco and I had been working for a while with Val on his Irish accent when my 95-year-old mother died and I had to leave for a couple of days for her funeral. During my absence, Val had to go home for a short while. When I returned I opened my hotel room door to find it awash with beautiful white roses. Val had sent them before he left, leaving a note of condolence and both his personal phone numbers so that I might call any time if I needed someone. Such unexpected kindness I have never forgotten.Catherine Charlton, voice coach, St Leonards-on-Sea‘His characterisation would not allow us to look away’His turn as Jim Morrison, under Oliver Stone’s directing, is career-defining. Though the movie has been panned as excessive, Kilmer’s portrayed the mercurial, ambivalent and addictive nature of a since-deified artist. Few actors can do this. We abhorred the self destruction we were seeing, yet Val’s characterisation would not allow us to look away. Bravo,Val Kilmer.Tom Leigh, Missouri, US‘Much more than a heart-throb’A seriously underrated actor, with great range and depth. My favourite role of his is in Spartan, a fabulous David Mamet film. His sometimes laconic method of acting in this movie worked wonders, leaving the audience to ponder and guess what the character knows, feels and what his purpose is. A somewhat fitting epithet to his whole acting career, I think. As in Top Secret, Kill Me Again, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and many others, he delivered great performances, and was so, so much more than a heart-throb.Gaspar Garção, Portalegre, Portugal‘He was brilliant as Jim Morrison’I once met Val Kilmer at Art Basel Miami, while visiting as an MFA graduate. I had gone back to school after a career as a potter so that I could teach at college level, so I was older than many of my classmates in their mid 20s. I casually went up to say hello to him and they wondered how I could be so brazen. He was accompanied by an entourage of his friends who I did not recognise. I told him how much I enjoyed his acting, and relayed the synchronicity of just recently seeing him in Werner Herzog’s Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans as Detective Stevie Pruit. He asked me how I liked it and without thinking I said I wished he had had a bigger role, which was true. But I think he was proud of the role and looked disappointed. I then quickly said how brilliant I thought he was as Jim Morrison, which probably didn’t make it any better.Stephen Hawks, visual artist, Brownsville, Texas, US‘An intellectual stuck in a Batman suit’I was lucky enough to meet Val Kilmer in 2005 through a dear friend when he was starring in The Postman Always Rings Twice in the West End in London. He took me and a friend out for dinner the next evening, with his two children. I remember his children reading the London gossip columns about him out loud – very loudly and hilariously at the table – and he joked and played upset. Later, he and I would have breakfasts at The Wolseley in London (his favourite place for breakfast), and we discussed everything from his role in The Doors, to time and space, to just everything. Val was an intellectual stuck in aBatmansuit – he really didn’t like playing the role. He was very open and strong, sometimes, in his opinions on the world, about Hollywood, about art. He was outspoken, which to me was great, even if it caused him problems sometimes.Jane Spencer, film-maker, Zurich‘Thunderheart is often overlooked’Val Kilmer was an underrated actor, who would probably admit that he sabotaged his career by acquiring a bad reputation on set. I remember him mainly for his role in Thunderheart, a very rare and powerful Hollywood treatment of Native Americans, based on a true story. It is often overlooked when reviewing his career. It’s a tricky role as a self-confident FBI agent uncomfortable with his tribal roots. He is cynically manipulated by his FBI superiors as he navigates an emotional tightrope between his arrogant FBI detachment and growing empathy for the plight of the tribes’ peoples and their traditions. In some ways, the role became a mirror of Kilmer’s own career and personal progression: from a brash, and some might think arrogant and self-assured young actor, who soon gained a bad reputation, to a man who found humility, self-discovery and closure in his tragic final years, leaving behind his own celluloid monument in thehome-movie self-portrait Val.Malcolm, Berlin‘A great portrayal of Doc Holliday’While there have been many great portrayals of Doc Holliday, Val Kilmer’s portrayal in Tombstone has been the hands-down favourite in this household since the movie premiered. It is spooky, watching him slowly die over the course of the movie, while remaining the most dangerous character on the screen.Christopher Dinnes, Austin, Texas, US‘Val Kilmer in Hamlet was a special treat’We saw Val Kilmer perform the title role in Hamlet at the Colorado Shakespeare festival in Boulder during the summer of 1988. The theatre was outdoors on a perfect Colorado summer night under a sky filled with stars. We had friends from Ireland visiting, so my husband prepped an epic picnic to eat on the lawn beforehand. We love to see Shakespeare performed in Boulder, but it was most unusual that a cast included an actor of Val Kilmer’s calibre. It was a special treat for us. Here he was doing a regional production like an everyday Joe. I could hardly breathe. The next morning, our youngest (maybe five years old), who was a huge Kilmer fan, was very eager to hear about his hero. All bright-eyed, he asked about our experience: “So how did you like Omelette?” No family gathering since has ever been complete without bringing up this family lore and talking about the time we saw Val Kilmer play Hamlet in Boulder.Katy, Denver, Colorado, USExplore more on these topicsVal KilmerBatmanTheatreActingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The making of revelatory music film One to OneThe director of One to One: John & Yoko reveals how he was given access to a trove of intimate and family archive material that changes how we see the star coupleKevin MacdonaldFri 4 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTSharePeople are usually at their most interesting when they are in flux – uncertain of the way forward, of what life they ought to build. That was the case withJohn Lennonand Yoko Ono when they arrived in New York in 1971. They were both fleeing England – the recriminations around the Beatles breakup; the terrible misogyny and racism levelled at Ono – but also running towards the optimism and creative excitement of the New York art scene.This is the period I have tried to recreate in my filmOne to One: John & Yoko– using a plethora of previously unheard phone recordings, home movies and archive. It’s an unconventional film in many ways, pitching the viewer headfirst into the life, politics and music of the time without the usual music documentary guardrails. At its heart is the One to One concert that the couple gave at Madison Square Garden in the summer of 1972 – a concert that turned out to be Lennon’s only full-length concert after leaving the Beatles.View image in fullscreenLennon and Ono speak to the press on their arrival at New York’s Kennedy Airport, 1 June 1971.Photograph: Ron Frehm/APDuring this time, Lennon became obsessed with a set of questions: what happened to flower power? Why hadn’t it worked? Why were the youth so apathetic? As an ex-Beatle, how could he use his celebrity to make the world a better place? How could he ever reclaim a private life when most of the world still seemed to think of him as a Beatle?Out of these questions and his interactions with the counterculture figure Jerry Rubin, the Yippies (Youth International party), and a host of activists who were inNew Yorkat the time, Lennon and Ono became a regular fixture at marches and political gatherings. He began to see himself as a troubadour – reporting in song from the streets – and for the only time in his life, briefly embraced the idea of violent revolution as the sole response to the continued bombing of civilians in Vietnam.View image in fullscreenFilm-maker Kevin Macdonald.Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Getty ImagesAt times you feel that Lennon is unsure of himself. He is searching for answers, trying on different personas. He seems willing to talk to anybody and to find interest and inspiration everywhere he looks. There’s an astonishing openness about him that sometimes borders on naivety and makes him deeply sympathetic as a character.When I was first approached about making this film – by the producers Peter Worsley and Alice Webb – I felt unsure whether I should do it. How do you say anything new and interesting about the Beatles? But something changed when I read a quote where Lennon talked about his first impression of America; how he spent most of his time watching TV, and that his image of the country was formed through this medium.I wanted to try to reproduce this impression for an audience using contemporary TV clips. That then fed into a desire to make a formally different film, and I was reminded of one of my favourite films, a documentary about Marlene Dietrich by Maximilian Schell, in which he reconstructed her apartment in a film studio. I thought doing something like that was an interesting way to approach it. Necessity really can be the mother of invention. I think we have ended up making something that is truly sui generis and makes you view Lennon and the Beatles’ legacy differently.View image in fullscreenFlashback … John Lennon and Yoko Ono at Tittenhurst Park, their home in Berkshire, in 1970, the year the Beatles broke up.Photograph: George Konig/ShutterstockWe had to seek the approval of the Lennon estate – in the form ofSean Ono Lennon. I explained what I wanted to do, how this would be an experiential film, not something literal and educational, and he really responded to that. I think as a musician he understands the creative process in the way a lot of estate gatekeepers don’t. He just said: “That sounds like a film my mum would love.”Perhaps the most interesting thing to emerge from the film is Ono, appearing as a much more human, vulnerable character than we usually see. She talks movingly about missing her daughter, Kyoko, who she didn’t see between the ages of eight and 31. The sense of loss permeates the film.View image in fullscreenA still from the film Bed Peace, 1970, directed by Lennon and Ono and shot by Nic Knowland.Photograph: Nic Knowland © 1970 Yoko Ono LennonIt’s not surprising that when Lennon and Ono saw theshocking news report by Geraldo Riveraabout theWillowbrook school on Staten Island for disabled childrenthat they were deeply affected by the sight of these youngsters living in barbaric, almost medieval conditions. The One to One concert was put on for the benefit of these children. Lennon and Ono moved from trying (and largely failing) to change the world through big-P politics and instead effected real, local change in the lives of these forgotten children.Sean’s blessing opened the Lennon/Ono archives for us. What a feast they were. Amazing home movies shot on Portapak – the original home video camera – plus Super 8 family footage and art films they had commissioned.View image in fullscreenThe couple at Butterfly Studios in New York in August 1972.Photograph: Bob GruenHalfway through the edit, the film-maker Simon Hilton, who works intimately with the estate, told me they had found a box of phone recordings from the period I was interested in. I listened to those for hours, transfixed by the intimacy of the conversations; by how different (and yet somehow the same) these two icons were in private from their interviews.One to One: John & Yoko review – fun, fierce, full-blooded portrait of Lennon and OnoRead moreYou’re listening to them talking to someone at an art gallery orLennon’s manager Allen Klein, or to their neighbour – just their everyday life at that moment. It’s not seen from a film-maker or music journalist’s point of view. I think even the most hardened and knowledgeable Beatles fan will be bowled over.In the period covered by the film, you don’t sense any trouble in Lennon and Ono’s relationship. They seem totally devoted, even co-dependent. But we know from books and interviews that trouble was brewing. Their separation in summer 1973 came about indirectly because ofNixon’s re-election the previous November (the pair reconciled in1975). This was a devastating moment for progressives in the US. Everything Lennon, Ono and their friends had done to try to sway public opinion had totally failed.Nixon achieved a landslide, winning 49 of 50 states, and Lennon was left bereft. What had it all been for? In the end, it seems it was this post-election depression that led to him splitting from Ono. The political had become personal.One to One: John and Yoko isin Imax cinemas on 9 and 10 April and is in UK cinemas from 11 April.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsJohn LennonYoko OnoNew YorkThe BeatlesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ahead of their second, they explain how they protected one another amid sudden fame – and how queer love and Davina McCall inspired themFri 4 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Apr 2025 11.21 EDTShareWet Leg’s Rhian Teasdale looks like a pop star from a different era. She walks into a bar in east London wearing a giant, floor-length pale-pink padded coat. She has bleached eyebrows, dip-dyed hair, drawn-on freckles and jewels stuck to her nails and teeth. For a moment, Top of the Pops could be on primetime TV and a copy of Smash Hits in my bag. But then Wet Leg’s story always did feel anachronistic. In 2021, they managed what indie bands don’t often manage any more and became an overnight success. That June, they released their first single, Chaise Longue, a deadpan, perfectly simple and cheerfully daft megahit; they conquered the US and Japan, toured arenas and topped the album charts with their scathing, self-titled debut, scoring two Brit awards and two Grammys.They were still touring that album last summer, supporting Foo Fighters in stadiums. But eventually they found time to make a new one. Trailed by the punchy, indie-sleazy Catch These Fists, Moisturizer otherwise largely ditches their trademark death-stare sarcasm in favour of stompy but soppy love songs. Teasdale lives in London and we are meeting in person, but Hester Chambers, the band’s co-founder and lead guitarist, lives on the Isle of Wight, where Wet Leg met and formed. (Having written their debut alone, this time, they co-wrote with drummer Henry Holmes, guitarist Joshua Mobaraki and bassist Ellis Durand.) Tracking Chambers down will prove a trickier task, but more on that later.Watch the video for Catch These Fists.Today, Teasdale is fresh from getting a tattoo. When we meet, she reveals the new vine-like shapes snaking up the sides of her stomach. “It’s the same artist that did this,” she says, showing me more of her ink. “Which is kind of like a three-headed spider lady. She does loads of elves and mythical beings and swords and wizards.” There has always been something a bit otherworldly about Wet Leg. Their early videos were jokey but unnerving, a creepy hybrid of folklore and pop culture. They appeared at the Brits accompanied by Morris dancers. For Moisturizer’s Aphex-Twin-esque artwork, a goblin-like Teasdale stares at the camera, while Chambers hides her face. Their nails are long, sharp and deadly looking. They are upping the uncanny.But in spring 2021, Wet Leg were just a hopeful guitar band, signed to Domino, with Chaise Longue in their back pocket. What did Teasdale think was going to happen next? “We were completely naive and, in some ways, that was good,” she says. “I just thought we were going to keep on working our regular jobs. Even if you’re quite high up on a festival bill, you can’t support yourself from that alone, especially in a band with five people.”View image in fullscreenTeasdale and Chambers with their two Brit awards in February 2023.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty ImagesWhat actually happened was that Wet Leg toured the world solidly for three years, playing countless festivals – Dave Grohl came out to scream with them at Coachella – and as support for Harry Styles’ global arena tour after he covered their single Wet Dream on BBC Radio 1. Was there any danger of burnout? “I did get homesick a few times,” Teasdale concedes. “I had a couple of emergency flights, where I’d fly home for one day and my partner would cook me dinner and then I’d go again.” What did she want when she got home? “Beans. Cheese and beans on toast.” Luxury! “Sometimes withMarmite,” she sighs, happily.In earlier interviews, Wet Leg sometimes seemed baffled by all the attention. Their interviews could be vague and peppered with in-jokes; it rarely looked as if they were taking themselves seriously. Watching footage of themon the Grammys red carpetshows a distinct clash between the sincerity of a US reporter and two British women gamely giving it a go. Chambers mostly looks alarmed, while Teasdale describes her choice of outfit with a deadpan: “I just wanted to get my bum out.”Being from the Isle of Wight, Teasdale says now: “To find yourself at some weird Grammys afterparty together, it’s just funny. It’s extremely easy to realise how ridiculous everything is, because we’ve known each other from being teenagers.” It is not that they weren’t taking it seriously. “I can’t really speak for the others, but I’ve had so many weird jobs. And whatever weird job I’ve had, something in me does want to try really hard.” What’s the weirdest? “I was a character at a theme park,” she says, a little reluctantly. Go on … “I was this thing called a Squawk Bird, a puppet you have to get inside. You have to make all the sounds.”View image in fullscreenTeasdale and Chambers at Coachella in California in 2023.Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for CoachellaThe theme park was on the Isle of Wight, where three of the band live. After a few days of trying to arrange a chat with Chambers, she asks if she can instead answer my questions by email. Chambers has anxiety. “My initial thought was: ‘Sorry, I can’t, I’m too scared,’” she writes. “These past years have been a crash course in learning about myself, and one of those [lessons] is that my social anxiety won’t be therapied away.”Chambers admits that certain aspects of band life can be challenging. “Sometimes I have no idea how I manage to get on the stage,” she writes. “Rhian said to me, feel the fear and do it anyway. That’s helped a lot. We never thought it would get this far, so it wasn’t really a problem before. But now we’re here.” What did getting here feel like? “It was such a weird and unexpected journey [that] I assumed it would be over before we knew it, like a long summer holiday, just riding the wave before it spat us out. I still have that voice saying ‘Don’t get too comfy’, but it’s drowned out a little by the excitement of having made a second record and getting to play some more gigs together.”I ask Teasdale if she feels protective towards Chambers. She isn’t sure. “Yeah? But then I don’t know if it’s because I’m more naive than Hester. Hester is very intelligent, so I think, in our own ways, we’re both protective of each other.”View image in fullscreenTheir secret show at the Moth Club in London last month.Photograph: Alice BackhamIn early 2024, having finally finished touring, the band stayed in an Airbnb in Southwold, Suffolk, and started working on the songs that would become Moisturizer. In one not-so-serious interview in summer 2022, they claimed to have already written and finished a second album. “That was a lie,” Teasdale says, serenely. “Everyone was like: ‘Don’t you feel the pressure? Aren’t you scared?’ So we just said we’d done it.”But wasn’t she scared? “Of course,” she says. “There’s that noise in your head that we didn’t have last time. But it’s just not very helpful. And it’s helped so much, having the five of us writing together, because sometimes I’d go down in the morning and be like: ‘I just can’t. I don’t have anything to give today, nothing sounds like music.’ And Ellis would just be like: ‘Don’t worry about it, dude.’”In a sign of how much the music industry has changed, the Airbnb was an extravagance. “Something I’ve learned the hard way is that the more money you chuck at something, the worse it is creatively,” says Teasdale. “The more money you spend on something, the less it becomes yours. That’s a really freeing observation. Just having a good idea is sometimes the strongest …” She catches herself and breaks into a mocking, singsong voice. “A good idea and a pure heart,” she jokes. “Please don’t write that.”View image in fullscreen‘We were completely naive and, in some ways, that was good.’Photograph: Alice BackhamRather than trying to replicate the Chaise Longue formula, Wet Leg simplified everything, shooting for songs that would be fun to play live. As a result, Moisturizer has more muscle than its predecessor. There is a hint of Nine Inch Nails and Post-era Björk; most of its tracks would tear up an indie disco dancefloor.Its subject matter is also more straightforward. There are still a couple of scorching kiss-offs: Catch These Fists is about being chatted up by a sleazy guy (“I just threw up in my mouth / When he just tried to ask me out”), while Mangetout gives short shrift to a “washed-up, irrelevant” enemy, telling him to “get lost forever”. But the record generally steps away from caustic put-downs and radiates romance.Why? Love, of course. Teasdale met her partner at a festival in Portugal, in the thick of the madness, at the end of 2021. It was the first time Wet Leg had played outside the UK. “We were all so excited,” she says. And then? “It was love at first sight. Literally. It was just an energy. It was just like: oh.Ohhh!Because of course I wasn’t looking for love, in any capacity, at all. But that’s what they say, isn’t it? It always comes when you least expect it.”Her partner is non-binary; Teasdale prefers not to reveal their identity. Until that moment, Teasdale had always assumed that she was straight. “It’s not very mysterious,” she says. “The thing with queer love, as well, is that, if you’re female-presenting, people assume you’re best friends.”View image in fullscreen(From left)Henry Holmes, Hester Chambers, Joshua Mobaraki, Ellis Durand and Rhian Teasdale at the Grammys in Los Angeles in February 2024.Photograph: Jason Armond/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesWhen Wet Leg were writing their first album, Teasdale was nursing a broken heart. During the band’s ascent, the ex-boyfriend in question gave an interview to the Sunday Times about how he inspired the songs, which provoked a deserved backlash. “It was pretty shit,” she says, quietly, conscious of widening the conversation to “how often people – especially women – have their work or contributions overshadowed or claimed by others” in all fields, not just music.Teasdale used to be a cynic about love, she explains, and says she had never been able to write a love song before – at least one that was “lusting over a guy. Maybe that was something in my subconscious that was just … very gay,” she laughs. “It just feels so much more empowering to write it about a non-man.” That sense of empowerment has also expanded into their image: Teasdale says she feels far less inclined to cover up these days.How does Teasdale’s love story fit in with what Chambers, who is in a long-term relationship with Mobaraki, has experienced over the past three years? “The theme was pretty prevalent early on in Rhian’s lyrics and it made me really happy to see my friend so happy and in love that she wrote about it,” Chambers says. She points out that she had never written a love song before this record, either, but has also broken that barrier, in a way. “Don’t Speak is a song I wrote as Josh, to me. Does that still count?”The record opens with CPR, a stomping melodrama about falling deep and hard; Jennifer’s Body, named after the cult horror film, is a declaration of obsessive love. “The first time I watched it, I would have been a straight teenager and was just like: ‘Oh, this is a cute film,’” says Teasdale. She has since picked up on its queer subtext. “It’s so funny. I’ve been with my partner for three years now and I’m still having these epiphanies, literally daily.”‘Saying you’re in a jangle-pop band is a red flag’: the Tubs talk speed, squalor and their glorious second albumRead moreThere are odes to domesticity, too, such as the lovely, lilting Davina McCall. “It’s a really soppy love song. Me and my partner were watching Big Brother, and I know she isn’t presenting the new one, but it made me think of watching Big Brother as a teenager, and how iconic she was, and that catchphrase: ‘I’m coming to get you.’” It turns out that McCall was also an early fan of the band. “When we were first starting to play shows, she tagged us in a post and she was at a show with a Wet Leg T-shirt on. We were all obviously super-stoked.”Does McCall know she has a song named after her? “No! I feel like I need to tell her. I feel like that would be the right thing to do.”When I tell McCall, she sends an ecstatic video note about how much she loves the band and how sorry she was that a prior engagement meant she had to turn down their invitation to a secret show last week. “Please invite me again,” she says, “because you’ve made my life. Bearing in mind I’m a 57-year-old woman, I’m not their natural fan, but I think they are ace: really cool, love the lyrics, love the music, love the attitude. They’re fucking amazing.”It is strange to hear Teasdale talk about what excited them all first time around: being tagged by McCall, playing in Europe for the very first time. Given how much Wet Leg exceeded their own wildest expectations, are they having to reconsider what they want from the band? “Going with the flow is part of the ambition,” says Teasdale. “It’s not: ‘What accolades do we want? What slots do we want to have?’ My ambitions, personally, are to just make something that I can look back on and be like: ‘Oh, that was really fun to make, I’m happy with that.’” She adopts a silly voice. “Taking it seriously, but not taking yourself too seriously,” she says, with a grimace. “That classic chestnut.”Having achieved world domination, they are about to find out what happens next. I ask Chambers if she is ready. “We’re heading back into the madness, ready or not,” she replies. “This weird dream just keeps going. I’m down to clown.”Moisturizer is released on 11 July on DominoExplore more on these topicsWet LegIndiePop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

These are the same individuals, former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships. This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion.”Combs previously pleaded not guilty to charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. While the new indictment added no new charges, it described what prosecutors called the “forced labor” that Combs demanded in connection with the 20-year alleged racketeering conspiracy.Prosecutors with the Manhattan US attorney’s office have previously said Combs used his business empire, including his record label, Bad Boy Entertainment, to sexually abuse women between 2004 and 2024.Combs’s alleged abuse included having women take part in recorded sexual performances called “freak offs” with male sex workers, who were sometimes transported across state lines.Marc Agnifilo, Combs’s attorney, has said the freak offs were consensual sexual activity.Combs also faces dozens of civil lawsuits by women and men who accused him of sexual assault and other misconduct. He has denied all wrongdoing.Central to the case is a March 2016 video showing Combs hitting and kicking his then girlfriend,R&B singer Cassie Ventura, in a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Prosecutors contend the assault happened during a so-called freak off. Combs’s lawyers argue the footage was nothing more than a “glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship” between the two.Combs’s lawyers contend the case should never have been brought and are fighting to dismiss a charge involving allegations he transported a male escort across state lines.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsUS crimeRape and sexual assaultNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

However, the transfer order states that the cases “share factual questions arising from allegations that OpenAI and Microsoft used copyrighted works, without consent or compensation, to train their large language models (LLMs) … which underlie defendants’ generative artificial intelligence products” such as OpenAI’sChatGPTand Microsoft’s Copilot.‘A machine-shaped hand’: Read a story from OpenAI’s new creative writing modelRead moreOpenAI had proposed consolidating the cases in northern California. The judicial panel ultimately transferred the cases to the southern district of New York, stating that centralisation would “serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses” and “promote the just and efficient conduct of this litigation”.“Given the novel and complicated nature of the technology, there likely will be overlapping experts” across the cases, read the order. Consolidation will “conserve the resources of the parties, their counsel and the judiciary”.Tech companies have argued that their use of copyrighted works to train AI is permitted under the doctrine of “fair use”, allowing the unauthorised use of copyrighted works under certain circumstances.An OpenAI spokesperson said: “We welcome this development and look forward to making it clear in court that our models are trained on publicly available data, grounded in fair use, and supportive of innovation,” reported Reuters.Steven Lieberman, the attorney representing Daily News, said that the company looks forward to “continuing to prove in New York that Microsoft and OpenAI committed widespread theft of millions of Times and Daily News works”.Many of the prominent authors suing OpenAI have also sued Meta for copyright infringement in its training of AI models. AJanuary court filingby Coates, Silverman and Díaz among others alleged that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg approved the company’s use of a notorious “shadow library”, LibGen, which contains more than 7.5m books.On Thursday, authors gathered outside the Meta offices in London to protest the company’s use of copyrighted books. Placards at the demonstration included “Get the Zuck off our books” and “I’d write a better sign but you’d just steal it”, according totrade magazine the Bookseller.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

So there’s always going to be conflict.”Brosnan and Mirren co-star inRonan Bennett’snew series, MobLand, but said they “didn’t talk about” the Bond franchise during production.In her interview with the Evening Standard, Mirren called Brosnan “one of the nicest people you’ll ever have the pleasure to work with,” and described Daniel Craig, who succeeded him as 007, as a “very lovely gracious person”.Brosnan’s remarks suggest a rethink from his previous position.Speaking in 2015, Brosnan responded to Craig calling his own take on the character as “not as sexist and misogynist” as previous incarnations.“I never thought of him like that,” said Brosnan. “I saw him as a solitary, enigmatic character,” adding that he did concur with Craig’s feeling that 007 was “very fucking lonely”.“I saw him as a fellow who carries a certain amount of pain and angst. Deep down as someone who’s quite troubled, and solitary – [though] Ian Fleming really doesn’t give you a lot to hang your hat on.”Brosnan’s first Bond film, 1995’s GoldenEye, attempted to address the issue directly, with Judi Dench’s M calling him a “sexist, misogynist dinosaur”. The film’s star, however, felt it was merely a “witty line”.“It was for the reintroduction of Bond, having been dormant for six years,” he said, “a good line to be delivered by Dame Judi: funny and telling. But you try to play within the lines and within the stillness of the character – that’s where hopefully you see something of him. The rest is phonetic and kinetic and dynamic and ... fun.”In February, it was announced thatAmazon MGM Studios would form a new joint ventureto control the James Bond intellectual property rights and gain creative control. Previous overseers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli will continue as co-owners.Speaking to Yahoo promoting MobLand, Brosnan said he thought Aaron Taylor-Johnson, his co-star from 2009 film The Greatest, would be “very good” in the role.Explore more on these topicsFilmHelen MirrenPierce BrosnanJames BondGenderShareReuse this content"

It added: “The ‘godfather of freak folk’ was for a prolific half-century the purveyor of an eccentric genius and compassionate wit … There is no other. Friends, family and the music community deeply mourn his loss.”Born in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in 1941, Hurley was the son of an operetta director and travelled the country with him as a child. This itinerant nature continued into young adulthood, when he started out as a musician – hitchhiking one day he was picked up by folklorist Fred Ramsey, who ended up producing his debut album First Songs which was released on the storied US label Folkways in 1964. The label, now Smithsonian Folkways, has paid tribute, writing: “His wit and wild imagination, steadfast through the decades, are a beacon for singers and songwriters seeking to express the joys and fantastical idiosyncrasies of the world.”Hurley spent time in New York’s flourishing folk-revival scene, home to the likes of Bob Dylan, but by his own admission didn’t have the drive to climb the music career ladder. “I didn’t enjoy the process of applying for gigs, that determination to penetrate things, all this trouble you had to go through,”he told the Guardian in 2021. “I preferred playing parties. Little gatherings. Drinking with friends, hopping across the river.”Folk singer Michael Hurley at 80: ‘The way music comes to you, it’s like dreaming’Read moreHe shuttled between jobs and locales – “moccasin maker, carpenter, apple picker, tipi maker” was part of a long list of work he related in 2021 – but continued to put out music, eventually releasing more than 30 albums of material featuring his own cover illustrations (often populated by cartoon wolves). The shaggy, spirited energy of these genial records, backed by small ensembles and spanning straightforward folk as well as bluegrass and folk-rock, inspired numerous artists across US alternative music, from folk-leaning singer-songwriters such as Lucinda Williams and Bonnie “Prince” Billy to alt-rockers such as Yo La Tengo.His most recent album is 2021’s The Time of the Foxgloves, which was a return to original songwriting after 12 years away. He had performed concerts in recent days, in Tennessee and North Carolina.Mike Quinn, founder of No Quarter Records, said that Hurley had “just finished a new album. It was mastered the week before he died, and he was very proud of it (as he should be… it’s outstanding). Hopeful it will see the light of day soon.”Explore more on these topicsFolk musicnewsShareReuse this content"

At Vanity Fair, where Carter took over the editorship in 1992, “the budget had no ceiling. I could send anybody anywhere for as long as I wanted.” For a commission on the collapse of Lloyd’s of London, one Vanity Fair hack ran up expenses of $180,000 – and the piece didn’t run.These are the details most readers will come for and Carter, who at 75 remains a symbol of magazine glamour and excess – a fact somehow vested in the whimsy and extravagance of his comic-book hair – doesn’t short-change us. His years at Vanity Fair entailed as much sucking up to the worlds of Hollywood and fashion as it did publishing great journalism, and this book reminds us that, like all hacks, he is a gossip at heart; casting an eye back on his life, he can’t help but dish the dirt.And thank goodness for that. At the front end of the memoir are some lovely, funny passages about his boyhood in Ottawa and Carter’s early jobs as a manual labourer and on a doomed student magazine. (It remains a curiosity that, unlike some of his fancy English peers atCondé Nast, his roots are modest and suburban, and his fascination with class feels connected to that.) But let’s cut to the chase: what did he really think of Anna Wintour? The Vogue editor is, writes Carter, someone who “tends to greet me either like her long lost friend or like the car attendant”, a woman of such awesome bad manners that, he recalls, she would demand the cheque at a restaurant the minute she finished her food even if her dining companions were still eating. Pioneering magazine editor Clay Felker? A snake. Legendary newspaperman Harry Evans? Also a snake. Like all good memoirs, When the Going Was Good includes a disastrous encounter with Princess Margaret. And there are long, satisfying sections on, for example, the extraordinarily bad behaviour of Hollywood stars trying to crash the Vanity Fair Oscars party. Meanwhile, Carter is so affable, so genial, so disarmingly honest about his own shortcomings – he refers to himself as “a beta male”, who hates negotiating and has to fight “inherent laziness” – you hardly notice the knife going in.His description of Donald Trump as a ‘short-fingered vulgarian’ is a testament to the power of the precisely judged insultSome of the book’s best material derives from the years between Carter quitting his dead-end reporting job at Time and joining Vanity Fair. This was when he and Kurt Andersen set up Spy magazine and, as he puts it, undertook a campaign of “carpet bombing at 25,000 feet” the great and the good of New York. Incredibly, the pair’s description of Donald Trump as a“short-fingered vulgarian”still stands, a testament to the power of the precisely judged insult. There are other delicious moments, including the time they referred to Jill Krementz, the wife of Kurt Vonnegut, as “a champion namedropper”. Carter writes: “Vonnegut called me in a fury. He said that his wife did not namedrop – she simply had a lot of famous friends and liked to talk about them. ‘Let me leave you with this,’ Vonnegut said, ending the call, ‘If you don’t already have cancer, I hope you get it.’”Carter himself isn’t above namedropping, of course, and he retains some tics from Vanity Fair’s more Tatler‑ish side. If a person went to Harvard (a “Harvard alum”, in Carter’s clubby language), you can bet you will hear about it. Someone is “the Boswell of England’s Eton-Oxbridge set”, while someone else was “then married to one of the lower-ranking members of the Tisch family”.A greater irritation is the book’s occasional vibe of old lags reliving their glory days. With yet another account of an overindulged male hack running up a huge hotel bill and skipping off without filing the piece, the larkish tone starts to wear thin. In the late 1990s, Christopher Hitchens staggered, tramp-like, into the Vanity Fair office and Carter sent him to the fashion closet to be refurbished right down to his undies. Yes, the magazine promoted plenty of women, but you have to wonder whether, if Marie Brenner, another star who broke story after story, walked in looking as if she had slept under a bridge, would the editor-in-chief have found it quite so endearing?Then there are the antics of Dominick Dunne, the star crime and society writer of the 1990s, who, despite being “on his way to earning half a million dollars a year”, writes Carter, “wasn’t always easy to get copy out of”. (Dunne would check into the Chateau Marmont hotel for weeks at a time, and his editor, Wayne Lawson, would have to fly to LA from New York to hold his hand and effectively talk the piece out of him.) The rivalry between Dunne, his brother John Gregory, and John’s wife,Joan Didion, meanwhile, was venomous, decades long, and is related in exquisite detail.I couldn’t get enough of this stuff: anecdotes about the subjects of Vanity Fair’s fawning profiles who flew into a rage because of a single perceived insult. For the super-agent Sue Mengers, it was the writer calling her house “modest”. For Tom Wolfe, it was use of the word “spry”. One journalist would turn in 70,000-word “vomit drafts” and expect the editors to whittle them down. And then there was the amazing amount of theft that took place at the Vanity Fair Oscar parties. “I remember catching Adrien Brody trying to smuggle out one of our electrified candle lamps on the tables,” writes Carter. “I said, ‘Adrien, you can’t do that. We had the shades all made up especially.’ He’s a gentleman, and a charming one at that, and still apologises any time I see him.” Some gentleman.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Already this year we have seen the arrival of the seventh mainlineCivilizationgame, the 14th entry in theAssassin’s Creedfranchise, and, most brain-melting of all, the 27thMonster Huntertitle. But look: here’s a magical-realist tale set in a moody, hurricane-ravaged imagining of the American deep south, whose title, crucially, bears no numerical suffix.South of Midnight makes a brilliantly atmospheric first impression. Winds bludgeon flimsy abodes; rain lashes down on tin roofs; the world is rendered with the macabre and crooked details of a Tim Burton film. Within minutes, a house – that of high-school athlete Hazel and her mother, a social worker – is carried away along a roiling flooded river. Playing as Hazel, you give chase, bounding with a lanky teenage gait across various platforms until the storm abates. In its wake lie miles of stagnant, fetid swamps. At one grisly point, you explore a farm stacked with the carcasses of pigs who did not survive the typhoon.As a protagonist, Hazel more than holds her own against this vivid and unusual (for video games, at least) world. With mere flicks of her wrists, connected to which are metaphysical scythe-like blades, Hazel rips through reality itself. For this spunky, determined young woman is a Weaver, adept at magically dispelling unsavoury spirits lurking amid the weeping willows and glinting glass bottle trees of her southern home. As a Weaver, she is able to see an enormous cosmic grand tapestry where myth, reality, time and space collide; peering into the past, she learns of ancestors who helped free slaves and of tragic child deaths.View image in fullscreenVivid and unusual … South of Midnight.Photograph: Xbox Game StudiosSprinting with energy, South of Midnight lays out its imaginative stall: action-packed chapters whisk the player from sweltering bayous to chilly mountains that feel as if they are edging towards Appalachia. The atmosphere is thick – at times, laying it on a little too thick: your friendly guide to this folkloric romp is a gigantic catfish who speaks with a distinct Creole drawl about, among other things, the classic southern dish grits.But in the actual playing, South of Midnight is simply thin. With its mostly linear mix of 3D platforming and melee combat, the game evokes PlayStation 2-era titles. Yet neither element has much personality. The brawling looks stylish, ending with brutal finishing moves in which Hazel unravels her wraith-like enemies’ very fabric of being. Really, it lacks the depth and expressive possibilities of titles such as God of War. Platforming feels floaty until you are vaulting from one conspicuously painted white ledge to another: then it just feels prescriptive and clunky.What great lengths the team of visual artists, sound designers, and scriptwriters at Microsoft-owned studio, CompulsionGames, went to in creating this rugged, earthy place, only to have it undone by gameplay of often mind-numbing smoothness. At various points, you must flee from a nebulous, mist-like entity. But these sequences are so straightforward as to lack any dramatic tension. They repeat many times throughout the game’s approximately 12-hour duration, only increasing a little in difficulty each time.Other loops grate as the hours stack up: clear this area of oozing corrupted matter (a visual manifestation of the land’s pain and trauma); watch another lightly animated flashback. This lovingly illustrated depiction of the south is rich and arresting yet the game is rote.What you’re left with is a game whose best ideas are all optics. The fairytale southern style plays out like a modern, YA take on Toni Morrison’s fiction while summoning some of the whimsical, damaged beauty of 2012’s Beasts of the Southern Wild. The soundtrack is a rambunctious collage of howling blues, twanging folk and lilting jazz. Compulsion Games bottled much southern magic during the making of this seemingly risky gambit for Microsoft, yet failed to take risks where it really mattered: this unique setting deserved more.South of Midnight is released 8 April, £39.99 or GamePass subscriptionExplore more on these topicsGamesXbox series S/XreviewsShareReuse this content"

When he played Mercutio for the RSC in 1995, it began to feel like a“daily execution”, he wrote. That led to a long hiatus from acting – also brought on by alcoholism, bipolar disorder, imprisonment and homelessness. But in taking on this one-man vehicle about the melancholy Dane, he proves – perhaps to himself and certainly to the audience – that Shakespearean performance is his gift too.It could have turned into a circus trick or feat of memory (as it did in the hands of Eddie Izzard) but, instead, the emotional clarity of Lockyer’s performance draws you in. Every character is made distinct, without recourse to broad characterisation. Whenever he is Claudius, Horatio, Hamlet’s father’s ghost or even the guards who see that apparition, he fully embodies each of them.He is especially masterly with pace, creating a gothic tension alongside pools of meditative stillness for soliloquies that tingle on the skin. Lockyer delivers verse with an ease of expression and makes the switches between characters look effortless. It has the bewitching effect of a campfire story. Lockyer’s performance has less playfulness than Andrew Scott’s one-manVanyaand none of the hi-tech gloss of Sarah Snook’s one-womanThe Picture of Dorian Gray, but dazzles just as much.View image in fullscreenShadow-play amplifies the intensity of a moment.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDirector Fiona Laird has edited the text down to 100 minutes, performed straight through, although lights are dimmed at the end of each act while Lockyer wipes his face and sips water, like a boxer preparing for the next round.The transitions from each scene to the next come rapidly, and some moments are lost: there is no dumb show to prick Claudius’s conscience, andHamletis not revisited by his father’s ghost while he is with Gertrude.Lockyer’s Hamlet has an earnest anger but is not brattish or self-indulgent, and he does not camp up the antic disposition. He is something of a romantic too: he foregoes the crude pun on “country matters” with Ophelia and is brought to tears when she hands back his love letters. The set is an empty space in which Tim Mitchell’s lighting design evokes scenes with shafts of light and shadow-play that amplify the intensity of a moment.As breathtaking as the show is, I would love to see Lockyer take on a single Shakespearean role in a production in which the drama takes precedence over the showcasing of a singular and remarkable talent. Because – of course – the play’s the thing.AtWilton’s Music Hall, London, until 12 April.Explore more on these topicsTheatreHamletWilton's Music HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

From the back of the room comes a voice, propelled as much by the convivial brilliance that has lit up the stage for the past half an hour as it apparently is by a couple of Thursday-night beers: “I love you too, mate!”The title of the Los Angeles bandleader and tenor saxophonist’s recent albumFearless Movementpromised much and largely delivered, but when live, its all-in-it-together spirit grows extra legs. As Washington and his band draw out its tracks into giddy, 15-minute jazz extemporisations coloured by P-funk squelch and rowdy hip-hop, their joy at being able to play together is obvious and wonderful.When his father, Rickey, takes the lead on Asha the First, pulling dizzying flurries of notes from his soprano sax over a hook first picked out on a piano at home by his four-year-old granddaughter, Washington sits centre stage, nodding insistently. It’s a similar scene as trombonist Ryan Porter plays a liquid solo on Together, while amid Road to Self (KO), Washington breaks into laughter at the absurd skill powering Brandon Coleman’s keyboard expedition, which sutures G-funk style on to proggy fusion phrasing.View image in fullscreenMonumental grooves … Kamasi Washington and band.Photograph: Kara Thomas/The GuardianWashington’s willingness to cede the floor means that it feels like an event whenever he approaches the mic with sax in hand. During Lesanu he arrives at something dazzling by responding to almost imperceptible tempo shifts plotted by drummer Tony Austin and bassist Joshua Crumbly, the trio eventually clicking in a manner that recalls a rapper finding a cadence that makes a beat feel whole.There is a similar dynamic at play throughout Prologue, where Washington and Austin spin off from its ingenious melody – somehow driving and patient at the same time – before tumbling into a monumental groove that is greeted by raucous cheers from the crowd. “We gonna have some fun?” Washington intones to open the set, but by the end it’s clear he wasn’t asking a question.Explore more on these topicsKamasi WashingtonJazzlive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

During her 1970s childhood, when every adult woman she knows is on a diet, Moss absorbs the message that she must be smart but quiet and amenable; she must be pretty and sylph-like but should never appear vain.Threaded through the narrative are the books of her formative years, by Arthur Ransome, Louisa May Alcott, Sylvia Plath and the Brontës, in which Moss is alert to depictions of women and femininity (her reading was done in secret, since her parents regarded it as a sign of indolence). Moss begins to see her body as a battleground, something over which she must exert control and power. This leads her to obsessively count calories, decline cake at birthday parties (for which she is often congratulated) and, eventually, stop eating altogether.The Scottish actor Morven Christie is the narrator: her reading is measured and reflective, drawing out the forlorn beauty of Moss’s prose. She also inhabits the brutality of the author’s inner voices, which berate her when they suspect her of disingenuousness or self-pity and hiss at her: “Shut up, no one cares.” An eventual diagnosis of anorexia is followed by the prescribed treatment: an instruction to eat more and drink four glasses of milk a day. Little wonder Moss’s illness follows her into adulthood, coming to a head during the pandemic where she becomes severely malnourished and a doctor warns her: “If we do not feed you now, you will die.”Available via Picador, 8hr 28minFurther listeningA Death in the ParishThe Rev Richard Coles, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 8hr25minThe kindly sleuth Canon Daniel Clement investigates another murder in the not-so-sleepy village of Champton.

Even conductor emeritus Vladimir Jurowski’s powers of persuasion couldn’t disguise the fact that Semyon Kotko is second-rate SergeiProkofiev. Set in rural Ukraine, his 1940 opera ran into difficulties from the start: after Stalin and Hitler signed their notorious non-aggression treaty, a drama filled with marauding hordes of German invaders was distinctly on the nose. An orchestral suite was the composer’s way of getting some of it heard, but for all his evident warmth for the Ukrainian countryside (Prokofiev grew up in Donetsk), the inspiration struggles to rise above the commonplace. The most original movement here featured a garish execution sequence with more than a whiff of the firing squad about it.Matthew Rose’s spook-haunted reading of Modest Mussorgsky’s Songs and Dances of Death was in another league, his Stygian bass and razor-sharp diction cutting a swathe through Edison Denisov’s vivid orchestrations. Clad in funereal black, hands drooping at his sides, Rose appeared every inch the grim reaper (though rather glued to his sheet music). With lugubrious visage, he nailed each song, whether crooning a lullaby to dupe the mother of a dying child, cavorting in the snow with a drunken peasant, or trampling on the bones of the fallen.Ukrainian composer Boris Lyatoshynsky’s tempest-tossed third symphony – rarely heard abroad – was written in 1951. Nevertheless, it seems like a wartime work with three turbulent movements capped by a finale with the epithet “Peace shall defeat war”. Jurowski and the LPO’s convincing account ran the gamut from militaristic menace in the alarm-filled opening movement to a nocturnal andante, where rippling flutes over tender violin pizzicatos proved too good to last. The slaughterhouse scherzo juddered along in pitiless waltz time before the finale powered full-pelt to a percussion-fuelled conclusion.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicLondon Philharmonic OrchestraVladimir JurowskireviewsShareReuse this content"

The views were to die for, and in the summer there was still some light at midnight. No frills, but good-quality bathrooms. It was the best campsite we found in Norway and also the cheapest.SarahIn harmony with nature, SloveniaView image in fullscreenCamp Jelinc, SloveniaTucked away on the banks of the Soča River in a remote corner of Slovenia, and surrounded by the dramatic scenery of the Triglav national park,Camp Jelinc(from €10 per adult per day) is a picturesque campsite in a stunning setting that lured me out of my tent in the morning with views of pine forests, glacial lakes and snow-capped mountains. The fast-flowing river outside my pitch had water so brightly turquoise that I couldn’t decide whether to drink it or dive in. There are only a small number of pitches and simple facilities, but I felt totally in harmony with nature during my stay. On Saturdays, hearty Slovenian “soup and song” nights made for beautiful evenings under starry skies.WillProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Though it was difficult to find (a local we asked for directions ended up driving us there as he realised his instructions were too complicated to follow), the immediate peace and beauty we found when we arrived made us forget the journey. Set amid cherry groves, the site has tables right on a riverbank, with views across the lush fields of western Georgia to the towering white wall of the Caucasus beyond. As the sun descended, the host grilledmtsvadi(meat skewers), served with fresh salads, while his brother cycled back from the village bakery with a stack ofmegruli khachapuri(a regional variation of stuffed bread which has cheese inside and on top). Amazing food, the river, the mountains, Georgian hospitality and the prospect of hiking to an 11th-century monastery the next day – I’d love to go back, if I can ever find it again.HenryPizza and pirate play in PortugalView image in fullscreenPhotograph: LucieOne of the highlights of our campervan trip round the coast of Portugal in 2023 was a night at theSalema Eco Camp(adults from €6, tent pitch from €7 a night). It sits almost at the far west corner of the Algarve, which is much quieter and less developed than the better-known areas. You choose your own pitch on the terraced hillside, and then head down to the bar and play area. The pizzas were incredible, and our kids had a blast playing on the pirate ship and making friends with children from all over Europe.LucieKayaking and naval-gazing in SwedenView image in fullscreenThe island city of Karlskrona.Photograph: NiseriN/Getty ImagesDragsö Camping(pitches from £14 a day) in the island city of Karlskrona, Sweden, offers pitches right next to the water. There’s a beach on the site and lots of walks. Rent a bike and cycle into the Unesco heritage city of Karlskrona. Visit the naval museum, where you can go into a submarine and see old naval ships. Or rent a kayak and find your very own beach –Allemansrätten(the right of public access) means there are loads of islands you can explore.AsaPitch amid the pines of Parnassus, GreeceView image in fullscreenThe sanctuary of Apollo and the slopes of Mount Parnassus.Photograph: Zuma Press/AlamyArrive atDelphi Camping(tent pitch for two from €27 a night) at night and pitch your tent under a sky the colour of dark wine among the pines of Mount Parnassus, haunt of the gods. The Kanatas family will serve you pine-scented retsina wine and slabs of creamy goat’s cheese, generously doused in oil harvested from their ancient olive groves. Awake at dawn and wander a dusty mountainside path to the archaeological sites, catching a glimpse of the temples through the trees before the crowds arrive. Return for an early dip in the campsite pool, perched above the Gulf of Corinth, 300 metres below.Emmaskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rented bikes took us along riverside paths to the hydroplane museum in Biscarrosse and over sandy forest hills to the coast. Our daily routine included fresh baguettes from the on-site shop and evening table tennis. As the French holidays began, the campsite came to life, filling up with holidaymakers playing pétanque and football, and zipping around on bikes – our son chatted with some fellow tweens over games of table tennis.BelindaA private beach in Italy’s garden of EdenView image in fullscreenPorto di Portese.Photograph: fotoluk1983/Getty ImagesOur best camping holiday was toCamping Eden(adults from €9 a night, pitch from €16), near Porto di Portese, overlooking Lake Garda in Italy. The pitches were on terraces above the lake, there was a private beach from which we could swim in the lake, and a beautiful small port was a five-minute walk away.SimonFamily-friendly fun in FranceView image in fullscreenSaint Jean de Monts.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyI am a solo parent, and Marvilla Parks’Le Domaine du Clarys(from €80 for four people for two nights) on the west coast of France has become our annual retreat since my daughter was three. The static caravans with decking offer a comfortable blend of camping and convenience – perfect for those who prefer a bit of luxury without the extremes of traditional camping. The parks, water slides and vibrant kids’ club activities provide endless fun for my daughter, and while she attends I savour a few precious hours of calm. She enjoys the fun activities delivered by the young and enthusiastic team, and I go for jogs along the coast, hire a bike to explore nearby towns (like Saint Jean de Monts), enjoy a glass of Provence rosé, or simply unwind with a book by the quiet pool. With friendly fellow travellers and a supermarket nearby, it’s the perfect safe escape for a solo female adventurer.PaulaWinning tip: Dive into Slovenia’s crystal-clear watersView image in fullscreenWe were lucky to get the last pitch atKamp Koren(pitches from €13 per person per night), near Kobarid in Slovenia, when we arrived in August without a reservation. The small pitch, at the top of a terraced hillside with trees for shade and privacy, was perfect for our tent. The campsite is on the banks of the Soča River and it was a short clamber over the rocks to reach the bracing, crystal-clear, green water for a dip. The pretty town of Kobarid has plenty of traditional restaurants, which made a welcome change from campsite cooking.BecsExplore more on these topicsCamping holidaysReaders' travel tipsEurope holidaysTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Which may explain why so much cash has been thrown at the area around the station to turn it into “an aspirational lifestyle destination”, rather than somewhere to stomp through grumpily while dragging a suitcase.By and large, however, this proposed glow-up has failed – the Euston Road will always be an unlovable, multi-laned traffic snarl-up – although now, if you creep intothe Megaro hotel, you’ll find a minimalist Scandi restaurant,Voyage with Adam Simmonds. This plain, dark brown, oak-panelled room sits rather incongruously inside the recently restyled Megaro, which now has a Britpop, Austin Powers-esque, rock’n’roll theme and suites boasting names such asGroove Britanniaand Pop Diva; Backstage Britannia comes complete with acid smiley face pillows.View image in fullscreenVoyage’s veal sweetbread comes ‘perched on a delicate plinth of kohlrabi’.If the Megaro is a celebration of the 1990s London party scene, however, Voyage is a post-party detox in Gällivare, Sweden. Dinner is a five- or seven-course tasting menu of painstakingly prepped gastronomical visions.Take our first course, named simply “Oyster”. One word, no clues. Fancy, Scandi-influenced menus – and I have seen many – never reveal what you’re ordering, although the portion sizes are almost guaranteed to be minute, as if they’re designed to feed psychic hamsters. That “Oyster”, by the way, turned out to be something very delicious indeed: a bivalve mollusc from France with teeny-tiny flecks of compressed granny smith apple, white asparagus, wood sorrel and tapioca pearls, which a flurry of chefs in the open kitchen assembled meticulously with tweezers.Similarly, when Voyage’s menu reads “Sweetbread”, you can expect a single veal sweetbread perched on a delicate plinth of kohlrabi served two ways – raw and salt-baked – with a dash of onion puree, a pied mouton mushroom and a whisper of chicken jus in its yellow mustard seed sauce. Voyage’s journey might, to some diners, feel like a trip to a weight-loss camp, although admittedly we were on several occasions offered some good rye bread with whipped butter. Even so, you should expect dinner here to be light and dainty, so on no account take a fine-dining refusenik who will pine for a side of buttered spuds with the “Venison”. That aged venison comes with a slice of salt-baked beetroot, another slice of raw beetroot and a puree of spinach, parsley and juniper.View image in fullscreen‘Light and dainty’: Voyage’s aged venison with beetroot two ways and a puree of spinach, parsley and juniper.Photograph: Beca B Jones/The GuardianAdam Simmonds spent his formative years atLe Manoir aux Quat’ Saisons, so his style was always heading towards the precise, refined, faultless and crisp. Voyage feels like a journey through all the various stoves behind which he has stood over a long career – atLe Gavroche,the Ritzand the Halkin, let alonethe LanesboroughandL’Escargot. It takes thousands of hours in hot kitchens to cook like Simmonds does.For me, the highlight of our meal was “Celeriac”, a bowl of cubed, salt-baked, roasted and fermented celeriac with truffle, plus some pieces of shiitake mushroom and walnut, all finished with celeriac broth. Celeriac cooked in five different ways in a single dish is as time-consuming as it sounds, but it’s worth it for this level of vegetarian joy. Also stridently finickety was “Lobster”, in which a forkful of lobster meat sat in a clear broth with some razor clam and squid.Like all fancy hotel restaurants, Voyage’s clientele included several guests who had possibly ambled in hoping for a caesar salad and a side of fries and were now knee-deep in a Noma-style nosh-up. And if the celeriac and the lobster dishes had puzzled them, they hadn’t seen pudding yet. A bowl of pale smears and creams of varying textures eventually revealed itself to be compressed pear infused with tea and kombucha, some koji ice-cream and some chocolate ganache with a few chestnut drops and a hazelnut cream. Not over-sweet and, in fact, by some interpretations of the word, not really dessert at all.View image in fullscreenVoyage’s sea buckthorn dessert.Voyage is not for everyone, sure, but others will love it. The service is warm, knowledgable and determinedly proud of Simmonds’ hard work, and they sent us on our way with delightful rosebud tea bags that had the look and feel of something I might have made atBrownies. These were packed into a homemade envelope, complete with a letter from Simmonds himself, and sealed with wax at the table, as if they were issuing me with a medieval death warrant. None of this, as far as I remember it, felt remotely normal at the time, and the whole experience becomes even weirder in its retelling. Voyage is definitely a trip.Voyage with Adam Simmonds23 Euston Road, London NW1, 020-3146 0222. Open lunch Thurs-Sat, noon-2.30pm, dinner Weds-Sat, 6-9.30pm.

It’s rich and indulgent, which is why I love it. I can be a bit of a brownie purist – no nuts, ever! – but here I make an exception. The biscuit base stays nice and crunchy, while the tangy, salted creme fraiche topping cuts through some of the richness. You can serve this while it’s still warm for something a little more gooey, but it’s much easier to slice if you let it cool completely.Double chocolate brownie tartPrep5 minCook50 min, plus coolingServes12For the base270gbourbonbiscuits80g unsalted butter, meltedFor the filling90g dark chocolate100g unsalted butter2 large eggs90g caster sugar90g dark brown sugar70g plain flour½ tbsp cocoa powder, plus extra for dusting½ tsp espresso powder¼ tsp saltTo top120mldouble creamFlaky sea salt150gcreme fraicheHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and line the base of a 23cm tart tin with baking paper.Finely crush the biscuits in a food processor (or in a food bag with a rolling pin). In a bowl, mix the melted butter into the biscuits until well coated, then tip into the lined tin and use the back of a spoon to press the mix down firmly, going up the sides of the tin, too. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove and leave to cool while you make the filling.Melt the chocolate and butter in a bowl set over (but not touching) a pan of simmering water.Whisk the eggs and sugars in a bowl for a couple of minutes, until slightly paler in colour, then pour in the melted chocolate and stir to combine. Add the flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder and salt, and stir to make a smooth batter. Pour this over the biscuit base in the tin, then bake for 20-25 minutes, until the middle is just set. Take out of the oven and leave to cool completely.To make the topping, lightly beat the cream and a big pinch of salt to very soft peaks, then fold in the creme fraiche and whip again until the mixture thickens. Spoon this on to the tart, then dust with cocoa powder and serve (if you’re having the tart warm, serve the cream on the side).Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotFoodBakingPastryDessertChocolateBiscuitsrecipesShareReuse this content"
