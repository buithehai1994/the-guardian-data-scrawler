Let’s hope he doesn’t regret the heart-to-heart with his sonLucy ManganThu 19 Jun 2025 16.00 EDTShareThe diagnosis around which Heston: My Life With Bipolar revolves is so recent that, when we meet him, the doctors are still adjusting his medication. It was only 18 months ago that police, firefighters and a man with a syringe arrived at his front door to have him sectioned at his wife’s request. “She had to do it,” he says. “Or I wouldn’t be here.” He woke up in what he would learn was a psychiatric hospital and stayed there for two months before returning home with his new medications as one of the 1.3 million people in the UK living with bipolar disorder.Heston isHeston Blumenthal, of course, who made his name as the “molecular gastronomist” who invented snail porridge, bacon-and-egg ice-cream, sardine sorbet and a plethora of other extraordinary dishes that made him and his restaurant the Fat Duck in Bray famous, kickstarted a career as a TV presenter and turned him into a world-renowned brand.The first third or so of the hour-long documentary chronicles him getting used to his diagnosis and wondering how much his hitherto-unsuspected condition – he thought attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder was the reason he “always had something bubbling in his mind”, as the Fat Duck’s head chef, Garrey Dawson, puts it – has shaped his life. It is a condition characterised by mood swings. “The lowest low is terrible and can include suicidality,” explains Dr Trudi Seneviratne of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, while the highs “are terribly high” and can encompass psychotic delusions. But can the element of mania also be responsible for someone’s artistry or creativity? And if so, can it be lost – must it be lost – in the pursuit of mental stability and safety?Blumenthal remembers years of elation without depression: “Like a kid in a sweetshop … ideas rained down.” But from about 2020, the mood swings became more severe and he wrestled with the darker side of his condition. In the lead-up to being sectioned, he hallucinated a gun. “I was inquisitive,” he says. Now he wants to find an equilibrium and consolidate successes rather than seek more. “Can you sit with mediocrity?” says Dr Nick Prior, a psychiatrist with bipolar disorder. Blumenthal thinks he can.He also wants to be “a consistent, loving husband and father”, which leads to a conversation with his son Jack, also a chef, that is one of the most dreadfully honest and painful things I have seen on TV in years. Pent-up emotions pour forth as Jack remembers “just wanting relaxing conversation with our dad and not being allowed to have one … You didn’t want to know anyone’s thoughts. We’d have to hype ourselves up to come and see you … It was horrible and it was constant and there was nothing I could do to help you.” “I’m so sorry,” says a horrified and tearful Blumenthal. “I know,” says Jack. They hug, but it is not the wholehearted catharsis we have been conditioned to expect. It is awful. You can only hope that both men had enough influence over the final cut that its presence doesn’t hurt them more.From there we step into the wider world and a postcode lottery for care. In the UK, you cannot get a bipolar diagnosis from anyone but a psychiatrist. There are 22 such professionals for every 100,000 people in Scotland, 17 in Wales and 16 in south-west England.The figures are indicative of the threadbare support that exists after diagnosis, too. Rebecca McLellan killed herself last year at 24, two years after her diagnosis, having begged for help that never came. Blumenthal meets her mother, Natalie, who shows him footage seemingly of Rebecca not being taken seriously at a crisis care unit. When she was later put on lithium, which requires careful supervision while it replaces previous medications, a further lack of help may have contributed to her death. “Certainly, her suffering could have been less,” says Natalie, who even in her grief is so careful with Blumenthal’s feelings and potential vulnerability that it fills you with awe.This is a standard-format documentary, but with a layer of skin removed. It probably serves the cause well and you hope Blumenthal doesn’t regret it in times to come. It ends on a positive but realistic note. “It’s a process,” says his wife, Melanie, as they look to the future. “But a good one.”Heston: My Life With Bipolar was on BBC Two and is available on BBC iPlayerIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

This could exceed the previous record in recent history, when between 3.3 million and 5.6 million people showed up at the 2017 Women’s March to rally against Trump’s misogynistic rhetoric.View image in fullscreenA No Kings rally in Los Angeles on on 14 June 2025.Photograph: Étienne Laurent/AFP/Getty ImagesMorris estimated the No Kings Day protest turnout in two steps. First, his team gathered data at events for as many locations as possible, defaulting to tallies published in local newspapers. Where that wasn’t available, they relied on estimates from organizers and attenders themselves.To come up with a rough approximation of nationwide numbers, he then estimated the attendance in each unreported protest would be equal to the median of the attendance in places where data did exist. “That’s a tough approximation, but at least an empirical one,” Morris wrote in an email. “We use the median instead of the average to control for outliers, [such as the fact that] big cities pull the average up, but most events are not huge urban protests.”Morris stressed that the Strength in Numbers tally remains unofficial, and he hopes that researchers will “build” on his data when they conduct more studies. But his estimation is similar to that made by Ezra Levin, the co-founder of Indivisible, the progressive non-profit that organized the event. He estimated that 5 million people across the globe took to the streets.If 1.8% of the US adult population showed up to protest, it sends a signal to other people that you can stand up, tooOmar WasowNot everyone is ready to call it the biggest protest ever. Jeremy Pressman of the Crowd Counting Consortium, a joint Harvard University/University of Connecticut project that estimates political crowds,toldUSA Today it would take “some time” to get an official tally.Meanwhile Steven Cheung, Trump’s director of communications, unsurprisinglycalledthe protests “a complete and utter failure with miniscule attendance” on X. (No Kings took place on Donald Trump’s birthday, which coincided witha paradethe president threw in celebration of the US army’s 250th anniversary.)Omar Wasow, an assistant professor in UC Berkeley’s department of political science, told the Guardian that the demonstration was “without question, among the largest single-day protests in history”.Map of the USA, showing blue dots of all locations protests took placeWasow compared protest movements to standing ovations given at a theater. “We see a cascade effect: if one person stands after the curtain drops, then more follow,” he said. “If 1.8% of the US adult population showed up to protest on Saturday, those are the people who stood up to clap first. It sends a signal to all these other people that you can stand up, too.”The 1963 March on Washington, where Dr Martin Luther King Jr made his famous “I have a dream” speech was at the time one of the largest protests in history, with up to a half a million people in attendance. It was dwarfed in size by the first Earth Day protests in 1970, in which 20 million people helped spark the creation of the Environmental Protection Act. “At the time this was about 10% of the US population, possibly the largest we will ever realistically see – unless the political environment deteriorates significantly, prompting more backlash,” Morris said.View image in fullscreenMartin Luther King Jr on 28 August 1963 in Washington DC.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesIn 1986 at the Hands Across America fundraiser, anestimated5 million Americans formed a human chain to raise money to fight hunger and homelessness (each person was asked to donate $10, though many participants didn’t end up paying and the politics of the Coca-Cola-sponsored event were murky). More than a million people took to the streets in 2006 for aboycottcalled “A Day Without Immigrants” in protest of stricter immigration laws. Polls taken during thesummer of 2020found that between 15 and 26 million Americans protested against the murder of George Floyd during the month of June (though day-by-day numbers were smaller).Gloria J Browne-Marshall, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and author of AProtestHistory of the United States, said that it was difficult to compare crowd sizes for various protests, especially ones that take place over the course of several days and span various locations. “There are different processes that have been used over the years, from eyeballing things to actually counting the number of people per square mile,” she said.‘No Kings’ protests stir US as Trump celebrates birthday with military parade – in picturesRead moreIn the days following No Kings, an idea put forth by the political scientists Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan called the 3.5% rulespurredsocial media discussion. Chenoweth, a Harvard professor and Stephan, a political scientist who covers nonviolent movements, studied 323 revolutionary campaigns around the world that took place from 1900 to 2006. They found that all nonviolent movements that had the support of at least 3.5% of a population always succeeded in triggering change. No Kings, with its massive turnout, could be seen as a turning point.There are caveats to this rule, which was published in the team’s 2011 book Why Civil Resistance Works. “The 3.5% rule is descriptive, not prescriptive – and has been revised significantly since being originally published to allow for exceptions,” Morris wrote. “Chenoweth now is clear that hitting 3.5% does not guarantee success, especially in political regimes where change is harder, and that movements can accomplish their goals with much smaller mobilization, through things like media coverage and alliances with elites.”Organizers and attenders of No Kings feel invigorated enough to continue the demonstrations, with another round of coordinated protests to fall on 17 July, the fifth anniversary of the death of John Lewis, the congressman and civil rights leader.But they admit there are limits to these events. “We’re not going to win if a lot of people show up at a protest one day,” Levin said. “We need people actually taking democracy seriously, and that’s not going to be done through a top-down action. It has to be done from the bottom-up. When pro-democracy movements succeed, it’s because of a broad-based, ideological, diverse, geographically-dispersed, grassroots organizing – not just mobilizing.”This article was amended on 19 June 2025 to clarify that G Elliott Morris used the median, not the medium, to approximate nationwide protest numbers.Explore more on these topicsUS newsProtestUS politicsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If it was up to Priti Patel, the UK would already be at war with Iran. In a former life as international development secretary, Priti got herself fired forfreelancing foreign policy on Israel. Now, as shadow foreign secretary, she’s at it again. Old habits die hard.Out and about on the morning media round, Priti was volunteering to personally fly the US stealth bombers deep into Iran. To ride the Massive Ordnance Penetrator – the Americans are nothing if not relentlessly macho – bombs deep into the nuclear facility at Fordow. Her very own last-chance power drive.In her defence, you have to remember Priti Vacant has no memory of what happened yesterday, let alone 22 years ago. If she did, she might be aware of what can happen when a UK government tries to hedge its bets on legal advice before going to war in the Middle East. That didn’t work out so well for anyone. Arguably, we’re all still paying the price of that George Bush-Tony Blair joint venture.Likewise, she has no insight into likely outcomes in the future. She has less imagination than a tardigrade. She is only capable of living entirely in the present. And a very limited present at that. Unaware that you can’t bomb knowledge. Unaware that even if the bunker-busting bombs did penetrate 80 metres of reinforced concrete and rock, the destruction would only make Iran more likely to develop a nuclear capability in the future.So it’s probably just as well for all of us that we’ve got someone like Keir Starmer as prime minister. A man whose natural instincts are set towards diplomacy and de-escalation. A lawyer who is likely to take theadvice of Richard Hermer, the attorney general, seriously. Who understands that extending a war between Israel and Iran to one that includes the US and the UK is in no one’s best interests. No easy task when you’re dealing with a US president who seems to think he is starring in his own first-person shooter video game. Donald Trump and Priti Vacant have a disturbing amount in common.It’s customary for the prime minister to update the Commons on the meeting of the G7 – or in this case, the G6 and a half – as soon as possible after returning home. But this time Keir thought better of it. Decided he had better things to do than face awkward questions from MPs of all parties on just how close the UK is to getting dragged into another war, and whether we intend to let the Americans use Diego Garcia as a base from which to bomb Iran. To avoid being asked what The Donald might do next. As if anyone had any idea. Even Trumpdoesn’t know what Trump will do next.So in the absence of a statement from the prime minister, we got one from chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, on the government’s 10-year infrastructure strategy. This felt like a rare outbreak of optimism. A cause for national celebration. At a time when many of us can’t be sure we’ll still be alive this time next week with the west on the brink of yet another war, we had Darren to hold our hands. Everything was going to be OK. Even if the world was to turn to rubble, Labour had a plan to put things back together. We might not be around to see it, but everything would be OK eventually.On a practical level, this did have an air of hope over experience. After all, when was the last time the UK completed an infrastructure project on time and on budget? Only on Wednesday, the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, had given yet another update on the fiasco that is HS2. A rail line that is already billions of pounds over budget, does nothing to increase connectivity to the north and won’t be ready until 10 years’ time at the earliest. The French managed to complete a high-speed railway the same length as HS2 in five years. We are still building tunnels through former Conservative constituencies. HS2 is this country’s own Ionesco study of the absurd.Still, nothing ventured, nothing gained and Darren was eager to share his Brave New World with us. And here was the thing. The 10 years had already started. Things were already far, far better than they had been. To be fair, they were for Dazza. No one enjoys being in government more than Darren. He’s been walking around with a rictus permagrin since last July. This is his time. If only we could all be a bit more like Dazza, the better it would be.Easy regime change in Tehran is a nice idea. But look to history: it’s a near-impossible one | Martin KettleRead moreDarren opened our eyes to £725bn of new infrastructure spending. What glories! Treasures the like of which had not been seen since Howard Carter opened Tutankhamun’s tomb. Hospitals, prisons, schools. Railways. Lucky Wales was to get £445m, the same amount as was being given to refurbish Leeds station.All would be rebuilt in Dazza’s own image. And they really would be built. This wasn’t a 10-year plan like so many other 10-year plans that barely survive contact with reality. This was to be a 10-year plan that would last for 100 years. Permanent secretaries might feel like temporary secretaries. Minister may come and go. Governments could fall. But the 10-year plan would remain. As would Darren. Because there would be a new quango. The National Infrastructure and Service Transformational Authority had been born to save us all.There was little argument from the Conservatives’ Richard Fuller about any of this. Then, there was hardly likely to be. He didn’t want to suggest this was all a pipe dream by drawing attention to the fact that the Tories had achieved next to nothing in 14 years. So he just asked which of the projects that the Tories had failed to deliver were being scrapped by Labour.Dazza had no idea. Everything was going to be great. There would be a new level of skills and coordination that didn’t currently exist. “I’m confident in my abilities,” he smirked. That goes down as one of life’s understatements. Darren has yet to find something he doesn’t do better than anyone else. We may have to hold our breath to see what The Donald does next, but Darren was there to reassure us that the future belonged to him.Explore more on these topicsPriti PatelThe politics sketchKeir StarmerForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

How do you rationalise– and, hopefully, enjoy –the fact that your audiences often encounter you as a beacon of beauty, sexuality and eroticism?GeroellheimerPeople can see me in whatever ways they want. As long as what I do brings them joy or helps them think about things, I don’t contemplate how they view me – it’s too abstract. When people share their opinions about me with me, I wonder who they’re talking about, but I go along with it to be polite.How do you move on and decompress after playing such intense roles?mansurzAfter Showgirls and Bound, I had so much residual energy that I ended up going to Greece, cut off some of my hair and released it into the sea. I thought: “This is very Greek.” There was a lot of energy that came with playingDonatella Versace. When I played Nancy Sinatra, I don’t want to say “I channelled her”, but I tapped into her energy. The next thing I knew, I had all these stomach ulcers. I asked her about it. She said: “I’ve had seven or eight of those.” I thought: “Oh my God, really?”View image in fullscreenGina Gershon in her new movie, High Rollers, with Lukas Haas and John Travolta.What do you think of your status as a gay icon?KooooonanI think it’s fabulous. I’m just happy it’s brought so many people so much joy. A lot of women have come up to me and told me how Bound helped them either come out or accept certain things. So that feels nice, you know?Did the Wachowskis invite you to audition for The Matrix?GlozboyThey wanted to doThe Matrixbefore they did Bound, but they needed to prove themselves. Once we started working on Bound, they told me about The Matrix. I said: “That sounds insane – and great.” The storyboards all had my face on, so I naturally assumed I was playing Trinity. Then I guess they fell in love with Carrie-Anne Moss and I didn’t do it. It was kind of heartbreaking.View image in fullscreenGina Gershon as Cristal Connors in Showgirls.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyDid “the joke” of Showgirls go over the rest of the cast’s heads, or were you all on the same page?RjoepenkI was a bigPaul Verhoevenfan. I loved Turkish Delight and Spetters, so I knew it was going to be very heavy and intense. I went deep down into Cristal, thinking I’d be playing Margo instead of Eve [in All About Eve], thinking about Aphrodite. It felt as if I was preparing for a Wagner concert or something. When I walked on to the set, it was a Technicolor pop concert of jewels and feathers. There was a moment when I was hanging on a rope in an S&M outfit, looking down at a load of naked bodies dancing around me, where I had this weird existential moment. I thought: I studied the classics! I wanted to play Medea. I wanted to do Chekhov. How did I get here? I thought: I better be really, really good in this, or else my career is over before it begins. As it turned more campy, I decided not to take things so seriously and thought: the drag queens will love me and want to dress like Cristal on Halloween.Your cameos inCurb Your Enthusiasmwere hilarious. Howhard is it not to laugh?Galdove19Playing Hannah the Horny Hasid, as I like to call her, was some of the most fun I’ve ever had. I had no idea what I was getting into. When they called, I was sitting with [the music producer] Rick Rubin. I said: “I don’t really have time. I’m doing a movie. I’m doing a TV show.” He said: “If there’s only one thing you should do all year, it’s Curb Your Enthusiasm.” When I got on set, I assumed I was playing myself. They said: “No, we want you to play the Hasidic Jew.” Larry [David] said: “Can you think of an accent?” I thought about my waxer, Rochelle – a French-Israeli woman who lived in the Bronx. I always loved her voice, so I just did her. Larry was laughing so hard. Any time you do something that makes Larry laugh, you feel great. But it’s not so great when you’re shooting, because they say: “We have to do it again because you laughed.” But then you just want to make him laugh, because it feels so satisfying to make him break.What was it like working on thetruly absurdFace/Off? If you could swap faces with anyone, who would it be?Bauhaus66I’d like to swap faces with my cat, because he’s so handsome. He’s called Lord Louis. Lord Louis Zuzu the Magnificent. He’s a 28lb [13kg] bundle of handsome love. He’s part African savannah domestic and looks like a lion. I wouldn’t mind having Benicio del Toro’s face; I just saw him in the new Wes Anderson movie [The Phoenician Scheme]. I could watch his face all day long.Did you feel you were on track tobecome a femme fataleafter your guest stint onMelrose Place?Kal_85Can I tell you the only thing I remember about Melrose Place? I was in Toronto with a bunch of people and we went to a strip club, like you do in a weird location. It was pretty tame and actually quite sweet. This dancer came walking down the runway, doing her bit. She looked at me, pointed her finger and went: “Melrose Place!” I thought I was going to die. I’d never been pointed out like that before. I can’t even remember who I played on Melrose Place. Is that terrible?View image in fullscreenGina Gershon in Bound.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyWhat was it like being part of a typically alpha-dogMichael Mannenvironment working on The Insider?leroyhunterI always thought I was too young. I said to Michael at the audition: “I’m too young to be believable. We’re talking about a 40-year-old woman.” She seemedsoancient to me. I thought: should I have grey in my hair? I walked on to set with no makeup, looking like a kid. I remember Al Pacino looking at me, as if to say: “What the fuck? How is she going to play this person?” I said: “Don’t, worry. I’m gonna age up quickly.”My first scene was with the great Christopher Plummer – the scene where he yells at me right in the face. He was so intense. It was the first time I felt: wow, I don’t even really have to act. When you’re working with someone so great, you just stay present and it becomes electric.What was it like ordering amultipleorgasm fromTom CruiseinCocktail?TopTrampI almost broke his nose. I had never done a love scene before and it was going to be with Tom Cruise. I thought: God, I get paid for this. He was so cute. I had a crush on him immediately. He was very protective and very much a gentleman, saying: “Let’s keep you covered.” He was very concerned.View image in fullscreenGershon as Coral in Cocktail.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyOriginally, we were supposed to be running around naked, but I thought: I don’t wanna do that. That seems dumb. I suggested: “Why don’t you go down on me under the covers? Then when you pop up, it’ll be a surprise.” He loved the idea, but I’d told him I was very ticklish, because he had started to tickle me earlier. I said: “Just don’t do that. I lose control because I was tortured as a child by my brother.”Right before the take, he was down there and grabbed my waist in a tickly, sweet manner. I didn’t mean to, but I had a kneejerk reaction right into his nose. It was full of blood. I thought: I just broke Tom Cruise’s nose. I will never work in Hollywood again. I was mortified because I really kicked him good. I didn’t mean to. He said: “Nope. My bad. You warned me.” I remember thinking: this guy is a movie star. He deserves everything he gets. He was just so kind and so sweet with me in a situation where I was quite vulnerable. I’m glad he was my first.High Rollers is on digital platformsExplore more on these topicsFilmFilm & Music reader interviewTelevisionUS televisionThe MatrixCurb Your EnthusiasmTom CruiseLarry DavidShareReuse this content"

Now, in the era of global heating, heatwaves are a warning sign, not a pleasure – and as we enter a UK summer, it’s a case of when, not if, the temperature will become unbearable.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Always take care when it heats up – theNHS recommendsstaying in the shade, especially between 11am and 3pm, wearing sunscreen and hats, and avoiding exercise. It also advises taking showers, eating cold food and drinks, and avoiding alcohol, caffeine and hot drinks.And there are other things that can help. As temperatures soar, we’ve asked experts in hotspots around the world – from Australia to Dubai – about how to cope with the heat. Here’s their advice for everything from waking and dressing to sleeping(yes, it is possible in this heat, we promise).How to keep cool in a heatwaveKeep hydratedView image in fullscreenRecycled stainless steel water bottle£35 at Ryman£35 at Ocean BottleView image in fullscreenInsulated leak-proof water bottleFrom £30 at John Lewis£32 at Chilly’sView image in fullscreenGlass coffee cup and straw£27 at Anthropologie£26.95 at AmazonThe NHS recommendsdrinking six to eight glasses of water a day – the aim being that your pee remains a light straw colour. In a heatwave, you’ll likely need more water, and ideally it’ll be cold to help cool you down.Ocean Bottles are double-wall insulated, made from 65% recycled materials, and the brand collects 11.4kg of plastic from oceans with the sale of each bottle.Chilly’s water bottles claim to keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours – and everyone in your co-working space will thank you for the rubber base that doesn’t “CLANG” every time you take a sip.The NHS technically advises against caffeine in extreme heat, but if it does feel necessary, you can at least go iced with this clear Keep Cup.… andice up your lifeView image in fullscreenLékué ice cube tray£15.75 at John Lewis£19.99 at LakelandView image in fullscreenMonster ice lolly mould£12.99 at John Lewis£12.99 at LakelandWhat better way to keep cool than with frozen water? A dedicated ice box lets you build up a stockpile for hot days – no more wasteful plastic bags of ice from the supermarket. Get the kids involved too with this ice lolly mould, letting them create some inventive flavours and reap the rewards after a few hours in the freezer.Seek out some shadeView image in fullscreenWind-up tilt parasol£53.99 at Robert Dyas£84.99 at John LewisView image in fullscreenRecycled polyester cream carousel parasol£70 at DunelmView image in fullscreenPortable beach tent£95.20 at Holloways of Ludlow£119 at AmazonWhether you’ve got an unforgiving, shadeless south-facing patio or are planning a day in the park or at the beach, you’ll need shade in a heatwave. From a cheerful, adjustable yellow parasol and an all-singing, tilting garden shade to a portable beach canopy, this lot has you covered.Dress to keep coolView image in fullscreenReiss linen midi dress£198 at John Lewis£198 at ReissView image in fullscreenAirism dress£24.90 at UniqloView image in fullscreenMen’s pure linen shirt£45 at M&SView image in fullscreenMen’s Airism white T-shirt£14.90 at UniqloView image in fullscreenRound mini shoulder bag£14.90 at UniqloView image in fullscreenPlan International Denmark tote bag£5.24 at Søstrene GreneAs recommended in ourMother’s Day gift guide. A percentage of the sale of this floral tote goes to Plan International, which helps support girls’ and young women’s rights.Working in an office in the heat and looking even remotely professional can feel impossible – something Elle Australia editor Jessica Bailey knows all too well. Opt for linen, she says. A sleeveless linen dress or a loose-fitting shirt will be your saviour: the lightweight material is known for its breathable properties – the baggier the better for circulation and non-clinginess.Darker colours will help disguise sweat marks – if you’re particularly worried about this, go for polyester or nylon over cotton. Or try a sweat-wicking fabric, such as Uniqlo’s Airism.If you carry a heavy leather handbag, it’s worth swapping for a lightweight cross-body bag or cotton tote. These have longer handles, allowing air to circulate rather than being stickily clamped to your side.Underwear-as-outerwearView image in fullscreenLace trim cami top£20 at NextView image in fullscreenMini slip dress£78 at Free PeopleView image in fullscreenSeersucker stripe boxers£28 for three at John Lewis“The Australian summer can be humid and unforgiving – as such, we learn how to dress for the heat from a young age,” says Elle Australia’s fashion editor, Jordan Boorman. “I lean into vintage-style lingerie silhouettes, wispy camisoles, lace slip dresses and skirts.” Men: feeling brave? Make like Paul Mescal and wear boxers as shorts, as recommended by Peter Bevan in hismen’s summer wardrobe updates.

Hot, sweaty feet equals rubbing and blisters and, as Chloe Mac Donnell wrote in herguide to sandals, no one wants carry a pair of trainers to swap into when they need to walk anywhere farther than the office tea point.This year, as last, sandals are fusing function and comfort with fashion. And for men, slip-on gladiator-style designs with thicker leather straps are everywhere.The best summer shoes: 44 sandals, pumps and trainers for everyoneRead moreUse a face mist and SPFView image in fullscreenVichy spa water£9.50 at Look Fantastic£9.50 at AmazonView image in fullscreenVichy SPF spray£16.13 at Look Fantastic£13.70 at AmazonA face mist can give instant relief in the heat.Dr Raj Arorais a GP and founder of aesthetics clinicThe Face Bible, and she recommends Vichy face mist. “I have used this myself when on holiday or during a heatwave,” she says. “Not only does it cool the skin down but it’s also infused with minerals and antioxidants to soothe the skin and protect the skin’s barrier during hot weather.”Of course, the main thing you need on your skin in a heatwave is a good SPF –Sali Hughes’s roundup of the best sunscreenshas something for everyone. For lightness in the heat, consider Vichy’s Capital Soleil SPF 50 spray with hyaluronic acid from her list.Bring out your fanView image in fullscreenDreo Cruiser tower fan£109.99 with wifi voice control at B&Q£89.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenMorphy Richards portable USB fan£39.99 at B&Q£39.99 at Morphy RichardsAs recommended in ourroundup of the best fansto keep you coolView image in fullscreenJisulife handheld mini fan£18.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenScalloped-edge fan£6.99 at H&MAn electric fan – either for your desk or room – can help with hot and bothered home working and sweaty, sleepless nights.

Not only is it painful, but the irritation makes the skin hot too – not what you need. There are several ways to combat this, and many women fall back on wearing shorts under skirts and dresses: try these M&S slimming shorts, which stay up all day and are so thin and cool that you forget they’re there.For other parts of the body, or if shorts don’t work for you, body image speaker and writer Laura Adlington recommends Megababe Thigh Rescue. “It glides on like a balm and keeps your thighs happy all day. Otherwise, try good old-fashionedbaby powder– it’s cheap as chips and does the trick.”Wear a sun hatView image in fullscreenWomen’s zebra-print bucket hat£19.99 at MangoView image in fullscreenWomen’s wide-brim sun hat£45 at John LewisView image in fullscreenWomen’s oversized summer hat£37 at Asos£37 at & Other StoriesView image in fullscreenMen’s broad-brim hat£25 at M&SView image in fullscreenUnisex Original Pirate Material cap£45 at ScrtThis pop culture cap gets Peter Bevan’s seal of approval in hismen’s summer wardrobe updatesA good hat is your ally in keeping a cool head. We asked the team at the oldest hat shop in the world, London’s Lock & Co Hatters, for their advice. Look for breathable materials such as straw, they said, and wide brims that protect your face and neck from the sun.This M&S packable broad-rim hat is another great option for men looking for something to take on holiday (or not brave enough to wear it on the commute), as it folds down easily. And don’t forget caps.Wide brims are everywhere on the high street this year – the John Lewis hat above has a simple silhouette that will pair with anything, and the black canvas offering from & Other Stories is a much chicer take on last year’s bucket hat trend.Summer runningView image in fullscreenUnisex hydration bag with 1L pouch£24.99 at DecathlonView image in fullscreenThe North Face Summit Run 5L vest£134.99 at SportsShoes£135 at the North FaceAs recommended by Kieran Alger in his guide totrail running essentialsIf a heatwave persists unbroken but you want to continue your exercise streak, Esther Newman, editor ofWomen’s Running magazineand co-host ofthe Women’s Running Podcast, says it is possible, with some adjustment.“If you’re running for longer than 30 minutes, carry water with you – usually twice as much as you would do in the winter,” she says. “Decathlon’s hydration packs do the job for a good price, and enable you to run hands-free.”View image in fullscreenLululemon WundermostNulu high-waist thong£25 at LululemonView image in fullscreenUniqlo Airism boxer briefs£12.90 at UniqloWhen you’re hot and sweaty, moisture-wicking base layers can really help.

Sleep expert James Wilson (AKAThe Sleep Geek) says there are things that can help. “I have clients who swear by the Chilipad topper – it allows you to set the temperature on your side of the bed,” he says. When it comes to fabrics, he says bamboo bedding will help; and for pyjamas, try modal. “Steer clear of all foams – it’s an insulator so will make you feel hotter, even if it claims to keep you cool all night – as well as down and feather, as they’ll make you really hot.”Sleep like a babyView image in fullscreenDigital room thermometer£21.99 at John Lewis£25 at ArgosView image in fullscreenOrganic cotton sleeping bag£34.50 at Natural Baby Shower£24.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenPortable blackout blinds£22.45 at John LewisFrom £24.99 at Tommee TippeeIf the baby’s not sleeping, then no one else is. Hot babies struggle to sleep, but high temperatures are also a health hazard for young children. “Keeping babies cool during a heatwave can feel like an uphill battle, especially when their sleep environment heats up,” says Rosey Davidson, sleep consultant and founder and CEO of Just Chill Baby Sleep. “My top tips are to keep blinds or curtains closed during the day to block out direct sunlight, and dress babies in just a nappy or a super-light layer. TheNHS recommendsyour child’s room be between 16 and 20C – and offers lots of tips on keeping children cool throughout the day.“The GroEgg room thermometer glows different colours to show temperature ranges – ideal for making quick, safe sleepwear decisions at bedtime. A cool muslin sleeping bag is lightweight and breathable, helping babies to sleep safely without the risk of overheating – Aden + Anais does a 1 tog range. And blackout blinds with suction cups, like this Tommee Tippee version, keep nurseries dark and cool by blocking out sunlight – they’re especially helpful for early bedtime routines.”Rhiannon Evans is a journalist and editor who’s covered everything from news and entertainment to lifestyle and parenting for some of the UK’s best titles (and some others too).

But this isn’t about being joyless, it’s about creating a healthy working environment. There are 20 of us in the office, and there’s sugar everywhere. We have free biscuits and a constant rotation of cakes, doughnuts and baked goods that descend on us without warning. It’s so normalised, and if you politely decline, people ask if you’re on a diet.Ruby takes the lead in guilt-tripping. If you say no thanks, she will look at you in disbelief. If you insist on not having a cake for your birthday, she will cajole you until you give in. Ruby loves to bake and she’s always making something, even when there’s no cause for celebration. It’s lovely, but it encourages a constant habit of eating sugar. I also think it puts pressure on everyone else to bring something in.We should let people enjoy their workplace without being backed into a corner by baked goodsNot everyone can or wants to eat sugar. I have a condition that means it doesn’t agree with me. Some people are recovering from eating disorders. And then there are allergies – I don’t want someone collapsing at work because they didn’t know there were hazelnuts in the ganache.I’m not saying we should have no cakes ever, I just think we should stop assuming cake is always welcome. A coffee, a card, time off, or just being acknowledged in a meeting is more meaningful than supermarket eclairs.I joined this company three years ago, a year after Ruby. She is the office baker and I accepted a sponge cake in my first year. But for the last two, I’ve requested no sweet treats and Ruby has listened. But I can tell that not baking me something is killing her. For everyone else, she takes orders.It’s lovely, and I think Ruby brings light into our office, but we should also let people enjoy their workplace without being backed into a corner by baked goods. If someone wants cake? Great, let’s make a spreadsheet with dietary requirements and requests. Homemade is obviously better than shop-bought. But we shouldn’t assume everyone wants a cake. The office shouldn’t be a minefield of sugar.The defence: RubyBringing cakes in shows we care and adds a little joy to the office. I’m not force-feeding anyoneCake makes everything better and that’s why I love giving it to people at work, or for birthdays, for my kids at home … Just everywhere.I’ve always loved baking and when I see the look on someone’s face after I make them a lemon drizzle or red velvet, it makes the slaving away in the kitchen worthwhile. Homemade, shop-bought, gluten-free, it doesn’t matter. It’s not just about the sugar, it’s the gesture. Someone took the time to make something, or stop by the shop to pick something up. Giving and baking are ways of showing that we care.I also just like to bake. It brings people together. I’ve had colleagues open up about their lives over a slice of banana bread. It would be criminal to ban that kind of magic. I totally get that not everyone wants sugar, and that’s fine, but no one’s force-feeding anyone and we’ve all learned how to cater to different diets: we bring gluten-free options and label allergens. I never force cake on anyone, I just express disappointment if they don’t have some.Banning cake completely? That feels like punishing everyone for the desires of a few. Life’s hard enoughBanning cake altogether feels joyless. Amina says I bring light into the office, and I always try. When I first made her a Victoria sponge years ago, she loved it. She ate loads and thanked me profusely. But then she changed her mind and said there’s too much temptation and it’s making us all unhealthy.I hate a sugar crash as much as the next person, so you’ve got to pace it – we do have a lot of sweet treats around us. But that’s no reason to stop making cakes altogether. For the last two years I’ve respected Amina’s right not to eat cake, but I do think baked goods are important to mark moments like birthdays, farewells and tiny personal wins. A slice of Colin the Caterpillar is not just a sugar rush, it’s a signal that we care for each other.Of course we should be mindful of different needs – but banning cake completely? That feels like punishing everyone for the desires of a few. Life’s hard enough. Amina shouldn’t try to take cake away from the rest of us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Anyone who doesn’t want cake can be a grown-up and just say no, leaving everyone else free to enjoy themselves!Mark, 49I sympathise with Amina, but there are solutions that don’t need to go as far as making the office a cake-free zone. Amina could ask Ruby to reduce the amount of times she brings them in; for example, only on birthdays. A little bit of sugar goes a long way.Rebecca, 31People often say they’re excited about the prospect of cake but then take only a very thin slice when it’s offered. So at the end of the working day, there’s still loads left. People are now more cautious about sugary, fatty treats, so I’m sorry to say that I’m with Amina on this one.Derek, 59I agree with Ruby that Amina’s anti-cake stance “joyless”, as no one is force feeding her. But while I support Ruby’s right to continue making cakes for grateful colleagues, she should accept with grace others’ right to say no, rather than looking “disappointed”.Victoria, 39It’s hard enough without the constant temptation of sweet treats. That said, Amina’s a grownup and needs to take responsibility for her own choices. On balance I’m with Ruby, but she needs to take on board that “expressing disappointment” is not OK.Monique, 27Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, should Ruby cool it with the cakes?The poll closes on Wednesday 25 June at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked ifFreddie should have painted the edges of the room, not just the walls87%said yes – Freddie is guilty13%said no – Freddie is innocentExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeFriendshipFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It added that correspondence with Tehran had continued and there was still hope of negotiations.Trump’s decision on whether to join the assault against Iran hinged in part on whether America’s most powerful conventional “bunker buster” bombs would be ableto take out Iran’s most heavily protected nuclear facility, sources familiar with the deliberations said.Israel does not have weapons capable of destroying the Fordow complex, which is buried up to 100 metres below a mountain near the holy city of Qom. Netanyahu and his allies have been encouraging the US to shift from backing Israel’s defence to joining the attack,telling Trumpthat he alone can “finish off” Iran’s nuclear project.Strike plans have been drawn up, but Trump is waiting to see if Tehran will make a last-minute deal to abandon its nuclear programme, sources said.Amid global warnings against further escalation, Europe is pushing for a diplomatic solution to the war. Iran’s foreign minister is travelling to Geneva to meet his British, French and German counterparts on Friday. There have also been offers of mediation from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and regional powers including Oman.On Thursday the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, met his US counterpart, Marco Rubio, at the White House, with the focus on the Middle East.They were joined by the British ambassador, Lord Mandelson, and Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, for the meeting.Lammy said later: “The situation in the Middle East remains perilous. We are determined that Iran must never have a nuclear weapon … we discussed how a deal could avoid a deepening conflict. A window now exists within the next two weeks to achieve a diplomatic solution.”He added: “Now is the time to put a stop to the grave scenes in the Middle East and prevent a regional escalation that would benefit no one.”1:37Iranian missile strike damages Israeli hospital – videoWhen Israel launched the conflict a week ago, Netanyahu described it as a focused operation to halt Iran’s progress towards making a nuclear bomb, but he has been increasingly vocal about his desire for the government in Tehran to fall.On a visit to the Soroka hospital in Beersheba on Thursday, after it was hit by an Iranian missile overnight, Netanyahu said Israel was creating conditions for regime change but that Iranians needed to rise up.Referencing a story from the Bible about the Persian emperor Cyrus the Great liberating Jewish people enslaved in Babylon, Netanyahu told journalists: “Today, a Jewish state is creating the means to liberate the Persian people.”Netanyahu later said the fall of the Iranian regime was for the country’s people to decide. “It could be a result, but it’s not a stated or formal goal that we have,” he told Israeli public broadcaster Kan.Iranians have repeatedly attempted to topple or reform their government over decades, and thousands have paid with their lives or freedom.Many opposition figures, including political prisoners, have rejected the idea that an Israeli war which has already killed hundreds of civilians represents a path to liberation for their country.View image in fullscreenSmoke rising from an Israeli attack in Tehran.Photograph: Majid Asgaripour/ReutersThey have a grim warning in the fate of neighbouring Iraq after US forces toppled Saddam Hussein. His downfall was celebrated by many Iraqis, but was followed by decades of extreme and often sectarian violence which paved the way for the rise of Islamic State.Katz visited Soroka hospital before Netanyahu and effectively called for Khamenei’s assassination. He had earlier said he ordered increased attacks on government targets to undermine the regime.“Khamenei openly declares that he wants Israel destroyed, he personally gives the order to fire on hospitals. He considers the destruction of the state of Israel to be a goal,” Katz told journalists. “Such a man can no longer be allowed to exist.”After its initial focus on military and nuclear sites, Israel recently attacked targets, including the state broadcaster, with no links to the nuclear project, but which Katz described as “symbols of the regime”.View image in fullscreenSmoke billowing from a building at Soroka hospital in Beersheba.Photograph: Maya Levin/AFP/Getty ImagesIran’s early morning hit on Soroka hospital in Beersheba did not cause any serious injuries because all staff and patients were in protected areas, the director, Shlomi Kodesh, said.But images of shattered wards and stunned medics examining the damage caused outrage in Israel.Other missiles landed around Tel Aviv, injuring more than 200 people across the country as a whole, four of them seriously.One hit the base of a skyscraper in Ramat Gan, close to central Tel Aviv and about 200 metres from the city’s diamond exchange.“It was like an atom bomb. An earthquake,” said Asher Adiv, 69, who lives in a nearby block of flats. His mother was an Iranian Jew from Isfahan and Asher grew up speaking Farsi.“The Iranian people should make a revolution, and kick out the ayatollahs,” he said. “We are not just fighting for Israel.

He has to bomb them to finish the nuclear sites.”Khamenei warned on Wednesday that the US would face “irreparable damage” if it shifted from supporting Israel’s defence to an active role in assaults on its territory.Iran’s military has moved missiles to prepare for attacks on US assets if it joins the war, and officials are considering other options to respond to one of the most serious threats since the 1979 revolution that brought the country under the control of clerics.A member of the national security committee in Iran’s parliament, Behnam Saeedi, said Iran could attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz, Reuters reported.

But now, two wars and more than 55,000 people dead, the prime minister is carrying himself as a man of destiny.Increasingly confident of fundamentally redrawing the map of the Middle East, he toyed with the idea of regime change inIran– the leader of a 10 million-strong nation calling on a population almost 10 times bigger to overthrow the clerical regime that has ruled the country since the 1979 revolution.“People ask me – are we targeting the downfall of the regime?” Netanyahu said, talking to the press in a hospital compound strewn with broken glass. “That may be a result, but it’s up to the Iranian people to rise for their freedom. Freedom is never cheap. It’s never free. Freedom requires these subjugated people to rise up, and it’s up to them. But we may create conditions that will help them do it.”If Israeli bombs were to break down the pillars of the Islamic Republic, Netanyahu said it would represent the paying of millennia-old dues, dating back to the liberation of the Jews from captivity in Babylon, by the Cyrus of Persia, the legendary predecessor of the ayatollahs.“I want to tell you that 2,500 years ago, Cyrus the Great, the king of Persia, liberated the Jews. And today, a Jewish state is creating the means to liberate the Persian people,” he said.When Cyrus stormed ancient Babylon, it was by land invasion. There are fewer guarantees that an aerial bombing campaign – not an option for the ancients – can change another country’s leadership in the way favoured by the bombers.So far there are signs that even fervent opponents of the oppressive regime are rallying to its cause in the face of an outside threat. At worst, bombing campaigns can bring monsters to power, as the US bombing of Cambodia helped create the Khmer Rouge.On this occasion, Netanyahu had come to the southern city of Beersheba, on the edge of the Negev desert, to paint Iran’s leaders as monsters for the bombing of the Soroka hospital.“We’re targeting missile sites. They’re targeting a hospital,” he said. “They’re targeting civilians because they’re a criminal regime. They’re the arch-terrorists of the world.”An hour earlier, Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, had stood in the same spot, with the same charred building behind him, and made the same argument, telling Iran’s leaders: “Your crimes against humanity, your war crimes, won’t deter us.”Herzog left without taking questions, nor was Netanyahu challenged with questions over Israel’s relentless destruction of the hospitals and clinics of Gaza, where 2.2 million Palestinians remain trapped under siege conditions some have compared to medieval warfare.Aryeh Myers, a spokesperson for the Israeli Magen David Adom emergency services, argued that there was a critical distinction, pointing to Israeli claims of Hamas strongholds under Gaza’s medical facilities.“The main difference between this hospital is it is a totally civilian hospital,” Myers said, as he helped oversee the evacuation of patients to other hospitals in the region. “There are no tunnels underneath [Soroka] – it’s not housing terrorist headquarters. This hospital is for the civilians who live in the Negev region – whether they are Jewish residents, Muslim residents, whoever it is.“We’ve got a huge Bedouin community that live in this area who are served very much by this hospital. And the fact that this hospital was targeted is a horrendous state of affairs,” he said.International humanitarian law affords strong protections to hospitals, clinics, ambulances, and their staff, who are to be protected at all times. The bar for infringement is set very high.Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, argued that the Iranian missile had been aimed at a nearby Israeli military headquarters and claimed Soroka hospital only suffered “superficial” damage from the blast wave. There was no question the damaged hospital building had been hit directly, however, and the map Araghchi used to illustrate his online claims bore little relation to the actual downtown area of Beersheba.On the other hand, Netanyahu’s claims that he knew all of Israel’s military sites and there was no such site “for miles and miles around” also seemed open to interpretation.The prime minister has a reputation for creativity when it comes to spinning a narrative, especially in this mood, as he surveyed thousands of years of history. Ultimately, he suggested, final liberation for Jews and Persians could depend on another latter-day king far beyond these shores, whose evangelical supporters have also likened to Cyrus the Great.Netanyahu described Donald Trump as a saviour in waiting – “a tremendous friend, a tremendous world leader”, who he praised for “his resolve, his determination, and his clarity”. The message has been consistent for several days now: if Israel is to play the transformative role for the ages that Netanyahu has in mind, it is clearly going to need a lot of help.Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaIrannewsShareReuse this content"

Israel has been able to achieve superiority over Iran’s skies at extraordinary speed, within hours of launching its surprise assault. Its military claimed on Monday to have knocked out 120 Iranian air defence systems through a mixture of air and drone strikes – about a third of Tehran’s pre-war total.In response, Iran’s most effective weapon has been its stock of high-speed ballistic missiles, estimated at about 2,000 by Israel’s Defense Force (IDF) at the outset of hostilities last week. But the heavy targeting by Israel of launch sites in westernIran, in underground bases such as at Kermanshah – coupled with Israel’s grimly effective targeted killing of Iran’s top military commanders – have left Iran struggling to respond militarily and presenting a significant threat.Iran has so far launched more than 400 missiles at Israel, but half, about 200, were launched in the initial retaliatory barrages last Friday. Since Monday the size of its missile barrages has reduced to a maximum of 15 to 20 (including 15 on Thursday afternoon), compared with up to 40 during the weekend, according to a count compiled by a US thinktank, theInstitute for the Study of War. Iran’s ability to manufacture new weapons is also likely to be limited,estimated by the US to be 50 a monthbefore the hostilities broke out.The sheer speed of ballistic missiles makes them dangerous weapons and a number – about 10% – continue to evade Israel’s sophisticated air defences, including a strike on the Soroka Medical Center in the southern city of Beersheba on Thursday that wounded 76. But the munitions mostly do not appear to be effectively targeted at Israel’s military-industrial complex, aside from an attack on the refinery at Haifa in northern Israel on Sunday that led to the shutting down of the facilities there.Intercepting ballistic missiles is primarily the task of Israel’s newest air defence system, Arrow 3, which have a 1,500-mile range and can knock out incoming missiles beyond the Earth’s atmosphere, and its predecessor Arrow 2, though the US has been providing help with a Thaad system and destroyers based in the eastern Mediterranean. Neither Arrow system is cheap – the cost of an Arrow 3 interceptor has been put at $3.5m each, though other estimates suggest a figure of $2m and $1.5m for Arrow 2. The Israeli business newspaper Globes has suggested thatthe total cost to Israel of Arrow interceptorshas been $1bn to $1.5bn since October 2023.A key question, however, is how many interceptors does Israel’s military have available – worries compounded by a report in the Wall Street Journal, which cited an anonymous US official as saying that Israel was running low. Stock levels are kept secret and that Israel, well aware of the Iranian ballistic missile threat, is considered unlikely to have chosen to attack Iran without at least enough interceptors to match its assessment of the likely threat. Nevertheless, sophisticated defensive missiles take time to manufacture, a problem long revealed in Ukraine, where Russia continues to fire more missiles than Kyiv has available air defences.In less than a week, Israel has told allies that it is further ahead in its attack than it expected to be, having killed 21 out of 22 senior military figures in the first 24 hours, and 10 out of 12 nuclear scientists. The country’s jets face almost no air defence threat as they fly over western and central Iran – Israel has so far acknowledged the loss of one drone – meaning they are able to target sites in the country with apparent impunity. Even if Israeli stockpiles of attack missiles run down in the next week or two, and there is no US intervention, its air dominance means it can continue to attack at a slower rate.Iran’s capabilities have been “exposed as inefficient”, concluded the missile analyst Fabian Hinzin a paper for the International Institute of Strategic Studies, while the “Israeli leadership, at least for the time being, [is] accepting the risks of ballistic missile strikes on its population centres”. As Hinz puts it, the “deterrence balance” between the two countries is unravelling – and it may only change back in Tehran’s favour if a suddenly a greater number or higher proportion of its remaining ballistic missiles strike population centres or key sites in Israel. There is no sign of that yet.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelWeapons technologyanalysisShareReuse this content"

We are going through a blitz,” Netanyahu said, referring to the wartime Nazi bombing of Britain in which 43,000 civilians died.“There are people who were killed, families who grieved loved ones, I really appreciate that,” he went on.The Israeli authorities say 24 Israeli civilians have so far been killed. Washington-based human rights activists have estimated the Iranian civilian death toll to be 263.“Each of us bears a personal cost, and my family has not been exempt,” Netanyahu said at the Soroka hospital, which was struck on Thursday morning by an Iranian missile, causing light injuries.“This is the second time that my son Avner has cancelled a wedding due to missile threats. It is a personal cost for his fiancee as well, and I must say that my dear wife is a hero, and she bears a personal cost.”Avner Netanyahu’s wedding was first scheduled for November but was postponed for security reasons. Then it was due to take place on Monday, despite the threat of opposition protests.Reports that the prime minister was going to take a few days off for the event may have contributed to Iran’s complacency on Friday morning when its leadership was taken unawares by Israel’s aerial attack.The Israeli backlash to Netanyahu’s nuptial comments was instant and furious. Anat Angrest, whose son Matan has been held hostage since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, observed that the suffering “didn’t go unnoticed by my family either”.“I have been in the hellish dungeons of Gaza for 622 days now,” Angrest said in a post on the social media platform X.Gilad Kariv, a Knesset member for the Democrats, called Netanyahu a “borderless narcissist”.“I know many families who were not forced to postpone a wedding, but who will now never celebrate the weddings that were once meant to take place,” Kariv said.He was contemptuous of Netanyahu’s claim that his wife, Sara, notorious in Israeli for her expensive tastes, was a hero.“The doctors who leave home for night shifts are the heroes,” Kariv said. “The teachers who keep our children together on Zoom and phone calls are the heroes.”Amir Tibon, an Israeli journalist, argued that public figures whose children had been killed in combat would never draw attention to the fact.“But there are no surprises with Netanyahu,” Tibon said. “Even in moments when a personal example is most needed, he is first and foremost concerned with himself.”Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaIranSecond world warnewsShareReuse this content"

It sounds good for TV but it’s not real.”The bomb is commonly known as a “bunker buster” because it was designed to destroy underground bunkers, but it can be carried only by a B2 bomber that has air superiority and requires a solid GPS signal to lock in on its target.While Israel has said it has established air superiority over Iran, a successful strike would still require any GPS jammers and other defenses to be taken out in advance, and for the GBU-57 to penetrate deep enough into the ground to neutralize the facility.locator mapIran built the nuclear enrichment facility at Fordow underground to protect it from the threat of aerial attacks. In 1981, Israel bombed a nuclear facility near Baghdad that was located above ground in order to stop Iraq developing nuclear weapons.In recent years, Israel has devised a variety of plans to destroy Fordow without the help of the United States. In one instance, Israel proposed loading helicopters with commandos who could fight their way into the facility and blow it up – an option that Trump has dismissed, according to people familiar with the matter.Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday, another leading Labour MP, Dan Carden, saidhe would vote against the billand the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, urged her MPs to oppose it.Keir Starmer has reiterated his own support for the bill, but on Thursday night there was no firm commitment from No 10 that the prime minister would be present to vote.“We are behind the curve,” Leadbeater said. “We’ve got the law going through the Isle of Man. We’ve got Jersey. We’ve got France. We’ve got various American states, Colorado recently.“Other countries are looking at us and saying, goodness me, why are you not doing what is essentially the right thing to do? And if we don’t do it now, we could be looking at another 10 years. We cannot put families through another 10 years of that.”The MP for Spen Valley said circumstances may never allow such a change for another generation, given the number of progressive MPs in the parliament. “This is surely everything modern parliamentarians should believe in: big societal change for the people that need it,” she said. “Now is the time.”Should the bill pass, Leadbeater said it would be accessible to those with a terminal illness by the end of the parliament, with a four-year implementation period. “I will certainly be putting pressure on to commence sooner than that if it can be done safely and effectively,” she said. “But ultimately it’s about it being safe rather than rushing it through.”At least 19 MPs have publicly said they will switch sides from either abstaining or backing the bill to voting against. Since the bill was last voted on, there has been a major change to the legislation: the removal of the requirement for a high court judge to sign off each case, replaced by a panel of experts including a psychiatrist, a social worker and senior lawyer.Proponents of the bill claimed they were confident it would pass again on Friday, having previously passed with a majority of 55. But further high-profile switchers or even significant interventions in the chamber on Friday could be critical and those who oppose the bill said they believed there was still significant traffic in their direction.Campaigners on both sides said that MPs would be going to extraordinary lengths to make the vote, returning from hospital bedsides and long-haul trips.Carden, who leads the Blue Labour group of MPs, told the Guardian he would vote against, having previously abstained. “Legalising assisted suicide will normalise the choice of death over life, care, respect and love,” the MP for Liverpool Walton said. “I draw on my own family experience, caring for my dad who died from lung cancer three years ago.“I genuinely fear the legislation will take us in the wrong direction. The values of family, social bonds, responsibilities, time and community will be diminished, with isolation, atomisation and individualism winning again.”Those who have switched from previously supporting the bill to voting against include the Conservative former minister George Freeman, the Lib Dem work and pensions spokesperson, Steve Darling, and the Labour MPs Karl Turner, Kanishka Narayan and Jonathan Hinder.But there have been some who have moved to vote in favour, including the Ipswich Labour MP Jack Abbott, who voted against in November but switched to support having been on the bill’s scrutiny committee, saying he was now convinced the safeguards were robust.A YouGov poll on the eve of the vote found assisted dying has robust support among the UK public: 75% believe that assisted dying should in principle be legal in some form in the UK, compared with 14% opposed. But there are significant divisions across different sections of society.Polling for the Muslim Council of Britain showed British Muslims were overwhelmingly likely to oppose the bill. The poll found 70% of respondents said that if their local MP were to vote for the assisted suicide bill, it would make them less likely to vote for them at the next election.Badenoch urged Conservative MPs to vote against the bill, though it remains a free vote. “I’m somebody who has been previously supportive of assisted suicide,” she said. “This bill is a bad bill. It is not going to deliver. It has not been done properly.“This is not how we should put through legislation like this. I don’t believe that the NHS and other services are ready to carry out assisted suicide, so I’ll be voting no, and I hope as many Conservative MPs as possible will be supporting me in that.”The Royal College of Psychiatrists issued another warning before the vote, saying there were “too many unanswered questions about the safeguarding of people with mental illness”.Should the bill pass on Friday, it will then go to the House of Lords. However, it is not expected peers will block its progress once the Commons has passed the bill, though it may be amended.The Labour peer Luciana Berger urged MPs to vote against the bill if they were unsure about safeguards, rather than assume further changes would be made in the Lords. “Elected MPs should be clear that as it is a [private member’s bill], amendments are likely to be limited,” she posted on X. “MPs must be satisfied that the Bill in front of them on Friday is fit for purpose.”The Labour peer Charlie Falconer is likely to take charge of the bill in the House of Lords. Falconerhad submitted his own billto the Lords prior to Leadbeater’s, though he withdrew it when her bill was put to the Commons.Proponents of the bill hope it will receive royal assent by October, but there will be a four-year implementation period to allow the NHS, Department of Health and Social Care and the Ministry of Justice to develop procedures and guidance. It is – as yet – unclear if the procedure would be available on the NHS or free at the point of use.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingEnglandWalesHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

The real and ongoing distress was palpable.“I absolutely understand the need to address the ever-increasing welfare bill in these difficult economic times, but I have always believed this could and should be done by supporting more disabled people into work.“I do not believe that cuts to personal independence payment [Pip] and the health element of universal credit should be part of the solution.”Government officials brace for up to 50 Labour MPs rebelling against welfare billRead moreFoxcroft, 48, who is among a number of frontbenchers uncomfortable with the proposed changes, said she had wrestled with whether to fight the changes from within the government.“Sadly it is now seems that we are not going to get the changes I desperately wanted to see. I therefore tender my resignation as I know I will not be able to do the job that is required of me and whip – or indeed vote – for reforms which include cuts to disabled people’s finances,” she said.“I am incredibly proud to have served as part of the firstLabourgovernment in 14 years and hope that ministers will revisit these reforms so that I can continue to support the government in delivering for the people of this country.”Responding to Foxcroft’s decision to resign as a whip, a government spokesperson said: “This Labour government was elected to deliver change. The broken welfare system we inherited is failing the sick and most vulnerable and holding too many young people back. It is fair and responsible to fix it.“Our principled reforms will ensure those who can work should, that those who want to work are properly supported, and that those with most severe disabilities and health conditions are protected.”The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, plans to save £5bn a year by overhauling the welfare system, including by cutting eligibility for Pip.Claimants only able to wash half of their body or who are unable to cook a meal for themselves will no longer be able to claim Pip unless they have another limiting condition.The welfare reform bill, published on Wednesday, confirmed it would lead to benefit cuts for 950,000 people by 2030. Kendall said the country’s £326bn social security netmight cease to exist if costs continued to escalate.Under the terms of the bill, people losing their disability benefits will get additional financial support for 13 weeks, while those with severe conditions such as heart disease or spinal injuries will not have to face reassessments.Kendall has set out a separate £1bn plan to help unemployed people get back to work, but this is not related to Pip, as these payments are unconnected to employment status.At least 42 MPs have publicly said they will not support the bill, expected to be put to a vote on 1 July. But about 170 are believed to have signed private letters to whips expressing significant concern about the changes.Explore more on these topicsWelfareLabourBenefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

Police fear more than 50 other women could be victims.Since his conviction, more than 20 women have come forward to police, and still more remain unidentified, with police fearing there may be dozens more.Zou remained impassive as Judge Cottage KC said he was “a highly manipulative and intelligent young man who gave no thought at all of the wishes and feelings of the women” he penetrated and filmed. They were, she said, “simply pieces in an elaborate game for one: you”.Telling the Chinese national that he would spend at least 24 years in a UK prison before being considered for parole, she said he posed a “significant risk” and had an “abiding sexual interest in asserting … power and control over women”.After the sentencing at Inner London crown court on Thursday, detectives urged women in the UK and China to come forward if they suspected they were one of Zou’s victims. Since an international appeal was made after the trial in March, 24 women have come forward.“The sheer scale of his offending, which spanned two countries, makes him one of the most prolific predators we have ever seen,” said DCI Richard Mackenzie.In statements read out to the court, victims described how Zou’s violations had destroyed their lives. One rape victim said she had been filled with “romantic anticipation” when she met Zou, but after a night out she had woken to find him “thrusting violently against my body”. “What happened that night is etched into my soul forever,” she said. “His face, his expression – they will never leave me.”Her memories caused migraines, physical pain and an “overwhelming urge to scrub myself clean”, she said.Another victim, who has bipolar disorder, described the disintegration of her mental health. Anxious that others would be attacked she posted about the assault on social media, but was blamed by some users who asked why she had been drinking and gone to his house. “I no longer believe in the inherent goodness of people,” she said.Commander Kevin Southworth, of the Metropolitan police, assured any women who feared they may have been one of Zou’s victims that they would be treated with “empathy, kindness and respect” if they came forward to police.“Thanks to the remarkable efforts of our officers and prosecutors, a dangerous and cowardly offender will now spend the next 24 years behind bars,” he said.The court was told that Zou had filmed nine rapes as “souvenirs”, but only two of his victims had been identified by the time he stood trial, with a third woman from China contacting police since.Zou, who in court admitted to watching extreme pornography depicting unconscious women being raped, wasconvicted in Marchof raping three women in London and seven in China after a month-long trial. He was convicted of 28 offences in total, including 11 rapes against 10 women, numerous counts of voyeurism, and possessing extreme pornography and drugs to commit sexual offences.Zou grew up in Guangdong province and came to Britain in 2017 to study at Queen’s University Belfast. He started studying for a master’s at University College London in 2019, travelling back to China occasionally, and by the time of his arrest in January 2024 was studying for a PhD in mechanical engineering.The jury heard that Zou used social media platforms and dating websites to target his victims, using the name Pakho online. He would ask young women, often Chinese students living away from home, to come back to his flat to study or have a drink.After his arrest at his flat in the Elephant and Castle area in January 2024, police discovered 1,664 hours of footage, including 58 videos of rapes filmed on secret cameras. They also found designer clothing and bags, a Rolex watch, and a box believed to contain “souvenirs” from his victims.Many of the women, who are all believed to be of Chinese heritage, could be heard pleading for him to stop before they lost consciousness. One woman could be heard stating: “I really don’t want … I beg you, don’t do this.”Zou replied: “Don’t push me, it’s pointless … The sound insulation here is very good.”Another woman could be heard repeatedly crying out for her mother. The judge said: “You calmly and inexorably ignored their pleas.”During the trial Zou bragged about having several new sexual partners every week and spoke of liking pornography in which the “females are passive and unresponsive during sex”. Asked why, Zou replied: “I like it because the girl appears to be still and quiet when they are having sex.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeEnglandLondonChinanewsShareReuse this content"

A reading above zero indicates optimism; below indicates pessimism.The last time the headline index, which is closely watched by the government and the Bank of England, was positive was in January 2016, when it was at 4. It has had double-digit negative readings since September 2021 when Britain was in the grip of Covid-19.Last month,sentiment hit its lowest level since November 2023as a combination of domestic tax increases, rising bills and worries over Donald Trump’s trade wars weighed on minds.Consumers became more optimistic about the overall economy this month, with scores up three points when judging how the past year went, and up by five points when looking at the next 12 months. However, both measures were firmly stuck in negative territory, at -43 and -28 respectively.Assessments of personal financial situations were unchanged, with the score for the past 12 months at -7 and the measure looking ahead was in positive territory, at 2.Neil Bellamy, consumer insights director at GfK, said:“Consumers have been resolute in their views on their wallets, with June’s personal financial situation scores (past and future) unchanged from May. Yet confidence is still fragile because the dark shadow of inflation is a day-to-day challenge for so many of us.”The cost of filling up a car started creeping up this week whencrude oil prices rose sharplyafter Israel’s attack on Iran. A litre of petrol now costs 132.8p while diesel is at 138.9p, according to the AA motoring group.Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “Looking ahead, consumer confidence will likely be squeezed by gradually easing wage growth while inflation remains at about 3.5% for the rest of the year, and unemployment will likely creep up.“The prospect of tax increases in the October budget could also weigh on households. But real income should continue eking out gains given that average earnings rose 5.5% year-over-year in March. We also expect unemployment to rise only modestly to a peak of 4.9%.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The study defined high risk as a one in 30 chance of flooding each year.The DfE summary, based on Met Office and University College London analysis, also said that even temperatures below extreme levels could result in “decreased ability to learn over the course of a typical academic year”.The summary said: “In the longer term, without the implementation of any adaptation measures, students could potentially lose up to 12 days of learning per year on average, as [the] result of generally warmer temperatures and not just from extreme heat.“It’s important to recognise that these are averages based on emerging evidence, giving only an indicative indication at this stage.”Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said an immediate priority should be given to rebuilding and refurbishing classrooms and buildings that were not designed to cope with extreme weather.He said: “Children feeling too hot or too cold in the classroom, or learning in buildings which aren’t equipped to handle drastic weather changes, may be exposed to serious health and safety risks, as well as struggling to focus on their learning.“Sustaining a safe and nurturing school environment is very difficult without a stable climate. Action and investment is needed by governments both to tackle climate change and support schools to prevent and mitigate the impact of extreme heat and flooding, for example through investment in things like solar panels, improved ventilation and insulation, and measures to ensure buildings are watertight.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The officer found the woman holding kitchen utensils and she was “red-dotted”, or targeted, with the Taser when she refused to drop them. The Taser was not discharged.More officers then attended and the woman was handcuffed, before the spit hood was applied after she spat at the officers, the IOPC said. She was not arrested and was taken to hospital, where both items were removed.After an investigation by the watchdog, it was determined there was a gross misconduct case to answer for one officer over their treatment of the woman, including their use of force regarding the Taser and their communication towards her.Another serving officer and a former officer, who left the force in August last year, will answer their own cases over the time the woman was kept in the handcuffs and spit hood and failing to take into account her age and disability.The IOPC investigation was launched in June 2023 after a voluntary referral from the Met and a complaint from the family over use of force and alleged discrimination owing to her age, race, sex and disability.The watchdog found no evidence the woman was discriminated against based on race or sex.The Crown Prosecution Service decided in November 2023 that none of the officers should face criminal charges over the incident after receiving evidence from the IOPC.It confirmed its decision would stand after a review in June last year. The IOPC investigation concluded in January.Both serving officers are on restricted duties, the Met said. Three further officers will undergo a reflective practice review process after their behaviour during the incident.Amanda Rowe, a director at the IOPC, said: “This was a concerning incident, particularly given the woman’s vulnerabilities. We have decided that three officers who attended the incident should face a police disciplinary hearing, which will ultimately determine whether the gross misconduct allegations are proven.”No date has yet been set for the proceedings.Det Ch Supt Emma Bond said: “While the misconduct hearing will carefully consider all the facts to determine whether the allegations are proven, I want to again acknowledge the distress caused to the woman involved and very real widespread concerns that followed.“Officers know we expect them to show compassion and to adjust their approach according to the circumstances they are faced with. Over the coming days we will work closely with those communities most affected to ensure they feel heard and supported.“We have provided every assistance to the IOPC throughout its investigation and will now arrange for the hearing to be held as soon as possible.”Explore more on these topicsMetropolitan policePoliceIndependent Office for Police ConductLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This arrest marks a significant step forward. There are several lines of inquiry ongoing, and we are working hard to establish the exact circumstances of this incident.”Police said on Wednesday that a missing diamond-encrusted Rolex watch could be linked to the stabbing. Detectives were said to be keeping an open mind about any motive but were appealing for information about the watch, which they believed was missing.An ambulance crew was called to Abbott’s home in Mornington Place, Camden, at about 6pm on 13 June and she was pronounced dead at the scene.Police said a postmortem examination was carried out on Sunday and gave the cause of death as sharp force trauma.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The public have been urged not to use disposable barbecues in open countryside, parks and moorland areas, and not to discard cigarettes, matches or glass bottles, as they can ignite dry vegetation.Phil Garrigan, the chair of the NFCC, said that fire and rescue services were already under “significant pressure” due to the high number of wildfires, and that “one small error” could lead to a blaze.“We are deeply concerned about the escalating threat of wildfires this summer, which have the potential to become more frequent, intense and dangerous particularly in areas where communities border the countryside,” said Garrigan.“We all need to play our part in protecting each other, our environment and our homes and businesses. We want everyone to enjoy the nice weather, we are just asking that they take extra care when out and about because it only takes one small error to lead to a significant wildfire.”Amber heat alertswere issued in England on Thursday as the UK experienced its hottest day of the year so far, with 32.2C recorded at Kew in west London.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said this week there could be “a rise in deaths” across all nine English regions due to the heatwave, with “those aged 65 and over or people with health conditions” particularly at risk.The UKHSA said “significant impacts” were also likely across health and social care services in England. The alerts came into force at midday on Thursday and were expected to remain until 9am on Monday.The Met Office said this week that the UK could exceed temperatures of 40C in the near future,and highs of 45C “may be possible”in the current climate.This would smash the record of 40.3C recorded in Coningsby, Lincolnshire, in 2022. A report by the Office for National Statistics and the UKHSA found there were 3,000 more deaths in England and Wales that summer than would normally be expected.In the first four months of this year there weremore than double the number of rural blazesthan in the months that preceded the 2022 heatwave, with the risk to people, wildlife and habitats described as “catastrophic”.The dangerous 32C heat that may be endured by people in the south-east of England this Saturday will have been made 100 times more likely by the climate crisis, scientists have calculated.Global heating, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, is making every heatwave more likely and more intense. The 32C day expected on Saturday would have been expected only once every 2,500 years without the climate crisis, the researchers said, and June heatwaves are now about 2-4C hotter than in the past.The heatwave is the latest in a series of recent extreme weather events in the country. Between February and April, England had its driest period on record, with the north-westdeclaring a drought in MayandYorkshire entering one last week.In order to avoid any negative effects from the weather, the UKHSA recommends people keep out of the sun between 11am and 3pm on the hottest days if possible, drink plenty of liquids and wear sunscreen and protective clothing when outside.It also recommends looking out for people aged 65 and over, as they are especially affected by the heat.Explore more on these topicsWildfiresUK weatherClimate crisisExtreme heatnewsShareReuse this content"

I love life and I want to live. But that said, I live in terror at the prospect of how my final weeks of life could turn out,” the 64-year-old said.“I know that even with the best palliative care available, there are limits to what can be done. It’s a dead weight of fear I carry around with me.”Fisher, a former academic and authorised Church of England preacher, is a strong supporter of the assisted dying bill that MPs will debate before acrucial vote on Friday. She hopes it will pass and come into force in enough time to give her the option of an assisted death when the moment comes.Although cancer has now spread to her bones and made walking difficult, she has travelled from her home in Huddersfield to join a planned demonstration outside parliament for the bill’sthird reading.“Despite all my disabilities and pain, I’ll be there until the end, until the vote comes through,” she said. “I’m hanging all my hopes on it. It would be quite devastating if it is defeated.”Her views have led to some tense exchanges with other members of the church, whose leaders have spoken out against the legislation. The bishop of London has said it may mean vulnerable people are compelled to hasten their death.Fisher said: “I can’t reconcile Christian compassion with the status quo that obliges people to a drawn-out process of dying in pain when this is against their will and they have the capacity to choose.“People use this concept of the sanctity of life which is completely central to Christian teaching. But I reject the assumption that the sanctity of life requires telling terminally ill people to undergo a painful death when they don’t want to.”Most debates in her congregation about the subject had been civilised, she said, although she sometimes feels as if she is marginalised as a terminal cancer patient. “It’s like you’re not taken as seriously – people think ‘well she would say that, wouldn’t she?’,” she said.On the other side of the debate, there are people alarmed the legislationcould lead to abuse, coercion or people dying earlier than needed, particularly in cases of misdiagnosis and inaccurate prognosis.View image in fullscreenPeter Sefton-Williams: ‘People have to accept that there will be cases where doctors get it wrong.’Photograph: suppliedPeter Sefton-Williams, 72, was diagnosed with suspected motor neurone disease by two neurologists in January 2024 and joined Dignitas after deciding he wanted to opt for an assisted death.“I was so completely shocked. I did very much think about ending my life because I live on my own and I’m not married, and motor neurone disease is terrible, you can’t swallow, you can’t speak,” he said.His condition didn’t deteriorate and then, nine months later, his diagnosis was changed to a rare, non-terminal condition called multifocal motor neuropathy.“If assisted dying had been available to me, it’s quite possible I would have opted for that. I mean, I had two of the country’s senior specialists confirm I had motor neurone disease. I was in a state of great despair,” he said.“People would have said, well, he died with dignity and so on. Except it would have been an error. It would have been a mistake. I would have died needlessly.”Along with misdiagnoses, the all-party parliamentary group for terminal illness reported that the accuracy of predictions of how long someone has left to live can range from 78% to 23%, and in cases involving less understood conditions, such as motor neurone disease, it can be impossible.“There are lots and lots of cases where people have lived very fruitful, happy lives for much longer than they were expected to,” Sefton-Williams said. “I was completely traumatised by the whole experience, the misdiagnosis and the implications of that. People have to accept that there will be cases where doctors get it wrong. And that needs to be discussed.”View image in fullscreenShafaq Sikandar: ‘Pain really does strip away everything that makes life worth living.’Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianShafaq Sikandar, 39, has stage 4 breast cancer and is a keen supporter of the bill. “It is not because I’m thinking about assisted dying,” she said. “I might not need it, but what I would like to know is that if and when that happens, that I have a choice. It’s a choice not to suffer, to be able to die at home with my loved ones.”She is a professor of sensory neurophysiology, specialising in people’s experiences of chronic pain, so she knows more than most how pain works and the scientific limitations of measuring it.“We don’t currently have the appropriate tools to really assess someone’s comfort when they’re past the point of being able to articulate how they’re feeling,” she said. “I am particularly worried about experiencing pain at any point in my life, including at the end of it. Pain is often described as an erosion of dignity and it really does strip away everything that makes life worth living.”She said she understood the complexity of the bill, and theneed to get the safeguarding right. “But it’s still a case of listening to the voice of patients and understanding they want to have a choice in their treatment,” she said. “When we think about death we also need to think about the meaning of life, and I think a lot of that boils down to living as well as you can until that very last breath.”Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingEnglandWalesHealth policyHouse of CommonsDeath and dyingnewsShareReuse this content"

Such access is extraordinary for a Pakistani general.“Senior US officials often meet with Pakistani generals. But they don’t get entertained at the White House,” noted Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based south Asia analyst. “Ayub Khan and Zia ul-Haq were exceptions but they came as heads of state.”The shift in tone is stark. India has long positioned itself as the more reliable partner for the US as the world’s largest democracy, a bulwark against China, and a hub for expanding trade and intelligence-sharing. Pakistan, by contrast, has been dogged by accusations of sheltering terrorists and undermining civilian rule.Just a few years ago, Trump himself accused Pakistan of offering “nothing but lies and deceit”. Joe Biden later called it “one of the most dangerous nations in the world”.Indian officials continue to point to Pakistan’s links to major terror attacks, including on its parliament in 2001 and in Mumbai in 2008. Against that backdrop, Washington’s embrace of Munir strikes a jarring note in Delhi, where critics say the US is engaging with the same military establishment long accused of enabling cross-border militancy.Analysts say the pivot may be driven by more than just strategic cooperation. For Trump, it could be personal. “He has a thing for strongmen,” said one US analyst.“He sees something in Munir – the mystique, the military credentials, the aura of control. Trump responds to dominance, and Munir projects it.”That may help to explain why Munir was granted access usually reserved for heads of state. “He probably relished the opportunity to size Munir up,” Kugelman said. “Trump knows that in Pakistan it’s the army chief who really runs the show.”But Munir’s visit is taking place as the Middle East is in turmoil, with Israel striking Iranian targets and Iran firing missiles in retaliation. The US may be hoping that Pakistan, one of the few countries with diplomatic ties to Tehran, could play a role in de-escalation.There’s also a more delicate calculation, with Israel pushing the US to join its military campaign against Iran, which shares a 900km border with Pakistan. That geography puts Islamabad in a pivotal position. Some analysts believe the US may be probing whether Munir would allow surveillance flights or logistical cooperation.But Pakistan’s room for manoeuvre is limited, with public opinion strongly pro-Iran. “Even privately, Pakistan’s military would likely balk at the risks,” Kugelman said. “They can’t afford to be dragged into this. The backlash would be enormous.”For Indian officials, Munir’s reception has revived old memories of the US tendency to tilt towards Pakistan at critical junctures, such as in the cold war moments or post-9/11. But this time, analysts say, the reset may also involve commercial opportunity.Pakistan is actively courting US investment in two of the most volatile and potentially lucrative global commerce sectors: cryptocurrency and critical minerals.“The Trump-Munir meeting shouldn’t be seen only through the lens of the Israel-Iran war,” Kugelman said. “There’s been US-Pakistan engagement on crypto, minerals and counter-terrorism, and Trump takes a deep personal interest in all of these.”He added: “This is classic Trump: ‘What can you do for me? What can I get out of this?’”Explore more on these topicsPakistanUS foreign policyIndiaTrump administrationDonald TrumpSouth and central AsiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

In 2021, Hadi and friends won there too.If that sounds as if the British legal system left the former Somalian refugee in the driving seat, he argues that life forUberworkers is now as precarious as ever.On Thursday, academics at the University of Oxford – in conjunction with the non-profit gig worker organisationWorker Info Exchange(WIE) – launched a report analysing a mass of data relating to1.5m trips provided by 258 UK Uber drivers, who had used privacy legislation to extract their personal data from the ride-hailing app.The study gave a rare opportunity to study the workings of Uber’s technology and produced some eye-catching findings.It found that many Uber drivers have earned “substantially less” an hour since the app introduced a “dynamic pricing” algorithm in 2023, which is said to adjust trip prices in real time based on a number of factors.These include time, distance, the number of available drivers in the area, the passenger demand, traffic and the weather. The report found that these earnings drops coincided with the company taking a significantly higher share of fares.The study unearthed further data suggesting that drivers such as Hadi are experiencing less and less control over their working lives. They described their days as being controlled by increasingly sophisticated pieces of computer code, which left them unclear how much Uber would take in fees on discrete jobs.“[The old system] was clear, transparent,” Hadi told the Guardian and ITV News. “You can calculate, you can see. Say, for example here it says about eight miles, so I know eight miles plus how long it took me, plus the starting fare, minus Uber’s fee, which is 20%. Even when they increased it to 25%, I would exactly know how much. Exactly.”The new system has resulted in Uber taking a variable cut, or “take rate”, of 29% of a fare on average, rising to more than 50% in some cases, the University of Oxford researchers found. The study also found that Uber’s take rate increased on higher value rides – something the company has denied.The 29% figure appears to chime with disclosures within Uber’s latest quarterly results figures, which show that the company made$1.2bn (£890m) of income from its operationsin the first three months of this year.Meanwhile, the WIE estimates that UK Uber drivers lost out on $1.6bn in pay, as a result of Uber increasing its share of the fare, during the 12 months to March 2025.Uber said the UK take rate and lost earnings figures are inaccurate, and that its take rate had remained “steady” at 25%.The company added: “The Uber app reviews real-time information to provide the best price to appeal to the drivers in the area, helping to minimise waiting times for customers and maximise earnings. Drivers are shown their earnings for the trip before they decide whether to accept.”But as Uber grows more confident in its calculations, those transporting passengers say they are becoming less so.A driver’s livelihood depends on their ability to guess what kinds of trips they will get at particular times and places, and how much those trips will pay.However, the University of Oxford study stated that “drivers frequently complained about the unpredictability of pay post-dynamic pricing”.It continued: “Any tacit knowledge drivers have built up over years about how much pay a given trip is likely to yield may no longer help them … the predictability of pay drastically changed after dynamic pricing was introduced.”A company spokesperson said: “Uber drivers in the UK took home over £1bn in earnings between January and March of this year, which is up on the year before.“Drivers choose to drive with Uber because we offer total flexibility on when they work and provide full transparency over the trips they accept.“All drivers receive a weekly summary of their earnings, which includes a clear breakdown of what Uber and the driver received from trips.“We are proud that thousands of drivers continue to make the positive choice to work on Uber as passenger demand and trips continue to grow.”Explore more on these topicsUberGig economyLiving wageanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s a farce-packed watch involving alotof spilt cocaineRachel AroestiThu 19 Jun 2025 17.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 17.31 EDTShareDisabled people are routinely ignored, underestimated, overlooked and patronised. The perfect drug dealers, in other words. This is the gratifyingly sardonic concept behind comedian Rosie Jones’s new sitcom – co-written with Veep’s Peter Fellows – in which she stars as Emily Dawkins, a woman with cerebral palsy whose benefits are senselessly cut by the DWP. After a humiliating work capability assessment, she runs into old school mate Ewen in the loos. Once he remembers who she is (no, not the woman he shagged in the Co-op store room), Ewen is delighted to see her again – “I thought you died!” – and is soon offering Emily 50 quid to deliver a mysterious package for him. Initially Emily declines; too dodgy. But with the prospect of an actual paycheck from her charity work dwindling, she reluctantly gets on with the job – and is pleasantly surprised to find that her disability allows her to get away with murder. Well, distributing cocaine, at any rate.Such a premise – impoverished disabled woman cornered into dealing drugs to survive contemporary Britain – could have produced an incredibly bleak show; criminal gangs do regularly exploit disabled people for financial gain. Yet Pushers comprehensively swerves sincere social commentary. Rather than being used by Ewen, Emily quickly becomes the enterprise’s driving force. While her childhood pal wants to shift the £500k worth of cocaine he has somehow acquired, then bow out of the game for good, his new employee opts to diversify into the heinous synthetic street drug spice behind his back. She also insists on recruiting a team to distribute the drugs faster. Two are sourced from Wee CU, the disabled-toilet-monitoring charity Emily volunteers for: Harry (Ruben Reuter), a dance lover with Down’s syndrome, and the stern, ruthless and neurodiverse-coded Hope (a brilliant performance from Libby Mai), who is keen to get stuck in (her qualifications include being “the treasurer of the official The Bill fanclub” and spending “42% of my spare time playing drug dealer simulations”). Emily also brings in local alcoholic Sean (Jon Furlong), who passes his days scaring the public by ranting to himself in the street. After Ewen insists his tough-as-old-boots mum be involved too, their crack team is complete.The other thing that prevents Pushers from straying into seriousness is Ewen himself (Ryan McParland), whose astonishing stupidity suffuses the entire series. Physically, McParland bears more than a passing resemblance to the American comedian Tim Robinson, whose unhinged performances in his Netflix series I Think You Should Leave breathed new life into the sketch genre. The actor seems to be channelling a similar comic vibe too: Ewen is loud, weird and unpredictably intense. The individual jokes designed to demonstrate his idiocy might seem hacky on paper – “name meone personwho has ever died from drugs?!” – but McParland’s exaggerated gormlessness makes such lines giddily funny.As Emily, Jones tones down her natural exuberance slightly – she is the straight woman to Ewen and his bonkers malapropisms and misapprehensions. Yet she’s still an agent of farce; in all the many, many TV shows about drug dealing I have watched over the years, I can safely say I have never seen so much spilt cocaine in my life. And as hinted by the flash forward at the start of episode one – in which Emily is pursued through a hospital by a glowering gangster, before running straight into a doctor holding an open blood bag – no matter how dark things get, silliness still dominates.The first couple of episodes of Pushers are absorbing and frequently hilarious. Jones’s ability to joke about disability is unparalleled (“I didn’t breathe for 17 minutes” is how she explains the origin of her cerebral palsy to her benefits assessor. “I really wouldn’t recommend it”). And she is careful to ensure Emily’s responses to Ewen are priceless in themselves. Yet as the series progresses, the comedy is overshadowed by a narrative that becomes increasingly hard to make sense of. Alongside the antics of Emily’s unwieldy criminal crew, both she and Ewen have romantic subplots, with the former developing a confusingly chaste entanglement with Jo, her Insta-glam boss at Wee CU, who dangles payment and sex in front of Emily like two ghostly carrots. What’s more, our hero’s sudden switch from reluctant dealer to gang mastermind is never fully explained: did her conscience just evaporate?Meanwhile, the slapstick and cartoonish inanity do start to wear thin after a while. Although its lack of sentimentality and commitment to hard comedy is admirable, Pushers still could have done with leaning a little further into the scathing satire promised by its setup. Instead, what we ultimately get is a gag-strewn, generally lighthearted portrayal of small-town turf wars. Jones’s action-sitcom certainly has its moments, but it could have had slightly more bite.Pushers is on Channel 4 nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewRosie JonesTV comedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But his heart remains in Shropshire – the backdrop to his ambitious, grief-stricken latest recordThu 19 Jun 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 13.27 EDTShareThe sun is shining, birds are tweeting and a river gently flows just yards away as Jerskin Fendrix tells me about his love of growing up in Shropshire. “It was so gorgeous and majestic,” he says, sitting in the garden of a friend’s house where he spent a lot of time in his youth. “It was nature, forests and hills and then just normal teenage life. The combination of this numinous, big landscape and getting wasted in a cornfield with your mates listening to Kanye West on a Bluetooth speaker while seeing a massive sunset.”Such vivid scenes fill his latest album, Once Upon a Time … in Shropshire. The opening track, Beth’s Farm, captures an idyllic scene where animals roam and rural teens party. “I thought it was a really nice symbol of this naive innocence,” he says. “Trying to get across how bucolic and heavenly this was before it starts to get corrupted.”Jerskin Fendrix: SK1 – video.The corruption he speaks of is some recent personal turmoil that has at once intensified, sharpened and darkened the reflective lens he’s looking back through. “A close friend of mine killed himself,” he says. “Then more stuff happened, and more people died.” He wrote about it as a means of dealing with it, along with exploring the complexities and contradictions of grief. “We’re taught by songs or Hollywood films that someone dies and then there’s very slow strings and you cry for six months and it gradually gets better,” he says. “That’s not how it works. Sometimes it’s not as bad as you think, sometimes it’s way worse. It can be trivial, funny or sometimes it’s these massively different combinations at the same time. Death is the same thing as life – it’s as complicated and kaleidoscopically beautiful.”‘I never thought about Oscars’: Brutalist composer Daniel Blumberg on the happiness and horror of his big winRead moreOnce Upon a Time … in Shropshire reflects these vast, knotty emotions. It’s bold and dramatic, heart-wrenching, vulnerable, intimate and funny. From eruptive post-rock to sweeping chamber pop via avant classical explorations, tender ballads and group sing-alongs around the family piano, it’s a singular piece of work.Joscelin Dent-Pooley was assigned the name Jerskin Fendrix as a joke by a friend at school and it stuck. A trained pianist and violinist, he moved to London in the late 2010s to be in the band Famous, but soon began playing solo shows and collaborating with the likes of Black Midi. His 2020 debut album, Winterreise, touched on hyper-pop, warped electro and leftfield baritone ballads. It was a cult record but it caught the ear of acclaimed film director Yorgos Lanthimos, who has since employed Fendrix to score three films:Poor Things, Kinds of Kindness and the upcoming Bugonia. The former even landed Fendrix an Oscar nomination and he’s buzzing about the next one. “It’s gonna be sick,” he enthuses. “It’s a wild film. I’m very proud of it. We got a 90-piece orchestra, so it’s a big fucking score.”However, we are deliberately back on home soil to talk about his latest record. Which is not always an easy process. One of the people Fendrix lost during the writing of the record was his father, whose death was sudden and unexpected. Before many of his answers, he takes a long inhale and sits in silence before answering. He tailgates cigarette after cigarette, blazing his way through a pack of Camel Blues.View image in fullscreenIdyllic scene … Fendrix pictured in Shropshire.Photograph: Tim GuttWhile the album is rich and joyful, it also contains real pain and anguish. Fendrix stretched his voice to new places, both emotionally and in terms of its register. “I really pushed myself,” he says. “To have gone through so many things that were so unusual, new and testing, and then to make music that was safe and comfortable … it wouldn’t have been reflective.” You can hear on some songs that he is close to breaking. “I wanted to record it myself in my own little studio, and that was fairly brutal for my emotions,” he says. “This was not very long after my father had died, and it was probably a good process, but it was a pretty heavy thing to impose on myself. There are some takes that just felt like self-punishment. I was very isolated, but I always felt people were with me. Having those ghosts there, of the living as well as dead, was almost conversational.”Experiencing such loss so close to home, Fendrix basked in memories of growing up nestled around a close-knit group of friends and family, being daft, “getting ratted in the kitchen” at parties, and extracting beauty from the simple things you sometimes take for granted. “A lot of people who grow up somewhere remote are like, ‘Oh, it was shit and there was nothing to do’,” he says. “But being bored is fucking great because you invent things. Even if that’s just being a dumbass. One has permission to find their life beautiful and not a lot of people give themselves that, regardless of what your environment is. And that’s not necessarily somewhere idyllic or utopian but just to find a real deep, beautiful meaning in what’s happened to you.”At the beginning of our conversation, Fendrix said to remind me to ask him about the river in front of us, as it was important. So as our conversation wraps, I bring it up. Another deep breath and long silence. “My friend who died, we had his wake here,” he begins. “And he really loved nature.” With eerie synchronicity, we are now cowering in a corner because the heavens have opened. Fendrix sucks down one last cigarette while looking out at the droplets hitting the flowing stream. “A thing that happened that day really stuck with me: the water came all the way up to here, and the entire town was flooded overnight. It was like the river rose up to come and get him.”Once Upon a Time … in Shropshire is released via Untitled (Recs) on 10 OctoberIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

They do it a lot, this so-called “mini-me dressing” – via tartans and tiaras, nautical details and nifty colour accents.She’s not the only one.Kim Kardashiandoes it with her kids, Beyoncé does it with Blue Ivy. In fact, it tallies with the whole vibe of nepo babies, who are now appearing in the public eye wearing outfits that are sartorial embodiments of the relationships that will privilege them for life.It’s polarising – cute or crass? – and it isn’t just famous parents who do it. I see it at playgroups, at the school gates and – without ever meaning to, I see it staring up at me on my own daughter, too. And no wonder, in a world where adult brands promote their mini-me collections and children’s brands diversify into clothes for grownups. For a raft of newer kids’ brands, prints are unisex, arguably less infantile and certainly less “pink”, both in actual colour and general vibe (perhaps a helpful shift for the many parents pointedly putting their little boys in fuchsia), making sharing looks across generations more possible.There’s a lot to say about the way we dress our children. Whole theses could be written on the outfits of the children in the pronatalist-inclined White House of Donald Trump, from press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s baby in a bow tie to Elon Musk’s four-year-old, known as “Lil X”, in a camel overcoat. These days, it seems plaid wins over Peppa Pig.View image in fullscreenDouble trouble … Beyoncé and Blue Ivy, right, at an NFL game in Houston, Texas, last December.Photograph: Alex Slitz/Getty ImagesWhen I spoke todress historian Alden O’Brien in 2023, she told me that during the early 18th century, children transitioned to adult dress fairly early, but “as attitudes towards childhood changed – letting children be children, play, have less constricting clothes – the age for moving out of children’s dresses rose”.That 18th-century shift is often ascribed to the influence of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s book Emile, Or Treatise on Education, which advocated letting kids be free to roam in nature. According to Alasdair Peebles, expert collector of historical boy’s clothes, the impact of that 1762 book was felt in the 1770s when “boys start wearing trousers”, as well as “skeleton suits, which are a bit like modern playsuits”.So how does the way we dress children speak to how we see childhood now? Deniz Arzuk is a critical childhood scholar who sees it as “embedded in the wider social economic structure”. The way we dress children, she says, “is tied to the way that we construct our class identities, our aspirations, and, specifically today, there is the online presence and maintaining the look”. I don’t think when my three-year-old and I end up in Crocs with matching Spider-Man charms – her work, not mine – we are maintaining some kind of cohesive look. But then the subconscious is a powerful thing. Plus, for parents who make a habit – and possibly an income – from posting on social media, matching outfits feel tailor-made to gain likes.It feels as if there is also a potent nostalgia at play in the way some parents dress their kids – just look to the market for £60-plus vintage 90s OshKosh dungarees on Vinted for evidence. A lot of how we dress children, argues Peeble, is also to do with “using your children to embody fantasies” – in fact, he was dressed in lederhosen and kilts by his mum. If you had a relatively carefree childhood in the 1980s while decked out in dungarees and shell suits, might you be more likely to try to replicate the look on your own children as a subliminal attempt to reconstruct your childhood?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He points, for a historical example, to Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who “wrote letters to her friends about all the outfits she was making for her son … she goes on in a very gushing way about how gorgeous he looks in all the clothes.“Your child was an accessory in a sense,” he continues. You could “demonstrate, through the opulence of their clothing, your wealth and status”. It tallies. Back then it might have been “French silks, cut velvets … possibly a wig and a tricorn hat with gold lace”. Now it might be a Mini Rodini bomber jacket or an organic cotton onesie with a peace sign print. It sounds a bit grim but, as Arzuk says, “the way we invest” in our children “is a way of building up the social capital … it’s about investing in our position in society”.A more fun spin would be to focus on the fact that today, adults dress more like children, with many predominantly kidswear brands now offering kid-inflected adult clothes that aren’t Crayola-bright or unicorn-heavy. Organic Zoo is one such company. According to its founder, Paulina Atkinson: “These days, there is a more visible connection between kids’ fashion and adults’ fashion, and both inspire each other. Kids’ clothes became more than just cute prints and adults’ styles are more relaxed and less formal.” Atkinson thinks this is a good thing, saying: “For a lot of parents and children, it is a great joy to twin with their outfits, so why not?”Kids intrinsically dress well. They embody clothes with unabashed, unadulterated personality. They dress with a lack of self-consciousness; prints clash, colours bark, cuts squabble for attention but, because it is done without a care, it works.

Welcome to the 93% ClubAlastair CampbellThe civil service, judiciary and media are still dominated by the privately educated 7%. Lasting change is not a pipe dream – but it’s up to usThu 19 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 11.06 EDTShareFor the first time in our history, we have a cabinet made up entirely of people who went to state schools. Several, including prime minister Keir Starmer, come from working-class backgrounds; some, such as deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, were raised in conditions of poverty that feel as if they ought to belong to another age.So far so good. What better signs could one ask for to show that Britain is a meritocracy, social mobility is real and anyone can rise to the top provided they have talent, commitment and determination?And yet it might be that in some ways these are exceptions that prove a rule: the rule being that for all the changes made down the years, a private education continues to give a disproportionate advantage to those – currently 7% – who use it. Yes, we have a state-educated cabinet and more state-schooled MPs than ever. Yet more broadly throughout the establishment, when looking at senior positions across Whitehall, the judiciary, law, media and finance, the 7% club continues to hold a disproportionate presence, and therefore to exercise disproportionate cultural and political power.That 7% figure is what gave rise to the93% Club, the UK’s network for state-educated people. Its latest report, theBig State School Survey, merits careful reading by anyone who thinks that because we have the most working-class cabinet of our lifetime, the old class divides are gone and the dream of genuine social mobility has been delivered.The survey suggests that though state-educated students may be the majority by far, it is the 93% who have to fit in with the attitudes and actions of the 7% rather than the other way round. The overwhelming sense of the research is that talk of class continues to be brushed aside as impolite conversation – yet it continues to determine who will thrive, who will falter and who is forced to adopt a new cultural identity just to get into the room.What the survey does is show the emotional cost of having to leave parts of your identity and community behind to thrive. It brings a darker side of social mobility into the light.The journey starts at university. For many, the culture shock is instant. Nearly three-quarters of all state school students reported experiencing it. That figure rises to 91% among those from working-class backgrounds, and 94% of students believe that university culture naturally caters to the wealthy.The little things add up. Three in four students say they miss out on formals and dinners (a component of life at universities such as Oxford and Cambridge). Many say they can’t afford to join sports teams or take part in extracurricular activities. The result is not just feeling out of place but feeling like the place was never meant for you despite your having worked hard to get there.The divide doesn’t end with a degree. In fact, it deepens: 93% of working-class professionals say their background clashes with workplace culture. Many end up straddling two worlds, the one they came from and the one they now operate in, feeling that they don’t fully belong to either.To fit in, people say they start to change. Accent. Clothes. Hobbies. Even what they eat and drink. These are not small cosmetic tweaks. They’re survival tactics in environments that reward polish over potential.And while a lot of this happens quietly – with a smile, a nod, a stiff upper lip mentality – the impact is loud and lasting; 61% of respondents said they had to leave their community behind to progress. Nearly half said their friendships changed. Some grew distant from their families. This is not social mobility – it’s a social trade-off.I’ve long been a fan of the 93% Club, not least because its 29-year-old founder, Sophie Pender, knows first-hand what it means to come from nothing and make it in the City with few tools or support at her disposal. And what’s refreshing about what her organisation is doing is that it’s not accepting the status quo or burning it down. Instead, it is retooling the idea of an old boys’ network to serve state school graduates – an old boys’ and old girls’ network for the many, not the few, you might say.The question now is: do we want a country where success still depends on knowing the right people, sounding the right way and fitting into the right mould? Or do we want one where talent is prized and diversity of thought guaranteed?State schools should set up debating clubs, says senior Eton leaderRead moreReal social mobility shouldn’t come at the cost of your character. It shouldn’t mean sanding down your accent, hiding where you’re from or second-guessing how you dress, speak or behave. It should mean being able to walk into any room and be taken seriously. A cabinet that reflects that reality is a start – but it can’t be the end goal.If we want lasting change, we need more than symbolism – we need infrastructure. A nationwide state-school alumni network that offers the kind of cultural capital, career support and peer sponsorship long taken for granted by the privately educated. A network that not only helps people navigate elite spaces but also mobilises them to rework the cultures within them. The 93% Club has already made significant strides in creating this infrastructure, but it still has work to do. They’re asking others to join in – to share their time, open doors and help rewire the systems that still quietly reward one kind of background over another.It’s not a pipe dream. It’s a proven model that private schools have used for centuries. It’s high time we repurposed it to build a country where people can succeed by not leaving their identity at the door but by walking through it the way they are.Alastair Campbell is a former journalist turned strategist and spokesperson for the Labour party.

Why not just scrap it, as the Reform leader suggests?Thu 19 Jun 2025 11.46 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 11.50 EDTShareStop it now. Stop spending sums that you admit are out of control. Show common sense and send everyone home.HS2is a bad joke, a fiasco.Labour’s second transport secretary in a year, Heidi Alexander, claimed on Wednesday to beshocked by HS2. She was clearly new to the subject. After being briefed on the latest delays and cost overruns by the latest CEO, Mark Wild, she said that the project was “an appalling mess … a litany of failure … unsustainable”. It was as if she had just entered a morgue and disliked the smell.What then? Alexander read out the usual dog-eared transport department brief. It said she would “draw a line in the sand” and “get the job done”. She did not know what it might cost or when it might actually open. But since it would be at least eight years overdue, no one need really care.Every other spending minister has a right to howl. Each day of the year, Alexander signs away £20m to fund a 12-year-oldvanity projectof a Tory prime minister, David Cameron. That is to meet HS2’s current Treasury subsidy of£7bn a year.Alexander’s statement clearly indicated that she was forbidden to challenge any aspect of the project beyond the ineptitude of its management. This enabled her to play the familiar Starmer card of blaming the opposition for everything that goes wrong, and imply that in her hands all would be fine. We have heard this from a decade of HS2 ministers, not one of whom was in office long enough to withstand its lobbies.It is a measure of the rottenness of British government that Cameron’s project dazzled politicians of both parties as well as the media establishment. Labour’s Ed Balls once said it would cancel HS2 if itcosts went beyond the then £50bnprice tag. But infrastructure is a religious creed. Its shrines, once sanctified by the Treasury, are beyond criticism.HS2 is clearly a project too big to stop. Everyone I have ever known in government agrees it was a mistake. But to say so in political circles is like questioning the virgin birth. The result is that no transport secretary, no chancellor and no prime minister has felt strong enough to order cancellation.Boris Johnson, who had once dismissed HS2 as a “gimmick”, merely hacked off its north-east limb. Rishi Sunak hacked off its north-west one. In doing so they slashed whatever value still attached to the project as a whole. It is now no more than a surplus line from an isolated station in central Birmingham to Acton in London, and possibly on to one of London’s least busy terminuses, Euston.Alexander is so in awe of HS2 that she appears to have reversed Sunak’s bizarre insistence that new extension be privately financed. This will give Eustonfour to six extra platforms. It is simply astonishing expenditure, a staggering £6bn for a few platforms. You could rebuild London’s most derelict hospitals with that. No one mentons that HS2 at current costs will pocket about £2,000 each from the average British taxpayer.HS2’s contractorswere toldthat they would be reimbursed for all their costs, plus inflation plus profit. Typical of Whitehall project management, this was insane. It meant that absolutely nobody had an interest in restraining costs rather than inflating them. That is how the company’s “world class” bosses havelong earned£400,000-£600,000 a year, while more than 40 senior staffearn over £150,000.The result is that HS2’s 30,000 staff, officials and consultants, its Whitehall civil servants, local councils and businesses, have formed a massive lobby for continuation. Johnson’s Downing Street transport adviser, Andrew Gilligan,tells of officialswho “lied, covered up and fired whistle-blowers”. One whistleblower known to me felt as though he was working for the mafia. The lobby sent a deputation to the Guardian to explain to me why my opposition was so wrong. The former owner of the Euston sitecalled the projecta giant “Ponzischeme, a gravy train to nowhere”. And they all walk away with their pay, perks and honours intact. It is a classic of Britain’s “deep state” at work.Alexander is now repeating the old ministerial mantra that the project will be fine if managed by her. It always starts with more reports. Alexander is now waiting for another Wild report. It follows theOakervee reviewand countless others fromStephen Glaister, the National Audit Office and thepublic accounts committee. All warn of trouble ahead. All have been ignored.The continued uncertainty over HS2 costs can only mean continued increases. The project is now way below normal Treasury value for money estimates, and survives only by the grace of politics. Its cancellation would of course cost more money. But of the currently assumed £100bn, only between £30bn and £40bnhas been spent. There is still about £60bn needed for what is a purely political gesture of growth machismo.Keir Starmer is fond these days of parroting Reform’s leader, Nigel Farage. He should listen to what Faragesaid on Wednesday: “Scrap HS2”, and spend the money on something worthwhile.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHS2OpinionLabourRail transportcommentShareReuse this content"

He is far from the first warmonger to do soThu 19 Jun 2025 10.59 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 13.27 EDTShareThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has invoked the Iranian regime’s heinous women’s rights record to justify his heinous war on Iran. This is the man whose genocide of Palestinians in Gazakilled more women and childrenin its first year than the equivalent period of any other conflict over the past two decades.“They’ve impoverished you, they’ve given you misery, they’ve given you death, they’ve given you terror, they shoot down your women, leaving this brave, unbelievable woman, Mahsa Amini, to bleed on the sidewalk for not covering her hair,” hetold Iraniansin an interview with Iran International.It is incredible to hear Netanyahu call on the Iranian people to rise up against the very things he has subjected Palestinians to. But it is not surprising. I am all too familiar with the ways imperialists, occupiers and invaders weaponise Muslim women’s bodies and rights to justify their wars.As an Egyptian, I know that colonisers such as Evelyn Baring, the 1st Earl of Cromer and the de facto ruler of Egypt between 1883 and 1907, supported greater rights for Egyptian women while being an anti-suffragist back home. Far from emancipating Egyptian women, Baring made it almost impossible for those opposed to the occupation and European influence to criticise traditions or religious practices without looking as though they were taking the side of the west.As a woman of Muslim descent, I remember vividly the US claiming its invasion of Afghanistan was to “liberate” women from the Taliban’s misogyny. Twenty years after that reckless invasion, an increasingly disastrous war and occupation, and a criminally chaoticwithdrawal from Afghanistan, the Taliban once again rule.Even worse and more shamefully, as a feminist I know that, unlike Afghan feminists, white feminists in the US were cheerleaders of that invasion, failing to understand the dangers of imperial powers co-opting women’s rights. Leaders of the Feminist Majority Foundation – including Eleanor Smeal, the former head of the National Organization for Women – attended events at the state department and met administration officials. The spring 2002 issue of Ms magazine called the invasion a “coalition of hope”.“As we achieve our objective, we are also clearing the path for you to achieve your freedom,”said Netanyahuin another televised speech aimed at Iranians. “This is your opportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard. Woman, life, freedom – zan, zendegi, azadi.”Thedeath of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, in a hospital in Iran in September 2022 days after being detained by the regime’s “morality police” for allegedly not complying with the country’s hijab regulation, sparked the feminist “woman, life, freedom” revolution. Women, queer people and marginalised minorities in Iran rose up to fight not only the regime’s compulsory hijab law but its decades of repression.They did not need Netanyahu to fight for their freedom then, nor do they need him now. On the contrary, his attempt to co-opt the courageous uprising is the quickest way to discredit feminism itself – often dismissed as “western” and alien. Wars and invasions harm, not strengthen, revolutions. As an Egyptian, I know all too well that the Egyptian regime tried its hardest to claim our25 January revolutionin 2011 was being masterminded from abroad.Easy regime change in Tehran is a nice idea. But look to history: it’s a near-impossible one | Martin KettleRead moreProtecting the “liberal” and “western” values of women’s rights is an easy moral cover for what is an invasion, war or colonisation always motivated by a desire for power, resources or both. If western leaders really cared so much about female bodily autonomy, perhaps they could look closer to home. The same George W Bush who claimed to defend women from the burqa and the Taliban was the same George W Bush who, on his first day in office, cut off funding to any international family-planning organisations that offered abortion services or counselling.Would the white feminists call for the invasion of the US today, where a premature baby was extracted from the decaying body of a brain-dead Black woman who, against the wishes of her partner and family, wastreated like an incubatorbecause of the state of Georgia’s ban on abortion? The patriarchy-atop-theocracy melange of Iran’s “morality police” is easier to see because it is so visibly expressed in the enforced hijab. But what is the enforced pregnancy of the Christian zealots in the US but a melange of patriarchy built atop theocracy right there?Wars and invasions do not liberate women. Ask the women of Afghanistan today. Every time an imperial power claims to “liberate” women from “their” men, those men will seek to wrestle back control over “their women” when the invaders are gone. Taliban 2.0 have banned girls’ education and barred women from working in public and private sectors, except for Afghan healthcare and a few other departments. They have barred women from travelling long distances by road or air unless accompanied by a male relative, and from visiting public places such as parks, gyms and bathhouses without a male relative. The Taliban have shut down even women-only beauty salons.As a feminist, I marvelled at and cheered on fellow feminists in Iran rising up for woman, life, freedom. And I am sure they know that the enemy of their enemy is not their friend.Mona Eltahawy writes theFeminist Giantnewsletter.

Whatisnoteworthy is the fact that his crusade of mass deportations seems to have taken the Maga crowd by surprise in a way that makes little sense if you’ve been paying attention to Trump, his campaign promises, his party and the people hesurrounds himselfwith.Even as they witness friends and family members hurt by this administration’s immigration clampdowns, some Trump supporters appear resistant to doing a full 180.Bradley Bartell, whose wife, Camila Muñoz, was recently detained, says he has no regrets about voting for Trump. Muñoz is from Peru and overstayed a work-study visa that expired right when Covid hit. She was trying to get permanent residency in the US when she was detained.“I don’t regret the vote,” Bartell toldNewsweek. His rationale? Trump is a victim of a bad immigration system that his administration inherited. “He didn’t create the system but he does have an opportunity to improve it. Hopefully, all this attention will bring to light how broken it is.”‘Abducted by Ice’: the haunting missing-person posters plastered across LARead moreForJensy Machadofrom Manassas, Virginia, things are a bit more complex. Machado, a naturalized US citizen, was driving to work when,according to NBC 4, he was stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents, who brandished guns and surrounded his truck. According to Machado, a man facing a deportation order had given Machado’s home address as his, and when Machado assured agents that they had the wrong person and offered them his Virginia driver’s license, they ordered him to leave his car and handcuffed him.“I was a Trump supporter,” Machado, who is Hispanic, said. “I voted for Trump last election, but, because I thought it was going to be like … against criminals, not every Hispanic, Spanish-lookalike.“They will assume that we are all illegals,” he continued. “They’re just following Hispanic people.”Machado said his support for the administration had been shaken. Others have been rattled by how and where Trump’s policies are being applied.That dissonance is well articulated in a recent New York Timespieceabout a small Missouri town that supported Trump – and is now grappling with the effects of his decisions.Many residents of Kennett, Missouri, were stunned when a beloved neighbor, Carol, was arrested and jailed to await deportation after being summoned to Ice offices in St Louis in April. According to the government, Carol came to the US from Hong Kong in 2004, and has spent the past two decades trying to secure legal stay in the country, ultimately being granted a temporary permission to stay known as an order of supervision. Carol’s most recent order of supervision was supposed to be valid through August 2025, but on the day of her arrest, she was told it was being terminated.Now, despite the fact that she’s spent the last two decades building a life and community in this small town, getting married and buying a house, she’s spent weeks moving between jails as she awaits a final decision on her deportation.“I voted forDonald Trump, and so did practically everyone here,” said Vanessa Cowart, who knows Carol from church. “But no one voted to deport moms. We were all under the impression we were just getting rid of the gangs, the people who came here in droves … This is Carol.”That last line – and the Kennett story as a whole – reveals a deeply American way of thinking about law and order and civil liberties: that anything is fair game once someone is considered a “criminal”. It’s an idea that has been sent into overdrive in the Trump years, where “criminal” has become a catch-all for the most evil, dangerous and undesirable in our communities, and shorthand for referencing anyone society doesn’t want to deal with.Trump ran on a campaign of hate, and the voters who helped cement that hatred and codify it into policy are now encountering the kind of state-sanctioned violence they endorsed at the ballot box.Still, to say “I told you so” in a moment like this is not only useless, it feels like a cruel understatement when the thing you were warning about is so destructive.So what can we learn from this? US leadership is clearly invested in the destruction of vulnerable American lives. If people who have been directly affected by Trump’s behaviour still find reasons to rationalize his leadership, it’s a reminder that ousting this regime will require the rest of us to speak out against tyranny and the establishment politics that got us here in the first place.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Rumours of a foreigner assaulting a local woman resulted in groups roaming through a small British town, breaking windows of homes belonging to “outsiders”. A few days later, the police attempted to stop mobs from reaching another nearby multiracial area. Eventually they broke through, ransacking shops and burning down a house, while local media reported that the violence had developed into “something like a fever”.Sound familiar? This isn’t Ballymena, the County Antrim town inNorthern Irelandthat has seen several nights of unrest in which immigrant homes were attacked after reports of an alleged sexual assault on a local girl by two teenagers, who had a Romanian interpreter read them the charges. These incidents actually took place more than a century ago, during the summer of 1919, as racial violence spread throughout south Wales, eventually reaching Cardiff and the diverse district of Tiger Bay.Back then, a number of things were blamed for the violence, among them a lack of jobs and housing for returning white servicemen, many of whom were disgusted by the relationships between local women and black men who had served in the merchant navy and madeWalestheir home during the first world war. The media also played their part. The South Wales Daily News claimed that it had never seen “so black a blot on an otherwise fair and thriving town”, before suggesting a fire like the Great Fire of London “would be a godsend” that could cleanse Tiger Bay (now known as Butetown).In Ballymena, the spark was the alleged attempted rape, coupled with the recent influx of immigrants who rioters said have “invaded”, “infested” and “ruined” their community. In the 2001 census, just 14,300 people, or 0.8% of the overall population of Northern Ireland, belonged to a minority ethnic group. By 2021, it was 65,600 people, or 3.4%. Still small numbers compared with England (18%), orScotland(11%), but each of those countries saw a similar outburst of racial violence when immigration was at a comparable level.England also witnessed riots in 1919. There was violence in North Shields and Liverpool, where a sailor called Charles Wooten drowned after beingchased by a mob. Liverpool again saw Ballymena-esque scenes in 1948 when a seamen’s hostel was assaulted and in 1972 when a racially mixed housing estate was attacked by skinheads. (Housing is still a flashpoint; last year, at leasteight African families– half of them including nurses – were forced toflee an estate in Antrim town.) In between those incidents in Liverpool there were the race riots in Nottingham and Notting Hill in London in 1958, followed by theracist murder of Kelso Cochranein the capital by teddy boys a year later.Throughout the 1970s, the rise of the far-right National Front, which had 12,000 members at its peak, created a dangerous environment in England: the historian Peter Fryer estimated that between 1976 and 1981, 31 people had beenmurdered by racistsin Southall, Brick Lane (both in London), Swindon, Manchester and Leeds. Politicians also inflamed the issue: in 1978, in an attempt to outflank the NF, Margaret Thatcher claimed in an interview that “People are really rather afraid that this country might be swamped by people with a different culture.”There’s a much more recent history of violence in England too: last summer, mobs attacked mosques, hotels housing migrants and the homes of “foreigners” in Hull, Hartlepool, Manchester and Liverpool after the murder of three children in Southport.Scotland also had its, albeit delayed, racial reckoning. Although Glasgow saw race riots in 1919, it wasn’t until 1989 and the murder of Somali student Axmed Sheekh that a group of activists and Black Scots forced a conversation about racism north of the border, which until then had been presented as an “English disease”. Anti-racist activists were told that there wasn’t a problem because there simply weren’t any black or brown people in Scotland. In 1991, ethnic minorities accounted for 1% of the population, but a Runnymede Trust report showed that there had been ahuge spike in racist assaultsnorth of the border as these tiny communities became more visible.There’s an established pattern that Ballymena is a part of: an influx of immigrants, hostility to their presence, a denial that there is a problem with xenophobia, then a spark followed by indiscriminate violence. But many people in Britain can’t see this pattern – or choose not to.The years 1981, 2001 and 2011 linger in the memory and are what many people think of when they hear the phrase “race riot” in a British context. Each one of those years saw unrest in black and brown communitiestriggered by policing(1981),far-right activity(2001) and thekilling of Mark Duggan(2011), followed by hand-wringing and commentators wondering where Britain went wrong on race. The events of 1919, 1948 and 1972 dissolve quickly into the forgotten past, footnotes at best; they are certainly not woven into the national story of racial violence.These incidents – of white violence – are presented in isolation. In Ballymena, it’s impossible to understand what’s happening without engaging with the recent history of Northern Ireland. The fact that most of the people attacking immigrants and the police were Protestants whose own families emigrated to Ireland generations before places the violence not just in the context of the Troubles, but also British colonialism. But they’re also part of a continuum, one that links different eras and parts of the United Kingdom.This history of violence is part of an established pattern that isn’t inevitable but instead manufactured by a combination of political failings, distorted media coverage and opportunism by the far right.It is this context that made Keir Starmer’s“island of strangers” speechso offensive. That language isn’t benign; it helps set the stage for another inevitable spate of attacks. Less than a month after the speech, Ballymena exploded. Now the rhetoric doesn’t just seem opportunistic but dangerous, a shameful decision that now sits alongside Thatcher’s “swamped” comments as a political intervention that further causes divisions for short-term gains. The NF collapsed in the 80s, but today Reform – led by a man whosepolitical herois Enoch Powell – is pulling Labour to the right.What happens next in Northern Ireland is crucial. History shows that in the UK it’s often the victims of racial violence who are blamed. After 1919 in Wales, there was a voluntary repatriation scheme, while authorities installed a new piece of draconian immigration legislation, which forced all seamen to carry an identity card, known as a “certificate of nationality and identity issued to a British Colonial Seaman”. It was a measure that treated them like criminals.Immigrants have already started to leave Ballymena but, as in Cardiff, many will stay. Their lives will be shaped by whether or not political leadership learns the lessons of Britain’s history of racial violence.Lanre Bakare is an arts and culture correspondent for the Guardian.

How has No Kings managed to unite it?Emma BrockesA new slogan has offered a non-partisan rallying point – and last weekend, protests overshadowed the president’s weird military paradeThu 19 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 06.45 EDTShareTwo months ago, around the US, mass demonstrations against Donald Trump were organised in what felt like the beginning of the great unfreezing of the popular movement. Since the inauguration in January there have been plenty of ad-hoc anti-Trump protests, but compared to the huge numbers that turned out in 2017 – half a millionat the Women’s Marchin Washington DC alone – the response has been muted. What was the point? The threat was so large, and the failure of the first movement apparently so great, that Americans have been suffering from what appeared to be a case of embarrassed paralysis: a sense, at once sheepish and depressed, that pink hats weren’t moving the needle on this one.It looks as if that thinking has changed. On Saturday, in a follow-up to the protests in April, more than 2,000coordinated marches took placein the US, organised by multiple groups under the umbrella No Kings Day and attended by numbers that at a glance seem startling. While in the capital on Saturday, Trump oversaw his weird, sparsely attended Kim Jong-un stylemilitary parade, an estimated 5 million people country-wide took to the streets to protest peacefully against him, includingan estimated80,000 in Philadelphia,75,000 in Chicago,50,000 in New York,20,000 in Phoenix, and7,000 in Honolulu. More heartening still were the numbers from deep red states, such as the2,000 odd protesterswho gathered in Mobile, Alabama, and a reported4,000 in Louisville, Kentucky.These protests were different in nature to their earlier incarnations, according to the accounts of some of those in attendance. I was in New York last month and friends who’d been at the march in April recounted, with amusement and despair, how few young people had shown up. In addition, said a friend, an elderly demonstrator marching close to them had shushed the crowd and put her fingers in her ears, and another set of women had started dancing, obliviously, to the music being played by pro-Trump counter-protesters on the sidelines. All successful protests require participants to forgive each other their differences, but we shook with laughter as he told us how hopeless and uninspiring – “it’s a protest sweetie, what did you expect?” – he’d found some of his fellow marchers.It was a different story on Saturday. The crowds were bigger – by some estimates, thelargest country-wide demonstrationsever recorded – younger, more energised and more focused. There was, I gather, a sense of urgency unleashed by the feeling not only that these protests were long overdue but that, after Trump’s deployment of the national guard in LA, some critical line had been crossed. Meanwhile, as a unifying slogan, the No Kings thing really seems to be working. When I first heard the phrase I thought it was limp – my forelock-tugging Pavlovian response to the word “king” and any reference to monarchy, I guess.I forgot: Americans presented with the same word go to George III not Charles III, and the signs on Saturday took up No Kings with real relish. This is a significant victory, given how hard it is to unite diverse constituencies under a single, snappy umbrella. There were a lot of very funny signs on the marches (some standouts: “Only he could ruin tacos”; “If Kamala were president we’d be at brunch” and my favourite, “Trump cheats at golf”.) But overarching them all was a slogan that in the most efficient way possible presented multiple groups with a non-partisan way to come out against Trump.So far, No Kings has also avoided some of the mistakes of the Women’s March, in which the celebrity of the organisers came to overshadow and poison the movement. The No Kings motif was coined earlier this year by the progressive group 50501 – the name is a reference to 50 protests, 50 states, one movement – and was created before the 17 February demonstrations as an alternative to the hashtag #NotMyPresidentsDay, which it was felt, shrewdly, struck the wrong tone. Instead, the group launched the phrase “No Kings on Presidents Day,” which by this month had compacted down into No Kings Day. As yet, 50501, which grew out of a Reddit post, has no identifiable leaders.This makes it a much harder target for Trump’s “black propagandists” to divide protesters via their political differences. Instead, No Kings seems to be offering a very broad on-ramp to protesters by way of a story that is simple and true: that opposition to Trump’s autocratic style is an act of patriotism with its roots in the country’s very foundations.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsProtestOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But outrageousness has become the name of the gameThu 19 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 14.19 EDTShareNational tragedyused to bring national unity. If only momentarily, partisanship was put aside, and people of all political persuasions came together.No more. The nation received a startling reminder of that sad fact on Sunday when the Republican senator Mike Lee went online to share his reaction to the weekend’shorrible shootingof two Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses.“This is what happens,” Lee wrote in a since-removed post on X, “When Marxists don’t get their way.” Accompanying this ugly, unfounded comment was a photo of the suspect in the shooting, Vance Boelter, wearing what appears to be a latex face mask.As if that wasn’t enough, Lee posted another picture of Boelter under the caption “Nightmare on Waltz Street”, an apparent reference to the Minnesota governor and former Democratic nominee for vice-president, Tim Walz. During the 2024 campaign, Republicansaccusedhim of being soft on crime and mishandling the riots after the murder of George Floyd.So why not suggest that he is somehow to blame for the shootings?Shameful. Lee has dishonored the institution in which he serves, and he knows it.Republican Senate leaders should censure their colleague. If they do not, they will further shred whatever dignity is left in that body.Put in context, Lee’s posts show how far we have come from the vision and hopes of the founders of the American republic. Recall that James Madison, co-author of the Federalist Papers and fourth president of the US,warnedthat government by the people could become what he called a “spectacle … of turbulence and contention”, driven by passions to make decisions “adverse to the rights of others or the permanent and aggregate good of the community”.Madison preferred what he called a republic, a government in which representatives would display the wisdom necessary to “discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations”.Oddly enough, in October 2020, Lee channeled Madisonwhen he insisted“that our form of government in the United States is not a democracy, but a republic … Insofar as ‘democracy’ means ‘a political system in which government derives its powers from the consent of the governed’, then of course that accurately describes our system”. He continued: “But the word … is often used to describe … the view that it is the prerogative of government to reflexively carry out the will of the majority of its citizens.“Our system of government,” Lee noted, “is best described as a constitutional republic. Power is not found in mere majorities, but in carefully balanced power.” In that system, the job of the Senate, Lee suggested – citing Thomas Jefferson – is to cool “hot passions … It’s where consensus is forged, as senators reach compromise across regional, cultural, and partisan lines.”Perhaps the senator has forgotten those lines.His posts about theMinnesotashootings seem designed to further fuel the “hot passions” of our political moment, rather than to “cool” them. They surely do not help build consensus across party lines.Now Lee’s agenda seems different. He wants to show his Maga scapegoating bona fides by conjuring leftist plots as an explanation for every problem.And he is not the only member of the Maga crowd to do so. He was joined by Elon Musk, who wrote on X: “The far left is murderously violent.” Musk reposted the following from a person who identifies herself with these words: “GOD | #MAGA | Freedom |#Trump2024 | Constitutionalist | America First | Shall Not Be Infringed | USMC Wife”.“The left kills the CEO of United Healthcare. Kills two Israeli ambassadors staffers. Attempts twice to assassinate the President. Doxes and attempts to murder federal ICE agents and Police – all week. And now kills a MN state rep and her husband and injures a Senator and his wife. The left has become a full blown domestic terrorist organization.”Madison must be turning over in his grave.And, as to the evidence that supports Lee’s or Musk’s claims about the Minnesota suspect? There is none.Don’t forget that the president himselfhas frequently demonized“radical left lunatics” and labelled people Marxists. Last September, he blamed a “violent, radical-left monster” for the second attempt on his life.Using tragedy to demonize others and stoke fears about adversaries has become a new normal. No more rallying around the flag and doing the job that Madison thought political leaders in a representative democracy should and would do.In 2016, the Washington Post’s Karen Tumulty,writingin the wake of whatwas then the deadliest mass shootingin American history, suggested that “not since 9/11 has a moment like this brought the nation together, and that evaporated quickly. Since then, calamity seems only to drive the left and the right further apart, while faith in the nation’s institutions deteriorates further.”We know that Lee knows better than to do what he did on Sunday. He demonstrated that in 2020.So why, five years later, would he go after Walz or Marxists after a national tragedy? We can only speculate.Politicians like Leelive for and on social media. Legislating is hard; accumulating “likes” with a quick post is easier.Getting attention by being outrageous or provocative is the name of the game in whatis now referred toas the attention economy. Madison, who thought that any damage done by what he called “fractious leaders” would be limited to their local area, could never have imagined the gravitational pull of that economy or its global reach.Sadly, Lee’s posts are making him a winner in that economy. By Monday morning, the first of them had been viewed 5.3m times, and the second attracted 7.8m views.Not bad for someone with 799,000 followers on X.In a deeply divided nation riven by political sectarianism, Lee did what his partisan supporters expect him to do. Give no quarter. Be on the offensive. Push your point.These are the rules, even when a tragedy occurs. In fact, itincreasesthe “opportunity for free publicity” that people like Lee crave.But let’s be clear. While we can understand the forces that might explain why Lee turned tragedy into disinformation, that doesn’t mean we should accept or forgive him for doing so.In the kind of constitutional republic that Madison imagined and Lee once praised, tragedies like the murders in Minnesota should bring out the best in our leaders. Their dutywas, when Madison wrote, and remains today: “to remind us of our shared humanity, not deepen our political divides.”Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsUS SenateOpinionUS politicsMinnesotacommentShareReuse this content"

Initially presented as essential to prevent Tehran from the imminent acquisition of a nuclear bomb, a claim running counter to US intelligence, it is increasingly discussed asthe path to bringing down the regime. The defence minister, Israel Katz, has said that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, “can no longer be allowed to exist”.Donald Trump has generally seen armed conflict as a trap rather than an escape route. Hesaidthat the US would “measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end – and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into”. Yet his failure to achieve the Nobel-worthy peace deals he wants, and Mr Netanyahu’s manoeuvring, appear to have made him keener on US intervention. Israel wants US bunker-busters to attack the underground nuclear facility at Fordow. There isno guaranteethat those would succeed. Israel’s regime-ending aspirations further undermine its claim to offer what might be called, in the term infamously used of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a cakewalk. There isn’t a bad plan for the day after; there is no plan.What Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu have in common is that they consistently subsume their nations’ best interests to their personal political imperatives, and that neither cares about 90 million Iranians. The brutal theocratic regime isrepugnant to many, but hundreds of civilians have already died as Israel offers to bomb themto freedom, and the horrors of Gaza suggest that far worse could come. Many Iranianslived through the unforeseen and unwanted consequencesof toppling a hated ruler in 1979, and more watched those spawned by the US invasion of Iraq. Meanwhile, Israeli civilians now face Iranian retaliation.Israel’s impunity over its war of annihilation in Gaza has encouraged it to take this dangerous and illegal course. European leaders who were late to voice qualms about Gaza, and have muted them since the strikes on Iran began, should be takingconcrete actionto stop Israel’s assault as well as to promote negotiations. Unbelievably, Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz,described itas “dirty work Israel is doing for all of us” (he reportedly urged “moderation” in a subsequent call with Mr Netanyahu). He may change his mind if energy prices soar, this fragile region is further destabilised and state failure forces Iranians to flee to Europe.The attorney general, Richard Hermer, reportedlywarnedthat any British involvement with this war beyond defensive support would be illegal. Sir Keir Starmer is rightto call for de-escalation and negotiationto tackle the nuclear issue. Mr Trump likes the idea of quick wins, but knows high oil prices and intervention would alienate many of his backers. As of Thursday evening, Iran had avoided targeting US bases and assets, and its foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has reportedly spoken several times to Steve Witkoff, Mr Trump’s special envoy. Though that’s a long way from the “unconditional surrender” demanded by Mr Trump, there are escape routes from this crisis. Mr Netanyahu must not be allowed to destroy them.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Should terminally ill people be allowed to end their lives with medical help? If so, under what safeguards? The question remains ethically, medically and legally complex.Technological and social changes enabling people to live much longer have created challenges around the resourcing of care and experiences of ageing and dying. There are profound questions about how we manage the final stages of life – and what we owe to those living through them.Ms Leadbeater, a Labour backbencher, has taken on the challenge of steering this bill through parliament with principle and empathy. The past nine months have seen an impassioned debate that has, rightly, filtered beyond parliament and the news media into everyday life. From the start, as this newspapernoted, public opinion has sided with the bill’s backers.Yet even such public backing is tempered by serious concerns. Earlier this week,Gordon Browncited a poll commissioned by Care Not Killing in which two-thirds of respondents agreed that the government should “sort out palliative and social care first”. That concern is not misplaced. Too many people do not receive adequate end-of-life care. There is a danger that assisted dying, if introduced without sufficient protections or investment, could feel less like a choice and more like a pressure.Legalising assisted dying wouldn’t open the door to something entirely new – it would bring into the open aphenomenonthat already exists in the shadows. In Britain today, life and death decisions hinge on opaque prosecutorial discretion. Those who help a loved one die, often with kindness, face prosecution for murder or manslaughter. Or they may not. The Crown Prosecution Service decides, after a police investigation that can betraumatic: homes treated as crime scenes, phones seized, grieving families interrogated. For many, it’s not the act that scars, it’s the ordeal that follows.For the bill’s advocates, the goal is simple: to spare people needless suffering. Some have watched loved ones endure drawn-out deaths; others, like the TV presenterEsther Rantzen, want control over their own. Some doctors see assisted dying as a humane choice. Many supporters of the bill are motivated by compassion, but questions remain as to whether the necessary safeguards and public investment have been seriously addressed.While many believe that a choice about dying is their right, it is essential to reflect carefully on the implications of such a momentous change on people with less agency and fewer resources. For a parliament less than a year old, this is a moment of political maturity and a test of its ability to handle one of the most emotionally charged questions of our time.MPs may pass the bill on Friday, but there is no doubt that the legislation will need further refinement in the Lords and government assurance to ensure that compassion is not compromised by cost-cutting, that vulnerable people are not left exposed to subtle forms of coercion, and that the values of care and dignity are central to how we support those at the end of life.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Even saying this sells him a bit short. Of the 86 bowlers to go past 200 Test wickets, none have done so at a lower average than Bumrah’s 19.4. Only Kasigo Rabada, with a strike rate of 38.9 to Bumrah’s 42, takes his wickets more regularly.Ben Stokes calls on England to adapt better ‘when we’re up against the wall’Read moreThe numbers only improved during Bumrah’s last outing with a red ball, too, with theBorder-Gavaskar Trophy in Australialast winter returning 32 wickets at 13 runs apiece – one for every 28 deliveries he lashed down. His remains one of the most remarkable actions in the sport, a gentle trot of a run-up followed by a slingshot explosion that asks the batter an absurd number of split-second questions. “It’s awkward to face,” said Ben Stokes on Thursday. “Especially when you first go in, for those first couple of balls.”If there is something England can take from that BGT series it is that India still lost 3-1. And though something no one likes to see, Bumrah broke down midway through its Sydney finale when the burden of carrying an attack eventually told. The upshot of that experience, going bythe interviewhe gave to Dinesh Karthik for Sky Sports, is that playing three out of the five Tests this summer is the target.So cricket-lovers hoping to watch Bumrah in the flesh over the next six weeks will have fingers crossed that theirs is the lucky Wonka ticket. For Shubman Gill, a young captain leading areboot post-Virat Kohliand Rohit Sharma, it will be a case of trying to coax more out of the support cast. India are seeking their first series win in England since 2007 and their second in a five-Test series away from home.This being the20-year anniversary of the 2005 Ashes, thoughts go back to the similarly great Glenn McGrath and the fact that England capitalised on the Tests he missed for their two wins. Not that Stokes and his players will be content to take a lead and park the bus. The England captain accepted his team need to be a bit “smarter” than in the recent past but draws are still very much not his thing.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Shoaib Bashir will face a big test of his mettle when he bowls to Rishabh Pant.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesNeither is talking about the Ashes, which can only be good news. When India were here in 2021, Chris Silverwood, then England’s head coach, spoke of the series “galvanising” his players for the tour of Australia that winter and watched a fatigued, confused side fall 2-1 behind after four Tests. Had India stayed in the country that summer, rather than push the fifth Test back a year due to Covid andthen lose at Edgbaston, they may well have got the job done.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And, now that Kohli has hung up his boots, the premier batter across the two sides is unquestionably Joe Root. There are 373 runs between the fourth-placed Yorkshireman (13,006) and second in the all-time Test charts, after which only Sachin Tendulkar’s 15,921 will sit higher. Bumrah has taken Root’s wicket nine times – the batter he has dismissed most – and will try to stymie this march.With the newly minted Anderson-Tendulkar trophy on the line – and this the start of the nextWorld Test Championship– perhaps the biggest question for England surrounds the bowling since the former’s retirement. Chris Woakes, who has claimed 36 wickets at 20.9 since his return in 2023 and is yet to lose a Test under Stokes, leads an attack that has grunt but is notably raw. Among the head-to-heads that could prove decisive is when Rishabh Pant inevitably tries to take down Shoaib Bashir.However, this role may be something that Karun Nair also takes on, having utterly marmalised England’s spinners nine years ago during aremarkable unbeaten 303 in Chennai. The 33-year-old never kicked on from that match but has forced his way back through Kohli’s exit and some stellar domestic returns that included two spells at Northamptonshire. Of the many storylines in this series, his is one of perseverance.Like Nair’s recent form, the weather at Headingley is set to be red hot and sets up a tricky toss. The old saying in these parts is to look up, not down – ie bat under clear skies, bowl under cloud cover – but there will surely be a temptation to go the other way. In recent times, the pitch has tended to improve as the match has progressed, with thepast six Tests herewon by the side that has bowled first.For England, another subplot will also unfold 90 miles further north when Jofra Archer makes a first-class return – his first red-ball appearance since 2021 – for Sussex at Durham with an eye on playing the second Test in Birmingham. Archer is possibly the closest thing England have to Bumrah by way of unique attributes, although there really is only one.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketJoe RootfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is not that the hulking Scotland winger is being rude – he is polite to a fault – but after a gruelling gym session the British & Irish Lion has blisters as big as golf balls. A fist bump – a touch daunting given the size of his biceps – must suffice.Van der Merwe’s war wounds are the first indication that public perception about him can be misleading and there are many to follow in the ensuing half-hour. From an impassioned response to accusations he is a “SpringJock”, to discussing whyhe runs roughshod over England once a year, Van der Merwe is illuminating company.Marcus Smith at full-back against Argentina as Lions aim to ‘set tone’ for tourRead moreHe is 6ft 4in and looks carved from Rustenburg granite. There is something cartoonish about the way he thunders past – or through – defenders and with gleaming blond hair he can list Johnny Bravo and Action Man as doppelgangers. Yet “show pony” and “flat-track bully” are brushes he can be tarred with. “I probably make my life a little bit more difficult by diving into the corners when I don’t have to,” he says with a chuckle. “Sometimes it’s just getting that nice photo, that’s why I dive.”He speaks with an unmistakable Afrikaans accent – arriving in Edinburgh in 2017 he struggled with his English to the extent he would get frustrated at his failure to grasp Scottish humour – so it makes sense to cut to the chase. He is often held up as a “project player”, a junior Springbok who sought his fortune with a country less blessed with 17st wingers. In short, his Scottishness has been questioned. No matter, it seems, that five years on from making his debut – qualifying after three years’ residency – Van der Merwe is Scotland’s record try-scorer.After being selected for his second Lions tour he was among the players born in the southern hemisphere whose place in the squad was questioned. Given the grief he was exposed to by opposition players and supporters four years ago in South Africa, there must be times when he feels he cannot win.View image in fullscreenVan der Merwe wants to prove his fitness for the British & Irish Lions having played 11 minutes since the Six Nations.Photograph: Dan Sheridan/Inpho/ShutterstockFor those that question his allegiance to Scotland, Van der Merwe points to how he failed a medical when about to sign for Edinburgh, aged 22, in 2017.He might have been cast aside, left in limbo, without a club and eight months of rehabilitation to manage alone, but Edinburgh, and Richard Cockerill, took a chance on him and he has repaid the faith in spades.“When I speak about it, I get really emotional because it’s a country that has given me so much when I had nothing,” says Van der Merwe, who arrived at Edinburgh after an ill-fated season with Montpellier. “I had a failed medical and at that time it would have been easy for them to say: ‘Look, you’ve failed your medical – off you go.’ But they looked after me.“I went over as a young boy and people don’t understand how hard it is, leaving your family behind, leaving everything behind, going to a country where you don’t know how things work.“Initially, my English wasn’t good at all. It was tough. People don’t understand how hard that transition is. It’s not easy, no one has guaranteed me: ‘Oh, Duhan, if you move over at the age of 22 you’ll be Scotland’s top try-scorer, you’ll have played 49 games for Scotland, you’ll go on a second Lions tour.’ People don’t see the amount of hard work and sacrifice you put in because I wouldn’t be sitting here without it.”View image in fullscreenVan der Merwe hits his stride during a Lions training camp in Faro, Portugal.Photograph: Dan Sheridan/INPHO/ShutterstockVan der Merwe, now 30, had a mixed experience on tour four years ago. He was, understandably enough, appointed tour guide before being sacked within a week by his teammates because there was only so much of his native South Africa he could showcase when cooped in a Covid bubble. While stadiums were empty, it did not stop South African supporters having their say on social media.“I always knew they were going to get stuck into me,” he says. “There were a lot of personal messages on social media towards me. I just dust it off because I know how hard I’ve worked to get to where I am. You always have people on social media who are going to bring you down and slate you, but I’ve got to a point in my career where it doesn’t faze me at all.”Whereas Van der Merwe had appeared 10 times for Scotland when selected for the Lions four years ago, he is now a mainstay of Gregor Townsend’s side, arguably their most potent weapon. An ankle injury in March has restricted him to 11 minutes of action since the Six Nations, however. He makes his comeback in the Lions’ warm-up match against Argentina in Dublin on Friday, but it was an anxious wait to discover if he would make the squad, not least because it was announced alphabetically – forwards, then backs – andVan der Merwe’s was the 37thof the 38 names read out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I guess you take yourself back: ‘Have I done enough over the four-year cycle? Have I done enough over the Six Nations?’ And then you start doubting yourself a wee bit. It was really tough because I felt like I couldn’t do anything about it.“I was in shock for a full 24 hours because I just couldn’t believe it because of the ankle. It really gives me a lot of confidence.”Van der Merwe started all three Testsagainst the Springboks in 2021and against the Pumas has the chance to lay down an early marker with his closest rival, James Lowe, arriving later to the squad. “I believe if I can get as many touches as possible, somehow I can get a line break or get some gainline for the team or score some tries,” he says.“I’ve worked hard at other parts of my game – if you look at the Six Nations I probably didn’t score as much but I probably assisted a bit more. Somehow I always have my best game of the season against England. The boys at the club have told me: ‘Duey, just imagine you’re seeing white jerseys in front of you.’”After a brief stint with Worcester – hastily returning to Edinburgh whenthe Warriors went bust– Van der Merwe feels Scotland is his long-term home. He has even gone into business with his Edinburgh, Scotland and Lions teammate Pierre Schoeman – also born in South Africa – setting up a whisky company. They sell a 12-year-old single malt from Speyside called Hirundine, aptly named after the bird that migrates between Africa and the UK.“Coming back to my story of giving back to Scotland and what better way for us to say thank you and give back than starting our own whisky company? I don’t agree with some of the things people say because it’s not easy – the biggest thing for me is buying into the culture and that’s something I’ve done really well.“I see Scottish people as some of my best mates, Pierre and I have started our own business, my wife has got her own company in Scotland as well. I’m still in Edinburgh and I’m loving life.”Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsRugby unionScotland rugby union teaminterviewsShareReuse this content"

Barrios met it in stride and hit a first-time, right-footed shot that rattled the underside of the crossbar on its way in.Barrios’ second in the 55th minute was simpler, as he was permitted time and space to hit a half-volley past goalkeeper Stefan Frei after Seattle’s failure to clear Marcos Llorente’s long throw from the right.Before half-time, Atlético had an apparent chance to double their lead from the penalty spot taken away after referee Yael Falcon Perez reversed his initial decision after a video review.The sides then traded goals in the first five minutes of the second half.

Mudryk is facing a four-year ban if he is found guilty by the FA of taking a banned substance.Maresca said he still trusts the Ukraine international and plans to check on his welfare soon, but Chelsea’s head coach added that he has had no contact with the 24-year-old since May. “I spoke with Misha in Poland when we played the Conference League final,” he said. “I didn’t speak with him since that time.Chelsea make Gittens top target and keep Kudus and João Pedro in sightsRead more“To be honest, I didn’t see the news. They communicated to me last night.“The last time I spoke with Misha he was quite good. I didn’t see him worried or at least I didn’t see him not good. Since that day I didn’t speak with him, so I don’t know how he is now. But for sure in the next days and weeks we are going to have direct contact with him.”Mudryk has not played since November and wasprovisionally suspended the following monthafter producing a positive A sample. It is believed the banned performance-enhancing substance meldonium was found in his system.“Misha is a Chelsea player,” Maresca said. “Until he’s not a Chelsea player, I will trust all the Chelsea players. It’s not just about Misha. It is in general.”Maresca said Chelsea would sign a winger regardless of the outcome of Mudryk’s case. They are keen on Borussia Dortmund’s Jamie Gittens and have made an inquiry for Lyon’s Malick Fofana.“We had already one entire season almost without Misha,” Maresca said. “We’re going to decide to go for a winger not because of Misha.

Like Groucho Marx, the world’s most daily football email has its principles and if you don’t like them … well, we have other ones. Those familiar with its work will be aware that Fifa is no different, but has still come as something of a surprise that having for so long publicly (if a little hollowly) purported to be against injustice of any kind, world football’s governing body abandoned its planned campaigns against racism and discrimination across the opening three days of the Copa Gianni being staged in the USA USA USA. Following a backlash, some pithy slogans were rolled out on Wednesday, albeit seemingly on the proviso that this token gesture would be for one day of this month-long jamboree only.While the dimwits who think politics should have no place in football will view Fifa’s non-stance as a victory, it is difficult to imagine what they made of Wednesday’s delegation of Juventus representatives at the Oval Office, where assorted players, staff and suits were forced to stand behind Donald Trump as he briefed his favoured correspondents on a possible attack on Iran, a bizarre soliloquy regarding the bodycount in the American Civil War and how “bigly” the crowd at Juve’s Copa Gianni match against Al Ain would be a few hours later. With Gianni Infantino gazing adoringly from his basket in the corner, the 47th president of the United States of America also tried unsuccessfully to bait some or all of his visitorsinto making transphobic comments.View image in fullscreenThere he is.Photograph: Ken Cedeno/EPAShowing all the enthusiasm and joie de vivre of captives in a hostage video, a group of players including USA USA USA internationals Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah looked on with a mixture of thinly veiled contempt and … no,just thinly veiled contempt. Speaking after Juve’s win over Al Ain later that evening, Weah stated that he and his teammates had been forced into participating in this tawdry photo op by their employers. “It was all a surprise to me, honestly,” he sighed. “They told us that we have to go and I had no choice but to go. I was caught by surprise, honestly. It was a bit weird. When he started talking about the politics with Iran and everything, it’s kind of like … I just want to play football, man.” Previouslyan outspoken criticof Trump’s disregard for black people among his myriad other shortcomings, McKennie stayed silent on this occasion but, if looks could kill, the midfielder would almost certainly have been bundled out of the office by the president’s secret service detail.Elsewhere in Copa Gianni, Manchester City got their campaignoff to a winning startagainst Wydad AC despite losing Rico Lewis to a late red card that simultaneously looked very harsh and entirely justified, while Merseyside’s most famous Hispanophone made his eagerly awaited debut for his new sidein their draw with Al-Hilal. “It’s an incredible day for me to make my Real Madrid debut,” cheered Trent Alexander-Arnold in his post-match interview, speaking in his native tongue on this occasion, presumably out of fear any Ice goons lurking nearby would be so impressed by his proficiency in Spanish that he might end in the back of a van being ferried to a detention centre.QUOTE OF THE DAY“Many question why our national team is in this situation and why there is a lack of talent, one reason being the losses due to piracy. All the money that is lost every year is not invested in the youth teams and in the growth of our young players, a major issue that has led our national team to face many difficulties … We are already far behind the Premier League and La Liga.

He talked about the need to restore enthusiasm to anAzzurriside whose morale has been dented by recent setbacks, as well as that sense of shared purpose that bonded him to teammates in the World Cup-winning side of 2006.The word he kept coming back to was “family”, insisting: “That’s the most important thing, more than tactics or formations.” His is not a vision of paternalistic authority but of a group close enough to speak hard truths to each other’s faces.‘A symbol of Italian football’: Azzurri appoint Gennaro Gattuso as head coachRead more“In moments of difficulty, when you feel alone and don’t hear the voice of your teammate, those are the 90 minutes that feel never-ending,” said Gattuso. “This is what we need to change. We need to help each other, we need to say those things that maybe you don’t want to hear, because that’s the only way you grow.”They will have no shortage of material. Italy’s men’s team are at an all-time low. Havingfailed to qualifyfor consecutive World Cups, their attempts to reach next summer’s tournament are in jeopardy aftera 3-0 thrashing by Norwayin their opening game of Group I.That result led the Italian football federation (FIGC) to sack Luciano Spalletti as manager, though he persuaded them to allow him one more game. The idea was to leave on a more positive note, and perhaps that was achieved in a2-0 win over Moldova, though the pre-game conference at which he in effect confirmed his own termination made for an awkward occasion.How had it come to this? Spalletti’s Italy were a disappointment at the Euros last summer, putting up a feeble defence of their 2021 triumph as they scraped out of their group witha 98th-minute equaliser against Croatiabeforelosing meekly to Switzerland.The manager had been dealt a tough hand, replacing Roberto Mancini midway through qualifying. It was easy to argue he deserved time to implement his vision after steering Napoli to their first Serie A title in 33 years. But what was the point in continuing, if the federation’s faith in him was always this fragile?Gattuso’s appointment raises more questions about their approach. The FIGC’s president, Gabriele Gravina, confirmed on Thursday that they had approached Claudio Ranieri first. That would have been a popular choice – a man with a reputation for rescuing teams in times of emergency, fresh fromone last miraclewith his boyhood team, Roma.But Ranieri already has a new job, moving upstairs as a senior adviser for theGiallorossi. As he explained it this week: “I respect the national team, but I belong to Roma.” Gravina sought to portray it not as a rejection but merely a respectful conversation with the club’s ownership.Whatever the truths of that story, it is a hard pivot from Ranieri –who made Leicester championsand has written countless brilliant chapters in his almost 40 years of management – to Gattuso, who has not yet left such a mark on any of the nine clubs he has led since 2013.View image in fullscreenGennaro Gattuso during his official presentation.Photograph: Fabio Frustaci/EPAThere are always different ways to tell a story. Is Gattuso, 47, a man who has repeatedly fallen short of his clubs’ objectives – failing to reach the Champions League with Milan and Napoli, finishing third in Croatia with Hajduk Split and not even lasting a full season with Valencia and Marseille in between?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For Italy to miss a third consecutive World Cup ought to be unthinkable, but the lopsided nature of their defeat by Norway, who have played two more games and won both, means even a perfect record from here on may only land them back into the playoffs from which they have failed to progress in each of the past two cycles.If the goal were only to make Italy a family again, Gattuso would have every chance of success. His presence at the podium alongside Buffon felt like a homecoming, albeit an understated one, the heroes of 2006 given their opportunity to lead. Journalists prefaced questions not with deferential honorifics but instead a familiar “ciao Rino”.In the end, though, the requirements of this job remain the same as they always were. Gattuso needs to win, starting with his first game, at home to Estonia in September. This family is sick of losing. He will hear hard truths soon enough, and from more people than he may care to, if he cannot make it stop.Explore more on these topicsItalyWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With temperatures hovering over 30C on Andy Murray Arena, the Spaniard was 4-2 down in the final set, having lost four games in a row. To add to his sense of peril and woe, his serve was also misfiring and he had just hit his 50th unforced error. Yet he found a way – just as he hadduring the French Open finalearlier this month.Coco Gauff stunned in first match since winning French Open titleRead moreA few minutes – and a series of inspired winners – later Alcaraz was shaking hands with his compatriot Jaume Munar having won 6-4, 6-7 (7), 7-5 in an epic that lasted a little under three hours and 30 minutes. It was the longest match at Queen’s Club since MaliVai Washington faced Mark Keil in 1991, with the second set alone taking an hour and 42 minutes. As Alcaraz pithily wrote on the BBC TV courtside camera: “Were we on clay?”The fact Munar was able to hit a barrage of 135mph howitzers on serve told you we were on the green stuff, but nothing else about this match made sense.Alcaraz double-faulted on match point when he had a chance to win in straight sets. His serve was patchy. And while there were the usual moments of genius, this was a day of struggle and strife. However, Munar, the world No 59, was magnificent. Having lost his serve early in the first set after serving three double faults in a row, he happily traded blows from the back of the court and showed granite resolve under pressure.Meanwhile, Alcaraz took out his frustration on his coach Samuel López and complained to the umpire after a time violation as the heat and his opponent’s play got to him.“It was a really tough battle, Alcaraz said. “I struggled a lot mentally and physically. I still don’t know how I am standing here but I am really proud to have given myself another chance in the quarter-finals.”This was his 15 consecutive victory, his longest winning streak in his career but Alcaraz said that even he did not know how he was able to turn the match around. “I just kept fighting, I guess. I didn’t give up. I tried to fight and play my best on the return of the serve. But I still don’t know.”View image in fullscreenJacob Fearnley is through to his first ATP Tour quarter-final with a win over Corentin Moutet.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAEarlier, the Frenchman Corentin Moutet lost his temper and his last 16 match to Britain’s Jacob Fearnley. This time last year, few outside tennis circles would have heard of Fearnley, a 23-year-old from Worcester. But he steadily climbed into the world’s top 50, on the back of a big forehand and thoroughly deserved his 6-3, 2-6, 6-2 win which puts him into an ATP Tour quarter-final for the first time in his career.However, the match will largely be remembered for Moutet ranting at the umpire after being given two time violations in the third set – as well as a code violation for ball abuse. “I am running every day for three hours and you are telling me what I have to do,” he told the umpire. “I explain it to you and you give me a time violation without listening to me.

The Gosden stable’s seven-year-old faced two four-year-old rivals with a touch more class but no experience of racing at two and a half miles and when Buick challenged them to catch him with a quarter of a mile to run, neither Illinois nor Candelari could summon a response.Candelari was a spent force with half a mile left, while Illinois’s brief effort in the home straight scarcely made an impression on Trawlerman’s lead as he galloped on relentlessly for the line. He had a seven-length advantage at the post and it was seven more back to Dubai Future in third.Royal Ascot 2025: Trawlerman nets biggest prize with Gold Cup triumph – as it happenedRead more“It was the only way we were going to win,” saidJohn Gosden, who has won the feature event on the first three days of the meeting. “We had to say, if you’re going to beat me, you’re going to know you’ve been in a race, because you’re going to have to go two and a half miles at a proper gallop.“William [had] said: ‘From four out, I’m going to notch it up, notch it up, notch it up. So if they stay, they’re going to have to stay every inch.’ He rode him perfectly and judged it beautifully. It’s not an easy thing to do over two and a half miles.“I take nothing from the second. He’s a fabulous horse, but two and a half miles truly run is not his game. Falsely run, he’d be fine.”Gosden summoned up the memory of a great stayer of the past – the three-time winner Sagaro, with Lester Piggott in the saddle – to explain the appeal of a hard-galloping stayer like Trawlerman and acknowledged that his horse had been beaten by an outstanding champion in the now retiredKyprios in this race last year.“He ran Kyprios to a length and they were both all out,” Gosden said. “So he deserves, with Kyprios not here, to come back and show he’s a proper horse over this trip.“I remember the great horses that Lester Piggott rode, like Sagaro, the way he could run the last six furlongs in one [minute] 12 [seconds] flat. That’s what I like, a horse that can go the distance, and then go, and you can’t catch them.”Illinois was seen as a possible successor to Kyprios and Aidan O’Brien’s mighty stayer Yeats before the race, but the search for the next Gold Cup winner from Ballydoyle now seems likely to shift to the three-year-old crop.

Don’t be surprised if you don’t see him again until the Henry II [Stakes in May] next year.“He doesn’t need to be going to all those [summer cup] races or he might come back here for that race in the autumn [the stayers’ event on Champions Day in October], he’s won that [before], and then we’ll put him away.”This was a fifth win of the meeting for the John and Thady Gosden team, but not enough to keep them in the lead in the race to be the leading trainer as O’Brien, the winner in eight of the past 10 seasons, completed a 44-1 treble.Charles Darwin (8-13) was an impressive winner of the opening Norfolk Stakes, while Garden Of Eden (7-1) took the Group Two Ribblesdale Stakes and Trinity College, the 5-2 favourite, made all the running in the Group Three Hampton Court Stakes.The treble sent Ryan Moore well clear of his rivals for the top jockeys’ prize with five winners. He is two clear of Oisin Murphy – who had a 42-1 double on Arabian Story in the Britannia Handicap and Never So Brave in the concluding Buckingham Palace Stakes – and three ahead of a trio of riders – including Buick and James Doyle – with two wins.Kon Tiki can sail to successZarigana, who got the Poule D’Essai Des Pouliches (French 1,000 Guineas) in the stewards’ room, is the only runner in Friday’s Coronation Stakes with a previous Group One victory to her name but still faces significant opposition as she pursues a second after two unbeaten fillies – Falakeyah and Kon Tiki – were given £46k supplementary entries at the weekend.Falakeyah in particular has captured the punters’ imagination, and Owen Burrows’s filly has since replaced Zarigana at the top of the betting with most firms.She is back in trip after running away with the Pretty Polly at Newmarket – often seen as a trial for the 12-furlong Oaks – but showed plenty of speed in the early part of the race and should cope with the drop to a mile.Zarigana could easily be unbeaten in five as her sole defeat was in a head-bobber for the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac at Longchamp in October.This is far from a two-horse race, however, and the 7-1 shotKon Tiki (4.20), who has very similar claims to Falakeyah on her form, accelerated impressively to win a Listed race at York’s Dante meeting in May.On paper, this is a significant step up in class but that was a strong field for the level and she won in an excellent time, with more in hand than a half-length margin might suggest.Royal Ascot 2.30Gold Diggershowed an excellent turn of foot to justify market support on debut at Yarmouth in May and could be over-priced at around 8-1 to follow up in what looks an open renewal of the Albany Stakes.Royal Ascot 3.05Two of 2024’s Group One-winning juveniles are in the lineup for this year’s Commonwealth Cup andShadow Of Light,who was Europe’s top-rated two-year-old thanks to a rare double in the Middle Park and Dewhurst Stakes, will be tough to beat dropping back to the Middle Park’s six-furlong trip. He showed excellent speed to quicken into the lead in the 2,000 Guineas in May before fading late on behind Ruling Court and Tuesday’sSt James’s Park Stakes winner, Field Of Gold, and this return to a stiff sprint trip promises to play to his strengths.RoyalAscot3.40Roger Varian’sFrench Dukehas yet to run this season but is the type to make significant further progress as a four-year-old having been gelded over the winter.

However, the Zimbabwean confirmed her family would not be following suit.Kirsty Coventry’s in-tray: six big issues facing IOC’s new presidentRead more“We won’t be staying in the Palace,” she said. “I really want my kids to grow up doing the same thing that I did, making beds and doing our chores and being kids.”Coventry, who won seven Olympic medals during her swimming career, said the significance of being thefirst female IOC presidenthad hit her only when she started reading the messages of support from other women. Asked for more details, Coventry said: “I think I will start crying, so might have to do that another time. But the sentiments were really just around: ‘Thank you;’ ‘You’re such an inspiration;’ ‘This is so incredible.’“In the last few days, I’ve started having a little bit of time to really go through or re go through some of the messages came through, and I’m now having a much greater understanding of that importance [of being appointed]. And as we get closer to the 23rd realise that, yes, it’s an exciting day, but it’s also a day with a lot of responsibility to ensure that we make and I make the right decisions. But I’m very proud of the fact that we as a membership have chosen this point in time to elect our first female president.”Coventry also made it clear she wanted IOC members to feel free to speak their minds and had invited them to stay two extra nights in Lausanne next week to have a “pause and reflect workshop” to hear their ideas. “The way I like to lead is with collaboration,” she said. “I like people to say: ‘Yes, I had a say and this was the direction that we went.’ That way you get a really authentic buy-in.”The 41-year-old made it clear she campaigned for the IOC job to change people’s lives for the better and not for the prestige involved. “After I was elected my husband started giggling at the breakfast table and he looked at me and he goes: ‘Do you realise you’re the most powerful person in sport?’” she said.“And I was like: ‘What are you talking about?’ For me, it’s not about the title. It wasn’t about power. Sometimes those things get in the way and they make you focus on maybe the wrong things.

Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianWhen a small Swedish town discovered their drinking water contained extremely high levels of Pfas, they had no idea what it would mean for their health and their children’s futureByMarta ZaraskaThu 19 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 09.47 EDTShareIf Agneta Bruno closes her eyes, the soapy smell takes her back to childhood. Cycling home to the barracks where she lived with her father, an air force major, she would whiz through patches of snowy-white foam near the entrance of the base. The foam resembled the bubbles you get in the bathtub, just thicker. “I had to lift my feet up to avoid getting wet,” Bruno told me.Aqueous film-forming foam (Afff) is a miracle of firefighting: it’s highly effective in putting out flammable liquid fires, such as those caused by jet fuel spills. Chemicals in the foam create a stable blanket over liquid fuel, trapping the flammable vapours and extinguishing the fire. At the air force base in Bruno’s home town of Kallinge inSweden, firefighters were trained to douse flames using the foam. New recruits came every few weeks, so the training sessions were pretty constant. Afterwards, the foam would soak away into the sandy soil and disappear.Kallinge is a small, tired-looking town in southern Sweden, dotted with small, wooden houses in various colours, many in need of fresh paint. A large factory dominates the centre: it has been makingcast-iron cookwarefor more than 300 years. The military base is on the outskirts, a short drive through a pine forest. The population numbers about 4,500, and the air is so clean that you can smell someone smoking from across the street.On 16 December 2013, the residents of Ronneby municipality, which includes Kallinge, heard on the news that their tap water had been switched over to a different source. The water supply, which had won awards for being one of the cleanest in Sweden, had been found to contain high levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or Pfas. These synthetic chemicals, widely used in industrial processes and manufacturing, are often called “forever chemicals” because they do not break down easily and can stay in the environment for hundreds of years, or even longer.News reports said the chemicals had seeped into the municipal water system from the firefighting foam used at the airbase. It had been going on for years, even decades, but no one had previously thought to check the water forPfas, which have no taste or smell. Nonetheless, the municipality’s message to residents was reassuring: the old water supply had now been shut down and switched over to a clean source.To many in Ronneby, including municipality staff, forever chemicals were still largely a mystery. “In December 2013, Pfas was completely unknown to us,” said Roger Fredriksson, who was mayor at the time. Ninnie Wikström, a green tech entrepreneur now in her early 40s who has lived in the area on and off since she was a child, was not unduly worried by the announcement. “Nobody knew what it was and how dangerous it was,” she recalled. Herman Afzelius, Wikström’s ex-husband, an IT business manager with startling blue eyes who moved to Kallinge in 2002, also saw no great cause for alarm: yes, there had been something in the water, but now it was fine. He got on with his life. It was almost Christmas, after all.MapThe next day, 17 December, the Swedish Food Agency made an announcement which to many sounded reassuring: the chemicals did not “pose an acute health risk”. While drinking a cup of Ronneby’s tap water wouldn’t make you acutely sick, the issue was the long-term consequences. In the past 12 years, far more research has been conducted into links between Pfas and diseases such as cancer and diabetes, but even back in 2013, a reasonable amount was known about the health risks associated with these chemicals. Production and use of perfluorooctane sulfonate, or Pfos, one of the main types of Pfas found in Ronneby’s water, had beenrestricted in the EUsince 2009 (though firefighting foams were excluded from that restriction).A few days after the initial discovery, Ronneby’s administrators contacted researchers at nearby Lund University. They knew that the drinking water had been heavily contaminated with Pfas; the question was to what extent this showed up in local people’s blood. Since children are particularly vulnerable to chemical pollutants, they would start by testing 11-year-olds from Ronneby’s schools. In February 2014, the blood samples arrived at the lab of Christian Lindh, an occupational health researcher. When Lindh ran his tests, he found the results so impossibly high, he had to run them again, to “double check”. Children from affected areas had more than37 times the amount of Pfasin their blood than children from outside the contaminated zone.Once again, the municipality attempted to ease locals’ concerns. In a press release, a Lund physician was quoted as saying there was no reason to expect “that the children will develop any diseases in the future caused by Pfas”. Since the news about the children’s study was couched in such reassuring terms, Afzelius, like many others in Ronneby, didn’t really start to worry until he received a letter asking him to have a blood test. The letter, adorned with logos of the Ronneby municipality, the Skåne region and Lund University, called for all local residents to get tested for Pfas. “That was actually the first time I reacted. I thought, ‘Why do they want to test my blood?’” Afzelius said.In the centre of Kallinge, next to a supermarket that serves as a meeting spot for the locals, is a squat, mustard-coloured medical clinic. It was here that people lined up in the spring of 2014 to get their blood tested for Pfas. The queues were long and the atmosphere was tense. People were feeling “a mix of worry, confusion and growing mistrust”, Afzelius recalled.The results came by post a few months later. Afzelius was shocked by what he read. To help recipients interpret the numbers, the letter included comparison results. Afzelius’s Pfas levels were at least nine times higher than the people from outside the contaminated area. “I instantly thought, OK, damn, this is really, really high,” he said. His case was far from the worst. Some people in Ronneby found themselves staring at numbers more than1,000 timesthe level that is, today, considered safe.It was official: Ronneby was the world’s worst known case of Pfas contamination. But at the time, few outsiders noticed. The media didn’t offer much coverage – that would come later – and the residents were left to work out what all this meant for them. The trouble was that nobody seemed to know.Following the discovery that he had high levels of Pfas in his blood, Afzelius tried to eradicate forever chemicals from his life. It was close to impossible. He got rid of outdoor clothing that had been treated with Pfas to make it waterproof, and he threw out his microwavable popcorn and baking parchment, but the list of Pfas sources is so long that it was hard to keep up. These chemicals are in saucepans and sun cream, dental floss and carpet fibres, pizza boxes and walking boots. They have been found in meat, fish and eggs. We not only ingest them, we absorb them through our skin. After Afzelius redecorated his kitchen he learned that there were Pfas in wallpaper.The first Pfas were developed in the 1930s by German scientists and used for insulating electric wiring. Many more types of Pfas followed. Today there may bemore than 14,500forever chemicals, and new ones are constantly added to the list. Pfas don’t decompose at high temperatures or when exposed to aggressive chemicals, which makes them useful in manufacturing. To make Pfas, scientists replace hydrogen atoms attached to carbon with fluorine, creating a bond so strong that the molecule doesn’t interact with other substances, such as water or frying oil. Its strength means that almost nothing can break it down, in the body or in the environment.View image in fullscreenHerman Afzelius, one of the key campaigners in the Ronneby Pfas case, at his home in Kallinge.Photograph: Josefine StenersenOne thing Afzelius couldn’t part with was his Teflon pan: it was just too convenient. Teflon, which is a brand name for a chemical polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), was one of the earliest forms of Pfas to be developed in the 1960s. A whitish powder discovered by chance by scientists at the US chemical companyDuPont, it proved to be remarkably useful in a wide range of household products. Aside from non-stick pans, it helps lightbulbs handle extreme heat and enables the hot plates in styling tongs to glide over hair.Like Teflon, the firefighting foam that leaked into Ronneby’s water system was developed in the 1960s. By the 2010s, after years of research, scientists had started to identify links between certain cancers andPfas in firefighting foam, and in the protective equipment the firefighters wear. There are of course other risk factors for firefighters, including fumes inhaled from fires, which complicates research. What we do know, Jeff Burgess, a toxicologist at the University of Arizona told me, is that exposure to certain chemicals is associated with increased cancer risks – such as PFOA, a type of Pfas, and testicular cancer.As scientists amassed more evidence of the detrimental health effects of Pfas, the list of places where groundwater or soil had been contaminated by Afff foam kept growing: Korsør in Denmark; El Paso County in the US; Saint-Louis in France. In the UK, severalmilitary sitesare now under investigation after Pfas from firefighting foams leached into drinking water sources.Yet none of these places is even close to Ronneby in terms of the levels of contamination. The Pfas levels that were found in Ronneby’s water were not just “high” – they were the highest ever discovered in any municipal drinking water:2,450 timesabove the safety threshold that would be introduced in 2023.“The population was extremely exposed, even compared with other highly exposed populations,” said Annelise Blomberg, an epidemiologist at Lund University.View image in fullscreenKallinge in the Ronneby municipality, Sweden.Photograph: Josefine StenersenMany citizens across the globe have taken up the fight against Pfas. In the US, under asettlement announced in May, the industrial chemicals company 3M will pay up to $450m to compensate the people of New Jersey for contaminating their environment with forever chemicals. Perhaps the most famous legal battle over forever chemicals took place in West Virginia and Ohio, where people living near the DuPont Teflon-manufacturing plant, who had suffered damage to their health and to their livestock from chemicals in the water, launched a class action lawsuit. (The story became the basis for the movie Dark Waters.)As part of asettlement reached in 2004, DuPont agreed to fund a study into the effects of PFOA. By 2013, the results were pouring in: scientists found links between PFOA and testicular, kidney, prostate and ovarian cancers and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. They found evidence of a higher risk ofthyroid problems. They found a “probable link” between exposure to PFOA and conditions includinghigh cholesterol and ulcerative colitis.But, by this stage, these chemicals were everywhere.When Afzelius talks, he looks straight at you, eyes wide, his face earnest. His friends say he is a fighter, determined, committed. The word “stubborn” gets mentioned, too. “I like to get details, dig into stuff,” is how he put it to me. After he received his blood test results, Afzelius read many of the early studies on Pfas. The more he learned, the more he felt that the government’s message was too casual. “The communication from the start has been: no need to worry, no one’s going to be sick,” he said. He was increasingly worried about what all this might mean for him and for his daughter with Wikström, Nahla, who was four.In June 2014, Afzelius started a Facebook group, which quickly gained hundreds of members. People shared test results and posted links to studies. They managed to get a meeting with city officials, representatives of the armed forces and researchers from Lund University. It was held at a school in Kallinge. So many people showed up that the crowd spilled out of the low brick building. “The crowd was like when you look at pictures from the 18th century – people standing with flaming torches and pitchforks,” recalled Sara Blixt.View image in fullscreenHerman Afzelius and Ninnie Wikström’s daughters, Nahla (left) and Lovis, in the garden of their home in Kallinge.Photograph: Josefine StenersenAt the meeting, the audience kept asking: will Pfas make us sick? Can you get rid of it from your blood? Some people started shouting – very uncharacteristic behaviour in Sweden. Representatives from the municipality, standing on stage, asked people to “keep it down” and “stay calm”, but to little effect. “I remember someone was shouting, “But what are you going to do? We are poisoned!’” Blixt said. Afzelius found some of the experts condescending. He recalled one of them saying, “I’m a chemist. Are you?” He had the feeling that the officials just wanted to move on.Afzelius and a number of other locals decided to take matters into their own hands. The first meeting of what became the Pfas Association took place around Afzelius’s kitchen table. The six people gathered became the board of directors. They wrote their ideas on Post-it notes and stuck them all over Afzelius’s kitchen cabinets. By the time the meeting finished, after three or four hours, they had resolved they would take their case to court.It was a big gamble. In West Virginia and Ohio, the affected residents who filed a class-action lawsuit against DuPont ended up securing a$670m settlement. Nothing like that was possible in Ronneby. “Many countries, including Sweden, don’t have legislation equipped for this type of lawsuit,” says Markus Segerström, a lawyer who represents dozens of people from Ronneby against the municipal water provider. Instead, each person had to sue on their own, risking their own money. And they couldn’t sue for damages simply because their water had contained forever chemicals. “Under current Swedish law, you typically need a diagnosed illness – which most people with elevated Pfas levels in their blood do not have,” Segerström said. “Part of our argument is that the courts should, through case law, expand the scope of compensation to include Pfas exposure even without a formal diagnosis. Historically, compensation in Sweden has been limited to concrete harm or clearly documented economic losses – such as a doctor’s visit or a prescription. You need to prove specific costs.”Sweden doesn’t have a no-win, no-fee system: if you lose, you end up paying all the legal bills and your opponent’s, too. “It’s scary,” Afzelius said. “Here all the financial risk has been on us.” Since Ronneby is home to many low-income families, even the initial court filing fee, 2,800 kronor per person (£210), was too much for some. What’s more, many people in Ronneby either worked for the armed forces or the municipality, or were subcontractors to one of them, so they were “afraid to speak up, fearing they might lose their jobs or face a backlash”, Afzelius said.The case launched in July 2016 with 165 plaintiffs. The media, which had initially followed the municipality’s line on the relatively low risk to residents, now ran stories about Pfas “poisoning”. The case dragged on for months, and then years; it was a new area of law and a lot of evidence had to be gathered, said Johan Öberg, the plaintiffs’ lawyer.As years passed, the legal costs added up. By 2021, a family of four could find their costs reaching 240,000 kronor (£18,000), which would only be recouped if they won. Several people abandoned legal action because they ran out of money. The stress was immense. Afzelius felt personally responsible for the fate of his friends and neighbours. “I started this,” he said. “What would happen if we lost? We would still be poisoned for the rest of our lives, and then have to pay for it.”View image in fullscreenAgneta Bruno with her horse at a paddock in Kallinge.Photograph: Josefine StenersenTo make things worse, this was not a simple case of heroes versus villains: the people of Ronneby were effectively suing their own local government, since the water company is wholly owned by Ronneby municipality. “It’s really, really hard emotionally to fight against the people that are supposed to protect you,” Afzelius said.When approached for comment, the current mayor, Ola Robertsson, said: “We are sorry if anyone in Ronneby feels abandoned in connection with the Pfas issue. We fully understand that this is a difficult and emotionally charged situation. The municipality strives to represent all our residents to the best of our ability, and we take their concerns very seriously.”For Wikström, who was among the plaintiffs, the attitude of the local government was bewildering. “If they could just say, ‘Sorry, you know what, we’ll take care of you now.’ But no. We need to fight, and fight, and put money into this struggle, instead of just getting help.” Worse, doctors don’t tend to stay long in Ronneby, and newcomers are often unaware of the risks of Pfas. “We say to the doctors: ‘We have high levels of Pfas,’ and most of them are just, like, ‘OK, what does that mean?’” Wikström said. Perhaps, she thought, winning the case would change that.On 13 April 2021, Wikström, Afzelius and the remaining board members of the association – Lollo Karlsson, Katarina Tilholm, Cilla Oijens, Stefan Hansson – gathered around a laptop in the glass porch of Afzelius’s house. No one could sit still. After years of dealing with paperwork, meetings and legal bills, the verdict from the district court was due to be announced online.When the result finally came at 2pm, they erupted with joy. The water company was deemed responsible for causing personal injury to the residents whose drinking water had been contaminated. “It was a moment of pure, shared victory,” Afzelius said.Their happiness was short lived. The water company appealed, and on 20 December 2022 the ruling was reversed. The court said the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that they had suffered direct harm because of Pfas. Anyone who fell ill would have to prove that it was directly caused by Pfas – which, in spite of the studies that have shown links between Pfas and diseases including cancer, is still an impossible feat. “That’s what we struggle with as epidemiologists. It’s very difficult to prove causality,” said Christel Nielsen, an environmental health researcher at Lund University.Following the appeal, the plaintiffs had to pay the water company’s legal bills on top of their own. “The air was knocked out of us. We felt completely abandoned,” Afzelius said. Ten of the plaintiffs quit the case right then – they couldn’t take on the financial risk of continuing. Others were simply exhausted by the entire process: the waiting, the emotional toll, the uncertainty.View image in fullscreenBiological samples stored at Lund University as part of the Pfas health study in Ronneby.Photograph: Josefine StenersenThe remaining plaintiffs decided to take the issue to the supreme court. They had to act quickly: they only had a window of three weeks to prepare their case. By then, Swedish media were giving the case a lot of attention, and people across the globe were watching the story unfold. One of them was Robert Bilott, the lawyer, portrayed by Mark Ruffalo inDark Waters, who had led the legal battle against DuPont in West Virginia and Ohio. “I’ve been closely following the developments in the Pfas litigation in Sweden,” Bilott told me, adding that he was particularly interested to see whether the Swedish court would recognise Pfas blood contamination as a compensable injury.The questions raised by the Ronneby case were not just legal ones, but also scientific. Nielsen became a researcher at Lund University in 2016, after the Ronneby scandal broke, and started working on the case right away. She compares her research into the effects of Pfas to building a puzzle out of many scattered pieces and trying to figure out the big picture.In her orderly, bright office on the outskirts of Lund, Nielsen has folders full of grant applications. She and her team of researchers are permanently short on staff and money. So far, they have managed to scramble enough to publish just over a dozen studies. They found that women in Ronneby whose water was contaminated had an increased risk ofpolycystic ovary syndrome– a chronic, incurable condition that can reduce fertility. They found an 18% increased risk oftype 2 diabetes,19% higher susceptibility toCovid-19, and higher risk ofosteoporosis.As for cancer rates, the research needs updating. A 2022 study conducted on data up to 2016 showed “no overall excess risk” in the contaminated area forall types of cancers, but “modestly increased risk of kidney cancer”. Nielsen believes the results might differ now. “We know that for cancer the latency period is often more than 10, 15 years,” she said.In the autumn of 2021, Afzelius noticed a lump in his right arm. It was firm, about the size of half an egg. At first, he didn’t make much of it – he thought it was just the result of pushing himself too hard in the gym. But when the lump kept growing, Afzelius went to see a doctor. After several biopsies, the lump proved to be an inflammatory leiomyosarcoma, an ultra-rare subtype of a rare cancer – so uncommon that onlya couple of dozen caseshave been reported in medical literature. That means the numbers are too small to reach statistical significance. When I asked if leiomyosarcoma would show up in the research on Pfas, Nielsen shook her head. “We can only study what we can study,” she said.Yet Afzelius is not the only person in town who has suffered from leiomyosarcoma. Royne Robertsson, who used to work at the air force base in the early 2000s cleaning firefighting equipment, had major surgery on his left leg in 2012 to treat a variant of that same rare cancer. Robertsson often thinks of the firefighting foam that would cling to his legs as he cleaned. “Nobody told me it was dangerous,” he said.View image in fullscreenSara Blixt, a resident of Kallinge who attended the early public meetings about the Pfas contamination.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianAmong theoriginalsix board members of the Pfas association, four have developed cancer since 2018, three of them under the age of 50: Afzelius, Karlsson and Tilholm. One, Thomas Lähdet, died of cancer in 2018. “Most of the people got sick after 2013,” Afzelius said. “We’re not even part of their statistics.”Funding problems mean it’s difficult for Nielsen and her colleagues to answer all of the questions the people of Ronneby may have about their health. For now, she is focusing on one issue she finds particularly important, and which bothers Afzelius and Wikström, too: how Pfas are passed from one generation to the next, and what that legacy means for their children’s future wellbeing.At Lund University, there is a room lined with fridges full of plastic bags that contain stiff, reddish discs. These are samples of placentas collected from women who gave birth in Ronneby between 2015 and 2020, for a study of how Pfas are passed from one generation to the next, and what effects these forever chemicals may have on children. It’s not just placentas: the fridges also contain samples of umbilical cord blood and breast milk.Wikström’s placenta is not one of those in the fridge. When she was pregnant with her second daughter, Wikström was all about organic: she used organic skincare and bought organic produce, while avoiding processed foods and sugar. And when she gave birth to Lovis in 2016, she asked for delayed umbilical cord clamping so that her daughter could get as much nutrient-rich cord blood as possible. It was only later, when the Ronneby mother-child studies were in full swing, that Wikström learned how easily Pfas flows from the mother to her child. “I wanted to be a good mother,” Wikström said. “I was so stupid.”Many mothers in Ronneby choke up when they talk about passing Pfas to their children. “I think it’s a horrible load to put on parents,” Nielsen said. For some, however, recent findings have provided relief. Blixt, who frequently checks her teenage sons for lumps, felt guilty about having bottle-fed them when they were tiny, dissolving the formula milk in what turned out to be contaminated water. “I actually had to go to therapy for this,” she said. Recently, she read a study showing that the breast milk of Ronneby’s mothers also contained Pfas. While the news was obviously disturbing, for Blixt, it was almost a relief: it meant that whether she had chosen to breastfeed or to bottle feed, the damage would have happened anyway.View image in fullscreenResearchers Christian Lindh, left, and Christel Nielsen, at Lund University, who investigated how Pfas exposure in Ronneby affected human health.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianStudies by Nielsen and her colleagues show that children in Ronneby with high exposure to Pfas suffer higher risk ofdevelopmental language disorders, “which is a useful proxy for other neurodevelopmental outcomes”, Nielsen said. Other research points to a higher risk ofcongenital malformations,liver diseaseandcancer. There appear to be problems with the children’simmune systems, too – vaccines, as other groups’ research showed, donot seem to workas well in children affected by Pfas. Nielsen’snewest studyalso suggests that these children are more prone to certain kinds of infections, such as ear infections.Both Lovis and Nahla are home sick a lot, their parents said. Afzelius worries about Nahla. “It feels like her immune system is not good,” he said. Of course, research can’t tell any parent for sure that their child’s immune systems were affected by Pfas – it can only show general patterns across populations. We don’t know how long the effects may last, either, or whether they may be reversed over time. But these unknowns are not exactly comforting. “It’s understandable,” Nielsen said, “such uncertainty makes parents worried.”On 5 December 2023, Nahla, who was now 14 years old, was sitting right next to her father on their porch, surrounded by friends from the Pfas association. Their eyes were focused on a TV screen, this time awaiting the final verdict from Sweden’s supreme court on their cases. When the news came, they jumped to their feet and Wikström cried out with joy. Finally, finally, they had won – and there wouldn’t be any more appeals. Thecourt ruledthat simply having Pfas in your bloodstream constituted personal injury, whether you were sick or not. It was unprecedented. “The supreme court had to create new case law,” Segerström said.The world was watching. In the US, Harry Deitzler, a West Virginia attorney who worked with Bilott, was “thrilled” to hear that the association had won the case. In Italy, Laura Facciolo of Mamme No Pfas, a group of parents fighting forever chemicals contamination in the Veneto region, was galvanised by the verdict. “I really hope Italian judges will take inspiration from this,” she said.Yet for those in Ronneby, the story was far from over. Soon after the supreme court’s announcement, Afzelius met his lawyers. “They said to me, OK, now it begins,” he recalled. In Segerström’s office, phones were ringing 24/7: people wanted to file new lawsuits against the municipal water company, this time hoping it would lead to something more concrete: a payout, a healthcare programme. One hundred and fifty decided to sue. It may take years before they get a resolution, Segerström said.In the meantime, new treatments offer some hope. A cholesterol-lowering drug, cholestyramine, has been found to decrease levels of Pfas in the blood by15% to 44%. This could be particularly helpful, Nielsen said, “if we could target young women before they have their first child”. This way, they may not pass such a high level of Pfas to the next generation.Legislation is tightening around Pfas, too. In the EU, Pfos and PFOA have beenbanned in everyday productssince 2020, while the US banned PFOA in household goods in 2014. Pfos-based Afff firefighting foams were banned in 2019. Yet this doesn’t mean there are no Pfas in firefighting foams any more, or that consumer products are now safe. Scientists warn that older forms of forever chemicals are simply being replaced by other compounds which may beequally toxicbut are currently less well understood. For Nielsen, studying the impacts of pollutants feels like trying to catch a runaway train. “There is no testing before chemicals are released on the market. We are basically chasing these new substances years after they’ve been put on the market in order to understand what health effects they’ve already had,” she said.Sewage sleuths: the men who revealed the slow, dirty death of Welsh and English riversRead moreTo complicate things further, we are still discovering new Pfas in human blood science didn’t even know existed. “Given the immense number of Pfas released to the market, we can assume that we are only capturing a fraction of what is actually present,” said Jana Weiss, an environmental chemist at Stockholm University.Some in Ronneby are exhausted from hearing about Pfas, and just want the whole thing to be over. “It’s like, if we don’t speak about it, it doesn’t exist,” Blixt said. Afzelius is tired, too, but he is determined to keep going. He wants the world to know about the dangers of Pfas, so another Ronneby doesn’t happen again. Above all, however, he is fighting for the children, he says. With the doses of Pfas she has received through the municipal water as a small child, Nahla, his daughter, will be middle aged before her Pfas levels go down to those of an average Swede. “And no one took responsibility,” Afzelius said, shaking his head. “No one.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readPfasSwedenEuropeRiversWaterDuPontfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His son, Hun Manet, is the current leader.During their discussion Paetongtarn addresses the veteran leader as “uncle” and refers to the Thai army commander in the country’s northeast as her opponent, a remark that sparked fierce criticism on social media.The Thai foreign ministry summoned the Cambodian ambassador on Thursday to deliver a letter complaining about the leaking of the call.View image in fullscreenA royalist supporter holds a sign that reads \"Thai government with Khmer heart Get Out\" during an anti-government protest following the phone call leak.Photograph: Chalinee Thirasupa/ReutersAfter the leak, the prime minister’s main coalition partner quit and she faced calls to resign or hold an election, throwing the kingdom into a fresh round of political instability as it seeks to boost its spluttering economy and avoid US President Donald Trump’s swingeing trade tariffs.The conservative Bhumjaithai party pulled out on Wednesday, saying Paetongtarn’s conduct in the leaked call had wounded the country and the army’s dignity.The Thai stock market fell 2.4% on Thursday as the crisis raged, but by the evening Paetongtarn, daughter of billionaire ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra, appeared to have won a reprieve as another coalition party said it would not withdraw – for now at least.Leaders of the Chartthaipattana, United Thai Nation and Democrat parties held urgent talks on the crisis on Thursday afternoon.Little experience and a lot on her plate: who is Thailand’s new prime minister?Read moreAfterwards, Chartthaipattana leader Varawut Silpa-archa told reporters his party would remain in government and meet Paetongtarn to decide what to do.Losing another coalition partner would probably mean the end of her government and either an election or a bid by other parties to stitch together a new coalition.The loss of Bhumjaithai’s 69 MPs left Paetongtarn with barely enough votes to scrape a majority in parliament and a snap election could be on the cards – barely two years after the last one in May 2023.Thailand’s military said in a statement that army chief Gen Pana Claewplodtook “affirms commitment to democratic principles and national sovereignty protection”.“The Chief of Army emphasised that the paramount imperative is for ‘Thai people to stand united’ in collectively defending national sovereignty,” it said.Thailand’s armed forces have long played a powerful role in the kingdom’s politics and politicians are usually careful not to antagonise them.Thailand has suffered a dozen coups since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, and the current crisis has inevitably triggered rumours that another may be in the offing.Such an outcome would make Paetongtarn the third member of her family, after her aunt Yingluck and father Thaksin, to be kicked out of office by the military.The main opposition People’s Party, which won the most seats in 2023 but was blocked by conservative senators from forming a government, urged Paetongtarn to call an election.The Palang Pracharath party, which led the government up to 2023, said the leaked recording showed Paetongtarn was weak and inexperienced, incapable of managing the country’s security.Hundreds of anti-government protesters, some of them veterans of the royalist, anti-Thaksin “Yellow Shirt” movement of the late 2000s, demonstrated outside Government House on Thursday demanding that Paetongtarn quit.Paetongtarn, 38, came to power in August 2024 at the head of an uneasy coalition between Pheu Thai and a group of conservative, pro-military parties whose members have spent much of the past 20 years battling against her father.Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificCambodianewsShareReuse this content"

The St George’s Cross, the union flag, theDerbyshirecounty flag and the Pride flag flutter brightly above the town’s many independent businesses.That was until a row erupted that has divided the town, after the mysterious disappearance of a Pride flag turned out to be the work of the very council that had installed it.Townspeople and the local MP are calling for its return after a LGBTQ+ standard was removed in a “sly little way” following complaints from some Christians.Kate Bond, who lives in the Derbyshire town, said she had donated £150 to the council to refresh the flags as they had become tatty over time. “They were such a mess because they were really old and dirty,” she said.Only the St George’s Cross and the union flag had previously been flown, so when the new flags went up on the high street last week she was delighted to see the addition of the Derbyshire flag and the Pride flag, following a decision by the 11 members of Matlock town council.View image in fullscreen‘It’s crazy. You just can’t believe it,’ said one resident, Kate Bond, after a Pride flag disappeared.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“I thought it was amazing to be honest. I thought, ‘Oh that’s brilliant. How nice.’ I was just thinking it looked really good,” she said.When a Pride flag disappeared, she thought it might be the work of lone homophobes – which has happened invarious townsandcities in the UK– and was shocked to discover the council had done it, appearing to bow to pressure from a homophobic minority.“It’s crazy. You just can’t believe it. More than anything, what I’m bothered about is the fact that it’s happened without anybody knowing about it. This sly little way it’s been done, it’s wrong somehow. If it’s your idea to put them up, stand by it,” she said.It is not clear how many people complained but one was Cornerstone Bookshop, run by a Christian charity, which said it was “grateful for the speedy removal” of the Pride flag.View image in fullscreenThe owner of Cornerstone bookshop said: ‘We have to respect other people’s views. But we didn’t want the flag flying outside our shop.’Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianJudy Crook, who runs the bookshop, told the Guardian that, though as “a point of basic Christian belief, we welcome everybody”, they did not want to promote homosexuality and “we’re not happy with the gay rights situation”.“We have to respect other people’s views. But we didn’t want the flag flying outside our shop.”In a statement, the bookshop added: “Fortunately, we are blessed in this country with freedom of conscience and freedom of religion legislation, enshrined in the Equality Act of 2010 which allows religion or belief as a protected characteristic. We are therefore very grateful for the speedy removal of this flag when we raised our concern to the council.”Bond, who is gay, responded: “You can’t do anything about homophobes. They’re going to be in the world. So my complaint really isn’t with [Crook], it’s the fact that the council have agreed to it. There’s obviously some people in Matlock, and perhaps just generally, that have more power than others.”The council clerk, Simon Hosmer, said: “We removed the flag due to a strong belief someone would put themselves in danger by removing it themselves. As a town council we can ill afford damage to property let alone damage to a person that we may be liable for.View image in fullscreenFlags flutter above Matlock’s historical high street.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“A lot of the local community are rightly upset that this has happened. It may look to people that we have bowed under the pressure of a single complaint. That is simply not the case.”He said more Pride flags had been ordered, despite the wider Derbyshire county council, now led by Reform UK, “wanting only union flags on public buildings”.Reform, which won a majority in the May local election, has banned the LGBTQ flag from the county hall in Matlock, along with the Ukrainian flag. The Guardian understands the council has since done a U-turn on the Ukrainian flag ban.The new administration has also introduced Christian prayer at the start of its meetings, with a Reform councillor, the group whip Dan Price, saying the UK was a “Christian country”.This article was amended on 19 June 2025. An earlier version said Reform had banned the LGBTQ flag from the town hall in Matlock, when county hall was meant.Explore more on these topicsLGBTQ+ rightsReligionDerbyshireLocal governmentEnglandChristianitynewsShareReuse this content"

Footage from the gig showed Daltrey turning in frustration towards his drummer during a rendition of The Song is Over and saying: “To sing that song I need to hear the keys and I can’t. All I’ve got is drums going boom boom boom.”Starkey wasfired two weeks laterbut he was reinstated after only three days, apologising on social media to Daltrey for having “dropped a few beats” – a mea culpa that was encouraged by the Who’s guitarist, Pete Townshend, who said Daltrey “did nothing wrong but fiddle with his in-ear monitors”. Townshend added that Starkey “made a few mistakes” and had apologised for them.But the drummer said he was informed 10 days later that the reinstatement was “never going to work”, and was encouraged to put out a statement to say he was moving on of his own accord.Starkey, the godson of the Who’s original drummer, the late Keith Moon, told Rolling Stone he was “very proud” of his father for “standing up for me”, adding that despite his apology he could still see no mistakes on his part in the concert footage. He said he had been blamed for missing his cue, when in fact Daltrey had come in “four bars early” after being unable to hear the piano.“He blamed it on the drums being too loud and then it got made into this huge social media thing,” Starkey said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Thereport, from the International Panel on the Information Environment (Ipie), systematically reviewed 300 studies.The researchers found climate denialism has evolved into campaigns focused on discrediting solutions, such as the false claims that renewable energy caused the recent massiveblackout in Spain.Online bots and trolls hugely amplify false narratives, the researchers say, playing a key role in promoting climate lies. The experts also report that political leaders, civil servants and regulatory agencies are increasingly being targeted in order to delay climate action.Climate misinformation – the term used by the report for both deliberate and inadvertent falsehoods – is of increasing concern. Last Thursday, the UN special rapporteur on human rights and climate change, Elisa Morgera, called for misinformation and greenwashing by the fossil fuel industry to be criminalised. On Saturday, Brazil, host of the upcoming Cop30 climate summit, will rally nations behind a separate UN initiative to crack down on climate misinformation.“It is a major problem,” said Dr Klaus Jensen, of the University of Copenhagen, who co-led the Ipie review. “If we don’t have the right information available, how are we going to vote for the right causes and politicians, and how are politicians going to translate the clear evidence into the necessary action? Unfortunately, I think the [bad actors] are still very, very active, and probably have the upper hand now.”Jensen added: “We have aboutfive years to cut emissions in halfand until 2050 to go carbon neutral. Without the right information, we’re not going to get there. So the climate crisis being translated into a climate catastrophe is possible, unless we handle the climate information integrity problem.”Morgera said in her report last week that countries must “defossilise” information systems, after decades of misinformation from the powerful fossil fuel industry.She said states should “criminalise misinformation and misrepresentation (greenwashing) by the fossil fuel industry” and “criminalise media and advertising firms for amplifying disinformation and misinformation by fossil fuel companies”. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, called in June 2024 for aban on advertising by fossil fuel companies, calling the firms the “godfathers of climate chaos”.The UN is leading an international effort called theGlobal Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change. Brazil will call for countries to strengthen measures to fight climate lies at climate negotiations in Bonn, Germany, with the UK, France, Chile, Morocco and others already signed up to the initiative. Audrey Azoulay, the Unesco director general, said: “Climate-related disinformation [is] running rampant on social media.”The Ipie report is a comprehensive assessment of who is producing climate misinformation, how they propagate it, what impact it has and how it can be combated. It concludes: “Misleading information has undermined public trust in climate science and other key social institutions. This crisis of information integrity is intensifying and exacerbating the climate crisis.”The misinformation ranges from industry promoting fossil gas as a “low-carbon fuel” to bizarre conspiracy theories such as thatwildfires in southern Californiathis year were planned by officials in order to destroy child-trafficking tunnels.Among the findings are that the fossil fuel industry has engaged in a “dual deception” of the public, first denying the reality of climate change, obscuring its responsibility and obstructing climate action, and, second,deploying greenwashto portray itself as an environmentally sustainable enterprise. The report says other sectors have also promoted climate misinformation: US electricity companies, animal agriculture, airlines, tourism, and fast food.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The report says Russian intelligence has used troll farms to disseminate disinformation about climate change.However, Jensen said the problem was deeper than social media. “Alliances of industry and conservative thinktanks actually target misinformation at the key people who will be making decisions. Those links are particularly worrisome because it’s something approaching a conspiracy.”In the European context, rightwing populist parties are “actively contravening climate science”, the report says, including the AfD in Germany, Vox in Spain, and the National Rally in France. Media outlets with conservative or rightwing political ideologies give priority to and amplify denial, scepticism and conspiracy theories regarding climate change, the report says.Measures to fight climate misinformation include regulation to improve the moderation of content by social media companies, as with theEU Digital Services Act, and requiring fossil fuel companies to make standardised declarations of their emissions. Jensen said some legal cases against purveyors of climate misinformation were already under way. In the longer term, improved climate education would enable citizens to identify misinformation.Jensen also said more research was needed as the studies to date were overwhelmingly on English-language misinformation and western nations, with, for example, just one study out of the 300 focused on Africa.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisClimate science scepticism and denialClimate sciencenewsShareReuse this content"

Many scientific experts have suggested the technology isnot economically viable. It is accused of being a favourite climate “solution” of the fossil fuel industrysince itallows for the continued extraction of oil and gas.The Labour governmentannounced in Octoberit would provide £22bn in subsidies to CCUS projects over 25 years afteran increase in lobbying by the fossil fuel industry.The Green party co-leader, Carla Denyer, said Reeves and the Labour government had been “caught out making promises in a secret exchange deal which goes against the interests of the British people”.The MP for Bristol Central added: “In public, they claim to be taxing fossil fuel giants more fairly by raising the windfall tax, but behind closed doors they are giving back with dodgy deals to allow the fossil fuel corporates to continue with business as usual under the guise of CCUS – an expensive distraction and largely unproven technology.”Equinor is one of the main companies investing in the UK’s CCUS sector. In December,the government signed deals with Equinor, BP and TotalEnergiesto develop carbon capture facilities in Teesside. This will involve the development of the Net Zero Teesside power plant, which will be 25% owned by Equinor and aims to be the world’s first gas-fired power station featuring CCUS.Earlier this year, Equinor wasforced to retracta claim that it stores 1m tonnes of carbon dioxide annually at its flagship carbon capture project in the North Sea. Equinor has not captured 1m tonnes of CO2 per year at the site since 2001, and only captured a 10th of that figure in 2023.Equinor made a $28.7bn (£21.2bn) post-tax profit in 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered higher oil and gas prices – a figure that stood at $8.8bn in 2024.Tessa Khan, the executive director of the campaign group Uplift, said: “Oil companies like Equinor have held sway over successive UK governments, for years shaping policies to benefit their bottom line and slowing down climate action. This Labour government must stand up to them and put our needs – for affordable clean energy and a safe climate that we can pass on to our children – ahead of their insatiable need to profit.”The House of Commons’ public accounts committee, which scrutinises government spending decisions, released a report in Februarydescribing the UK’s £22bn CCUS subsidies as “risky”.The report noted that the government has downgraded its ambitions for CCUS storage, scrapping its previous commitment of storing 20 to 30m tonnes annually by 2030. It also highlighted that the UK’s new CCUS projects do not allow the government to share any potential profits, or for local consumers to benefit from lower energy bills.The committee also reported that producing liquid natural gas, which will be used in the UK’s CCUS projects, leaks more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than previously thought. “This could undermine the rationale for pursuing certain schemes,” the report said.After being sued by the environmental consultant Andrew Boswell over the Net Zero Teesside scheme, the previous Conservative governmentadmitted it had not taken into account the plant’s full potential emissions, which Boswell estimated could reach more than 20.3m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent during its lifetime.In summer 2024, a judge rejected Boswell’s case, which argued that officials did not fully explore the environmental impacts of the scheme before approving it.

In November,the governmentadmittedit had unlawfully approved the development of the UK’s largest untapped oilfield, Rosebank, which is operated by Equinor, by not taking into account the climate effects of the combustion of oil and gas to be extracted from the field.Equinor intends to reapply for approval to develop the field.The Labour government has been steadfast in its support for the UK achieving net zero emissions by 2050, with Keir Starmer having said “homegrown clean energy” is “inthe DNA” of his administration.The Climate Change Committee stated in its 2025 appraisal of the government’s net zero policies thatthe UK needs to scale up its CCUS capacity to 73m tonnes-a-year by 2050to help meet its climate commitments.“Investment in carbon capture and storage is a gamble on unproven technology,” said Lily-Rose Ellis, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK. “All it does is give oil and gas giants carte blanche to continue causing planet-destroying emissions in the hopes that one day they might be able to capture the carbon and store it for all of eternity. Public money should be spent on renewables, which guarantee to lower emissions, bring bills down and boost the economy with new jobs.”A spokesperson for Equinor said: “Equinor has been a reliable energy partner to the UK for over 40 years, providing a stable supply of oil and gas, developing the UK’s offshore wind industry, and pioneering solutions to decarbonise the UK economy, including carbon capture and storage.“Using our experience of decarbonising energy production in Norway, including safely storing carbon emissions under the North Sea for over 25 years, we are supporting the UK to develop its own homegrown energy transition.”A government spokesperson said: “We are delivering first-of-a-kind carbon capture projects in the UK, supporting thousands of jobs across the country, reigniting industrial heartlands and tackling the climate crisis. Money raised from changes to the energy profits levy made at autumn budget last year support the transition to clean energy, enhance energy security and independence, provide sustainable jobs for the future, and help protect electricity bills against future price shocks.”Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesFossil fuelsEnergyEnergy industryCarbon capture and storage (CCS)Greenhouse gas emissionsOil and gas companiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Alongside an American volunteer, Lyndon Hauge, he gazes out over a charred field. Clouds of smoke are still billowing from the ground.As he walks through the ash-covered field, his optimistic speech turns to sadness and he pauses in silence to take in the barren landscape.Before the fire, this 2-hectare (5-acre) plot of land in the mountains of Cantel was home to 2,000 trees, all planted through Pocol’s reforestation project.Over a quarter of a century, he and his small team of volunteers and community members have planted thousands of trees, regenerating the landscape of Guatemala’s highlands and mitigating the impacts of the climate crisis, while also generating revenue for local communities.View image in fullscreenA lush hillside on the south-east ridge of the Xecam range en route to Lake Atitlán.Photograph: Zach Mordan/Courtesy of Chico MendesPocol initiated theChico Mendes Reforestation Project in Pachaj– located 2,400 metres (7,900ft) above sea level and about 6 miles (10km) from the town of Quetzaltenango, known as Xela – in 1999. At that time, the region had suffered extensive deforestation over several decades.The organisation was named after theBrazilian environmentalist Chico Mendes, who fought to preserve the rainforest and for Indigenous rights until he was murdered by a cattle rancher in 1988.“The struggles he went through in Brazil are similar to the ones we go through in Guatemala,” Pocol says.View image in fullscreenArmando López Pocol, who set up the Chico Mendes Reforestation Project in 1999.Photograph: Zach Mordan/Courtesy of Chico Mendes“From the 1960s to the 1990s, there was a lot of deforestation in Cantel, as the wood was used extensively for building houses and as firewood for families,” he says. “I started Chico Mendes to stop the deforestation, as I was worried about climate change and environmental problems in Guatemala, with mining companies destroying the community forests of Indigenous people.”He says deforestation is now largely caused by fires during the dry season, and attributes the latest one – the third in his fields so far this year – to an arson attack.“We’re losing many tree plantations,” he says, adding that the region lost more than 100,000 trees to fires in 2023 alone. “What keeps my spirit alive are the workers and volunteers showing their support and not giving up.”Since he embarked on his tree-planting mission, Pocol has become resigned to the fact that he cannot stop fires. “We just don’t have enough staff,” he admits. “It’s expensive to have people out here watching all this land.”While he believes some of the fires are due to foul play, he says they have tried to reduce the number by creating fire corridors in the forests.View image in fullscreenSmallholders and their livestock at a reforestation site in May, the start of Guatemala’s rainy season. Last year there was no rain until July.Photograph: Zach Mordan/Courtesy of Chico MendesPocol says the organisation, using land owned by the local municipality, has planted between 5,000 and 20,000 trees every year since 1998. Over the last 10 years, this figure has risen to an annual average of 20,000 to 25,000, and it is anticipated that the figure will exceed 30,000 this year.There’s been a lot of difficult times. But I’ve never given up, and it always lifts my spirits when volunteers comeArmando López PocolThe organisation plants eight different types of trees, though he says he has found the most success with cypress and pine, which tend to flourish in the cooler climates found at higher altitudes.“We plant pine trees because the earth here is very hot and we don’t have many other types of trees that live through the seasons,” he says, standing on a site where 1,000 pines and cypresses were planted about 10 years ago.Pocol says environmentalists recommended a greater variety of trees, but adds: “They started to see that with the terrain and the dirt here, it just doesn’t work.”Experts indicate that theprimary drivers of deforestation in the western highlandsare logging for firewood and charcoal, as well as wildfires caused by campfires, slash-and-burn farming techniques, and conflicts between communities.Pocol is also concerned about mining companies seeking to extract minerals and is constantly stressed about his organisation’s financial situation.The Guatemalan government operates reforestation projects throughProbosque, a state programme that supports reforestation and restoration by offering incentives for landowners to plant trees. While experts say that government projects have generally been effective, funding remains limited.View image in fullscreenThe village of Alaska, so named because of the altitude and often cold climate.Photograph: Zach Mordan/Courtesy of Chico Mendes“There are many organisations and NGOs that receive support from these programmes, but it’s not enough. We need more,” says Dr René Zamora-Cristales, outgoing director of the Latin American restoration initiative 20x20 at theWorld Resources Instituteand an associate professor at theOregon State University college of forestry.Zamora-Cristales says many environmental organisations struggle to meet the necessary regulations to access the programme, such as the requirement for a certain number of trees for each hectare. “You need to follow technical guidelines, and sometimes communities don’t want to follow them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Volunteers gather seeds, source decomposed leaves, fill bags with soil, and plant trees.Donations and the volunteering fee are crucial for Chico Mendes, as Pocol sees his initiative as much more than a reforestation project. The organisation also supports the community through ecotourism, with funds circulating through the local economy via homestays and treks, as well as volunteers spending money in the village.View image in fullscreenVolunteers pose during a day of preparing a hillside in Cantel for replanting.Photograph: Zach Mordan/Courtesy of Chico MendesChico Mendes facilitates Spanish lessons with 25 teachers from the local community and offers homestays with 30 families. “All the teachers through Chico Mendes are Indigenous women,” says Pocol. “We are creating opportunities for the community.”New revenue streams are vital for local communities, as the region has increasingly been affected by the climate crisis. Therainy season in Guatemala usually lasts from May to October, but the Cantel area hasexperienced reduced rainfall in recent years.“Some years, it only rains in two months,” says Pocol. “There wasn’t any rain from last May through to July last year. The corn was dying, and that has led to a radical increase in crop prices.”View image in fullscreenChico Mendes volunteers carry saplings for planting in thealtiplano, or highlands, near Quetzaltenango.Photograph: Zach Mordan/Courtesy of Chico MendesDr Daniel Ariano, biodiversity coordinator at the University of the Valley of Guatemala’s centre for environmental studies and biodiversity, says projects such as Chico Mendes encourage mitigation and adaptation to climate risks. He notes that, in addition to drought, extreme weather events such as heavy rain also heighten the threat of landslides.‘Global red alert’: forest loss hits record high – and Latin America is the heart of the infernoRead more“This kind of project is extremely important, especially to promote the reforestation and restoration of ecosystems,” Ariano says. “We need to develop resilient communities in the highlands.”Zamora-Cristales praises Pocol’s work and says Guatemala needs more people like him. “Deforestation has always been an issue, but different efforts, such as the one from Armando, have reduced the overall deforestation in the country. We certainly need more local leaders committed to improving the livelihoods of local communities by restoring nature,” he says.Pocol, who works on his project every day without a break, including weekends, and tops up his income in the evenings as an Uber driver, admits he is exhausted.“I wake up in the night and wonder what the future is going to be for the project as there’s been a lot of difficult times. But I’ve never given up, and it always lifts my spirits when volunteers come,” Pocol says.“We all just want a green planet, so that all future children can have a clean environment, clean water, pure oxygen and food.”Explore more on these topicsDeforestationSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanGuatemalaTrees and forestsConservationAmericasIndigenous peoplesWildfiresfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But with the promise of extreme conditions in the months to come, federal fire crews are also growing concerned that a series of changes brought on by theTrump administrationhave left them underprepared.Severe cuts to budgets and staff have hamstrung the agencies that manage roughly 640m acres of the nation’s public lands, leaving significant gaps in a workforce that supports wildfire mitigation and suppression. The administration’s crackdown on climate science and the dismantling of departments that provided world-class research and weather forecasting, may also undermine early warning systems, slowing response and strategic planning.Donald Trump has championed firefighters and called for bolstering preparedness for the a year-round fire season, using the devastating fire storms that leveled communities across Los Angeles at the start of the year as a call to action. But in the six months since, the administration has only added obstacles to addressing the key issues.There are also fears that Trump’snew wildfire directiveto bring the country’s federal firefighters together under a new agency will be rushed, adding another layer of uncertainty and chaos just as crews are trying to prepare for another grueling season.Many areas have had anexceptionally warm springfollowing a dry winter.The south-west and Pacific north-west are alreadyexperiencingsizzlingheatwaves, and on landscapes acrossCalifornia,Montanaand Texas, there’s a high danger for ignitions to turn into infernos. Climate forecasters are predicting the potential for forest fires is higher this year than in the previous two years.“If this turns out to be a major fire year, it’s going to be a shit show,” said Dr Hugh Safford, a fire ecologist at the University ofCalifornia, Davis, who spent more than two decades working for the US Forest Service (USFS) before retiring in 2021.Five federal firefighters, who spoke with the Guardian under the condition of anonymity because they are barred from speaking publicly, echoed Safford’s unease. When asked if their agencies were ready for the season ahead, the answer was a resounding “no”.And it’s already getting busy.Homes and businesseswere lost to the flamesin Oregon this week, and dozens of blazes aretearing through Canada– where more than 8.5m acres have already been consumed by fires – brought the rising risks forming across the continent into sharper focus.During a Senate appropriations committee hearing last week, Tom Schultz, the chief of the USFS, which currently employs the bulk of the US government’s fire workforce, said his teams are well-positioned for the months ahead.Many fire experts, firefighters and lawmakers don’t agree.“The reality is on the ground we have lost workers whose jobs are absolutely essential,” Patty Murray, a US senator, said during the hearing,sharing that an estimated 7,500employeeshave been pushed out of the USFS this year. That includes scientists, maintenance staff and administrators who support wildfire response, and workers who had qualifications to fill in as firefighters on blazes when they were needed.“The stakes are life and death here – and this raises serious alarms about this agency being ready for this critical fire season.”A fraying firefighter workforceFears are mounting that the loss of support staff could mean a range of needs, from meals to medical services, will not be in place during large fires when they are needed most.“Those agencies were already understaffed,” Lenya N Quinn-Davidson,director of University of California Agricultural and Natural Resources Fire Network, said. “Now they are skeletal.”Already, there have been reports of crews being left without power for weeks due to cut maintenance workers, paychecks being late or halved because administrative roles were left empty, or firefighters having to mow lawns outside their offices, manage campsites, and do plumbing work at their barracks in addition to their other duties.Access to purchase cards that teams typically rely on for everything from bathroom supplies to fuel for chainsaws were revoked. District offices couldn’t buy ink or paper for their printers. Othersstruggled to get safety and tactical supplies for the season, including radios and fire shelters.A squad leader for the USFS said some newly hired firefighters had had to go for months without healthcare and seasoned ones were left waiting on backpay because the human resources department has less than a quarter of the staff it did previously. Another firefighter said thousands of cases are lagging in HR because people haven’t gotten paid properly and promotions aren’t being processed.“I think we have taken those people for granted for a long time,” the squad leader added. “Now that they aren’t around we are going to be in for a shock.”View image in fullscreenFirefighters extinguish hotspots at a home which was destroyed by wildfire on 15 March 2025 in Mannford, Oklahoma.Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty ImagesCapacity will probably be crunched on the fire line too.The forest service is going into the summer with fewer firefighters and teams than it had last year, whenoverwork led to an increase in injuries and burnout.Schultz confirmed the agency has hired 11,000 firefighters, roughly 900 fewer than last season, and that there are 37 incident management teams, down by five. Those teams are a crucial need for responding to complex and large-scale disasters, and there may not be enough to go around.“It is just another example of the administration making these kneejerk reactions and truly not understanding what it takes to respond to wildfires and other disasters,” said Riva Duncan, a former manager and firefighter in the USFS and vice-president of ​​Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a non-profit advocacy group. “Come August, when more geographic areas are on fire, I think we are going to see some glitches in the system.”Roughly 4,800 USFS workers have signed on to a program offering workers paid administrative leave through September if they opted to resign or retire, pushed by the Trump administration as a way to rapidly shrink the federal government. That figure includes 1,400 people with so-called “red cards”,trained to join operations on the fire line if needed.Schultz told senators that, because the offer to leave was voluntary, the USFS didn’t do an analysis ahead of time to strategically make cuts or keep staff who might be needed when emergencies strike.Now in an effort to get some of those workers back, the Department of Agriculture, which the USFS falls under, has called for volunteers willing to take fire assignments until their contracts end.A spokesperson for the USDA said it was a top priority for Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, to “ensure the entire agency is geared to respond to what is already an above normal summer fire season”, and claimed the forest service was well on its way with 96% of its hiring goals met. They cited the program to bring those on administrative leave back to active duty as an indication that the USFS “is operationally ready for the fire season ahead”.Even if some do opt to sign on for the summer, time is running short to reposition resources and get them ready.“A lot of those folks have missed their fire refreshers, they have missed taking their fitness tests, they are behind the curve,” Duncan said “And, not everybody is willing to come back.”A fire planner at the USFS, who also asked not to be named, said he did not expect many to sign up. He said the loss will result in heavy “brain drain”, as people with decades of experience are now missing from the agency’s roster.View image in fullscreenPeople watch a wildfire burn in Squamish, British Columbia, on 10 June. The wildfires in Canada have been a stark warning of what could lie ahead this summer.Photograph: Canadian Press/ShutterstockTeams are bracing for another round of cuts expected to come. An executive ordersigned by Trumplast week directing the government to combine federal firefighters under a new agency in the Department of Interior is shaking up the workforce just as the season enters full-swing. The order gives departments just 90 days to formulate plans.Federal firefighters have spent years advocating for the move, but there are concerns the process will be rushed and mismanaged. Leaders were told the consolidation wouldn’t happen until next year.“It seems like a joke if you can’t even pay my guys or get them insurance,” the squad leader said of the administration’s aim to merge departments while pressing needs of their crews go unaddressed. He added that the idea of a new agency – one that puts firefighters in positions to make key decisions – is promising. “But I don’t have faith in these people putting it together.”It’s a feeling the other firefighters who spoke to the Guardian share.There have long been challenges at the agencies they work for, especially at the USFS. Now there are fears that the administration’s answers to those problems are ignoring firefighters’ needs. Morale has continued to plummet.One USFS firefighter said the lack of workforce planning “could be catastrophic”: “I am not seeing our interests being represented.”An anti-science agendaBeyond the personnel shortage,grants that support important forest health and fire mitigation work are being phased out, leaving more landscapes vulnerable to burning.Schultz told senators during the hearing that those grants – including funds that support wildfire risk reduction on state, local and tribal lands, as well as a program that helps private landowners maintain their trees –were halved this year so that more than $43mcould go toward the program incentivizing early resignations and retirements. In next year’s budget, the grants are completely closed out.Some funds appropriated by Congress were not distributed at all. Murray, the senator, highlighted that $97m budgeted to support state, rural and volunteer fire departments in wildfire reduction work was withheldby the agency this year.The effects of these deep cuts are expected to be far-reaching and long term, especially due to the loss of science and research capacity that support land management work and wildfire mitigation.“The administration’s budget forForest Service research is $0– this for the world’s most important forest research organization,” Safford said. It’s not just new research being squashed; Trump has enforced an anti-science agenda across the government that will leave the US less prepared as the climate crisis unfolds.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa),which saw large-scale layoffs earlier this year, may also be less able to provide important forecasts and data used to plan prescribed burns, warn the public and pre-position crews during extreme weather events. National Weather Service stations no longer have the staff for round-the-clock monitoring, especially in high fire-prone regions in California and the Pacific north-west. The overhaul of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) couldleave gaps in response and recovery.View image in fullscreenSanjay Mohanty, a UCLA professor and civil engineering scientist, and Judy Chu, a congresswoman, watch as his team collects soil samples from a home in the Eaton fire burn area in Altadena.Photograph: MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News/Getty ImagesThe USFSis also returning to a “full-suppression” ethosthat has shocked ecologists and firefighters alike. Rather than letting some backcountry blazes burn – wildfires that can be healthy for forests that evolved with fire – Schultz ordered the agency to revert to a strategy widely recognized as a key culprit in the increase in catastrophic fire. The USFS chief has also placed higher restrictions on prescribed burning.“We have known since the late 1960s that full-tilt suppression is reactive and does nothing to solve the underlying issues,” Safford said. A push to put all fires out immediately, regardless of their ecological benefit or risks to communities, “wastes extraordinary amounts of money, puts firefighters at risk, and additionally has all sorts of negative environmental and ecological repercussions in both the short and long term”.Plugging the shortfallsStates are now scrambling to fill the gaps left by the federal government.Californiaissued nearly $72m in Mayto support land management projects in the state and fast-tracked projects in partnership with tribes, private landowners and local districts.In Colorado this spring,Jared Polis, the governor,issued $7m in state wildfire mitigation grants. “Forest fires aren’t going to take four years off just because of who’s in the White House,” he told Politico at the time. “So it’s really important that states up the bar on preparation.”This is, in part, by design.“There’s going to be a shift to put greater reliance on state and local governments to cover those costs on their own without direct federal support,” Schultz told lawmakers at the hearing.For Quinn-Davidson,these moves speak to the importance of community-based work and leadership. With less federal support, it will fall to individuals and local groups to do the important work needed in their own backyards to prevent the worst fires.Quinn-Davidson, who oversees programs helping communities conduct prescribed burns, thinks they will be up for the challenge. She lamented the loss of passionate federal workers but said people were jumping at the opportunity to get involved and do what’s required to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire in their own backyards.“The more involved people can be at the local level, and the more we can empower communities to have leadership on fire,” she said, “the more resilient we will be in the face of disaster.”Explore more on these topicsUS wildfiresTrump administrationWildfiresColoradoCaliforniaOregonWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She later complained to the regulator.The Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) said Flatman “misled [the woman] and the court” and that his “misconduct brought the profession into disrepute and had the potential to harm [the mother]”.At a disciplinary hearing in April last year, Flatman said he had been instructed as a psychologist with relevant experience. He said he had never been specifically instructed as an educational psychologist in the family courts despite having provided expert evidence in “around 1,680” family cases.TBIJ has examined seven further cases in which he gave expert evidence between 2013 and 2024 and found that in all those cases he may have acted outside his professional remit by assessing people for a range of non-educational issues.Miriam Silver, a consultant clinical psychologist who co-authoredguidanceon the use of psychologists in the family courts, said: “It is deeply concerning that someone who may have been acting outside of their field of competence was able to give evidence in such a potentially huge number of court cases.“The role of the psychologist as an expert witness is very influential in the family courts, and whilst the judge will weigh up all the evidence to inform their decision and may sometimes disregard our recommendations, generally they give a lot of weight to our opinions.”In one case, Flatman’s conclusions led to him being criticised by two court of appeal judges after he failed to conduct the proper legal test to establish if a vulnerable mother could understand proceedings about the future care of her daughter – although they noted the case would have had the same outcome.Flatman’s six-month suspension was lifted in October. The panel noted he was no longer working in the courts. However, he remains registered with the HCPC and the watchdog cannot prevent him from making court assessments in the future.In a statement, Flatman said he had worked as an expert witness in family courts since 1997. He did not respond when asked how many assessments he had undertaken on adults in total.“I have never presented myself as a clinical psychologist,” he said. “With every report, I accurately included my professional qualifications and experience as an educational psychologist.”Flatman said he immediately stopped his family court work after the HCPC’s findings and took the suspension “very seriously”.In the case that led to his disciplinary action, Flatman conducted tests on the woman that the panel said went beyond the limits of his skills, knowledge and experience.Flatman told the panel he had been acting as an expert in the family courts since about 1997. It did not examine how many other adults he had assessed during this time but warned that his actions could discredit his evidence in other cases.None of the published judgments of the seven cases identified by TBIJ correctly refer to Flatman as an educational psychologist. Judges instead describe him as a “very experienced psychologist”, “a child and family psychologist” and a “psychologist”.Silver said: “It is incumbent on the expert to be very clear about their qualifications and areas of expertise, and to correct any errors made about their title or scope of knowledge.”The cases uncovered by TBIJ show that Flatman’s opinions informed decisions that had a profound impact on the lives of those involved. He produced psychological reports on the ability of three mothers to care for their children, who were all subsequently removed from their care.The HCPC took no further action after his suspension expired as he had taken steps to address his misconduct, which included no longer undertaking expert witness work.Flatman told the regulator he “fully acknowledged the risk of harm associated with his misconduct” and promised to stay within the traditional scope of an educational psychologist.The HCPC said Flatman had demonstrated a high level of insight and it was “highly unlikely his conduct would be repeated”.Explore more on these topicsFamily lawnewsShareReuse this content"

There’s some voices, though, that need to step away,” she said. “We can do it, let us do it – we don’t need you to speak on our behalf.”Jones, who works with Archer at theHolly Project, a support service helping survivors of child sexual exploitation (CSE) and their families, said: “There are so many people out there at this moment exploiting the exploited – it’s happening all the time.”The government announced on Monday that police wouldcollect ethnicity datafor all cases of child sexual abuse, after areport from Louise Caseyfound evidence of “overrepresentation” of men of Asian and Pakistani heritage among suspects in local data collected in Greater Manchester, West and South Yorkshire.But Casey also urged the public to“keep calm”over the ethnicities of grooming gang offenders, saying police data from one region suggested that the races of child abuse suspects were proportional with the local population.Archer, who founded the Holly Project, said the collection of ethnicity data of offenders had to improve but also urged those discussing CSE not to rely on stereotypes surrounding perpetrators or their victims. While she was groomed from the age of 14 by men of Pakistani origin, the majority of men who went on to “buy” her and rape her as a child were Chinese.Jones, the author ofJust a Girl, said she was first abused within her own white family, then enticed into a grooming gang.“Nobody wants to know about that because that doesn’t meet their narrative,” Archer said. “You’re told that you’re just not relevant, that it didn’t really happen to you anyway. You’re a liar. You’re a fake person.”Archer said she no longer used social media after facing threats. “I’ve been called a paedophile myself, a paedophile enabler, a grooming gang supporter. They said they hope my daughter gets raped. It’s just constant.”She also described being given a leaflet by the far-rightBritain First political movementin Telford after her book was published in 2016. “They handed me leaflets that had quotes from my own book in them,” she said. “They didn’t know it was me, and they were telling me I was very pro what they were doing. It was insane.”Archer and Jones, who both use pseudonyms and are not pictured to protect themselves and their families, both welcomed therecommendations made by Casey, particularly the involvement of the National Crime Agency (NCA), which will lead a national push to reopen historical group-based child sexual abuse cases.The inquiry, as well as being victim-led, also had to establish a definition of child sexual exploitation, which could differ in different agencies and police forces, the women said.The inquiry will involve five existing local inquiries into grooming gangs being coordinated by an independent commission with full statutory inquiry powers, which Archer said would provide much-needed accountability. “It is really important that the localised aspect is not lost,” she said.In Telford, where a three-year independent inquiry into the scale of CSEconcluded in 2022that hundreds of children had been sexually exploited over decades, victims were consulted from the beginning, Jones said. Survivors, including the Holly Project, then helped the council to implement changes.“At a national level, I don’t want them to lose the part where survivors are actually the people telling them what needs to be done,” she said.The pair are both critical of theindependent inquiry into child sexual abuseled by Prof Alexis Jay, which Jones described as “absolutely pointless”.“Years later, nothing has been done, none of the recommendations have been implemented,” she said. “The worry is that that is what will happen again.”Above all, the pair want to see a shift in the national conversation so that children are always treated as victims, and not seen – as they were – as complicit in their own abuse.“We need one statutory procedure that says if a child is suspected to be at risk of exploitation, we are going to wrap care around them and their family to make sure that they are safe,” Archer said. “We need survivors to feel safe enough just to live their life, be happy and know that they’re worth having that happiness.”In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

They include big institutional investors such as Aberdeen, BlackRock, Invesco and M&G, and US hedge funds such as Elliott Investment Management and Silver Point Capital.Regulatory easements would prove controversialbecause they would in effect make it much easier for Thames’s new owners to achieve bigger financial returns, as it would exempt the company from fines that could reach hundreds of millions of pounds.In May, Thames Water was fined £123m by Ofwat – the biggest ever fine imposed by the regulator. The creditors expect future fines of more than £1bn if current regulations are applied.However, the creditors have argued in meetings with government that the only way to turn around Thames Water is for the threat of fines to be lifted. TheUS private equity firm KKR pulled outof a rescue deal after making the same argument.A spokesperson for the creditors said: “Broad regulatory support is needed to unlock a market-led solution for Thames Water that will secure billions of pounds in fresh investment for its ageing network, allowing a world-class leadership team to start the intensive turnaround and deliver better outcomes for customers and the environment.“This investor group is committed to working with the government and regulators to agree a pragmatic plan that recognises what Thames Water can realistically deliver and they expect to be held accountable for an ambitious trajectory for the company’s return to compliance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another £5bn has already been written off in equity investments by the previous owners.A person familiar with the creditor group’s thinking said SAR would be a “political decision”, because the requested regulatory easements were within Ofwat’s powers.“If they decide they can’t [be lenient on the environmental obligations], they’ll just end up doing it in government themselves” after taking over Thames, the person said.Other water companies would be likely to seize on any leniency to argue that they should also be exempted from fines on the grounds of fairness.However, the creditors argue that exemptions for Thames Water should be the first stage in an overhaul of the regulatory system. The former Bank of England deputy governorJon Cunliffe is considering the shape of a new system.A Thames Water spokesperson said: “Thames Water is committed to improving outcomes for the environment and its customers.“We are investing billions of pounds in our network and any recapitalisation of the business will need to ensure that is maintained for the benefit of all our stakeholders.“Our focus remains on a holistic and fundamental recapitalisation, delivering a market-led solution which includes targeting investment-grade credit ratings.”Explore more on these topicsThames WaterUtilitiesWater industryLabournewsShareReuse this content"

He cautioned, however, that the world was “highly unpredictable” and it was difficult to predict when interest rates would next be reduced.Financial markets expect the MPC to reduce rates at its next meeting in August, and again to 3.75% before the end of the year.The economyshrank by 0.3% in Aprilafter a 0.7% boost in the first three months of the year, indicating a significant cooling in the outlook for growth in national output, or gross domestic product (GDP). Vacancy rates have plummeted to pre-pandemic levels,unemployment has increasedandwages growth has slowed.The MPC said in its report that business surveys “had continued to point to weak underlying GDP growth” and the Bank’s regional agents had said businesses were reluctant to invest while the outlook was clouded by uncertainty.A forecast for the rest of the year said growth would be just 0.25% in each quarter, though “slightly higher” than expected in May.The MPC expects inflation to rise temporarily in the coming months as a result of higher energy prices, and then to fall back later in the year as wage growth weakens.Kathleen Brooks, the research director at the foreign exchange dealer XTB, said the Bank was mainly concerned with bringing inflation down to its 2% target, but it “sounds more worried about the growth outlook than the inflation outlook”.Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at CapitalEconomics, said:“We think it’s only a matter of time before the weakness in employment will lead to a big easing in wage growth. As a result, we continue to expect quarter-point cuts in August, November and February.”UK inflation edged down to3.4% in Mayfrom 3.5% in April, according to official figures published on Wednesday, reflecting falls in air fares and petrol prices. But the cost of food showed a marked increase, including a record rise in chocolate prices as a result of poor harvests in key producer countries.Bailey said earlier this month that Donald Trump’s tariff war madeprospects for inflation and interest ratesmore ambiguous. He told MPs: “The path remains downwards, but how far and how quickly is now shrouded in a lot more uncertainty, frankly.”Since the MPC’s last meeting, the escalating crisis in the Middle East has raised concerns about the future path of oil prices. The MPC report said the cost of Brent crude had risen by 26% to $79 a barrel since the previous report in May, “in part reflecting an escalation in the conflict between Israel and Iran”. European natural gas prices increased by 11%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Period,” he wrote on Facebook.The mayor, who was re-elected to the position last summer, is among the harshest critics of the rightwing government’s politics. He has hung an LGBTQ+ flag and a Ukrainian flag on the administration building in central Budapest, in defiance of Orbán’s Fidesz party’s rhetoric.In an interview with the Guardian this week, before the police statement, Karácsony said he was determined the event would go ahead.“There is currently no law that could ban [a municipal event],” he said. “Obviously, anything can happen inHungary. But we will come up with a plan C.”View image in fullscreenGergely Karácsony, the liberal mayor of Budapest, was one of the speakers at Budapest Pride in 2021.Photograph: Aleksander Kalka/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockDozens of MEPs have said they willattend a Pride event in the city in defiance of the government, as well as politicians including: the Spanish culture minister, Ernest Urtasun; Ireland’s former taoiseach, Leo Varadkar; and the mayors of Amsterdam and Brussels.Karácsony, who won a seat in the Hungarian parliament as a member of a new green party in 2010, the same year Orbán came to power, said he also expected the police to help guarantee the safety of the event. “I believe that everyone can attend safely on 28 June,” he said.Since Orbán returned to power, Hungary has passed a series of laws which have been criticised at home and across the EU for curtailing the rights of the country’s sexual and gender minorities in the name of “child protection”.The bill passed in March by the Fidesz-majority parliament was only the latest but perhaps starkest example, seen by many as a direct attack on Budapest Pride, which has been held in the city for nearly three decades.Karácsony, who waselected mayor of the capital in 2019and was re-elected in 2024 by just a few hundred votes, insists his drive to ensure the march lives on is not about currying favour with voters. “A good politician has a strong moral compass,” he said. “But I know that most Budapest residents agree with me.”At a time when the Hungarian LGBTQ+ community feels increasingly embattled, Karácsony has openly supported LGBTQ+ rights. He was among the speakers at Budapest Pride in 2021, after the government passed a law banning the “display or promotion of homosexuality” to under-18s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the end, the six-party joint opposition chose another city mayor, Péter Márki-Zay, to run for PM. Fidesz retained a two-thirds majority in parliament, and Orbán was elected for a fourth consecutive term.Karácsony told the Guardian he would not run in the 2026 general election, where Orbán is expected to face his strongest opponent to date, Péter Magyar. Magyar, a conservative politician, has not endorsed Pride, but spoken up for the right of people to assemble.“We use power to encourage or support those who need it,” said Karácsony, a sociologist by trade.Quite what will happen on 28 June is unclear. Orbán’s chief of staff, Gergely Gulyás, told a briefing on Wednesday that no matter what the mayor said, a Pride gathering would fall under the legislation that governs the right to assemble.In their statement, police said any appeal against the ban must be lodged with the Hungarian supreme court within three days.The march, they said, “by its very nature cannot be held without the representation” of people belonging to the LGBTQ+ community and that under-18s could be present along the route.“If it cannot be stated with absolute certainty that the display is not taking place in the presence of persons under 18 years of age, the assembly would be in breach of the ban,” the police said.Explore more on these topicsHungaryEuropePrideLGBTQ+ rightsViktor OrbánnewsShareReuse this content"

There have been about 20 such incidents in the last four weeks.Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli fire killed 15 people and wounded 60 between the town of Nuseirat and in the centre ofGazaearly on Thursday morning after thousands had gathered in the hope of receiving rations.Such reports are difficult to confirm independently but interviews conducted by the Guardian with witnesses appeared to corroborate many of the details.Abdullah Ahmed, 31, said he had been about a kilometre from an aid distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a US and Israeli-backed private organisation, when there were a series of explosions and shootings at around 2am local time.“I heard that the GHF site would open in the morning and set out early from my home [in the nearby town of al-Bureij] to get food,” he said. “Because there are always many people, we try to be the first to increase our chances of getting aid.“When I was heading to the aid distribution point, there was heavy but intermittent gunfire from tanks, artillery and quadcopters.“As we got closer to the site, gunfire resumed and shells were launched. A shell fell just a few metres away from me and shrapnel hit me in my chest, neck and leg.”View image in fullscreenA Palestinian woman in Beit Lahia waits for UN aid trucks to enter northern Gaza on Wednesday.Photograph: Ebrahim Hajjaj/ReutersAbdel Fattah Younis, 20, from Nuseirat, said the shooting or shelling occurred when crowds had surged towards the GHF site in the belief that it had opened to distribute aid.“We moved toward it and we became fully exposed … Suddenly, intense gunfire was directed at us … I was shot once in the chest and another bullet lodged in my lower back,” he said.Dr Nasser Abu Samra, the head of the emergency reception department at al-Awda hospital, said it received nine dead and 120 injured from the incident.The Israeli army told Agence France-Presse that troops fired “warning shots” at “suspects” approaching them in the Netzarim area, but that it was “not aware of any injured individuals”.The reported incident came on a particularly bloody day in Gaza, with about 60 people reported killed in a wave of airstrikes.Food has become extremely scarce in Gaza since Israel’s imposition of a tight blockade on all supplies throughout March and April, leaving many of the territory’s inhabitants facing a“critical risk of famine”.Since the blockade was partially lifted last month, the UN has tried to bring in aid but has faced major obstacles including rubble-choked roads, Israeli military restrictions, continuing airstrikes and growing anarchy.What Israel’s new war means for Gaza – podcastRead moreAid officials said an average of 23 UN trucks a day had entered Gaza through the main checkpoint of Kerem Shalom in recent days, but most have been “self-distributed” by hungry Palestinians who stopped them, or looted by organised gangs.The World Food Programme (WFP) said on Wednesday it has been able to dispatch just 9,000 tonnes of food aid into Gaza over the last four weeks, “a tiny fraction of what a population of 2.1 million hungry people needs”.Israel hopes the GHF will replace the previous comprehensive system of aid distribution run by the UN, which Israeli officials claim allowed Hamas to steal and sell supplies.UN agencies and major aid groups, which have delivered humanitarian aid across Gaza since the start of 20-month-long war, haverejected the new system, saying it is impractical, inadequate and unethical. They deny there is widespread theft of aid by Hamas.GHF said in an email on Wednesday that it had provided more than 30m meals “safely and without incident” since it began operating last month.Israel launched its campaign intended to destroy Hamas after the group’s 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage. Hamas still holds 53 hostages, fewer than half of them alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.Gaza’s health ministry said on Tuesday that 5,194 people had been killed since Israel resumed major operations in the territory on 18 March, ending a two-month truce.The death toll in Gaza since the war broke out has reached 55,600, according to the health ministry.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The firm itself was also on trial for moral responsibility in the case.The case, being heard at the criminal court of Châlons-en-Champagne in north-east France, has become known in France as “the grape harvest of shame”.A police investigation found that a total of 57 men and women, mostly from west African countries and many of them undocumented, were allegedly held in fetid housing. They were allegedly forced to work in conditions likened to slavery while hand-picking grapes in Champagne’s picturesque vineyards, in a region recognised as a Unesco world heritage site.The case came to light when residents in the small village of Nesle-le-Repons called police to complain about noise and activity in a derelict house during the September 2023 grape harvest.A labour inspectorate found what it said in a report were “disgusting” and “dilapidated” living conditions at the house.Grape-pickers were allegedly forced to sleep on what they described as stinking inflatable mattresses in a house without proper flooring, walls or windows, amid dangerous electrical wiring and rusty bed frames. There was no adequate water supply, washing facilities or sanitation and only three blocked and unusable toilets.The workers, from countries including Mali, Mauritania, Ivory Coast and Senegal, were allegedly given too little food – either rice or sandwiches that were rotting. They were said to be transported to vineyards crammed into the back of vans, standing up, with no seats or windows. Some told investigators they worked for 10 hours with only a 30-minute break and were threatened if they wanted to rest or drink water.They are believed to have been hired from areas in northern Paris where refugees and undocumented people often sleep rough or in tents and were driven to the Champagne region with the promise of work.The state prosecutor said the housing in the Champagne area included “worn and dirty sanitation facilities”, outdoor kitchen and living areas that were unprotected from the weather, and bedding strewn on the floor.Two of the former workers told local French media that they still cried when thinking about the conditions they experienced. Maxime Cessieux, a lawyer for the workers, said the accused had “a total contempt” and disrespect for “human dignity”.A lawyer for one of the accused employees told theNouvel Obshe had only been involved in initial recruitment, and had had nothing to do with housing or work conditions.The CGT trade union said there must be an end to exploitation of seasonal workers in vineyards.In a sign that the case was being taken seriously by the industry, the Champagne Committee, which represents 16,200 winemakers, 130 cooperatives and 370 champagne houses, took part in the trial as a civil party – a first for legal proceedings concerning the living conditions of seasonal workers.The committee is “firmly opposed to these unacceptable practices”, its director, Charles Goemaere, said in a statement in March.A wine cooperative in the Marne was also on trial for moral responsibility in using illegal labour.Every year, about 120,000 seasonal workers are brought into the Champagne region to handpick grapes grown across 34,000 hectares (84,000 acres) and used to make the sparkling alcoholic drink.But the plight of seasonal workers has sometimes cast a shadow over champagne’s reputation. In 2023,four grape-pickers died, believed to have suffered sunstroke after working in scorching heat. During the 2018 champagne harvest, dozens of workers, including many from Afghanistan, were discovered housed in fetid conditions. Two members of a firm providing labour to the wine industry were found guilty of human trafficking and given prison sentences.David Desgranges, vice-president of the Consortium Contre l’Esclavage Moderne (Committee Against Modern Slavery), told Agence France-Presse: “The public should be made aware of the extent of human trafficking in the agricultural sector, and producers should know that they may face legal action.”Explore more on these topicsFranceWineFood & drink industryEuropeFoodHuman traffickingnewsShareReuse this content"

So why did he find becoming an artist so unnatural? Ahead of a major British show, he reveals allThu 19 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 09.47 EDTShareYou only have to glance at William Kentridge’s family tree to realise why he is such an outsider. His maternal grandmother, Irene Geffen, was South Africa’s first female barrister while his mother, Felicia Geffen, became an anti-apartheid lawyer. Then there’s his father, Sydney Kentridge, the indomitable QC who represented Nelson Mandela in the 1960s and fought for justice for Steve Biko in the 70s. Studying law would have been the obvious path. “Public speaking, thinking on my feet, were natural and easy skills,” said Kentridge back in 1998. “Being an artist was a very unnatural and hard thing for me to do.”That’s quite a statement. Because in the three decades since, Kentridge has conquered the international art world with the oomph and verve of an emerging twentysomething. He has exhibited in most major museums and biennales, and his work now fetches millions. Along the way, he has collected 10 honorary doctorates, numerous grand prizes in art and theatre, and a spot on the Time 100 list of influential people. Now, fresh from celebrating his 70th birthday in April, he has two solo exhibitions under way, two group shows, four touring operas, a touring feature-length film and a nine-part film series,Self-Portrait As a Coffee-Pot, streaming globally on Mubi “with an accompanying 836-page book”. It’s almost as if he was, indeed, a natural.A sound becomes a line. A line becomes a drawing. A drawing becomes a shadow. A shadow gains the heft of a paperweightWe meet in London, before an expansive show titled The Pull of Gravity, is about to open atYorkshire Sculpture Park. He suggests we meet at his flat opposite the British Museum and, despite him having to take a flight to South Korea in a few hours, he greets me at the door with gentle aplomb. I sit at the kitchen table while he makes tea and talks about coffee pots. If you set out to do a self-portrait, he explains, you can either attempt some kind of likeness, or you can list, say, all the books you’ve ever read, or all the objects you own, or even just one. “In that sense,” he says, “a coffee pot is as good a way of drawing oneself as drawing a picture of your face.”View image in fullscreen‘The self becomes an absurdity’... a still from Self-Portrait As a Coffee-Pot.Photograph: Courtesy Kentridge Studio, © William KentridgeAnd this, it turns out, is something he actually does. “Ironically,” he says, “the coffee pot I draw is the one kind of coffee pot that I don’t like. So they’re not kept in the kitchen. People see them in the studio, though, and they give me more of them. So we have a huge range of these Bialetti coffee pots sitting in the studio and they’re used as paint-holders, brush-holders and flower pots. I suppose, because it’s an absurdity, the self becomes an absurdity.”In person, Kentridge is exactly as he is in his films: same cadence, same donnish delivery, same subtle wit, same kindness. Only the blue of the shirt he’s wearing today feels out of place, given how it jars with the crisp white button-down he wears for the films in the Coffee Pot series, in which he appears as several versions of himself (Kentridge One, Two and sometimes Three). In each, these Kentridges sport lopsided pince-nez glasses as they go about the business of the studio. We watch their white shirts getting spotted and smudged, almost as if they’re being slowly subsumed into whatever is being drawn: tree, landscape, stage, mine.Kentridge still lives and works in the whitewashed turn-of-the-century home he grew up in in Johannesburg. But since 2014, he has also owned this small London pied-a-terre, which looks and feels like a studio, buzzing with paintings, drawings and sculptures. Having it is, in part, to meet the travel demands of an unrelenting international schedule. It also allows him to see family members who live here: his siblings, a daughter and two grandchildren, and his father, who is now 102.View image in fullscreenExploring Shostakovich’s relationship with Stalin ... Oh to Believe in Another World.Photograph: Victor & Simon – Joana Luz/© William Kentridge“I was with him yesterday,” he says. “His memory’s going, so he says, ‘What are you doing?’ I said, ‘I’ve been in France.’ ‘What were you doing in France?’ I said, ‘Oh, I was inducted as an academician at the Académie des Beaux-Arts.’ And he said, ‘Ah, my boy, I’m proud of you. It was worth every franc I paid them.’” He laughs quietly. “I’m his 70-year-old boy,” he says.The YorkshireSculpturePark show will be the most complete survey of Kentridge’s sculptural work outside South Africa. As a new commission for the park itself, he has created Paper Procession, six monumental cutouts that started out as paper but are now painted aluminium and steel. The largest is more than five metres tall. Further works include four of Kentridge’s largest bronzes and, inside, several sets of tiny bronzes he refers to as “glyphs”: ink flourishes rendered in metal that stand in for things spoken or heard. “The sculpture very often starts as drawing,” he says. “It’s about the weight of a word, the weight of a thought, a way of fixing something that would otherwise be very changeable.”Belgian set designer and long-term collaborator Sabine Theunissen has designed the exhibition to also include several film works.Oh to Believe in Another World, recently on show at London’s Southbank Centre, examines composer Dmitri Shostakovich’s relationship with Stalin – and the fizz and trauma of the Soviet century. Visually and textually, it is a magnificent DIY medley of dancing, archival footage, puppetry and cut-up dialogue steeped in avant garde experimentation. “There are things from the constructivists that we’re still catching up with,” says Kentridge. “Dziga Vertov’s Man With a Movie Camera – no one has made a film like it in the 96 years since it was made.”View image in fullscreenKentridge’s Cursive, 2020.Photograph: Thys Dullaart/© William KentridgeSelf-Portrait As a Coffee-Pot, meanwhile, will be on view in its entirety, a mesmerising discussion of art-making and mortality. Each episode takes as its source the genesis of a recent project, with added family stories, memories and some critique. “There was no overarching script,” says Kentridge. “I’m not a narrative writer. I keep thinking I should do a detective story, but I have different skills, a different brain.” Instead, he improvised: “I was recognising things as they emerged.”It was filmed in his Johannesburg studio (a “vital, vital place”). You see one or other Kentridge character surveying a sculpture under way, with a baby on his hip or a taller child in tow. The wider family of studio collaborators, assistants and performers make appearances too, as do horses made of cardboard and timber, animated armies of drawing pins, and tiny mice made quickly from putty eraser detritus.“There are some artists for whom it is very important not to talk about what they’re doing while they’re doing it,” he says. “But I’m someone who works easily and well with people seeing work in different stages. While they’re watching the film, I’m watching them – to see things that are connecting and those that are not.”Also, he says, talking about the work is not just about sharing – it’s about making. “Somebody says, ‘What film are you making?’ And I don’t really know. But by the end of the conversation, I have a very clear second conversation going on in my head – as I’m calling it into being.”View image in fullscreenKentridge working on the preparatory plaster version of the bronze Laocoön, 2021.Photograph: Stella Olivier/© William KentridgeTheunissen first met Kentridge in 2002, when he was directing and doing animations for Mozart’s The Magic Flute at the Théatre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels. He was put in touch with Theunissen and he asked if she knew his work. She replied no. “To my shame!” she says. However, he was delighted. Even more so when she admitted she didn’t know the opera well either. She returned the next day with, as a design proposal, a maquette so small she’d transported it in a matchbox. He was sold. “He didn’t even look inside,” Theunissen says. “I think it’s because I immediately started making something. And we still work in the same way.”This principle of, as Kentridge puts it, “being open to discovery rather than knowing in advance what you’ll do” saw him start an arts centre in Johannesburg in 2015: The Centre for the Less Good Idea. More than 2,000 artists have gone to work at this hub of experimentation, described as unlike anything else in the country. Pianist and composer Kyle Shepherd has contributed to multiple Kentridge projects since meeting him there. “Usually when musicians and artists reach his age,” says Shepherd, “they sort of paint the rhinoceros another 2,000 times, or they play the piece another 1,000 times, because that’s what worked for the last 40 years.” But not Kentridge, says the musician, who thinks of him as “a jazz man”, a master improviser.“There’s a branch of Hasidism,” says Kentridge, “that believes the words of the prayer are for God and the gaps between the words – the white spaces – are for you. That’s me. In the moment of listening, I absolutely get lost.” In the Coffee Pot series, he describes the studio as a space where impulse is allowed to expand and find its place: “A sound becomes a line. A line becomes a drawing. A drawing becomes a shadow. A shadow gains the heft of a paperweight.” At 70, Kentridge is not slowing down, eyes firmly fixed on what he cannot yet see.William Kentridge: The Pull of Gravity is atYorkshire Sculpture Parkfrom 28 June to 19 AprilExplore more on these topicsArt and designWilliam KentridgeArt (Education)Art (Art and design)Yorkshire Sculpture ParkPaintingSculptureinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Kevin Williamson sees you. And he has reinvented his late-90s/early-00s tale of a close knit community round a watery area for an adult market. Not adult-adult, you understand – we’re talking drug-running and crumbling family empire rather than sauce – but the main ingredients of his first TV hit are all here. Namely, masses of plot and some lightly sketched characters to keep it moving swiftly enough that nobody has time to stop and say “Hang on, fellas – I simply don’t believe a word of this!” Those of us who sat through several young women choosing Dawson over Pacey are only here for the second part of the phrase “credible drama”.The Buckleys and their fleet have long dominated the small fishing town of Havenport, North Carolina. They are rich and troubled. More so the latter as they become less of the former because business is getting tougher and mighty patriarch Harlan (Holt McCallany, charismatic, humourless) took his hand off the tiller to have two heart attacks and left his inadequate son Cane (Jake Weary, uncharismatic, humourless) to run things for a bit. Cane decided the best way to do this was to start shifting illegal narcotics for wodges of cash and an unseen gangster called Owen. Alas, we open with a set of Cane’s smuggling crewmen being offed by a gang of armed men, and Owen’s $10m shipment going missing. Cane asks his cousin Lynette (Bethany DeZelle), at whatever the nautical equivalent of the DVLA, North Carolinian office is, to amend some paperwork to say that he sold the murder boat three months ago. I am sure this is a foolproof cover and that nothing will escalate.The Drug Enforcement Administration descends – but the family is so steeped in internecine warfare that they hardly notice. Harlan returns to the office to beat the living daylights out of Cane and advise the clan that the problem lies not in drug smuggling but innotdrug smugglingenough. They need to cut the middle men out of the picture and take hold of the supply line themselves. OK, grizzled boomer.Cane’s mother, Belle (Maria Bello), is secretly cutting a deal to sell a stretch of Buckley land to a developer. But! This stretch of land is sacred to the memory of Harlan’s late mother, and he won’t be grizzly pleased when he finds out. And! The developer wants to develop Belle’s site too, if ya know what I mean. She is considering the offer.Meanwhile! Cane’s sister Bree (Supergirl’s Melissa Benoist, flying here too – albeit metaphorically – and, like Bello, improving the show with every scene she is in) has been given a job in the family bar and restaurant after rehab for alcohol and pill addiction. She is keen to get back to proper work but the Buckleys don’t think she is ready. She has also lost custody of her son, Diller (Brady Hepner) to her cruddy ex-husband and is trying to repair their relationship on the boy’s weekend visits. Unfortunately, Diller is unforgiving of her catalogue of sins – which I suspect goes back to naming him ‘Diller’ – and progress is slow. Harlan gives Diller a job in the restaurant, putting Bree in near-permanent breach of a court order to stay 300 feet away from anyone she has nomenclaturally abused since infancy, so, you know, that’s a worry.Meanwhile, again! On top of the multimillion dollar drug debt, Cane is tormented by the return of his first love/high school sweetheart/soulmate, who is a totally differently pretty brunette from his wife and also married. His wife is called Peyton (Danielle Campbell) and his former girlfriend is called Jenna (Humberly González). That’s really all there is to say about them.Twists and reveals come thick and fast. You’ll never guess who Bree is seeing on the down-low, or where they met! You’ll never guess which character played by an established character actor whose part initially seems too small for him turns out to be a double-crossing major player in the whole caboodle! You’ll never guess how efficient and uninspiring the script is! You’ll never guess which issues it nods towards so you don’t feel like you’re entirely wasting your time! Toxic masculinity, generational trauma, the father-son bond, class divides and the problems of the one per cent in a coastal location? Oh, you CAN guess – well done!You get the idea. It is escapist summer nonsense with – God, I hope – no pretensions to being otherwise. Dive into the adult creek and wallow in nostalgia as the waves of absurdity sweep towards shore.The Waterfront is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Absolutely not for the faint-heartedStuart HeritageThu 19 Jun 2025 17.10 EDTShareThe smart thing about comparing something to The Jinx is that you’re essentially daring viewers to stick with you until the very end. After all,as good as The Jinx was, it didn’t reach legendary status until its final few moments, when notorious murder suspect Robert Durst paused an interview with his microphone still on, and muttered a confession while using the toilet.The Mortician, it has to be said, is pound for pound more staggering than The Jinx. Joshua Rofé’s three-part documentary about California cremator David Sconce is a feat of construction, patiently doling out larger and larger transgressions until the whole thing becomes swamped in unimaginable horror. It’s the kind of documentary where, when the credits roll, you realise that you haven’t drawn breath for several minutes.As with most true crime documentaries, Sconce’s case is a known one. Perhaps you watched it unfold at the time, or perhaps you like to spend your time trawling the darker corners of Wikipedia. This is the downfall of many products of this ilk; they’re flashy retellings that add very little of value. The Mortician is not that. The Lamb Funeral Home scandal made enough of a splash to have inspired more than one novel, and yet The Mortician deserves to go down as the definitive version.On some level, it’s the story of a very efficient businessman. As the figure in charge of Pasadena crematorium Lamb Funeral Home, David Sconce was determined to undercut his rivals. He would perform long round-trips around mortuaries in his rundown van, collecting bodies, burning them and returning them for the low, low price of $55. But cremations are slow. It takes from two to three hours to burn a body and let the remains cool enough to safely gather them. So Sconce started burning a few at a time. And then more and more, breaking bones to cram as many as he could into his incinerator. In barely any time at all the business went from performing 194 cremations a year to 8,173, handing bereaved relatives urns scooped from bins brimming with the mixed ashes of countless different people.View image in fullscreenWeirdly charismatic … David Sconce, the Richie Cunningham-esque figure who ran the Lamb Funeral Home.Photograph: HBOIncredibly, it only gets worse from there. To reveal too much would be to spoil the cascade of monstrosities that follow, but it makes for extremely queasy viewing. The thefts, the desecration, the complete detachment between the human life that ended and the wholesale scavenging that followed. It is unbelievably dark.At the centre of it all is Sconce himself. Met by the documentary crew outside jail, where he had just finished serving a 10-year sentence, Sconce is a weirdly charismatic presence. Described by one talking head as “Richie Cunningham” from Happy Days, he has a big, open, all-American face, and golly-gees his way through much of his interviews despite the atrocities laid at his feet. At best, he defends his actions with a cold logic – “People have got to be more in control of their emotions,” he says at one point of the appalled bereaved; “That’s not your loved one any more” – but at worst there’s a showboating bravado, as if he can’t get enough of his own performance.And this is ultimately what gets him. The Mortician has received so many comparisons to The Jinx because of how it ends. During an unguarded moment when he believes the camera is no longer running, Sconce appears to admit to something awful. It’s left vague, since there’s nothing as concrete as Durst muttering that he “killed them all”, but it’s still enough for Rofé to publicly encourage renewed investigation.However, while the climax will grab all the headlines, the journey is just as important. The Mortician isn’t only about one grim individual who did horrendous things to thousands of corpses; it’s about the dehumanising effects of unfettered capitalism and our own relationship to death. In the cold light of day, how should we treat the people we love once they are gone? Is the dignity we afford their bodies purely ceremonial? Do they simply become matter to be disposed of by whatever means necessary?It is a harrowing journey to get to the end of the programme – the faint of heart should be warned that the series includes talk of concentration camps, infants, organ harvesting and something nefariously referred to as “popping chops” – but it’s worth it. The Mortician is so much more than a gussied-up Wikipedia page. It’s something that is unlikely to ever leave you.The Mortician is on Sky and Now in the UK. In the US, it airs on HBO and Max.

This weird butjoyous documentaryfrom Morgan Neville uses Lego to encapsulate the life of the wildly successful Neptunes producer and musician. Williams having synaesthesia – he experiences sound as colour – means the film can go off on visual flights of fancy; the beats he creates becoming rainbow fireworks or vibrant waves. All this trippy imagery covers up the fact that his rise to stardom has been fairly frictionless, but contributions from Lego versions of Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg et al attest to his offbeat worldview and hyperactive creativity.Saturday, 8.25am, 4.20pm, Sky Cinema PremiereSaint OmerView image in fullscreenMurky and moving … Kayije Kagame in Saint Omer.Photograph: TCD/AlamyWhy would a mother leave her 15-month-old daughter on a beach to drown?

Lecturer Rama (Kayije Kagame) attends in the hope of writing a book about it, but uneasy resonances with her own life – immigrant family, pregnancy, mixed-race relationship – throw her off-track.

It was a marriage so heinous that one would be tempted to think it was parody had it not existed in a film so entirely devoid of humour and self-awareness. The Chris Evans/Ana de Armas vehicle became the new nadir of the action comedy, a subgenre that has been run down into the sewer by streamers, carelessly cobbling together big stars and bad quips on an almost weekly basis.28 Years Later review – Danny Boyle’s zombies on the rage rampage againRead moreBut as dreadful as it was, there was something fascinatingly dreadful about it, a cacophony of bad decisions that became almost instructive to the industry in its of-the-moment awfulness. In this week’s Bride Hard, the latest tinny genre mix to get chucked at us, when Rebel Wilson’s shoddy kitchen-based fight scene is scored to Geri Halliwell’s It’s Raining Men, you’ll be too bored to even roll your eyes, if you’re even awake at that point.The awfulness of Bride Hard just isn’t worth pointing and laughing at, it’s the kind of joyless slog that pushes you to check out early and never gives you reason to check back in. Even in a season where we’re somewhat forced to be a little more forgiving given the limited options, this really is as bad as it gets (and it’s gotten to be pretty bad already).The makers would like you to think of it as Die Hard meets Bridesmaids and it certainly hits enough of those assembled beats in theory, shamelessly so when it tries to copy the formula of the latter. Like that film it centres on a maid of honour whose behaviour causes a rift with her oldest friend turned bride-to-be and a rivalry with a rich, catty bridesmaid. But unlike Kristen Wiig’s hit, still one of the greatest comedies of the last 20 years, it doesn’t find any humour or texture within that set-up and when an action plot is thrown on top, there are also none of the base pleasures one would expect from a Die Hard rip-off.The maid of honour is Sam (Rebel Wilson, funnier in a handful of scenes in Bridesmaids than she is in this entire movie), who is hiding her job as a superspy from best friend, Betsy (Wilson’s Pitch Perfect co-star Anna Camp). When she is forced to abandon her bachelorette party in what’s allegedly Paris, Betsy loses her patience and replaces her with Virginia (Anna Chlumsky, doing too much yet not enough), heading into the wedding on bad terms. But after a group of criminals (led by Stephen Dorff) take the guests hostage, Sam must reveal her true identity and save the day. Cue Geri.Even taking Bride Hard on its own low-stakes terms – a cheap rip-off made two years ago and released by an almost brand new company – it’s a total disaster, a tedious and maddeningly laugh-free endurance test that’s also made without a shred of competence. Its ugliness is a slight surprise, given that it’s directed by the British film-maker Simon West, who was behind Con Air, one of the most enjoyable action films of the 90s. He went on to make lesser yet still slickly efficient films like The General’s Daughter and Tomb Raider but with studio backing stripped away, any confidence behind the camera has gone awol, the action sequences as uninvolving as the script is unfunny. The only amusing moment is unintentional, as a character lies next to some Fiji water bottles while another digs into a bag of Lay’s chips before the camera glides past a selection of elf beauty products, swiftly explaining where some of the budget came from …Paul Feig followed Bridesmaids with two of the best contemporary action comedies – The Heat and Spy – films that could easily rest on the skills of a dynamo like Melissa McCarthy. Wilson just doesn’t have those chops, a limited comedic actor who only works in small doses in certain roles visibly struggling as a straightforward lead and despite having made three Pitch Perfect films with Camp, they have zero chemistry together. Lower down the cast is also a wasted Da’Vine Joy Randolph, one of the most deserving Oscar winners of late, forced into tiresome shtick that should be beneath her (one hopes after this andShadow Force, she can move on to better things). Films like Bride Hard, proudly recycling well-known popcorn plots without any attempt at originality, rely on heavy-lifting star power but there’s just none of that here.It leaves screenwriter Shaina Steinberg with far too much to do. Her decision to pair crude R-rated dick joke comedy with PG-rated Home Alone sequel action means that no one really knows what the hell they’re doing and who on earth it might be for. The answer might just be no one.Bride Hard is out in US cinemas on 20 June, Australia on 31 July and in the UK at a later dateExplore more on these topicsRebel WilsonComedy filmsComedyAction and adventure filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Saint-Saëns took years to write his Trio No 2, and the result was a sprawling five-movement work that gets an appropriately wide-ranging and meaty performance here. The first movement roils and surges, the players catching both the push and pull of the restless theme and the brief passage of stillness later on. The slow third movement sings .with wistful nostalgia, and the fourth flows by in a waltz-like whirl pitched somewhere between Chopin and Dvořák. But the second movement, with its obsessively repeated rhythmic motif, perhaps needs a little more imagination to make it work.The two movements ofMel Bonis’s Soir et Matin, written in 1907, are the opposite way round in atmosphere from how you might expect: Soir (Evening) is soulful, expansive and melodic; Matin (Morning) altogether more strange, impressionistic and beguiling. Finally, there’s something unexpected on a chamber music recital: Debussy’s painterly orchestral showpiece La Mer. Rendering the orchestra’s highly textured writing for a chamber group is no easy task but this version, made by the composer Sally Beamish in 2013, is imaginative and beautifully judged, emerging more like a new work in its own right than a mere arrangement.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

In Hark, the author Alice Vincent goes to extreme lengths to eradicate noise as she spends time in an anechoic chamber, a heavily soundproofed space designed to swallow up sound waves. There she becomes aware of the noises of her own body, from involuntary swallowing to the soft, high-pitched ringing in her ears. But rather than feel unease, she is “confronted with a comfort I couldn’t have imagined – and a familiarity with quietude I didn’t realise I was living in”.Hark is a book about listening, being heard and the author’s shifting relationship with sound in the early years of motherhood. While working as a music journalist in her 20s, Vincent had been surrounded by noise. But now, in her 30s and plunged into domesticity, she finds herself craving quiet. She also examines how others experience sound, investigating misophonia, an acute sensitivity to everyday noises; deep listening, a practice that ensures the speaker feels heard; and the concept of “deaf gain”, which turns the notion of “hearing loss” into something positive and empowering.The actor Fiona Hampton is the book’s narrator, though her reading is interspersed with voice notes from Vincent in which she shares reflections and asides not available in the printed edition; ahead of a chapter entitled Ghosts, she recalls her mother talking about the “baby in the head”, her expression to describe the phantom crying often heard by new mothers. The audiobook also concludes with a wonderfully warm conversation between Hampton and Vincent where they discuss their experiences of motherhood and the ways it fundamentally changed how they listen.Available via Canongate, 8hr 44minFurther listeningLootTania James, Penguin Audio, 9hr 23minMaanuv Thiara narrates this epic tale constructed around the real-life theft of an 18th-century wooden tiger from Mysore in India by British soldiers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Wonder, nostalgia, love, hurt, excitement, hard-won peace: these are the emotions his voice tends to catch on. When combined with his typically blissed-out sonics – feathery breakbeats, dreamy piano figures, delicate synth washes, gently plucked guitars – the results are often very nice. Sometimes a bit too nice. So it is on Feel at Home, the sentimental love song that opens the 30-year-old’s fourth album, Hopefully!View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Hopefully!Photograph: Publicity imageCarner – whose moniker is a spoonerism of his real name, Benjamin Coyle-Larner – never makes music that is boring or basic. As well as the slushy lyrics and comfortingly toasty chords, Feel at Home is buttressed by madly skittering percussion and what sounds like a blurry reproduction of young children’s playground chatter. But much like the outpouring of earnestness and loveliness on the Croydon-raised rapper’s first two albums, Hopefully! may well have you hankering for a shred of dissonance or disruption – especially after 2022’s Mercury-shortlistedHugo, which gratifyingly offset Carner’s trademark tenderness with a more abrasive sonic palette. Initially, the musician seems to have moved on – or perhaps backwards – from that record.Then he starts singing. Carner has said he was duped into doing so by his producer, Avi Barath (he originally thought his vocal track was a placeholder for another performer). It was a trick worth playing: whenever Carner slips into his low-pitched, totally unaffected croon, it cuts through any over-sweetness like a squeeze of lemon. The combination works particularly well on the exceptional In My Mind – whose lugubrious self-laceration and loose, clattery instrumentation recalls King Krule’s thrilling early work, while always remaining characteristically Carner – as well as in the choruses of Lyin and Strangers. The latter’s singsong central refrain is flatly murmured in a way that feels authentically uncertain and all the more appealing for it.Loyle Carner: Lyin – videoVulnerability has always been Carner’s lyrical stock in trade. It tends to manifest in two ways, first in open-hearted sincerity that has generated songs about grief and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and which is in full flow on the album’s title track: “You give me hope in humankind, but are humans kind? / I don’t know but I hope so.” Second, in a less anodyne and far more striking form of introspection: on In My Mind, he admits a tendency towards myopic self-obsession and alludes to the bitter dismissal of a “minor friend”.Carner has two young children, and the artwork for Hopefully! features the kind of felt-tip scrawl most toddler-wranglers will recognise. Parenting is the album’s major theme, and there are moments when Carner approaches it from a compellingly raw angle. On About Time, covering the tensions between fatherhood and artistry, the narrator lists the thrills of his job before describing what sounds like a fight with his partner, in which he lets slip yet “another fucking thing I know you couldn’t forgive”. Yet for all Carner’s accounts of the internal and external conflict involved in fatherhood, it’s hard to buy the more damning self-critique – on Lyin he claims to be “just a man trained to kill, to love I never had the skill” – from an artist who makes music this heartfelt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Progressing from anxiety to confusion to a strange elation, he is overcome by the way his child’s hand reflexively tightens as he attempts to let go of it and how bright the sky looks in the middle of the night. His voice radiates awe and trepidation-tinged delight. It is magical songwriting, and his most impressive work to date.Even before fatherhood, Carner’s work fixated on family: his mother is unusually omnipresent in his music, even by hip-hop’s standards. His 2019 song Dear Jean even took pains to insist that his new girlfriend was no threat to the pair’s intimacy. She’s still never far away; over luminous guitars on All I Need, he recalls the smell of “the sheets on my mother’s mattress – just the place I learnt my backflips”. It’s classic Carner: the place where heady feeling threatens to tip over into cloying soppiness. Yet thanks to a pleasingly precarious new vocal style and some levelled-up lyricism, he’s more adept than ever at this specific balancing act.This week Rachel listened toBig Thief – IncomprehensibleThis taster of the Brooklyn band’s sixth album, Double Infinity, ups the tempo as frontperson Adrianne Lenker makes peace with the aging process in her trademark stream-of-consciousness style.

Her husband, Matt, discovered he had pancreatic cancer; her father-in-law, aunt and stepfather all died; and her then 81-year-old mother, the novelist and poet Erica Jong, was diagnosed with dementia. “My mother is just a body now,” she states in How to Lose Your Mother. “Erica Jong the person has left the planet.”That year also marked the 50th anniversary ofFear of Flying, Jong’s autobiographical novel. Hailed as a landmark of feminist literature, it made a star of its author, selling more than 20m copies and leading to appearances on The Tonight Show and the cover of Newsweek. The book coined the phrase “the zipless fuck” to describe casual sex. “Now think about being the offspring of the person who wrote that sentence. And pour one out for me,” writes Jong-Fast.How to Lose Your Mother documents this annus horribilis when, along with working and parenting three children, the author found herself juggling meetings with doctors, carers, accountants and funeral directors. It also provides snapshots of a life spent in the shadow of her mother’s celebrity. Jong-Fast, who is an only child, learned early that the problem with success is that it tends to wane, leading to grief, bitterness and, in Erica’s case, alcoholism. “Becoming normal like the rest of us, the journey to unfamousness, was for [Erica] an event so strange and stressful, so damaging to her ego, that she was never able to process it.”Her mother’s dementia crept up slowly. In the past, people would come up to Jong-Fast to tell her what Erica’s writing meant to them; now they reported her saying or doing something inappropriate, such as writing the word “Neat” under a social media post announcing someone’s death. Visiting her at home, Jong-Fast often found her once glamorous mother shuffling around with her robe open, a breast exposed. Yet the elderly, absent-minded Jong wasn’t so different from her younger self, when she was dreamy and distracted. She never came to school performances or sat down and played with her daughter. For long stretches of her childhood, her mother was absent and parenting was handed over to a nanny.While Jong-Fast is aware of her privilege – she blithely refers to her “nepo baby” status – she nonetheless paints a bleak picture of familial dysfunction and neglect. After a childhood spent longing for Erica’s attention, she finds her mother is now dependent on her and pleading for her company. Mirroring the way Erica relied on others to look after her daughter all those years ago, Jong-Fast finds herself doing the same, hiring others to deal with the day-to-day business of caring.The writing veers between punchy and meandering, with moments of deep sadness leavened by a sardonic humour. There is a sense, at times, that we are eavesdropping on an extended therapy session. Guilt is a running theme. Her honesty not just about her mother’s shortcomings but her own, specifically her reluctance to spend time with Erica, is affecting. So too is her agony over her decision to move her mother and stepfather out of their apartment and into a care facility, selling their home and belongings without their knowledge.But there is another less convincing seam of agony here, related to her spilling the beans. “[I’ve] always hated the idea of writing a book like this,” she notes more than once, to which the obvious response is: “Then why do it?” Certainly, Jong-Fast’s assertion that she is a bad daughter for writing about Erica’s decline strikes a disingenuous note. You don’t tell the world you have found shit in your mother’s bed if you are fundamentally uncomfortable with revealing the details of her infirmity.Jong-Fast is most convincing when describing the blunt reality of her situation. She learns that, though we are shaped by our parents, seeking redress or closure following an unhappy childhood is a fool’s errand. She also discovers that simultaneously wrangling elderly dependents and children along with a critically ill spouse while in the throes of middle age can drive a person to the brink, and that it is normal to wish to run away. Yet she makes it out the other side of her terrible year, not through bravery or superhuman stoicism, but because there is no other road available. As she tells her husband in the aftermath of his cancer treatment: “The only way through is through.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It was originally titled Eccentric Abstraction, but the eccentrically abstract isn’t nearly as sexy as the erotic – yet somehow neither title quite fits the strange and compelling sculptures and little objects, drawings and reliefs by Alice Adams, Eva Hesse andLouise Bourgeoisthat, even 60 years on, are as alive as ever they were.Eccentric Abstraction was the first exhibition Lippard had ever curated, and was, she said, “an attempt to blur boundaries, in this case between minimalism and something more sensuous and sensual – that is, in retrospect, something more feminist” – although, at the time, feminism was far from her mind. The exhibition was crucial in the development of the now 88-year-old’s thinking and her subsequent activism.Although many of the works here were included in the original show, this is not a thorough restaging, and all the male artists, including the then recently graduated Bruce Nauman, are absent. Eccentric Abstraction is largely remembered for the contributions the three female artists made, for the coherence of their approaches to materiality, form and artistic process, and the ways their work addressed the psychosexual and the human body.There are fewer than 30 sculptures, reliefs and drawings here, occupying two small rooms. But size isn’t everything. One of the delights of this exhibition is to do with scale. Only one work is bigger than we are. Others you could put in your pocket or carry in your arms. The works of all three artists sit close to the walls, hang from the walls, dangle on wires in front of them, or sit on shelves in a vitrine, jostling in and out of view, emphasising intimacy and proximity. It is a show of close relations, filled with delicate things and enigmatic things, and things as incomprehensible as they are beguiling.View image in fullscreenA show of close relations … Eva Hesse, No title, 1966.Photograph: Stefan Altenburger Photography Zürich/© The Estate of Eva Hesse. Courtesy Hauser & Wirth. Photo: Stefan Altenburger Photography ZürichIt isn’t all about forms directly analogous to body parts, although there are plenty of those. There is instead an unnerving slippage between the skin and the interior, between the whole and the part, just as there is between sculptural form and drawing, between object and image, threat and tenderness, familiarity and otherness.A black shape like a pear or a lightbulb, by Hesse, dangles from the wall on a string that loops around a nail to another object that just touches the pear thing. This object is like a skinny black sausage that narrows at its tip then bulges out again, like a bratwurst giving birth to a cocktail sausage. All the elements are painted with black enamel. Stark and graphic, the arrangement is funny and lewd and very satisfying to look at – reminding me, distantly, of Giacometti’s 1930-31 surrealist sculpture Suspended Ball. While movements and idioms come and go, distant debts to surrealism and Freud persist. The unconscious is always with us.A steel cable passes through the holes in a perforated metal plate and gets entangled there. Another rusted steel cable is woven through a metal grid. Their relations are complicated and they ensnare me. These tensile amalgamations were the work of Adams, who first trained as a weaver and previously worked with looms and fibre. There is a direct link between her earlier textile art and these sculptures. Other, later works use chain-link fencing, and yet more lengths of springy, twisty, recalcitrant cable that could only be manipulated with difficulty. Their torsions have lives of their own, and can’t be forced to follow paths they don’t want to take. Adams’s materials told her what could and couldn’t be done. Some things twist and coil and are held in dynamic constraint. They have the brevity of a sentence but look as if they could explode.View image in fullscreenThey have the brevity of a sentence but look as if they could explode … Alice Adams, Sheath, 1964.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and David Hall Gallery, Wellesley MA. ©️ Howcroft Photography, Boston. Beth Rudin DeWoody CollectionAnother work – an interpenetrating conjunction of a chain-link cylinder and a rusted, woven steel cable funnel – conflates the two forms into a conundrum of interior and exterior. A bulging roll of aluminium fencing hangs like a great intestinal tract in mid-air, a huge skeletal drawing in wire, the form dramatically lit and entangled with its own shadow, which is cast on the wall just behind it.If Eccentric Abstraction seems like a long time ago, the ways the artists worked endure, in their approach to materiality, their disregard of neat divisions between abstraction and figuration, and the ways their works not only occupy space but actively inhabit it. This sensibility is still with us. If the ideas are still alive, much of the works Hesse made using hand-poured sheets of latex resin are now extremely difficult to show or to conserve, the material having darkened and become brittle by age exposure to daylight.The same is true of the sculptures Bourgeois made using latex. Several of Bourgeois’s sculptures here have darkened and shrivelled, and acquired a feel of the archaeological relic, if not the fossilised. Her latex and cloth Le Regard, a kind of rounded bowl or vessel split open to reveal something (are there teeth in there, is that an eye or a clitoris?) now seems to belong to an archaic past. Perhaps timelessness can only ever be accidental.Bourgeois’s art is filled with ambivalent images and forms. Her Fée Couturière is a dangling off-white sac, a little like a wasp’s nest penetrated by apertures. It might be a head, it could be a habitation. Even the version of her Fillette, a dangling erect penis and balls, sheathed and swaddled in some kind of blanket, is as much female as it is, just as inescapably, male. Gender in almost all the works here is slippery, when it can be ascribed at all.View image in fullscreenRecords of her own emotional weather … Louise Bourgeois, Untitled, 1968.Photograph: Photo : Christopher Burke, © The Easton Foundation, Licensed by DACS, UK and VAGA at ARS, NYWhat a can of worms all this is. On cue, sitting on a shelf behind glass, are two small cylindrical containers by Hesse, one most likely the original lid to the other, both filled to overflowing with little worms, fashioned from cord and wire, everything painted in white enamel.Many of Hesse’s works from the mid-1960s can be seen as impromptus or asides, things made in the moment, without much regard to their permanence. Wrapped objects bulge in sagging net bags, like so much shopping. It’s as if Hesse made things to see what they would look like, how they would look back at her and tell her what to do next: one thing leading to another, and another. Many of the compound forms Hesse created were made using inflated balloons as a kind of armature, their surfaces built up and solidified using tape and paint. The process is immediate and daft, as basic as breathing.Along with Abstract Erotic, The Courtauld is also showing a room of drawings by Bourgeois. Filled with maelstroms and turbulence, repetitive gestures and breast forms, waves and rows of marks and unnameable, unstoppable eruptions, they are more records of her own emotional weather than any formal search. These drawings often have a great touch, but the sculptures in Abstract Erotic say it all, even when we don’t know what it is.Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Alice Adams atthe Courtauld, London, from 20 June to 14 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsArtLouise BourgeoisExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

They play a divided self, it seems, reflecting on illness, shame, self-loathing, love, betrayal, medication culture and – importantly – the prospect of ending it all at exactly 4.48am.Co-produced by theRoyal Shakespeare Company, the play is again staged in the upstairs theatre at the Royal Court (after which it will travel to Stratford-upon-Avon). It is variously abstruse and lucid in its arguments on life, death and suicide, and still original in form. But this production feels like the reconstruction of a seminal performance rather than a seminal performance for today. Maybe this is because Kane’s position has changed in the intervening decades: she sits firmly in the canon. So this replica-like revival has the strange effect of a museum piece in this “new writing” space, posthumous and reverential.Jeremy Herbert’s set is a white square with functional table, chairs and an overhanging mirror that reflects the audience and the protagonist’s selves which acquire more fractured counterparts in shadow. Light alters in this room, glowing sharp or soporific, like the setting and rising of the sun (beautifully designed lighting by Nigel Edwards). There are bursts of disturbance within, reminiscent of the grey fuzz of an old TV set, which becomes an inspired visual analogy for the dismal brain fog of depression.View image in fullscreenEnraged at life … Jo McInnes in 4.48 Psychosis.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe protagonist variously lies prone, circles the stage or sits in antagonistic conversation with a psychiatrist (another inner voice). There are deep, startlingly lyrical passages (“the cold black pond of myself”) alongside bathos and grim humour; the script is an exemplar of Kane’s perceptive and emotionally unswerving gifts as a writer.But dramatically it is sedate. You wish for something messier, louder, angrier. There are flickers of this – a stunning moment when the protagonist (McInnes) shouts as she lies on the table, enraged at life – yet it then returns to blankness. Maybe this non-mood is the point – a depression that leaves meaningful emotion quashed – but it evokes a kind of vacancy in the air nonetheless.‘She plumbed our secret, shameful depths’: why are Sarah Kane’s plays still so shocking?Read moreThere is still value in its staging and poignancy, too. It is beautifully performed with moments of bared anguish and delicate detail. The opening of the stage windows, a countervailing gesture to the reflection of a closed window on stage, is a haunting, yet exhilarating, final image.At theRoyal Court theatre, London, until 5 July.

I’ve worked in and around the art world for 20 years, and until recently I hadn’t heard of Rosso either.In artists’ ateliers, however, Rosso has long been a familiar and revered name. Auguste Rodin, the father of modern sculpture, was his champion and friend until the pair’s fallout. Émile Zola was a fan. The playwright Edward Albeeowned a version of his sculpture Enfant Juif; French poet Guillaume Apollinaire described him as “without a doubt the greatest living sculptor”.Rosso, a new retrospective at Kunstmuseum Basel, contends, brought sculpture into the modern era with busts and figures that seemed to materialise organically out of his materials – wax, plaster, bronze – like spectres in motion. The Swiss art institution has had no trouble finding 60 contemporary artists who feel a kinship with his sculptures, photographs and drawings, his fleeting impressions of street scenes, cafes and clouds – from Louise Bourgeois’s textile sculptures that look like entrails to Francesca Woodman’s wraithlike photographs.“If you sit 10 gallerists and collectors around a table, nine out of the 10 will not know who Medardo Rosso is,” says Elena Filipovic, the director of Kunstmuseum Basel, which is holding a retrospective on this shadowy figure. “If you sit 10 artists around the table, nine out of the 10 will fall to the floor with excitement.”View image in fullscreenSickly yellow lumps: Rosso’s Ecce Puer, made of wax on plaster.Photograph: Courtesy Galleria Russo, RomeThere are good reasons why Rosso has fallen into relative obscurity. Some, albeit unintentionally, are Rosso’s fault. For instance, his practice was neurotically self-contained. While Rodin followed the template for becoming famous, Rosso followed his own instincts. Rodin knew to create monumental works – “size matters,” says Filipovic – and that professional marketing was key. Rosso created small-scale works, works seen in the studio, home and exhibitions but not out on the boulevards, and he liked to promote them himself.Rodin created monumental works and knew professional marketing was key – Rosso worked small scale and promoted himselfHe worked, repeatedly, on a relatively small number of motifs. One of his most famous works, Ecce Puer (1906), is of a boy’s head shrouded in a sheet; he’s there but not there. Another, Enfant Malade (1893-95), features the inclined head of a sick child, tipping possibly towards death.We often use the term “in the flesh” when standing in front of a sculpture, but with Rosso the phrase has a particular resonance: his faces, just that little bit smaller than in real life, with dimensions that add to a sense of unease, look as if they might blink their waxy eyelids. His sickly yellow lumps are not pretty. They’re not Degas’s dancers.Perhaps the most disturbing of all though is Aetas Aurea (1886), a study of his wife, Giuditta, and their son, Francesco, in which the pair look conjoined at their cheeks. They melt into the background. It’s a horror movie prop rather than a loving family portrait. Other figures are drunk, leaning, screaming. His wax sculptures are the colour of nicotine stains.View image in fullscreenSize matters: Auguste Rodin’s Les Bourgeois de Calais, 1884-1889.Photograph: Martin P Bühler/Kunstmuseum BaselBorn in Turin in 1858, the second son of a railway worker, Rosso opened his first atelier in Milan in 1882 and circulated with members of the artistic group Scapigliatura – translated as “dishevelment” – a Bohemian set of a socialists and anarchists. Living up to the name, Rosso’s studies in the city’s esteemed Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera were cut short when he was expelled for assaulting another student. Three years later, however, he had a wife and son, and was successfully forging a career in Paris, wooing patrons and winning commissions.Rosso was definitely a “very idiosyncratic personality, very persuasive, powerful, winning, someone with a big heart, especially for children, but also suspicious, controlling, obsessively pursuing his cause,” says Heike Eipeldauer, a curator and Rosso expert at the Mumok museum in Vienna, Austria. There were a lot of disagreements: his wife left him and one of his closest friends cut him off after an argument about debts. And then there was Rodin, who he got into a public spat with over who had influenced whom. “They were friends, until they weren’t,” says Filipovic.View image in fullscreenSpirit photography: Ecce Puer, pictured inside Rosso’s studio on Boulevard des Batignolles, Paris.Photograph: Mumok/Markus WörgötterHis intractable nature could work against him. He cast his own works – eating into his time and reducing the number of works created – while Rodin used foundries. And Rodin hired Edward Steichen and other well-known photographers to capture his works and produce portraits of him as the great master in the studio (often with a hammer and chisel, even though he never carved marble himself). Rosso’s sculptures were only ever photographed by the artist himself.“He wanted to control the image,” says Filipovic. “He understood that photography and how you saw the work was also the work.” The exhibition features about 200 of Rosso’s photographs: frail prints of sculptures, some as small as stamps, otherworldly portraits rather than iconic marketing shots. He lit and staged them, with an ethereal aesthetic that echoed the Victorian craze for spirit photography.While Rosso’s photographic studies reanimate objects, his studio-set self-portraits conjure up a phantom, his scruffy features bleached by the sun through his studio’s skylight, his figure blurred in movement: studies as faint and mercurial as his artistic footprint.Having spent his last two decades constantly reworking a few subjects, the artist died in 1928, aged 69. He had dropped glass negatives on his foot, resulting first in the amputation of several toes, then part of his leg and finally a fatal case of blood poisoning. A gradual erosion.Today, Rosso’s complicated nature hampers research, explains his great-granddaughter, Danila Marsure Rosso, who manages the artist’s estate. “He destroyed all the letters he received because he said that nobody should enter in his private life,” she says.View image in fullscreenAn artist’s artist: Rosso’s Portinaia next to modern works by Isa Genzken and Yayoi Kusama at Kunstmuseum Basel.Photograph: Max EhrengruberThere are no biographies of Rosso. There are dozens of Rodin. Rosso’s auction record stands at £341,000 (for a version of Enfant Juif, sold in London in 2015); Rodin’s record was set in 2016, when the master’s marble Eternal Springtime sold in New York for $20m (£14m). Legacies can pay dividends.But Rosso’s quirks had their own creative rewards. He invited groups into his studio to watch him sculpt and cast his works, as if he were a performer. “It was about understanding that there is magic in this making,” says Filipovic. “Rodin couldn’t do that because he used a foundry.”Another idiosyncrasy was Rosso’s fondness for installing sculptures in collectors’ homes in strange, jarring configurations. Context was everything, but not always logical. I can imagine him sitting uncomfortably close to guests at dinner parties just to observe their reaction. Was he a control freak? “Certainly,” says Filipovic. “But don’t you want that in an artist?”Explore more on these topicsArtSculpturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The actor, fresh from a stint as Emcee in the London run of Cabaret, and about to reprise the roleon Broadway, speaks in a poised, purposeful, regal fashion. Each word is selected with care and weighed in his hand as if it were an avocado in the fruit and veg aisle, the gaps between words so lengthy that it isn’t always clear when he has finished speaking. Seated around the table in the south London studio where Porter is overseeing rehearsals for This Bitter Earth, which marks his UK directorial debut, are the playwright Harrison David Rivers and the actors Omari Douglas (It’s a Sin) and Alexander Lincoln (Emmerdale). Everyone maintains an attentive silence while Porter is speaking, until there can be no doubt that he has completed his thought.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“The …beautiful… part of this play,” he says, easing his feet out of a pair of marshmallow-soft cream-and-ebony moon boots and nudging them to one side, “is we get to watch two people who love each other try … time … and time … and time … andtimeagain … and they never give up … onthemselves… or on love. There is hope … We don’t have to be divided. Having conversations that are complicated is what makes the healing happen … without blame … without shame.”This Bitter Earth is a fragmentary, non-linear portrait of the passionate but strained relationship between two queer men in their late 20s and early 30s. The action ricochets back and forth across the years between 2012, when Barack Obama was still in the White House, and 2015, when Donald Trump (who goes entirely unmentioned) announced his own presidential campaign.Neil, played by Lincoln, is a white Black Lives Matter activist described in the dramatis personae as “an enthusiast [who] means well”, while Jesse (Douglas) is a Black playwright upbraided by Neil for his apparent lack of political engagement. Protest, though, can take many forms. As Jesse argues: “I’m living my fucking life! What else do you want from me?”View image in fullscreen‘I wish it felt different now’ … Alexander Lincoln and Omari Douglas in rehearsals for This Bitter Earth.Photograph: Danny KaanOnce the actors have read through a scene in which Neil expresses disappointment because Jesse gave only a passing greeting to his white activist friends, Porter turns to his actors: “Great. So what is this about? What bug is up your ass and what are you trying to incite?” While they debate the characters’ intentions, Rivers looks on. His play premiered in 2017, and he isn’t usually involved in new productions of it. “It’s fun for me to re-meet the play after eight years of living and the world shifting,” he says.Or not shifting. “I wish it felt different now. You write a play and you hope that you’ve solved all the problems. The dream is that people will pull out what you wrote and be, like, ‘Remember when we didn’t respect people and there was violence and we didn’t know how to talk with one another?’ The play is important now because we can step out of this room and into a very similar world. That’s sad. But let’s speak to it anew and try again to make a change.”“We have to keep trying!” booms Porter in his distinctively husky battle-cry.Back to the scene. Lincoln, wearing a grey singlet that shows off his tats, clearly comprehends what his character cannot: “Neil doesn’t see that simply stepping out of your house in the morning can be your protest.”View image in fullscreenHarrison David Rivers.Photograph: Danny KaanIt is an argument with which Porter can readily empathise. “Living is a protest,” he says. “Or walking down the street … wearing … ahat. When David Bowie does it, he’s a genius. When Kiss do it, they’re rock stars. Because they’rewhite.” He peers over the top of his glasses with a disdainful look. “But it’s just a hat. It’s … just … ahat. Now shut the fuck up!” In the space of one monologue, Porter has apparently slipped between the roles of director, memoirist and actor, his final admonition addressed to the fictional Neil rather than to anyone in the room. As a directing style, you might call it cubist.Rivers commends Porter for being “present” and for living “now, now, now”. He explains: “I think Billy’s urgency is being directed into the play.”When I ask whether the two actors recognise the sort of “whitesplaining” comments that Neil makes to Jesse, Douglas rolls his eyes: “Oh God, yes. If I told you about them, we’d be here all day.” I confess that I was wincing too, hearing echoes of myself in Neil’s patronising liberalism. “Why ‘wince’?” Porter demands across the table. “I would encourage you – andI’mnot interviewingyouhere – to take the ‘wince’ out of it. The openness to having the conversation is the point. ‘When you know better, do better,’ is what Maya Angelou always said. Now, when you know better and youdon’tdo better –that’swhen I’m comin’ at you!”This Bitter Earth is atSoho theatre, London, until 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatrePolitical theatreBlack Lives Matter movementActivismRaceBilly PorterOmari DouglasinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Christopher Polk/Penske Media/Getty ImagesAs the 80-year-old gears up for Worthy Farm, we pick the best of his post-Faces career, from moving ballads to silly, sleazy pop, and cover versions that became definitiveByAlexis PetridisThu 19 Jun 2025 08.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 10.29 EDTShare20. Baby Jane (1983)This is essentially a lyrical update of (I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone or Where Do You Go to (My Lovely)? – in summary: peeved ex complains that former girlfriend now moves in lofty circles. But Baby Jane was as good as 80s-pop Rod got: very of-its-era arrangement, great melody, big old chorus, a UK No 1.19. Brighton Beach (2013)“I hear you’ve written songs for your new album,” Elton John remarked to Stewart on stage in London. “What’s it called – Rarities?” And indeed, Time’s standout track was good enough to make you wonder why Stewart didn’t make the effort more often: a sweet, sad acoustic memoir of love lost in the singer’s beatnik youth.18. Gasoline Alley (1970)The title track of Stewart’s second album is his early solo approach in a nutshell. Folky and sensitive yet tough in sound and mood, it somehow manages to rock despite the languid pace and lack of drums. The interplay between Rod’s rasp and Ronnie Wood’s slide guitar is a marvel.17. Downtown Train (1989)A perfect example of Stewart’s skill as an interpreter of others’ songs: he digs deep and finds a melody in the verses not fully evident in Tom Waits’s original – it’s masked by Waits’s trademark vocal approach – and emerges with a song transformed into the stuff of arena singalongs.16. I Don’t Want to Talk About It (1975)The same year Neil Young belatedly released Tonight’s the Night – his racked response to the deaths of roadie Bruce Berry and guitarist Danny Whitten – Stewart covered Whitten’s signature ballad. One is harrowing, chaotic and dissipated, the other smooth, orchestrated pop-rock, but they’re equally moving: Stewart’s vocal is understated, capturing the song’s lovelorn misery.15. Every Picture Tells a Story (1971)View image in fullscreenStewart and Ronnie Wood performing in 1974.Photograph: Mick Gold/RedfernsCo-written by Stewart and Wood, the glorious title track of Stewart’s solo breakthrough – a transatlantic No 1 – has a lot of the Faces’ ramshackle charm. The lyrics detail romantic mishaps around the world, the 12-string guitar is out of tune, and the backing vocals come from former mentor Long John Baldry.14. I Was Only Joking (1977)Noticeably more thoughtful than the rest of his Foot Loose and Fancy Free album, the remorseful I Was Only Joking unexpectedly suggests a certain darkness – and weariness – behind Stewart’s playboy image: “Illusions of that grand first prize are slowly wearing thin.” Also home to a great bit of fourth-wall breaking: “Verse seven is never clear.”13. (I Know) I’m Losing You (1971)Throughout his career, Stewart has recorded dozens of Motown covers, but this might be his best: essentially a Faces track in all but name (it features all four members), it transforms the Temptations’ original version into loose-limbed rock, complete with unexpectedly thrilling drum solo, without sacrificing its intensity.12. Forever Young (1988)Stewart spent much of the 80s obviously coasting, but could still, unexpectedly, deliver something with emotional punch. The production on Forever Young suggests someone had heard U2’s Where the Streets Have No Name and decided it needed a layer of gloss – but the song’s reflections on parenthood are really moving.11. You’re in My Heart (The Final Acclaim) (1977)For all its lyrical references to Aubrey Beardsley and faintly Gallic-sounding violin (actually the work of bluegrass innovator Richard Greene), something of the pub at last orders rather charmingly clings to You’re in My Heart: its bottom-of-the-fourth-pint blend of confession and teary sentimentality, its arms-around-your-mates chorus. A million copies were sold in the US alone: cheers!10. Handbags and Gladrags (1969)Mike d’Abo’s Handbags and Gladrags had already been recorded by Chris Farlowe and the Love Affair’s Steve Ellis. Both were fantastic vocalists, but it’s Rod’s version that nails the song. He is less anguished than Farlowe but wearier-sounding than Ellis: the perfect voice to fit the hard-won wisdom of the lyric.9. Sailing (1975)Another example of Stewart’s transformative interpretative powers. The Sutherland Brothers’ original is an ominous harmonium-and-bass-drum drone – the key line is definitely “Will I see you, who can say?” – but Stewart recasts the song completely, making it wistful, but soaring and celebratory. Anthem status swiftly followed.View image in fullscreenThe disco years.Photograph: ITV/Rex Features8. Da Ya Think I’m Sexy? (1978)To borrow an old Smash Hits phrase, there were points where Stewart’s late 70s brand of raunch turned a little Uncle Disgusting – Hot Legs; the frankly creepy Tonight’s the Night (Gonna Be Alright) – but his “disco spoof” is so preposterous, so evidently performed with tongue in cheek, that it’s weirdly irresistible.7. The First Cut Is the Deepest (1977)It had already been recorded umpteen times – by author Cat Stevens, PP Arnold, and the Love Affair (them again!) among others. You can argue for hours about the definitive reading, but Stewart’s careworn take is in with a shot at the title: the cathartic orchestrated finale is particularly fine.6. The Killing of Georgie Pt I & II (1976)An affecting account of a homophobic murder delivered with a cocktail of empathy, sadness and a desire to celebrate the victim’s life. Part II contains the most glaring of the perennially light-fingered Stewart’s musical steals, so indebted to the Beatles’ Don’t Let Me Down that John Lennon publicly raised an eyebrow.5. Mandolin Wind (1971)For a moment, it looked as if Stewart might not just be one of the 1970s’ major singers, but a major singer-songwriter. It didn’t turn out like that, but when he was producing songs as great as Mandolin Wind – poignant, moving, ultimately joyous – you could understand why.View image in fullscreenShowing his support during the 1982 World Cup.Photograph: Rex Features4. Young Turks (1981)One of the 70s old guard’s finest responses to new wave: a Springsteen-esque “love on the run” narrative set to a wired, urgent drum machine and synth pulse, complete with phenomenal chorus and – awww! – a happy ending. Why he didn’t make more music like this is a mystery.3. Reason to Believe (1971)In which Stewart transforms Tim Hardin’s beautiful, but brief and sparsely arranged original into an understated epic, the piano and organ seemingly taking the title as a cue to dive into gospelly waters. It’s big on shiver-inducing moments where the band drop out and his rasping voice sings unaccompanied.2. You Wear It Well (1972)A follow-up that matches the big hit for quality: honestly, there’s not a cigarette paper between this and the song at No 1 here. You Wear It Well wraps a saga of lost love in a melody and a loose performance that oozes an infectious, slightly boozy joy. An unmitigated delight.1. Maggie May (1971)Apparently based on a true story (Stewart has said it’s about the woman he lost his virginity to in 1961), Maggie May was initially released only as a B-side; perhaps his label balked at the idea of releasing a single without an identifiable chorus. But it doesn’t need one, because it has a melody that alternately breezes and sighs – the perfect complement to the emotional twists and turns of a lyric that can’t work out whether to be rueful, affectionately reflective or optimistic – and immediately lodges in your brain. Proof that sometimes, an artist’s best-known is also their best full stop.Explore more on these topicsRankedRod StewartPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And as she gears up for a performance at this year’s Glastonbury festival, PP Arnold will be answering your questions.Born into a family of gospel singers in Los Angeles, Arnold could have easily never ended up in music: by the age of 17 she was a mother-of-two in an abusive marriage. But she auditioned for Ike and Tina Turner and was hired as an Ikette, fleeing her husband to perform backing vocals on tour and in the studio, with Tina becoming a mentor.After the Turner band toured with the Rolling Stones in the UK in 1966, Arnold left and stuck around in England. The admiring Mick Jagger helped secure her a record contract, and she was quickly in the thick of swinging London as British pop and rock swept to cultural dominance. Arnold sang backing vocals on the Small Faces’ Itchycoo Park and the band in turn backed her own studio recordings; she duetted with Rod Stewart on Come Home Baby; her backing band for a time were the Nice, featuring Keith Emerson; and the Bee Gees’ Barry Gibb produced some of her work.Her debut album contained a cover of Cat Stevens’ The First Cut Is the Deepest which many consider to be the definitive version, while the follow-up Kafunta – orchestrated by Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones – contained another iconic cover, of Angel of the Morning, both British chart hits.The unlikely return of PP Arnold: 'I put myself in God's hands'Read moreThose would be her biggest solo successes, but Arnold remained rooted in the entertainment business, segueing to musical theatre and collaborating with Eric Clapton, Nick Drake and singing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel’s megahit Sledgehammer. She was sought after in the 80s and 90s dance scene, doing vocals for the Beatmasters and Altern-8 and singing the hook of the KLF’s 3am Eternal. She also partnered with Ocean Colour Scene and Primal Scream.Now 78, she has continued to release her own music – 2019 brought The New Adventures of... PP Arnold – and she will perform songs from her remarkable discography at Glastonbury’s Acoustic stage on Sunday 29 June at 4pm. Before she does, she’ll answer your questions – post them in the comments before 10am BST on Tuesday 24 June.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockFilm & Music reader interviewcalloutShareReuse this content"

The last time this happened was in November, according to Flussbad.City officials have also cited the potential hazard of wartime munitions lodged in the riverbed, something Edler dismissed. “You can get that in a lake too.”View image in fullscreenThe ‘Dip-Dip-Hurrah’ demonstration.Photograph: Christian Jungeblodt/The GuardianThe 150-metre-long stretch of water chosen for the demonstration was where the last central “swim station” was in operation 100 years ago, just off the Unter den Linden boulevard opposite today’s Humboldt Forum museum built in the old Hohenzollern palace’s image.“This part of town is basically for tourists, not for Berliners, and this feels like we’re reclaiming it,” said real estate consultant Robin Härdter, 32, as he wrapped himself in a towel.Architect Lina Lahiri, 44, emerged glistening, shivering and exhilarated from a long swim in the Spree, whose temperature on Tuesday evening measured 21.3C. “I thought it would be dirtier! I tried to keep my mouth closed but then I wanted to talk to everyone around me,” she said with a laugh.View image in fullscreenLina Lahiri: ‘I thought it would be dirtier.’Photograph: Christian Jungeblodt/The Guardian“It would be wonderful if this protest got the ball rolling but even though there’s a European-wide movement [for urban swimming],Germanyis super bureaucratic – it could take ages. Fingers crossed.”Although the Berlin area is dotted with dozens of accessible lakes, the civil servant Jan Köttke said there was nothing quite like splashing around downtown.“The view of the city is completely different from down there,” said Köttke, 53, pointing at the rippling green-blue water. “You’re here in the historic centre with all the monuments but it’s not that heavy, serious perspective – it’s more playful.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s more playful,’ one swimmer said.Photograph: Christian Jungeblodt/The GuardianAlthough officials from the Mitte district have expressed support for a trial period of Spree swimming in 2026, a spokesperson for the city’s environment department, Frank Preiss, said studies to determine if “the Spree is suited hygienically for swimming are still unclear and completely open”. Results, he said, were expected later this year.On Tuesday, resplendent in a pink bathrobe and yellow bucket hat, 77-year-old Ulrich Fitzke said he was ready to take the plunge. “Because I love to swim in the open water, because it costs €6-8 admission everywhere else, because it’s marvellous weather,” he said.Fitzke, a retired electrician trainer who lives in the ex-communist planned district of Marzahn on the city’s eastern fringe, said he had no concerns about potential contaminants in the water.“I’m a farmer’s son and grew up swimming in ponds with thousands of catfish and sometimes leeches that sometimes would get you right here,” he said pointing to his arm. “I’m not worried.”Deborah ColeParis, FranceView image in fullscreenAn artist’s view of the Bras Marie bathing site in Paris.Illustration: Paris City HallAfter a 100-year ban on swimming in Paris’s Seine River, mostly due to the risk from unclean water and bacteria from human waste, the city’s bathers will at last be able to take a dip in the river this summer.Efforts to clean up Paris’s murky river water for swimmers were accelerated and given a funding boost for last year’s Olympics, when triathlon and open-water athletes competed in the Seine.More than €1bn (£850m) has been invested in wastewater management, treatment plants, filtering stations and storm basins to lower the river’s bacterial contamination from faecal waste.View image in fullscreenAn artist’s view of Grenelle bathing site.Illustration: Paris City HallTempting Parisians back into the Seine was one of the Games’ key aims, in part as a means of cooling off amid growing summer heatwaves.But because of strong currents and Paris’s heavy river traffic of freight and tourist tour boats, city swimmers won’t have a vast open expanse of the Seine, but rather designated, timetabled spots with lifeguards and changing facilities.The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said the experience would nonetheless be “much wilder than swimming in a pool” and the infrastructure would be as subtle as possible.Three city bathing spots will open in Paris from 5 July until 31 August.Near the finance ministry at Bercy in the east of the city, swimmers will be shielded from boat traffic by a concrete barrier.At Grenelle in the west of the city, with a view of the Eiffel Tower, there will be a structured pontoon and a marked-off swimming area 60 metres long by 20 metres wide.In the historic centre of the city near Pont de Sully, looking on to the Île Saint-Louis, swimmers will have slightly more space, marked off by a line of yellow buoys. However, because of the busy tourist boat tours coming past Notre Dame cathedral in the afternoons, the swimming area will only be open from 8am to 11.30am, and all day on Sundays.The challenge of stopping swimmers simply jumping into the Seine at random spots outside the designated zones remains. Signs, guards and boat patrols have been planned to prevent this.Angelique ChrisafisOslo, NorwayView image in fullscreenSwimming in Sørenga, a new neighbourhood near the Oslo fjord.Photograph: Agenzia Sintesi/AlamyWhen the sun is shining in Norway’s capital (and even when it’s not), swimmers plunge into the salty fjord from packed floating saunas and the city beaches are full of paddling toddlers. It is difficult to believe that the waters around Oslo were not always like this.Until an enormous cleanup process that began in 2006, decades of industry mistreatment, runoff from the city and waste dumping had left the inner Oslofjord heavily polluted.But after multiple remediations of the seabed, the removal of contaminated material from the harbour basin and the introduction of a huge water and wastewater project, completed in 2015, today it is an urban swimming paradise.View image in fullscreenOne of Oslo’s floating saunas in the harbour.Photograph: Alexander Farnsworth/Getty ImagesThe radical turnaround is perhaps best exemplified by Oslo Sauna Association’s 26 floating saunas across seven sites in the city.Formed in 2016 by diplomats from the ministry of foreign affairs’ ice swimming club, it now has a membership of 18,000 and is pretty much fully booked from 7am until 11pm from October to April. Last year 260,000 people visited their saunas, which are accessible for both locals and tourists who swim-sauna-swim-sauna on repeat for as long as they can.The turnaround has transformed the city, said Ragna Marie Fjeld, the association’s secretary general.In the beginning, she said, entrepreneurs and politicians were sceptical, fearing properties near the saunas might lose value as a result.“But now they all beg us to come to their new building projects because this is something they want,” she said. “You could say the tables have turned.”Currently the water temperature is about 14C but in the winter it dips to zero and in the summer it gets up to 20C. “A lot of people I talk to say the saunas have made Oslo much cooler and made it the city they want to live in. Part of what makes Oslo great.”Miranda BryantCopenhagen, DenmarkView image in fullscreenPeople sunbathing at Kvæsthusgraven, Nyhavn district, Copenhagen.Photograph: Ian Dagnall/AlamyOn summer evenings, Copenhagen’s harbours are lined with people hanging out by the water and swimming in designated areas. Winter swimming is also increasingly popular, even though the water temperature can plunge as low as zero.Mikkel Bendixsen, who has been swimming in the Danish capital for a decade and started his own free-of-charge swimming club, KBH Vinterbad, said the networking potential of these bracing dips was not to be underestimated.“It’s nice to do and you motivate each other. Everyone brings something – coffee or whatnot,” he said. “If it’s not crazy wind or rain then we will hang out and talk.

Amsterdam has a bay, the IJ, and nine official wild swimming sites where you can escape the summer heat.There aremultiple city beaches, like the Sloterplas beach in Nieuw-West or the Ouderkerkerplas, further afield by the village Ouderkerk aan de Amstel.

While houseboats are now plumbed into the sewage system, it’s generally still not recommended to go swimming in any old canal. There are warnings on the side of certain waterways – for example, old industrial areas near the harbour where the bottom of the water contains heavy metal.If you are simply desperate to experience swimming through the canals yourself, it’s probably best to wait for the SeptemberAmsterdam City Swim, when thousands swim from the Keizersgracht to the Marineterrein harbourside – withfamous alumni even includingQueen Máxima.This weekend, the Swimmable Cities alliance will hold what it called the world’s first summit dedicated to the topic of urban swimming. The Rotterdam event will bring together 150 participants from four continents to drive what organisers heralded as “bold action in climate adaptation, community wellbeing and urban waterfront regeneration”.Senay BoztasExplore more on these topicsEuropeSwimmingGermanyParisFranceParis Olympic Games 2024NorwayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Every now and then, I join him and we then walk for a bit (there is nothing like a caffeine-baba spring in your step), and congratulate each other for not smoking while both wishing that we had a cigarette.In Poland, the word “baba” can refer to a variety of baked goods, and one in particular is made with rye flour and sweet wine. Baba al rum came about thanks to the greediness of twice king of Poland Stanislaus Leszczyński, who, exiled in Lorraine, thought hiskougelhopftoo dry, so asked for it to be soaked in rum. This inspired his pastry chef to perfect the dish and, in turn, subsequently inspired other pastry chefs, like baba dominoes. It is a project, though, and remember to chill the eggs.Arrange the babas in a serving dish, then, just before eating, spoon over a little of the reserved syrup, so they shine.In the Gastronomy of Italy, Anna del Conte describes babas soaked in rum as also being covered with enough thin icing to hold a few flaked almonds, and topped with a hot sauce made from sweet local wine – a description that makes a Sicilian cassata seem reasonably sweet (not that I don’t love the idea). Also, consider serving baba al rum with fridge-cold double or whipped cream and an espresso, and thengo.Mini babas al rum (small sponge cakes soaked in rum)Makes12Oil,to grease300g plain flour12g fresh yeast,crumbled6 very cold eggs5g salt20g caster sugar100g butter, cut into 6 piecesFor the syrup350g caster sugarA few strips of lemon or orange zest100-150ml rumLightly oil 12 baba moulds or ramekins. Working in a food processor with a dough hook, put the flour and crumbled yeast in the bowl, then start the hook at medium-low. Add the eggs one at a time, making sure each is incorporated before adding the next - this will take about eight minutes. Now add the salt and sugar, followed by the butter piece by piece, making sure each bit is incorporated before adding any more. Cover the bowl and leave to sit in a warm spot to rise and double in volume – this should take between two and three hours, depending on the temperature.Rub your hands with water, then ease the dough away from the sides of the bowl (it will deflate). Still working with wet hands, pull off roughly 40g pieces of dough (it’s an idea to weigh the first one, to get an idea of the right size), then squeeze each lump tightly in your fist so it oozes into the lightly oiled moulds. Cover and leave to sit for an hour, or until the dough rises just above the top of the mould.Arrange the moulds on a baking tray and bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 16-20 minutes, then remove and leave to cool completely, or overnight, before un-moulding.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app. Scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.Make the syrup by warming 500ml water with the sugar and a few strips of lemon or orange zest over a medium flame, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Pull off the heat, add the rum, then leave to cool until tepid. Add the babas and let them bob around like apples for a couple of minutes (help them along by turning occasionally). Then, with clean hands, lift out the babas one by one, squeeze gently (this helps enormously with absorption), then return to the syrup for another minute-long soak.Lift out the babas out again and put them on a baking rack to drain. Pour the remaining syrup into a jug. Arrange the babas in a serving dish, then, just before eating, spoon over a little more of the syrup, so they shine.Explore more on these topicsDessertA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkBakingSpiritsEggsCakerecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Garmin’s new top running watch, the Forerunner 970, has very big shoes to fill as it attempts to replace one of the best training and race companions available. Can a built-in torch, a software revamp and voice control really make a difference?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The new top-of-the-line Forerunner takes the body of the outgoing Forerunner 965 and squeezes in a much brighter display, useful new running analytics and more of the advanced tech fromGarmin’s flagship adventure watch the Fenix 8.These upgrades come at a steep cost of £630 (€750/$750/A$1,399) – £30 more than its predecessor – placing it right at the top of the running and triathlon watch pile, although less than the £780 Fenix 8.View image in fullscreenThe Forerunner 970 is a large but not enormous watch with a relatively low profile that slips under shirt cuffs and stays put during exercise.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 970 is about the same size as the outgoing 965 with a 47mm case and a beautiful, crisp and very bright 1.4in OLED screen. The touchscreen is covered in super-hard sapphire glass similar to luxury watches, while the titanium bezel finishes off the polycarbonate body in a choice of three colours.Quite a lot of the upgrades are trickle-downs from the Fenix 8 and make the 970 a better everyday smartwatch. It has Garmin’s new offline voice control system, which allows you to quickly set timers and alarms, access settings or start activities. The watch also connects to your phone’s voice assistant and takes calls on your wrist via Bluetooth.A revamped interface speeds up access to notifications from your smartphone by swiping down from the top of the screen. With an iPhone you can view and dismiss text-only notifications but connected to an Android phone you can also see images in notifications and directly reply to them from the watch. The 970 has Garmin Pay for contactless payments, althoughbank support is limited, and can control music on your phone or download playlists from Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube Music and others for phone-free music on runs.View image in fullscreenOnce you have a torch built into your watch you’ll never want to be without it. I use it at least five times a day.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe best new feature is the LED torch built into the 970’s top edge. It was invaluable on the Fenix 8 and is my favourite new addition to the Forerunner. It is bright enough to light your way on the street at night or find things buried in dark cupboards but can be turned a dim red to avoid waking everyone at home. It can also be used as a strobe light for running to help keep you visible at night.The battery lasts about six days with general smartwatch usage, including having the screen on all the time, all-day and night monitoring of health, plenty of notifications and copious use of the torch. The screen has automatic brightness but turning it down one notch in settings, which was still plenty bright enough to see outdoors, added a couple of days to the battery life. Turning the always-on display setting off extended it further to about 12 to 15 days.SpecificationsScreen:1.4in AMOLED (454x454)Case size:47mmCase thickness:13.2mmBand size:standard 22mmWeight:56gStorage:32GBWater resistance:50 metres (5ATM)Sensors:GNSS (Multiband GPS, Glonass, Galileo), compass, thermometer, heart rate, pulse OxConnectivity:Bluetooth, ANT+, wifiRunning and activity trackingView image in fullscreenThe watch charges via a USB-C cable that slots in next to the sensor cluster on the back, reaching 70% in about 40 minutes and full in 83 minutes.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianIts predecessor was a fantastic running watch filled to the brim with metrics, helpful analysis and buckets of customisation options, on which the 970 only builds. The screen is large enough to be able to clearly see up to eight data fields on screen at once. Maps look particularly good and are easy to use with touch.It has the latest dual-band GPS, while Garmin’s algorithms consistently have higher tracking accuracy than its rivals, even with similar systems. The new Gen 5 Elevate heart rate sensor on the back improves pulse monitoring in tricky conditions, and provides ECG (arrhythmia) readings.The 970 has Garmin’s suite of industry-leading fitness, recovery and training metrics, which are joined by a few new and interesting statistics, including two that attempt to help you prevent injury.Impact load quantifies how hard a run is on your body based on its intensity and difficulty compared with an easy, flat run at slower speeds. One fast, hard 7km run was rated as equivalent to a gentler 12km run, which felt about right in my feet and legs and made me consider taking a longer recovery time before the next workout.View image in fullscreenImpact load helps you avoid overdoing your training by estimating the impact of your runs on your body.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianIn addition, the new running tolerance feature tracks your mileage over a seven-day period and advises how much more you can run without increasing your chance of injury. Many runners, including myself, have injured themselves when ramping up their weekly distance too fast when training for a race, which this new stat is an attempt to avoid by giving you suggested guard rails.The 970 also has a new running economy feature that tracks efficiency of your form, including how much speed you lose as your foot hits the ground, but it relies on Garmin’s latest heart rate monitor strap, theHRM 600– a £150 separate purchase.Running battery life is a solid 11-plus hours with its highest accuracy settings and listening to offline music via Bluetooth headphones, or about 16 hours without music. Turning down the screen brightness a bit added several hours to the running battery life, while reducing the GPS accuracy mode can last up to 26 hours.Solid general health monitoringView image in fullscreenThe Forerunner looks and feels premium with flashes of colour on the body and strap but is obviously a sports watch, so may not be suitable for all occasions.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Garmin isn’t entirely about running, triathlon and its 30-plus sport tracking features. It also has a comprehensive suite of general health monitoring tools, including good sleep, activity, stress, women’s health and heart health tracking rivalling an Apple Watch or similar.Most of Garmin’s most advanced training tools also monitor your recovery from exercise during the rest of the day and night, advising you in the morning and during the day how your body is doing. It has a built-in sleep coach, a running or triathlon coach and various advisers for activity, suggesting when to do a hard workout and when to take it easy. The daily suggested workouts are dynamic and based on your sleep and recovery, so it will never prompt you to do a hardcore workout when you’ve had a terrible night. These automatic workouts can be replaced by a coaching plan, either using Garmin’s solid tools or third-party ones placed on a calendar before a race.SustainabilityThe watch is generally repairable with optionsavailable via support. The battery is rated to maintain at least 90% of its original capacity after two years of weekly charging. The watch does not contain any recycled materials. Garmin guarantees security updates until at least 21 May 2027 but typically supports its devices far longer. It offersrecycling schemeson new purchases.PriceThe Garmin Forerunner 970 costs£629.99(€749.99/$749.99/A$1,399).For comparison, theGarmin Fenix 8costs from£780, the Forerunner 570 costs£460, theGarmin Forerunner 965costs£499.99, theApple Watch Ultra 2costs£799, the Coros Pace Pro costs£349, the Suunto Race S costs£299and the Polar Vantage V3 costs£519.VerdictGarmin continues to set the bar for running watches with the Forerunner 970. It isn’t a dramatic leap over the outgoing Forerunner 965, instead adding a few bits to the already excellent formula.The screen is brighter, covered in scratch-resistant sapphire and ringed by a titanium bezel, which gives it a premium look and feel alongside a more modern and responsive interface. The added bells and whistles of voice control and faster access to notifications make using it as a smartwatch alternative much easier. Though wearing it is still a statement about your sporty priorities compared with an Apple or Pixel Watch.The upgraded heart rate sensor helps keep things locked during more difficult exercises and adds ECG readings for more comprehensive heart health tracking. But it is the built-in torch that is the best addition for daily life. Every watch should have one.Meanwhile, the new impact load and running tolerance features could be very useful for avoiding strain and injury, adding to the already excellent training and recovery tracking. Plus it has market-leading running accuracy and detailed onboard maps for routes or if you get lost.If you want a premium running and triathlon watch with all the bells and whistles, the Forerunner 970 is the best you can get. It just comes at a very high cost.Pros:super bright OLED screen, built-in torch, phone and offline voice control, Garmin Pay, extensive tracking and recovery analysis for running and many other sports, full offline mapping, offline Spotify, buttons and touch, most accurate GPS, ECG.Cons:expensive, limited Garmin Pay bank support, still limited smartwatch features compared with Apple/Google/Samsung watches, battery life shorter than LCD rivals.View image in fullscreenThere are plenty of customisable watch faces to choose from either built-in or from the Garmin IQ store.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsGarminSmartwatchesGadgetsWearable technologyreviewsShareReuse this content"

I have been on Ozempic for almost two years. I have lost almost 50 kilos and can now do a whole lot of things that I wasn’t physically able to do before, which is great. But people treat me differently now. I had my work review and I am doing less but got feedback about how much more I am doing. I have been asked if I am looking to date, and even if I am thinking of having a child, both questions I neverwas asked when I was bigger. I didn’t think people treated me badly before, and still don’t, but now I am seeing that there is a difference. It is not comfortable for me. I am not at risk of putting the weight back on but how do I navigate the difference in how people are treating me?Eleanor says:A lot of people notice this after losing lots of weight. You get spoken to in a different key. People turn on a switch you didn’t know they had. For some people this feels great. For others it’s unnerving: to feel so newly visible and yet somehow so unseen.The trouble is, you know you’ve been the sameyouall along. So when people hand over their attraction or attention or approval now that you’ve lost weight, they simultaneously undermine its value. Oh great, I have more of your esteem – just because of how I look?I’m considering dating again. Should I stop having sex with my ex? | Leading questionsRead moreIt’s easy to resent being treated better because of what you weigh. We don’t want to feel like the deep things in life – being wanted, being respected – are tied to something so superficial. We want to be loved and respected for the deeper “us”. One of the most moving pieces of radio I ever heard was Elna Baker, a producer at This American Lifewho also lost 50kg,asking her fiancewhether he’d have dated her when she was fat. He says he’s always thought the real Elna is the “skinny” Elna. “That’s stupid,” she said. There is no “fat Elna”. “It was me,” she said. “It just was me.”In navigating this, one place to start might be to notice who has treated you the same all along. You’ll know who they are. If the bitter part of this experience is learning how much people react to how you look, the sweeter part is learning who reacts to you for you – who’s seen the deeper you all along.Another way to approach this might be to slightly shift what you expect, or hope for, from strangers or colleagues. You mentioned the way work thinks you’re more industrious now. Other silly aesthetic signals can produce similar results. If you were a man, a hair transplant might get you seen as more confident, a crisper suit as more effective. At work or with strangers we’re interpreted through layers of appearance; people read clues about our merits from our clothes, accent, posture, hair. Maybe “weight” is part of the costuming we all wear in those spaces and through which we are interpreted. It can be frustrating or bemusing to learn how much these things affect people’s judgments. But maybe workplaces and strangers are not where any of us get clear-eyed reactions to our merits unmuddied by appearances. Leaning into the parts of your life that aren’t filtered through appearance might make it easier to tolerate the parts that are.My husband covered up the fact that he retired. How can I reboot open communication?Read moreLastly, it might be fun to enjoy your new X-ray vision. Your experience lets you see through the myth that a person’s weight is a good guide to their character. Are there other myths you can see through now, too? I think we all do this a bit. We assume old means slow, dishevelled means chaotic, beautiful means virtuous. But lots of people have their version of “no fat Elna”. What would we see in other people if we looked the way we want to be looked at? It could be fun to experiment.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsLife and styleLeading questionsAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But you don’t need to have deep pockets to enjoy its great food sceneLiz BoulterThu 19 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 02.31 EDTShareMany renowned dining destinations have hosted the annual “food Oscars” – theWorld’s 50 Best Restaurantslist. This year is the first time the honour goes to Italy, with Turin, capital of Piedmont, holding the ceremony on 19 June. Although Emilia-Romagna is usually regarded as the country’s food capital, Piedmont has a proud gastronomic tradition, with white truffles, rice, chocolate, pastas and cheeses, not to mention wines such as barolo and barbaresco.Greener than most Italian cities, Turin, the former capital of Savoy and briefly capital of Italy, also has elegant piazzas, royal palaces, possibly Europe’s biggest outdoor market and the wide Po River for strolling, cycling and kayaking. It is where vermouth (see below),grissinibreadsticks and espresso coffee were invented.Given that few visitors can afford the high-end dining the 50 Best contenders offer, I asked Savio Losito, co-founder of appUnexpected Italy, to show me places across Turin where a visitor can plug into its food scene without spending €100 a head.Latteria BeraChiara Franzoso’s grandmother and great aunts opened this dairy in Turin’s historic centre in 1958 to offer city dwellers fresh milk from the surrounding hills. That function is less vital these days, but Chiara keeps up her relationship with small producers, stocking a huge range of fresh and aged cow, goat and sheep cheeses as well as charcuterie specialities I had never seen, such as cooked salami. UK visitors may be surprised to see locals popping in for her most popular dairy product – fresh cream whipped with sugar and vanilla in an antique mixer and served in little pots – like ice-cream – with nuts, chocolate or a dollop of warm zabaglione.Takeaway trays and tastings from €8.50.ScannabueView image in fullscreenTurin classics such ascarne cruda(beef tartare),vitello tonnato(veal in creamy tuna mayonnaise), stuffed pasta and braised cheek with mash are found on hundreds of menus. This city institution does them all beautifully, but adds innovative dishes such as goat’s cheese with almonds and house-dried tomatoes, and marinated artichokes. Boss Paolo Fantini advises us to eat theplin(rectangular pinched ravioli) with a spoon to enjoy the rich butter sauce; risotto with parmesan, lemon and bone marrow is equally oozy. I’m also struck by the friendly atmosphere: Paolo checking a waitress isn’t stressed, and joshing with a young sommelier.Two-course lunch with wine or dessert from €15.Le Vitel ÉtonnéView image in fullscreenOwner Luisa PandolfiThe name is a French/Piedmontese pun by founder Luisa Pandolfi, makingvitello tonnato(vitel tonnéin dialect) sound like “astonished veal”. That may pass anglophone diners by, but the meat is exemplary – cooked for nine hours at just 52C. Head chef Massimiliano Brunetto’s other antipasti include tripe salad (nicer than it sounds), anchovies with green and red sauce, and wonderful stuffed courgette flowers in rice batter. We continue with local pastas:tajarín(handcut ribbons) carbonara style with asparagus andguanciale; andagnolotti(like ravioli too) stuffed with veal, beef and pork and served with roasting juices.Two courses fromabout €30. On 1 July they are opening a takeaway pasta shop up the road.Antiche SereView image in fullscreen‘Like being in a book or a film’The name of this restaurant in a residential district west of the centre means “ancient evenings” and a summer dinner under the vine-covered pergola does feel like being in a book or film, particularly when chef Daniele Rota emerges to greet and joke with customers. Traditional in the best way, it is run by his sister Antonella plus several family members, and the hand-written menu includes all the favourites plus ribstickers such as pork shank with potatoes, and rabbit stew in white wine. I particularly like the “electric”tominicheeses, with chilli-spiked green herb sauce.Two courses from €22.Fratelli BruzzoneView image in fullscreenBrother-and-sister team Martina and Gabriele BruzzoneBrother-and-sister team Martina and Gabriele Bruzzone took a love of food learned from their grandparents and opened a deli that evolved into this 30-seat restaurant (40 including the street outside). As well as Turin classics, they offer several welcome plant-based dishes. I start with porcini mushrooms in afujot(the ceramic dish with candle used to keepbagna caudawarm) plus a plate ofgiardinierapickled vegetables and a salad with fermented fennel.Plinwith goat ricotta and asparagus keep up the meat-free theme. New to mark the 50 Best launch are house-made apricot or cherry ice lollies – refreshing and singing of summer fruit.Two courses from €20. Booking essential.Ristorante ConsorzioView image in fullscreenCrispy egg on braised chard at Ristorante ConsorzioThis dark, intimate restaurant is widely admired for Sicilian chef Valentina Chiaramonte’s modern twists – “I take the history and make it into a novel,” she says – and its strict insistence on organic and natural wines. A snail symbol on the menu denotes Slow Food-registered dishes. Pleased to see some meat-light options, I enjoy a crispy egg on braised chard, then grilled asparagus with pea cream and pine nuts. Savio takes one for the team by ordering its famed offal selection – pig’s foot, brain salad, confit lung and grilledmatrice(cow’s vagina). I take his word that it’s good.Two courses from €32.Caffè dell’OrologioView image in fullscreenElisabetta Desana at Caffè dell’OrologioOn evenings in the riverside San Salvario district, thispiola(dialect forosteria) serves a mostly coldmerenda sinoira, thetraditional Piedmont country supper that co-founder Lorenzo Coscia remembers his grandparents eating.It’s a relief to find not all Italian meals are elaborate multi-course affairs. From a regularly changing “small plates” menu we choose tasty potato croquettes, marinated onions, thinly sliced tongue with tomato and pepper sauce, rabbit liver paté and fresh tomini cheeses with herby sauce. The wine list is 100% Piedmontese. Open all afternoon, this is a handy spot for visitors with children who get hungry before restaurants are open.Dishes from €4.Gelateria AriaView image in fullscreenRoberto Speranza with his air beaten gelatoThere are ice-cream parlours all over this city. Many swear by award winner Mara dei Boschi, but with branches also in Milan and Barolo, it is no longer a small producer. Aria, in the studenty Vanchiglia district, was opened in 2022 by Roberto Speranza, who worked all over Italy and in Paris before returning to Piedmont and naming his gelateria after its main ingredient – the air beaten into gelato. His ice-creams “tell the story of the region”, using small local producers of saffron, mountain honey, hazelnuts and olive oil. Flavours include liquorice-and-violet “Il Senateur”, as favoured by statesman Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, and a popular popcorn and caramel.TocView image in fullscreenMaria and Paolo- from TocTurin and chocolate have gone together since a Savoy duke married a Spanish princess and gained access to new world imports. Turin cooks may have been the first to mix cacao with sugar to make bars. Today, the city is full of big-name chocolate shops, most of them now on an industrial scale. For something truly artisanal, we head to the gentrifying Borgo Nuovo district, where former publishing exec Paolo Lovisolo and his staff of six offer top-quality chocolates handmade daily. His wares, with salted caramel, pistachio, orange peel and even – deliciously – rosemary, should all be eaten within three weeks.Eccetera BarView image in fullscreenNicola Piazza offers a vermouth experience in the birthplace of the fortified winePerhaps not surprisingly given its rich food, Turin led the world in creating aperitifs. A fine place to learn their history is this bar a few streets from the river. Genial owner Nicola Piazza uses his 20 years of drinks industry experience to take us through the origins of vermouth: how adding bitter herbs to wine stimulates saliva production and “opens” the stomach. We taste three vermouths neat, including a special-edition Martini “di Torino”, then make three cocktails, including one named after a gin-loving 19th-century count called … Negroni. For me, Cocchi vermouth with sparkling water is better than any Aperol spritz.Vermouth Voyage €45ppWhere to stayView image in fullscreenLook TO is in an 1830s palazzoLandscape designer Giuliana Marsiaj opened B&BLook TO(doubles from €180) in 2019, in an 1830s palazzo overlooking vast Piazza Vittorio Veneto and walking distance from Porta Nuova station and the river.

And it is now easier than ever to get to know your chaffinch from your chiffchaffElle HuntThu 19 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 06.16 EDTShareI’m assured this is a big deal: on the far side of a field in Thetford, separated from me by a gate, there is a stone-curlew.Jon Carter, from the British Trust for Ornithology, patiently directs my binoculars up, down and past patches of grass until my gaze lands on an austere-looking, long-legged brown bird. “Quite a rare bird,” Carter says, pleased. “Very much a bird of the Breckland.”As a very beginner birder, I’ll have to take his word for that.My interest was sparked early this summer when a friend introduced me toMerlin Bird ID. Developed at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York, the app records birdsong and uses artificial intelligence to identify particular species – like Shazam for birds. Merlin has added a new dimension to my walks, sharpening my awareness of wildlife I’d ordinarily have tuned out. I can now identify one bird by song alone (the chiffchaff – it helpfully says its name).Having surged through the pandemic, birding may be taking off once more. Merlin has recently been shouted out on the ultra-cool NTS radio station andon Instagram by Sarah Jessica Parker, whileThe Residence, the recent Netflix whodunnit from Shonda Rhimes’ production company, features a birdwatching detective.Birding not only gets you outdoors and moving, but engages you in nature; both benefit mental and physical health.A 2022 studyfound that everyday encounters with birdlife were associated with lasting improvements in mental wellbeing.Even simply hearing birdsongcan be restorative.But how do you go from noticing birds to becoming a full-blown birder? Carter and other experts took me under their wings.View image in fullscreenQuite rare … a stone-curlew.Photograph: Lee Hudson/AlamyStart where you areCarter is leading me through the BTO’sNunnery Lakes reserve, just south of Thetford in Norfolk. Sixty species of birds breed here between March and August, and more stop over.In just 20 minutes, we spot a dozen or so, including a charming family of great crested grebes.Many birders practise “patch birding”, focusing their entire practice on just the one area, Carter tells me: “It’s quite addictive.” He discovered birding aged 11, when his family moved close to the RSPB’sLeighton Moss nature reservein coastal Lancashire. “Suddenly, birds became the absolute focus.”But even urban areas teem with birdlife.Nadeem Perera, an RSPB ambassador and co-founder of the birding communityFlock Together, got hooked after spotting a green woodpecker in a suburban London cemetery. “I couldn’t get over how strikingly beautiful this bird was, and moreover, that it was on my doorstep,” he says.At the time, Perera was 15 and had just dropped out of school. He was feeling hopeless and disengaged. The woodpecker represented hope and possibility. “All I knew was that being exposed to birds in their natural environments made me feel good – so I kept on going.”Fifteen years later, Perera can confidently identify most birdsong in London.View image in fullscreenStrikingly beautiful … a green woodpecker.Photograph: Simon Rigby/Getty Images/500pxGet to know your neighboursWith more than 600 bird species recorded in the UK, Carter suggests starting with those you’re most likely to encounter locally. A field guide such asCollins Bird Guideis the best way to familiarise yourself with different types of birds and helpful vocabulary.By learning a little about the taxonomies – and what distinguishes, say, a passerine (perching bird) from a petrel (seabird) – “you very quickly learn how to describe the birds you see,” Carter says. But don’t feel pressure to become an expert, he adds. “People can just enjoy being in nature because it’s valid and valuable.”Amy Tan, the bestselling author of The Joy Luck Club, became a “back yard birder” in 2016, following Donald Trump’s election. “It was so depressing – I needed to find beauty again in the world,” she says. At the time, Tan was 64. Birding brought her calm and a refreshed perspective, “getting distracting and distressing elements out of my head so I could continue with my day”. Soon she became “obsessed” with birds; at one point, she even stored live mealworms in her fridge.In her bookThe Backyard Bird Chronicles(a US bestseller, to be published in the UK in August), Tan captures her visitors with whimsical descriptions and drawings. She can now identify more than 70 species – but that knowledge came gradually, she says. “If you take on too much at once, it’s overwhelming, and then you just don’t want to do it any more.” Naming birds “does not have to be a criteria” to enjoy them, she adds. “It’s a very democratic hobby, or passion – or obsession.”View image in fullscreenPortrait of the artist … Amy Tan sketching in her back yard.Photograph: Amy TanDo make use of technology …Technology can be a gateway to green spaces, as demonstrated by my experience with Merlin Bird ID. It’s useful for engaging young people in particular in the natural world, Carter agrees – and perhaps more realistic than urging them to leave their phones at home.The Collins Bird Guide is also availableas an appfor on-the-go referral (though most birders seem to use the app alongside the hard copy, since the book is easier to browse). Carter also recommends the BTO’s free appBirdTrack, which allows users to record their sightings, review those of others, and contribute to research. Some people prefereBird, which, like Merlin, comes from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.View image in fullscreenProblem solving … Amy Tan’s sketch of scrub jays.Photograph: Amy Tan… but don’t forget to pay attention, tooThough apps can augment birders’ experience in the field, they can also distract from it. Carter says Merlin is best used in addition to your own instincts and identifications, rather than as a replacement – not least because “it’s not 100% accurate”. And by immediately reaching for the app to ID a bird sighting or song, you also risk skipping over steps that would make that knowledge stick or feel earned.I have now started using Merlin only after making my best guess as to what species I’m hearing. I am usually wrong (unless it’s a chiffchaff) – but I feel as if I’m training my ear.Birding requires patience, which is at odds with our on-demand culture, Perera points out. That’s “one of the great things” about it – but it can be a tough adjustment. “This isn’t Netflix. There’s every chance that you will see nothing. Then you realise: ‘Oh, wow, the world actually doesn’t happen on my terms,’” he says. “It humbles your ego a little bit. But it makes you very appreciative of those magical moments when you do see the bird that you’re after.”Get your ‘bins’ outView image in fullscreenIn focus … binoculars and bird identification guide books are essential kit.Photograph: Simon Dack/AlamyBirding is a widely accessible, even generally free pastime – “but if you want to do it to a certain standard, you need to buy a pair of binoculars,” Carter says. As a one-off expense, it’s worth putting in the time to find a pair that suits your purposes (and ideally try before you buy). Magnification is not the only consideration, Carter says; some have a brighter picture, but might be less sharp. Weight and size are also important. “It’s about finding ones that feel right in your hand.”Premium-brand “bins”, such as Leica and Zeiss, go for more than £1,000. (An AI-assisted pair made by Swarovski – yes, like the crystal – will set you back £3,695.) Budget models have come a long way, but Carter warns against scrimping: “You’re not going to get anything under £150 or £200 that’s even really useful. But once you’ve got it, you’re done.”Think of it as an investment, echoes Sam Walker of theWildfowl & Wetlands Trust (WWT)charity. “You don’t have to spend thousands, but it’s really key. Even if it’s just a small pair of field binoculars, they’re going to set you up for decades into the future.” He suggests buying top brands secondhand, available at a fifth or even a tenth of the price of new. Walker’s own binoculars and telescope are probably more than 10 years old, “but it’s still great-quality glass”.Find your flockBirding is often a solitary pursuit, but it doesn’t have to be. “It’s a more social hobby than you’d think,” says Walker. He got into birding six years ago when he started working at the WWT, and says the best way to learn is by going out with people with more experience. “It’s much easier to identify birds and retain information, because you’ve got others there to bounce ideas off. I’m always really keen to not be sat in a bird hide, on my own, in the dark.”Nature reserves and organisations such as the BTO and the RSPB put on birding walks, talks, training courses and events. Joining a local bird club is also a great way to meet like-minded people. Birding may still be dominated by older, white men – but that is changing. TheBTOandRSPBboth have youth wings, while groups such asBirds & the BellesandBirding for Allare working to make the pastime more inclusive.Perera andOllie Olanipekunco-founded Flock Together in 2020, as a “birdwatching club for Black and brown people”. Five years on, it holds monthly birdwatching walks and has chapters in Tokyo, Toronto and New York. “Don’t let anybody intimidate you, or make you feel as though you don’t belong,” says Perera, who is of Sri Lankan and Jamaican heritage. “They’re just scared that you’re going to be better at it than them.”View image in fullscreenFlight chronicle … Tan’s picture of crows.Photograph: Amy TanStart a list, or a systemBirders love to log their sightings: the most common records are “year lists”, covering the calendar year, and “life lists” that include everything. Walker’s 2025 list is currently at 130 species, sighted around his Gloucestershire home – but he knows birders with life lists tallying 600-plus. “You can imagine the amount of time and money that they’ve spent travelling around.”Many birdwatchers will go to great lengths to secure rare spots. “It just adds a little bit of magic sparkle to your birding year, and builds up that life list as well.” But even patch-birders, focused on their local area, can get a bit obsessive about trying to catch ’em all, Walker admits. “People get worried about going away on holiday.”Raptors delight: a bird safari in the Forest of BowlandRead moreWhile some structure or system can support your developing hobby, Carter discourages being too focused on outcomes. “I’ve seen quite a few young people get into the rarity, list-building thing.”Earlier this month, a Pallas’s reed bunting was spotted on Fair Isle in the Shetlands – only the fifth sighting recorded since 1976. Though the bird itself is small and unshowy, excitement levels were high: “A mostly monochrome masterpiece, this was the stuff of birding legend,” wrote theRare Bird Alertnewsletter. Carter recalls: “straight away, people were trying to figure out if they could get charter flights, whether there were any boats running …” He advises slowing down. “Take your time; learn to really love birds.”It’s enough just to lookTan decries some birdwatchers’ elitism, and dismissal of common species. “They’ll call a starling or sparrow a ‘junk bird’; I think that’s horrible.” She approaches birding as a practice of observation, and even mindfulness. “You can start noticing what a bird is doing – these ordinary behaviours that we don’t always pay attention to.”Tan also studies the pecking order playing out at her feeders. “Trying to decipher the relationships – that’s part of the fun,” she says. Drawing each bird pushes her to focus on easily missed details such as bill shape or foot colour, and “the way that each individual bird is actually constructed”.Keeping a journal or a diary (as The Backyard Bird Chronicles began) helps “anchor” her practice, Tan says. “It’s a good brain exercise, if you’re a writer, but also just for remembering the things that made your life so meaningful and joyful.”Broaden your horizonsOnce you’re familiar with your patch and its regulars, you can start attuning yourself to seasonal variations. Many migratory birds arrive in the UK during the spring, staying for the summer and leaving just as winter visitors are descending.The time of day and the weather affect sightings, too. Birdlife is typically most active at dawn and dusk. While rain can worsen visibility and make some species less active, it enlivens others and causes them to fly closer to the ground, making them easier to spot.Strong onshore winds can blow seabirds towards the coast from open water, and cause migratory species from North America, Europe or Asia to make a pit stop on British shores. Just a short drive or train ride can transport you to a different habitat hosting unfamiliar species, Walker says. “Even in London, you can get out to heathland or down to the coast.”The eBird and BirdTrack apps, alerting on recent sightings and particular hotspots, can give you a sense of what to look for – but in general, Walker says, “being out and always birding is the best place to be”.Once you’re familiar with your patch and its regulars, you can start attuning yourself to seasonal variationsBe part of something biggerAs well as offering an escape from screens, work and day-to-day stresses, birding can deepen your investment in nature. You might notice the changing climate in your area, or get involved in local efforts to protect green spaces. “It connects you to it, so you care about it, and you’re concerned when someone wants to fill in your local pond or build a road through woodland,” says Carter.You can contribute to science and conservation efforts by logging sightings on BirdTrack, adding to anational databaseof “what’s where and when”. The BTO also conductsregular projects and surveys– of wetland birds, breeding birds or garden birds – involving thousands of volunteers each year. Even beginners can play a part, says Carter.“Every record is of some value: if you identify only half the birds you saw, that half is still really useful. You don’t have to be an expert in telling one weird wader apart from another weird wader – there are always people who are good at that.”The Backyard Bird Chronicles by Amy Tan is published in the UK by Corsair (£20) on 7 AugustExplore more on these topicsBirdwatchingScience and nature booksBirdsAnimalsWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was years before she properly understood it as abuse. Now she is working tirelessly in parliament for other survivorsThu 19 Jun 2025 02.32 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 11.21 EDTShareNatalie Fleet is nervous about this interview. Her assistant has warned me and Fleet tells me several times, before and during. “I just feel sick,” she says. “I don’t know if it’s because it’s about me or because of the subject. It just doesn’t seem to get any easier.”The subject is rape – specifically Fleet’s experience of being groomed by an older man when she was 15, becoming pregnant and having the baby. That daughter, “the love of her life”, is now 24. Since entering parliament last summer as the Labour MP for Bolsover, Fleet has spoken a good deal about rape, her life story and the lack of support for mothers whose children were conceived this way – and each time it upsets her. “My husband said: ‘I don’t want you to be the “rapey MP”,’ and I don’t want that either,” says Fleet. “But it’s such a massive void in our national conversation. If nobody’s talking about it, then people won’t report it or understand it, perpetrators won’t be prosecuted or convicted. Andshame really does need to switch sides. That can only happen if we start telling each other that it’s not our fault.”For Fleet, that last point could not be more pertinent because, for decades, she has blamed herself for the events that almost derailed her life. It is only since entering parliament that she has begun to look back, rethink and reframe it. Only now, at 41, has Fleet started to see her “teenage relationship” as grooming, the “sex” as statutory rape and the man she fleetingly, naively thought she loved, her daughter’s “absent father”, as a perpetrator. She is making sense of it, adjusting to it and campaigning on it all at the same time.Shame really does need to switch sides. That can only happen if we start telling each other that it’s not our faultFleet grew up in Sutton-in-Ashfield, a Nottinghamshire mining town. “Everybody was connected to the mines – my grandad and my uncle were miners, my dad delivered the coal; he was a lorry driver,” she says. The area also had a sky-high teenage pregnancy rate – according to Fleet, the highest in Europe. But she was aiming for something different. “I can remember being at my first ever parents evening when I was five and the teacher saying to my mum and dad: ‘She’s going straight to university,’” says Fleet. “I didn’t know what university was. I didn’t know anybody who’d ever been. I grew up knowing more people who went to prison than university, but I worked really, really hard. I just wanted to do well.”When she was eight, Fleet’s parents separated and her dad moved to Norfolk. By her teens, home life had become very difficult. “Domestic violence is something I have experienced and it shaped the adult that I am, but I feel lucky that I can keep the details of that trauma to myself,” she says. “I don’t need to talk about how horrendous it was because of the women who have come before me and spoken about this and are doing great work.“What I will say is I was a young girl in really difficult circumstances looking for love when things were tough. And I thought I’d found it.” An older man who lived streets away told 15-year-old Fleet everything she needed to hear. “He told me he loved me and that I was amazing and I believed him,” she says. “I thought we were in a loving relationship that would go long-term. I didn’t know it was just lies to have sex with a teenage girl.”View image in fullscreenNatalie Fleet with her daughter Lottie and mother, Tracy Hovell, at the Labour party conference in Manchester in September 2014.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThey were “together” for three months. “That feels like a long time when you’re young and vulnerable,” says Fleet. “Looking back with hindsight, it’s not long at all.” When she discovered she was pregnant, his reaction crushed her. “The first thing he said was that I needed to get a termination and, if I didn’t, he’d tell everybody that the baby wasn’t his, that it could be anybody’s. That was the first inkling I got that we weren’t in a serious, long-term relationship.“It was only at that point that I asked him how it had happened,” Fleet continues. “Did the condom break, or something? He just mumbled that he thought I was on contraception – but he’d never asked. I knew about STIs and pregnancy and the importance of protected sex and believed that’s what we were having. I was probably embarrassed to ask or check. It’s dark, you’re young, this is an older man, he must know what he’s doing. If we all struggle to talk about this stuff and have open conversations, no wonder sometimes things go really wrong.”Telling her family was the hardest thing. “It was absolutely horrendous,” she says. “My mum took me straight to my grandparents, as she wanted their support. My grandad, the miner, had supported me since birth. He’d looked after me, made sure I was safe – and now he saw this thing had happened to me while I was still a child. He just screamed. The noise that came out of his body is something I’ll never forget. It didn’t sound like a human. It was a wail.” Very soon, though, that grandad became a devoted great-grandfather, providing childcare, always giving so much love.View image in fullscreenNatalie Fleet in her office at Portcullis House.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianStill, in the early days of Fleet’s pregnancy, the overriding message was that she had ruined her life. “Teachers. Relatives. Anyone who spoke to me said the same thing. ‘You had a whole future ahead of you; now look what you’ve done.’ ‘How did you let this happen?’” Nobody looked at the father, the man who had been having sex with an underage girl, and there was certainly no talk of statutory rape or prosecution. “There were no questions around: ‘Who is he?’ ‘What is happening here?’” says Fleet. “I had a consultant because I was so young, I had the support of my GP, I had midwives, health visitors – nobody asked.” The blame was placed squarely on Fleet. “I felt absolutely full of shame,” she says.After taking her GCSEs, Fleet left school to have her daughter. She creditsSure Start, a government initiative to support families in disadvantaged areas, for showing her the way. “It was this massive orange building next to the school,” she says. “They had signs on the wall that said: ‘We don’t smack.’ I thought: ‘Why don’t we smack?’ and they explained it to me. They had a baby cafe where they taught me how to blend fruit and vegetables. They gave new mothers Argos vouchers for breastfeeding! Nobody in my family had ever breastfed. Your breasts were for your partner, not your child. I thought: ‘If they’re prepared to put money behind it, it must be really important.’ I breastfed for nine months and really loved that special bond.” (That Sure Start centre, like most others, has since closed due to cuts by previous governments – something Fleet finds devastating.)When her daughter was just three months old, Fleet met her husband. He had gone to the same school, three years above, and was now a heating engineer. “It’s only since I’ve been doing these interviews that most people around us, even close friends, have realised he isn’t my daughter’s biological father,” she says. “It’s not something we hid, but he is so ingrained in our life; my daughter has only ever known him. As she grew up, she understood that there was an absent father and at times that felt difficult, like she was being rejected. But I’ve always thought of it as her having been ‘chosen’. My husband chose to be her dad and he has always been there for her.”View image in fullscreenNatalie Fleet addresses the chamber in parliament.Photograph: House of CommonsA nursery place for her daughter, funded by Sure Start, allowed Fleet to go to college to study for her A-levels. Then, after having her second child, a son, Fleet began a history and politics degree at the University of Nottingham. “I loved the work, I loved everything I learned, but culturally it was so different to anything I’d ever encountered,” she says.“The students were posher than anyone I’d ever met. I was 19, but I had two children. I’d fought so hard to get to a 9am lecture and they would just roll out of bed and talk about the night they’d had. I felt uncomfortable. I couldn’t relate to anybody, so I dropped out – and that was horrendous. That’s when I thought everything people had said was true. I’d ruined my life. It took me a long time to rebuild.”In the years after, Fleet had two more children, volunteered at a Citizens Advice bureau and joined the Labour party. Her local MP,Gloria De Piero, became a kind of mentor and they remain very close. Eventually, Fleet got a job at the National Education Union, which she loved; she remained there until she entered parliament.It was only as she prepared to be an MP that she began thinking hard about her past. “You have to go through everything, every grain of your life and think: ‘How would I explain this if I was asked about it?’” she says. “That’s the point where I began to realise. I sat down with my daughter and said to her: ‘I think this was actually statutory rape. I don’t think it was OK.’ My daughter said: ‘Yes, that’s no surprise.’ She was gobsmacked that it had taken me so long to realise. I had the same conversation with my son, who is three years younger. He already knew as well. I was the last person to cotton on.“Even now that I know objectively that what happened was statutory rape, and that it wasn’t my fault, I also know that the minute we’re finished speaking today, the shame will kick back in,” says Fleet.My dream is that every woman will have an MP who believes her, a police force that understands and a court system without a backlogThis is partly what motivates her in parliament. Her office walls at Portcullis House are dotted with goals and mini pep talks, the kind you might need when you have landed outside your comfort zone (“Make friends!” “Speak more!”). “I want to be here because I believe I can do a great deal of good and that we should have a representative democracy with people from a whole range of backgrounds, but I’ve struggled since I got here,” she says. “I mean, it’s an actual palace. It’s not made for people like me. If you’ve been to boarding school or the Oxford debating society, you’ll fit in a lot easier. If I wanted to congratulate somebody, like most of the country, I’d clap. I wouldn’t shout: ‘Hear, hear!’ Even in the middle of it, it’s hard to feel you belong, so no wonder the whole country feels they can’t relate to politicians.”But she has work to do. “Every time I’ve spoken about rape or sexual assault or asked a question in the chamber, people have got in contact, stopped me in the street to thank me, sent handwritten letters about their own horrendous experiences. Some of them say: ‘I’ve never told anybody what I’m about to tell you …’ now, rather than thinking: ‘Do you have a story?’ I’ll look at women and think: ‘I wonder what your story is …’“My absolute dream is that, by the end of this period in government, I’ll be able to tell any woman who comes to me that she’ll have an MP who believes her, a police force that will understand, each with a designated specially trained officer, a court system without a backlog and space in prison for perpetrators to serve a full sentence.”Fleet is also working to start a charity that supports families with children conceived by rape. “It’s a charity that doesn’t exist here even though there are 10 babies born every day to mothers who’ve been raped,” she says. “I want there to be practical support on how to talk to your child about this in an age-appropriate way. I want there to be advice and community that can reassure you that the love, anger and confusion you feel is normal.”Four months ago, Fleet became a grandparent: her daughter had her own daughter. Fleet’s husband is going part-time to provide childcare when her daughter returns to work. “He chose to be her dad and he has chosen to be the best grandad, too, and I’m thrilled for her,” says Fleet. “I was a mum at 15, which is terrible, but a nana at 40 is incredible. It’s such a blessing and I miss my home so much.”But she also has work to do. Our interview ends when a clerk arrives to help Fleet draft an amendment to thevictims and courts bill, an amendment that would remove parental rights from a father whose child was conceived by rape. “I think the government is going to support this and that feels incredible,” says Fleet. “When people hear about it, they say: ‘Surely that’s already the law?’ But no. At the moment, children are the only proceeds of crime that a criminal gets to keep.“We talk about the privilege of being an MP and at times I’ve struggled to feel it,” she says. “I’ve missed my family so much. But being able to do things like this is more than I could have wished for.”Her daughter is right behind her, too. “She is so supportive, it’s unbelievable,” says Fleet. “You do your best and hope for the best and I am just so proud of her. When I first started speaking about all this, she said to me: ‘Mum, every time I hear you say the word “rape”, I bristle.

The reckless decisions of these leaders did not take place in a vacuum. As Tisdall writes: “The roots of major conflicts often reach back decades – and this is true of the Israel-Iran vendetta, which dates to the 1979 Islamic revolution.” I suggest reaching further back to the 1950s, when Israel built itsnuclear facility in Dimonaand Charles De Gaulle decided to end French support unless Israel joined the non‑proliferation treaty (NPT).After John F Kennedy’s ultimatum for safeguards, Israel accepted six inspections, until Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger condoned its nuclear status outside the NPT, provided Israel maintained nuclear ambiguity, playing down its strategic advantage. Israel concealed its nuclear status, refused to adhere to the NPT as contrary to its national security interest, and adopted the “Begin doctrine” of counter-proliferation, envisaging preventive strikes against Middle Eastern countries installing nuclear reactors that might produce nuclear weapons. Accordingly, it destroyed Iraq’s and Syria’s nuclear reactors (in1981and2007respectively) and, in cooperation with the US, damaged the Iranian nuclear facilities with the Stuxnet malware (which leaked and spread).Ambiguity allowed Israel to avoid legal restrictions on American military and economic support towards nuclear-armed states (except NPT members). The current crisis arises because, as Tisdall writes, Donald Trump trashed the previous nuclear agreement (which Tehran had respected) and fell into Benjamin Netanyahu’s trap. If, eventually, a nuclear showdown is to be avoided in the Middle East, all countries must have the right to develop nuclear energy for civil purposes and the duty to submit to NPT rules. Even if the present conflict ends, unless Israel joins the NPT, Iran will eventually have the bomb. In western media there is a conspiracy of silence on this.Corrado Pirzio-BiroliBrussels, BelgiumJonathan Freedland, noting Israel’s longstanding contention that Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons would constitute an existential threat, rightly concludes that the latest extension of conflict in the Middle East may paradoxically lead to nuclear proliferation (Netanyahu attacked Iran to avert an ‘existential threat’. He may have made it worse, 13 June). He cites North Korea as an example, for Iran, of a country that has ensured its safety by retaining nuclear weapons, but here the theory of deterrence breaks down. If North Korea is secure, why not Israel, which has significant nuclear weapons capability?If it is contended thatIranis a rogue actor, unwilling to follow the “rules” of mutually assured destruction, why is any nuclear-armed country safe from rogue actors? Every effort must be put into developing an internationally enforceable inspection, control, reduction and elimination regime to whichallcountries are subject, rather than unilateral pre-emptive acts, with all their appalling and unpredictable consequences.Dr Anthony IsaacsLondonRe “three angry old men who could get us all killed”, what about Vladimir Putin? That would make up the four horsemen of the apocalypse Simon Tisdall predicts.Hubert CasselFarnham, SurreyApropos your report (Israel and Iran broaden strikes during third day of escalating war, 15 June), it has to be said that Iran was quite content with its nuclear deal with the west. In fact, the nuclear deal was President Barack Obama’s biggest gift to both the US and Iran. But President Donald Trump, instead of building on the deal via establishing diplomatic relations, decided to crush it, thereby turning the clock of the US-Iran relations back to the pre-2015 level.Furthermore, Washington, not merely content with withdrawing from the deal, chose to spin the alleged Iranian nuclear threat into a rationale for military action against Iran. Was it not a similar Iraqi nuclear threat that President George HW Bush evoked to wincongressional authorisationfor US military action against Saddam Hussein, resulting in the deaths of more than 461,000 people, including 4,598 US soldiers and 179 British service personnel?Randhir Singh BainsGants Hill, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Many Zambians have raised the issue of this looting for years, but have met coordinated resistance. Consequently, Zambia’s treasury loses billions of dollars in revenue. These losses are driven by well-known multinationals working in concert with certain insiders close to the Zambian state.Your editorial also says: “The US decision to cut $50m a year in aid toZambia… is dreadful, and the reason given, corruption, rings hollow.” Alas, I disagree and wish to place this in context.The aid cut followed large-scale theft of US-donated medical supplies by individuals connected to and within the Zambian state. Even before Donald Trump assumed office, Michael Gonzales, the US ambassador, confronted Zambian authorities about this. US officials engaged in33 meetingswith senior members of the Zambian government and officers from the Zambia police service and other law enforcement agencies. US officials urged the Zambians to take action to ensure medicines reached the country’s poorest citizens. The president’s inner circle ignored the warnings, ultimately leading to the aid cut. The Zambian government’s reaction was to dismiss these legitimate concerns, saying diplomatsshould stay out of Zambia’s internal affairs.This response is inadequate, as the issues go beyond mere bureaucratic inefficiency and touch on profound state corruption.The government’s refusal to confront this reality is disappointing and has led to more suffering, where ordinary people who benefited from this aid will be most affected.Emmanuel MwambaZambia’s high commissioner to SouthAfrica(2015-19)As a Zambian and UK citizen, I am both enraged and heartbroken by Prof Andrew Fischer’s research exposing the systematic plunder of my country’s wealth. WhileDonald Trumpcuts our aid, citing “corruption”, the real thieves operate with complete impunity under the guise of legitimate business.The figures are devastating:$5bn extractedin 2021 alone. This isn’t corruption in the traditional sense, it’s legalised theft orchestrated by multinational corporations that exploit our resources while leaving us in poverty. How can we be called corrupt when the very system designed to “help” us facilitates our exploitation?I think of my fellow Zambians struggling to access basic healthcare, education and clean water while billions flow to Swiss bank accounts. We sit on some of the world’s most valuable mineral deposits, yet we’re drowning in debt. This isn’t coincidence – it’s by design.Foreign direct investment is often foreign direct extraction in disguise. Companies like Glencore and First Quantum Minerals have treated Zambia like a cash machine, using complex financial structures to strip our wealth while paying minimal taxes. When confronted, they simply leave or settle for pennies in the pound.This global economic architecture, which enables legal plunder, must be challenged. African countries need new models of resource governance that prioritise our people over foreign shareholders. We need transparency requirements exposing these shadowy financial flows, progressive taxation capturing fair value from our resources, and regional cooperation preventing companies from playing us against each other.The west’s moralising about corruption while facilitating this systematic theft is breathtaking hypocrisy. Until the international community addresses the structural violence of this extractive system, their aid will remain what it truly is – a drop in the ocean compared with the torrent of wealth flowing out of Africa.Fiona MulaishoLondonExplore more on these topicsZambiaAfricaDonald TrumpUS politicsAidlettersShareReuse this content"

Nowhere in the Guardian article he is responding to (Conservationists call for Lake District to lose Unesco world heritage status, 7 June) does anyone call for “sheep farming’s demise”. Neither the letter I sent to Unesco nor the report that I co-authored, both referred to in the article, call for it either. Instead, we’re raising concerns about the Lake District’s world heritage site designation, which poses a major threat to exactly the sort of adaptation that Mr Stocker says he wants and that most farmers know is coming.None of the farmers I’ve spoken to could name a single benefit of being in a world heritage site. Most people won’t be aware of the downsides, but for those of us working in conservation, they are obvious. The designation is influencing decisions by the national park authority, which views every element of the park’s management through a world heritage lens and puts sheep farming first, often at the expense of rural livelihoods and nature.We are not attacking farming or anybody’s culture, and it’s a pity that this is how Stocker and many others, including the MP Tim Farron, have interpreted it. For farmers and conservationists to be at loggerheads is madness. Once the dust settles, I hope we will be able to sit down and have some sensible discussion about these issues and how to resolve them.As Mr Stocker attests, farming has played a key role in the history of theLake District, and it will have a vital role to play in its future, but only if it is allowed to adapt. Removing the world heritage site designation, or amending it to reflect the urgency of the climate crisis, will help that transition to take place.Lee SchofieldBampton, CumbriaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Pirates didn’t keep journals listing their lawlessness. What happened in Nassau stayed in Nassau. If we want to discover the truth, we’re going to have to dive for it.”TheBahamaswas a major crossroads for trade and more than 500 ships have been wrecked off New Providence since the 1680s, according to historical sources. But there may be dozens more, with pirate ships among them.In 1718, when Woodes Rogers sailed to Nassau to become its governor, he noted 40 seized ships on the shore that had been “either burned or sunk” to destroy evidence and “about 700 pirates”.In 1696, the privateer Henry Avery sailed to Nassau in his ship, the Fancy, laden with loot. He used some of the treasure to bribe the governor of the Bahamas, establishing Nassau as a base for fellow pirates.Top of the most-wanted hitlist of shipwrecks is the Fancy, a 46-gun flagship.Kingsley said: “Avery of Plymouth lit the fuse and threw the grenade that started the golden age of piracy after looting a Mughal treasure ship of $108m off India. He then sailed to Nassau in 1696 to lie low, party and for the crew to break up with their cut of the booty.“Avery scuttled the Fancy in Nassau. It’s the crown jewels of pirate ships. If we were to find anything associated with it, it would be spectacular. Its plunder was the greatest and most successful pirate heist on the high seas.”TheNew Providence Pirates Expedition– which is dedicated to science, education, entertainment and tourism in the Bahamas – is drawing on historical and archaeological evidence to conduct the first underwater survey, which begins in September.The project has secured the first-ever agreement with the Antiquities, Monuments and Museums Corporation of the Bahamas, a partner collaborator.Kingsley has explored more than 350 shipwrecks in the last 30 years and is the founding editor ofWreckwatch, the world’s only magazine dedicated to the sunken past.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For the first time in history, viewers are going to see with their own eyes the places where Blackbeard and gang terrorised theAmericas.“Somewhere out there are the wine bottles they partied with, the tobacco pipes they smoked, the pieces of eight carelessly lost and so much more. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to get up close and personal with the real pirates of the Caribbean.”Asked how they will identify pirate shipwrecks, Kingsley said: “Generally, if you find a Dutch, English or French shipwreck, it has a very specific type of material culture on it. If it’s Spanish, it will have olive jars, a good marker. If it’s British, it may have Bristol or London tobacco pipes, for instance.“On a pirate wreck, you will find French, English and Dutch ceramics and a mix of coins, anything from Arabian to British, and weapons such as stinkpots, explosive weapons used by pirates.”Dr Michael Pateman, the expedition’s co-director and the ambassador for history, culture and museology in the Bahamas, said: “This is the first project to reconstruct the port and landscape where Blackbeard, Calico Jack Rackham, Anne Bonny and the rest of the notorious Flying Gang were based. Anything could still be down there.”Explore more on these topicsPiracy at seaArchaeologyBahamasAmericasCaribbeannewsShareReuse this content"

Bolsonaro may be gone, but forces aligned with him and his ideas have occupied bodies like the medical council,” said Diniz.Such attempts are even more harmful given that legal abortion is not widely available across Brazil –only 4% of Brazilian cities have facilities and trained professionals to carry out the procedure, and that does not include even all state capitals.In the state of Goiás, a 13-year-old girl who had been raped turned to the courts after she was denied a legal abortion at a hospital, but a judge prohibited any method that would induce the death of the foetus. Ahigher court eventually authorised the abortion.In that state, the governor – also a Bolsonaro loyalist – signed a law requiring women seeking a legal abortion to firstlisten to the foetal heartbeat.Rio’s anti-abortion signs law was approved last Friday by Mayor Eduardo Paes – who is not a Bolsonaro supporter and is aligned with the current leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.The mayor’s decision not to veto the law – which was proposed by three far-right city councillors – is being seen as a political move, as he is expected to run for state governor next year.Under the law, hospitals providing abortions must also display signs saying: “You have the right to give your baby up for adoption anonymously … Give life a chance!” and “Abortion can lead to consequences such as infertility, psychological problems, infections and even death.”Diniz said the second sign was even more problematic as there is no scientific evidence that abortion, when carried out safely and with medical support, causes any of those effects.“This law is perverse because it is based on a false narrative of ‘care’ for women and girls, when in fact it is persecuting them,” said Diniz.On Tuesday, a public prosecutor filed a lawsuit arguing that the law is unconstitutional and requesting that the city government be barred from putting up the signs. The case is yet to be reviewed by a judge.Explore more on these topicsRio de JaneiroBrazilAbortionAmericasHealthWomenReproductive rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

His son, Hun Manet, is the current leader.During their discussion Paetongtarn addresses the veteran leader as “uncle” and refers to the Thai army commander in the country’s northeast as her opponent, a remark that sparked fierce criticism on social media.The Thai foreign ministry summoned the Cambodian ambassador on Thursday to deliver a letter complaining about the leaking of the call.View image in fullscreenA royalist supporter holds a sign that reads \"Thai government with Khmer heart Get Out\" during an anti-government protest following the phone call leak.Photograph: Chalinee Thirasupa/ReutersAfter the leak, the prime minister’s main coalition partner quit and she faced calls to resign or hold an election, throwing the kingdom into a fresh round of political instability as it seeks to boost its spluttering economy and avoid US President Donald Trump’s swingeing trade tariffs.The conservative Bhumjaithai party pulled out on Wednesday, saying Paetongtarn’s conduct in the leaked call had wounded the country and the army’s dignity.The Thai stock market fell 2.4% on Thursday as the crisis raged, but by the evening Paetongtarn, daughter of billionaire ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra, appeared to have won a reprieve as another coalition party said it would not withdraw – for now at least.Leaders of the Chartthaipattana, United Thai Nation and Democrat parties held urgent talks on the crisis on Thursday afternoon.Little experience and a lot on her plate: who is Thailand’s new prime minister?Read moreAfterwards, Chartthaipattana leader Varawut Silpa-archa told reporters his party would remain in government and meet Paetongtarn to decide what to do.Losing another coalition partner would probably mean the end of her government and either an election or a bid by other parties to stitch together a new coalition.The loss of Bhumjaithai’s 69 MPs left Paetongtarn with barely enough votes to scrape a majority in parliament and a snap election could be on the cards – barely two years after the last one in May 2023.Thailand’s military said in a statement that army chief Gen Pana Claewplodtook “affirms commitment to democratic principles and national sovereignty protection”.“The Chief of Army emphasised that the paramount imperative is for ‘Thai people to stand united’ in collectively defending national sovereignty,” it said.Thailand’s armed forces have long played a powerful role in the kingdom’s politics and politicians are usually careful not to antagonise them.Thailand has suffered a dozen coups since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, and the current crisis has inevitably triggered rumours that another may be in the offing.Such an outcome would make Paetongtarn the third member of her family, after her aunt Yingluck and father Thaksin, to be kicked out of office by the military.The main opposition People’s Party, which won the most seats in 2023 but was blocked by conservative senators from forming a government, urged Paetongtarn to call an election.The Palang Pracharath party, which led the government up to 2023, said the leaked recording showed Paetongtarn was weak and inexperienced, incapable of managing the country’s security.Hundreds of anti-government protesters, some of them veterans of the royalist, anti-Thaksin “Yellow Shirt” movement of the late 2000s, demonstrated outside Government House on Thursday demanding that Paetongtarn quit.Paetongtarn, 38, came to power in August 2024 at the head of an uneasy coalition between Pheu Thai and a group of conservative, pro-military parties whose members have spent much of the past 20 years battling against her father.Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificCambodianewsShareReuse this content"

The legislation does not explicitly say how platforms should enforce the law and the government is assessing more than 50 companies whose technologies could help verify that a user is over 16.The ABCreported on Thursdayteenage children in the trial were identified by some of the software as being aged in their 20s and 30s, and that face-scanning technology was only 85% accurate in picking a user’s age within an 18-month range. But Allen said the trial’s final report would give more detailed data about its findings and the accuracy of the technology tested.The trial is being run by the Age Check Certification Scheme and testing partner KJR. It was due to present a report to government on the trial’s progress in June but thathas been delayed until the end of July. On Friday, the trial published a two-page summary of “preliminary findings” and broad reflections before what it said would be a final report of “hundreds of pages” to the new communications minister, Anika Wells.The summary said a “plethora of options” were available, with “careful, critical thinking by providers” on privacy and security concerns. It concluded that “age assurance can be done in Australia”.The summary praised some approaches that it said handled personal data and privacy well. But it also found what it called “concerning evidence” that some providers were seeking to collect too much data.“Some providers were found to be building tools to enable regulators, law enforcement or coroners to retrace the actions taken by individuals to verify their age, which could lead to increased risk of privacy breaches due to unnecessary and disproportionate collection and retention of data,” it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are plenty of disagreements about how this can be done but there is general consensus that we should try.But another question has been left unasked: if we are successful in lifting productivity, what should we do with the dividends of our success? Or more simply: do we want to work less and spend the same, or do we want to work more and spend more?Jim Chalmers says media’s ‘rule-in rule-out game’ on tax reform has ‘cancerous effect’ on policy debatesRead moreLooking at history, the answer has been a combination of the two, according to Rusha Das, a research economist at the Productivity Commission.In a new paper, Das calculated that Australians used only 23% of the productivity “dividend” from the past 40-plus years to work less, while we banked the remaining 77% as higher income.“Rather than spending our productivity dividend on more spare time, we have largely traded it for higher incomes, and more and better stuff,” Das said.This choice of how to spend the fruits of higher productivity is rarely presented to us in such simple terms. A typical employer doesn’t ask if their staff want to work 5% less or have a 5% pay rise, for example.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“Instead, the effects of productivity gains are more subtly embedded in our lives, granting us more agency over how we live and work,” Das said.“It may be taking a half-day each fortnight, investing time in professional development rather than taking on additional clients, or deciding to expand the number of cattle on a dairy farm.“All these are choices that reflect the underlying freedom that productivity growth makes possible.”The economist John Maynard Keynes in 1930 famously predicted that technological advances meant his grandchildren would be working just 15 hours a week without being any worse off materially.Das said that prediction was not necessarily wrong, it’s just that we have made different choices.“With the growth in labour productivity Australia has enjoyed since 1980, Australians could have reduced their average hours worked by 15 hours per week without lowering consumption levels,” she said.Or we could have used all of the productivity dividend on working more and spending more – in which case GDP per capita would be 11% higher now than in 1980.Das said the choice between leisure and consumption can be influenced by a number of factors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIf we feel like the changes that are making us more productive are short term, then we’ll work more to take advantage of it while we can, and vice versa.Government policy plays a part – whether it’s higher tax rates that disincentivise working that extra hour, or workplace rules that allow people more flexibility.Cultural values also have a hand, Das said. In France there is a strong tendency to choose more leisure time, while in the US it is the opposite, her research showed.“For example, there is a saying that in the UK the last one to leave the office is seen as the hardest working, whereas in Germany the last one to leave is seen as the least efficient.”And these values change through time. Next year will marka century of working five days a week, after carmaker Henry Ford reduced it to five days from six.As we approach this milestone, more companies are implementing or trialling four-day working weeks, while the Greens before the May election launched a four-day work week policy.Das said keeping up our high levels of work “could be a good thing if it reflects greater voluntary participation in the workforce”: workers choosing to improve their living standards, or it’s the result of removing historical barriers that have held some segments of society back.“But it is concerning if Australians have been working more out of sheer necessity, sacrificing study, rest or time with loved ones just to maintain their standard of living.“For example, people may need to work more just to keep up with rising house prices, which has outpaced wage growth over a long period of time.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian economyProductivity CommissionCost-of-living crisisBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

We intend to respond to that when the work is done.”Mookhey said when the government was ready to make an announcement about the plan “the budget will reflect that decision”.In March conservation groups implored the premier, Chris Minns, to declare the full 176,000 hectares to be assessed and included as part of the park in northern NSW to protect it from logging.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailSince Labor’s 2023 election victory, more than10,000 football fields of forests have been cut downin the footprint of the promised park, according to a coalition of groups campaigning for urgent action.A multimillion-dollar transition package will be neededfor timber workers to halt logging, as well as ongoing funding to establish and run the park.“It’s incredibly disappointing if there is no new money for the great koala national park in the budget,” said the NatureConservationCouncil’s NSW chief executive, Jacqui Mumford.“We’ve had two years of delays already, and not putting money in the budget will only delay the park further.“It’s bad news for koalas and its bad news for timber workers.”Tuesday’s budget will also reveal the huge cost of natural disasters includingCyclone Alfredin March, which affected northern NSW;floods on the mid-north coastin May; and recovery costs for the2022 Lismore floods. The figure is expected to be in the billions.The government will also need to reveal the additional costs due to increased psychological claims by public sector workers after it failed to pass a bill to limit workers compensation claims ahead of the budget.The treasurer has claimed the additional liability will be $2.6bn over five years. The legislation is now likely to return to parliament in September.“People will see the budget is under pressure, predominantly from two sources: first, natural disasters; and second, a failing workers’ compensation system that is not returning workers to their health and then to work,” Mookhey saidAsked about future climate change adaptation costs, he said this would feature in different ways in the budget.“We are embedding that type of resilience investment and planning framework in more and more areas of government activity,” he said, including water, roads, transport and maritime.“You can’t silo [adaptation] from the rest of the government’s work.

It is not mentioned in either its explanatory speech or explanatory notes.According to a written briefing by the Department of State Development, Infrastructure and Planning, made during consideration by a parliamentary committee, the bill would “enhance efficiency and effectiveness” by “removing certain requirements for the appointment of OCOG board directors”.That includes “that 50% of nominated directors be women” and “that at least one of the independent directors is Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander”.The bill has yet to pass parliament but is certain to do so if all government members vote for it.Renee Carr, the executive director of Fair Agenda, said “women should be an equal part of making the critical decisions that shape its legacy”.“There’s been important progress in recognising women’s contribution to sport – as athletes, coaches, and in leadership. We should be leaning into what’s possible, not going backwards,” she said.Queensland moves to crack down on windfarms and exempt Olympic venues from planning lawsRead more“Hosting an event of this scale will impact Queensland’s economy, infrastructure and tourism. Women’s voices and expertise must be an equal part of planning a games that delivers for the whole community.”The executive director of QUT’s Carumba Institute,Prof Chelsea Watego, said the plan to remove the requirement was an “appalling decision”.She said the Sydney Olympics was able to make decisions with a board that included an Indigenous representative, Lowitja O’Donoghue, so there was no case that excluding them would make it more efficient.“It just tells you how far backwards Queensland has gone under an LNP government,” she said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailWatego said that Brisbane, Queensland and Australia would be on the international stage.“We’re under a microscope and we have to think very seriously about what this tells the world about who we are as a nation, who we are as a state, and the location of Indigenous peoples and women in relation to that.”The minister for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Tim Mander, said: “The Crisafulli government has accepted the recommendation of the independent 100-day review of the Games to streamline governance arrangements.“The act is currently before the state development, infrastructure and works committee.”The Planning (Social Impact and Community Benefit) and Other Legislation Amendment bill 2025 has a wide-ranging scope and more than 700 individuals and groups made a submission during a parliamentary inquiry process.Among other changes, the bill will reduce the size ofthe OCOG board from 24 to 15.It also amends regulation of renewables projects to make them easier for opponents to challenge in court and exempts Olympic venues from legal challenge.AOC appoints Mark Arbib as CEO for run-in to 2032 Brisbane Olympic GamesRead moreThe OCOG board is appointed by multiple different agencies separate from the state government, such as the federal sports minister and the president of the Australian Olympic Committee.A legal provision will still apply requiring consideration of the state government’s policy on gender equity on boards. The policy sets a non-binding target for gender equity and does not cover Indigenous representation.The Brisbane Olympics will be held from 23 July to 8 August 2032, with the Paralympics running from 24 August to 5 September. Queensland has never held an Olympics but has hosted the Commonwealth Games, most recently in 2018.A binding provision that the 2032 games be “climate positive” has also beenreportedly removed from the Olympic host contract. It will now aim “at removing more carbon from the atmosphere than what the Games project emits”.Explore more on these topicsQueenslandOlympic GamesBrisbane Olympic Games 2032Jarrod BleijieGenderIndigenous AustraliansnewsShareReuse this content"

The firm itself was also on trial for moral responsibility in the case.The case, being heard at the criminal court of Châlons-en-Champagne in north-east France, has become known in France as “the grape harvest of shame”.A police investigation found that a total of 57 men and women, mostly from west African countries and many of them undocumented, were allegedly held in fetid housing. They were allegedly forced to work in conditions likened to slavery while hand-picking grapes in Champagne’s picturesque vineyards, in a region recognised as a Unesco world heritage site.The case came to light when residents in the small village of Nesle-le-Repons called police to complain about noise and activity in a derelict house during the September 2023 grape harvest.A labour inspectorate found what it said in a report were “disgusting” and “dilapidated” living conditions at the house.Grape-pickers were allegedly forced to sleep on what they described as stinking inflatable mattresses in a house without proper flooring, walls or windows, amid dangerous electrical wiring and rusty bed frames. There was no adequate water supply, washing facilities or sanitation and only three blocked and unusable toilets.The workers, from countries including Mali, Mauritania, Ivory Coast and Senegal, were allegedly given too little food – either rice or sandwiches that were rotting. They were said to be transported to vineyards crammed into the back of vans, standing up, with no seats or windows. Some told investigators they worked for 10 hours with only a 30-minute break and were threatened if they wanted to rest or drink water.They are believed to have been hired from areas in northern Paris where refugees and undocumented people often sleep rough or in tents and were driven to the Champagne region with the promise of work.The state prosecutor said the housing in the Champagne area included “worn and dirty sanitation facilities”, outdoor kitchen and living areas that were unprotected from the weather, and bedding strewn on the floor.Two of the former workers told local French media that they still cried when thinking about the conditions they experienced. Maxime Cessieux, a lawyer for the workers, said the accused had “a total contempt” and disrespect for “human dignity”.A lawyer for one of the accused employees told theNouvel Obshe had only been involved in initial recruitment, and had had nothing to do with housing or work conditions.The CGT trade union said there must be an end to exploitation of seasonal workers in vineyards.In a sign that the case was being taken seriously by the industry, the Champagne Committee, which represents 16,200 winemakers, 130 cooperatives and 370 champagne houses, took part in the trial as a civil party – a first for legal proceedings concerning the living conditions of seasonal workers.The committee is “firmly opposed to these unacceptable practices”, its director, Charles Goemaere, said in a statement in March.A wine cooperative in the Marne was also on trial for moral responsibility in using illegal labour.Every year, about 120,000 seasonal workers are brought into the Champagne region to handpick grapes grown across 34,000 hectares (84,000 acres) and used to make the sparkling alcoholic drink.But the plight of seasonal workers has sometimes cast a shadow over champagne’s reputation. In 2023,four grape-pickers died, believed to have suffered sunstroke after working in scorching heat. During the 2018 champagne harvest, dozens of workers, including many from Afghanistan, were discovered housed in fetid conditions. Two members of a firm providing labour to the wine industry were found guilty of human trafficking and given prison sentences.David Desgranges, vice-president of the Consortium Contre l’Esclavage Moderne (Committee Against Modern Slavery), told Agence France-Presse: “The public should be made aware of the extent of human trafficking in the agricultural sector, and producers should know that they may face legal action.”Explore more on these topicsFranceWineFood & drink industryEuropeFoodHuman traffickingnewsShareReuse this content"

As a sovereign ally, we choose not to.”Spain currently lags well behind other western nations by dedicating only about 1.3% of its GDP to defence spending, well short of the current Nato target of 2%. It has suggested a target of 2.1%.Two months ago,Sánchez announced a €10.5bn (£9bn) “industrial and technological plan for security and defence” to help Spain hit the 2% target by the end of the year, saying it had become obvious “onlyEuropewill know how to protect Europe” from now on.Asked for comment about Spain’s request, a Nato official told Reuters: “Discussions among allies on a new defence investment plan are ongoing.”Trump increased pressure on the alliance in January, saying the US had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and that he would ask all members to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said last month that the pressure was already paying off in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Italy.“I tell them that, well, now I am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2% by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2% because we have to spend much, much more,” he said in March.Explore more on these topicsSpainNatoEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Using onboard AI, saildrones compile data using multiple sensors, cameras and radar to produce a more detailed picture of maritime activity than satellites can provide.EU ministers call for coordinated action on Russian ‘shadow fleet’ in Baltic SeaRead moreThe company has previously worked with the US navy, which used its vessels to help counter drug trafficking and illegal fishing operations. Its arrival in Denmark marks the first time it has been used for defence purposes in European waters.“The purpose of Saildrone is to give eyes and ears where we previously didn’t have eyes and ears,” said Richard Jenkins, CEO of Saildrone.As concerns grow over Russia’s so-called shadow fleet – ageing tankers used to circumvent sanctions by transporting crude oil to China and India – saildrones can be used to verify vessel identification and flag unusual movements that may point to undersea sabotage of pipelines or data cables.“What we’re seeing now is commercial shipping fleets being used in military applications,” said Jenkins.“So whether it’s the shadow fleet for Russia trafficking illegal supplies that is getting around sanctions or whether they are trying to do nefarious things like damage infrastructure, we need to be able to track that.”The Danish armed forces are deploying four saildrones in the Baltic for operational testing to improve its capacity for maritime surveillance and intelligence gathering.However, the partnership has raised concerns among Denmark’s tech leaders.The software engineer and entrepreneur, David Heinemeier Hansson, told Danish broadcaster DR: “The problem with American companies is that they have to follow American law, American decrees and the American president. He can demand data at any time, and he can close an account at any time.”Jacob Herbst, head of the Danish Cybersecurity Council, said: “With the international situation we are currently seeing, you obviously have to think very carefully when choosing American suppliers in this area.”Jenkins said they are not getting classified data in Denmark and that data is fully encrypted.The floating drones can be powered by diesel, wind and solar and can remain at sea for over a year but their average deployment is 100 days. Between 10 and 20 saildrones would be needed to cover the whole of the Baltic.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkRussiaDrones (military)EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Period,” he wrote on Facebook.The mayor, who was re-elected to the position last summer, is among the harshest critics of the rightwing government’s politics. He has hung an LGBTQ+ flag and a Ukrainian flag on the administration building in central Budapest, in defiance of Orbán’s Fidesz party’s rhetoric.In an interview with the Guardian this week, before the police statement, Karácsony said he was determined the event would go ahead.“There is currently no law that could ban [a municipal event],” he said. “Obviously, anything can happen inHungary. But we will come up with a plan C.”View image in fullscreenGergely Karácsony, the liberal mayor of Budapest, was one of the speakers at Budapest Pride in 2021.Photograph: Aleksander Kalka/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockDozens of MEPs have said they willattend a Pride event in the city in defiance of the government, as well as politicians including: the Spanish culture minister, Ernest Urtasun; Ireland’s former taoiseach, Leo Varadkar; and the mayors of Amsterdam and Brussels.Karácsony, who won a seat in the Hungarian parliament as a member of a new green party in 2010, the same year Orbán came to power, said he also expected the police to help guarantee the safety of the event. “I believe that everyone can attend safely on 28 June,” he said.Since Orbán returned to power, Hungary has passed a series of laws which have been criticised at home and across the EU for curtailing the rights of the country’s sexual and gender minorities in the name of “child protection”.The bill passed in March by the Fidesz-majority parliament was only the latest but perhaps starkest example, seen by many as a direct attack on Budapest Pride, which has been held in the city for nearly three decades.Karácsony, who waselected mayor of the capital in 2019and was re-elected in 2024 by just a few hundred votes, insists his drive to ensure the march lives on is not about currying favour with voters. “A good politician has a strong moral compass,” he said. “But I know that most Budapest residents agree with me.”At a time when the Hungarian LGBTQ+ community feels increasingly embattled, Karácsony has openly supported LGBTQ+ rights. He was among the speakers at Budapest Pride in 2021, after the government passed a law banning the “display or promotion of homosexuality” to under-18s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the end, the six-party joint opposition chose another city mayor, Péter Márki-Zay, to run for PM. Fidesz retained a two-thirds majority in parliament, and Orbán was elected for a fourth consecutive term.Karácsony told the Guardian he would not run in the 2026 general election, where Orbán is expected to face his strongest opponent to date, Péter Magyar. Magyar, a conservative politician, has not endorsed Pride, but spoken up for the right of people to assemble.“We use power to encourage or support those who need it,” said Karácsony, a sociologist by trade.Quite what will happen on 28 June is unclear. Orbán’s chief of staff, Gergely Gulyás, told a briefing on Wednesday that no matter what the mayor said, a Pride gathering would fall under the legislation that governs the right to assemble.In their statement, police said any appeal against the ban must be lodged with the Hungarian supreme court within three days.The march, they said, “by its very nature cannot be held without the representation” of people belonging to the LGBTQ+ community and that under-18s could be present along the route.“If it cannot be stated with absolute certainty that the display is not taking place in the presence of persons under 18 years of age, the assembly would be in breach of the ban,” the police said.Explore more on these topicsHungaryEuropePrideLGBTQ+ rightsViktor OrbánnewsShareReuse this content"

It added that correspondence with Tehran had continued and there was still hope of negotiations.Trump’s decision on whether to join the assault against Iran hinged in part on whether America’s most powerful conventional “bunker buster” bombs would be ableto take out Iran’s most heavily protected nuclear facility, sources familiar with the deliberations said.Israel does not have weapons capable of destroying the Fordow complex, which is buried up to 100 metres below a mountain near the holy city of Qom. Netanyahu and his allies have been encouraging the US to shift from backing Israel’s defence to joining the attack,telling Trumpthat he alone can “finish off” Iran’s nuclear project.Strike plans have been drawn up, but Trump is waiting to see if Tehran will make a last-minute deal to abandon its nuclear programme, sources said.Amid global warnings against further escalation, Europe is pushing for a diplomatic solution to the war. Iran’s foreign minister is travelling to Geneva to meet his British, French and German counterparts on Friday. There have also been offers of mediation from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and regional powers including Oman.On Thursday the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, met his US counterpart, Marco Rubio, at the White House, with the focus on the Middle East.They were joined by the British ambassador, Lord Mandelson, and Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, for the meeting.Lammy said later: “The situation in the Middle East remains perilous. We are determined that Iran must never have a nuclear weapon … we discussed how a deal could avoid a deepening conflict. A window now exists within the next two weeks to achieve a diplomatic solution.”He added: “Now is the time to put a stop to the grave scenes in the Middle East and prevent a regional escalation that would benefit no one.”1:37Iranian missile strike damages Israeli hospital – videoWhen Israel launched the conflict a week ago, Netanyahu described it as a focused operation to halt Iran’s progress towards making a nuclear bomb, but he has been increasingly vocal about his desire for the government in Tehran to fall.On a visit to the Soroka hospital in Beersheba on Thursday, after it was hit by an Iranian missile overnight, Netanyahu said Israel was creating conditions for regime change but that Iranians needed to rise up.Referencing a story from the Bible about the Persian emperor Cyrus the Great liberating Jewish people enslaved in Babylon, Netanyahu told journalists: “Today, a Jewish state is creating the means to liberate the Persian people.”Netanyahu later said the fall of the Iranian regime was for the country’s people to decide. “It could be a result, but it’s not a stated or formal goal that we have,” he told Israeli public broadcaster Kan.Iranians have repeatedly attempted to topple or reform their government over decades, and thousands have paid with their lives or freedom.Many opposition figures, including political prisoners, have rejected the idea that an Israeli war which has already killed hundreds of civilians represents a path to liberation for their country.View image in fullscreenSmoke rising from an Israeli attack in Tehran.Photograph: Majid Asgaripour/ReutersThey have a grim warning in the fate of neighbouring Iraq after US forces toppled Saddam Hussein. His downfall was celebrated by many Iraqis, but was followed by decades of extreme and often sectarian violence which paved the way for the rise of Islamic State.Katz visited Soroka hospital before Netanyahu and effectively called for Khamenei’s assassination. He had earlier said he ordered increased attacks on government targets to undermine the regime.“Khamenei openly declares that he wants Israel destroyed, he personally gives the order to fire on hospitals. He considers the destruction of the state of Israel to be a goal,” Katz told journalists. “Such a man can no longer be allowed to exist.”After its initial focus on military and nuclear sites, Israel recently attacked targets, including the state broadcaster, with no links to the nuclear project, but which Katz described as “symbols of the regime”.View image in fullscreenSmoke billowing from a building at Soroka hospital in Beersheba.Photograph: Maya Levin/AFP/Getty ImagesIran’s early morning hit on Soroka hospital in Beersheba did not cause any serious injuries because all staff and patients were in protected areas, the director, Shlomi Kodesh, said.But images of shattered wards and stunned medics examining the damage caused outrage in Israel.Other missiles landed around Tel Aviv, injuring more than 200 people across the country as a whole, four of them seriously.One hit the base of a skyscraper in Ramat Gan, close to central Tel Aviv and about 200 metres from the city’s diamond exchange.“It was like an atom bomb. An earthquake,” said Asher Adiv, 69, who lives in a nearby block of flats. His mother was an Iranian Jew from Isfahan and Asher grew up speaking Farsi.“The Iranian people should make a revolution, and kick out the ayatollahs,” he said. “We are not just fighting for Israel. We are fighting for the whole world. We ask Trump to go inside and finish the problem.”Trump, who initially distanced himself from the conflict, has increased the US military presence in the region as heweighs up ordering US forces to join attacks on Iran.The US president was the first subject most Tel Aviv residents wanted to discuss, as they gathered at the police cordon to watch first responders work among the rubble and shattered glass.mapAdiv’s wife, Anny, who immigrated from Morocco in 1969, said: “Tell Donald Trump to be beside us. He has to bomb them to finish the nuclear sites.”Khamenei warned on Wednesday that the US would face “irreparable damage” if it shifted from supporting Israel’s defence to an active role in assaults on its territory.Iran’s military has moved missiles to prepare for attacks on US assets if it joins the war, and officials are considering other options to respond to one of the most serious threats since the 1979 revolution that brought the country under the control of clerics.A member of the national security committee in Iran’s parliament, Behnam Saeedi, said Iran could attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz, Reuters reported. The narrow passage is used by vessels carrying a fifth of the world’s daily oil needs.Israeli planes bombed a partly built heavy-water reactor near Arak on Thursday and returned to strike the Natanz nuclear complex.There was no radiation risk from the strike on the reactor, state TV said. Israeli warnings meant the area had been evacuated.View image in fullscreenIsraeli rescuers evacuate Haim Rasin from his flat in Ramat Gan after it was destroyed by an Iranian missile strike.Photograph: Oded Balilty/APHeavy-water reactors are considered a proliferation risk because they can produce plutonium, an alternative to enriched uranium for the core of a nuclear weapon.

It was censured by the International Atomic Energy Agency just before the war began and is the only state without nuclear weapons that enriches uranium to 60%, one technical step away from weapons-grade levels.Israel, which has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, is the only nuclear-armed power in the region. It has never officially confirmed or denied having nuclear weapons butits status has been an open secret for years.Several countries are preparing to evacuate their citizens from Iran and Israel, while flights to bring back tens of thousands of Israelis stranded outside the country get under way.

The report cited three anonymous officials.On Thursday, Trump responded to the report,posting on Truth Social: “The Wall Street Journal has No Idea what my thoughts are concerning Iran!”But Trump’s decision is dependent on whether the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) would destroy the Fordow uranium enrichment site, a US official toldAxios. Fordow, which is built into a mountain south of Tehran, is a target of Israel’s, but they lack the “bunker-buster bombs” and aircraft needed to destroy it; the US has access to both.Trump caution on Iran strike linked to doubts over ‘bunker buster’ bomb, officials sayRead more“We’re going to be ready to strikeIran. We’re not convinced yet that we’re necessary. And we want to be unnecessary, but I think the president’s just not convinced we are needed yet,” a US official told the outlet.Debate within Trump’s cabinet and Pentagon chiefs over the effectiveness of the GBU-57s, a 13.6-tonne (30,000lb) bomb, wasechoed in Guardian reporting, with Trump reportedly unconvinced of the bomb’s efficacy in destroying the complex and the possibility that direct US involvement could be forestalled by negotiations with Iran.According to two defense officials who were briefed, the thinking is that only a tactical nuclear weapon could be capable of destroying Fordow because of how deeply it is located.At a White House press call on Thursday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt delivered a message that, she said, came directly from the president, and is attributable to him.“Based on the fact there’s a substantial chance of negotiations, that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,” Leavitt said.A day earlier, on Wednesday, Trump told reporters: “I have ideas on what to do but I haven’t made a final – I like to make the final decision one second before it’s due.”He added, referring to direct involvement: “I may do it, I may not do it. The next week is going to be very big, maybe less than a week.”Iran’s mission to the UN issued a statement saying: “Iran does NOT negotiate under duress, shall NOT accept peace under duress, and certainly NOT with a has-been warmonger clinging to relevance.”Uncertainty around direct US involvement in the conflict comes as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called Trump “a great friend of Israel” and thanked him “for standing by us”.Israeli defence minister says he ordered attacks on Iran to ‘undermine regime’Read moreThe Pentagon has sent multiple warships to the Middle East, including three navy destroyers and two carrier strike groups, while the state department has ramped up assistance to US citizens advised to leave the region.Trump’s denial of the Journal’s report comes as a heated split in the Make America Great Again coalition over support for a strike on Iran appeared to be cooling.The former Fox primetime host Tucker Carlson and former White House political strategist Steve Bannon had expressed concern that another Middle East military engagement in Iran would run counter to Maga’s “America first” policies.Bannon said on Wednesday that Trump could win over Maga doubters if he made the case for Iran engagement directly to the American people. Trump also said that Carlson called him to apologize for saying that he “is complicit in an act of war”.‘Tucker’s a nice guy. He called and apologized the other day because he thought he said things that were a little bit too strong, and I appreciated that,” Trump said on Wednesday from the White House.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS national securityIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

But now, two wars and more than 55,000 people dead, the prime minister is carrying himself as a man of destiny.Increasingly confident of fundamentally redrawing the map of the Middle East, he toyed with the idea of regime change inIran– the leader of a 10 million-strong nation calling on a population almost 10 times bigger to overthrow the clerical regime that has ruled the country since the 1979 revolution.“People ask me – are we targeting the downfall of the regime?” Netanyahu said, talking to the press in a hospital compound strewn with broken glass. “That may be a result, but it’s up to the Iranian people to rise for their freedom. Freedom is never cheap. It’s never free. Freedom requires these subjugated people to rise up, and it’s up to them. But we may create conditions that will help them do it.”If Israeli bombs were to break down the pillars of the Islamic Republic, Netanyahu said it would represent the paying of millennia-old dues, dating back to the liberation of the Jews from captivity in Babylon, by the Cyrus of Persia, the legendary predecessor of the ayatollahs.“I want to tell you that 2,500 years ago, Cyrus the Great, the king of Persia, liberated the Jews. And today, a Jewish state is creating the means to liberate the Persian people,” he said.When Cyrus stormed ancient Babylon, it was by land invasion. There are fewer guarantees that an aerial bombing campaign – not an option for the ancients – can change another country’s leadership in the way favoured by the bombers.So far there are signs that even fervent opponents of the oppressive regime are rallying to its cause in the face of an outside threat. At worst, bombing campaigns can bring monsters to power, as the US bombing of Cambodia helped create the Khmer Rouge.On this occasion, Netanyahu had come to the southern city of Beersheba, on the edge of the Negev desert, to paint Iran’s leaders as monsters for the bombing of the Soroka hospital.“We’re targeting missile sites. They’re targeting a hospital,” he said. “They’re targeting civilians because they’re a criminal regime. They’re the arch-terrorists of the world.”An hour earlier, Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, had stood in the same spot, with the same charred building behind him, and made the same argument, telling Iran’s leaders: “Your crimes against humanity, your war crimes, won’t deter us.”Herzog left without taking questions, nor was Netanyahu challenged with questions over Israel’s relentless destruction of the hospitals and clinics of Gaza, where 2.2 million Palestinians remain trapped under siege conditions some have compared to medieval warfare.Aryeh Myers, a spokesperson for the Israeli Magen David Adom emergency services, argued that there was a critical distinction, pointing to Israeli claims of Hamas strongholds under Gaza’s medical facilities.“The main difference between this hospital is it is a totally civilian hospital,” Myers said, as he helped oversee the evacuation of patients to other hospitals in the region. “There are no tunnels underneath [Soroka] – it’s not housing terrorist headquarters. This hospital is for the civilians who live in the Negev region – whether they are Jewish residents, Muslim residents, whoever it is.“We’ve got a huge Bedouin community that live in this area who are served very much by this hospital. And the fact that this hospital was targeted is a horrendous state of affairs,” he said.International humanitarian law affords strong protections to hospitals, clinics, ambulances, and their staff, who are to be protected at all times. The bar for infringement is set very high.Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, argued that the Iranian missile had been aimed at a nearby Israeli military headquarters and claimed Soroka hospital only suffered “superficial” damage from the blast wave. There was no question the damaged hospital building had been hit directly, however, and the map Araghchi used to illustrate his online claims bore little relation to the actual downtown area of Beersheba.On the other hand, Netanyahu’s claims that he knew all of Israel’s military sites and there was no such site “for miles and miles around” also seemed open to interpretation.The prime minister has a reputation for creativity when it comes to spinning a narrative, especially in this mood, as he surveyed thousands of years of history. Ultimately, he suggested, final liberation for Jews and Persians could depend on another latter-day king far beyond these shores, whose evangelical supporters have also likened to Cyrus the Great.Netanyahu described Donald Trump as a saviour in waiting – “a tremendous friend, a tremendous world leader”, who he praised for “his resolve, his determination, and his clarity”. The message has been consistent for several days now: if Israel is to play the transformative role for the ages that Netanyahu has in mind, it is clearly going to need a lot of help.Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaIrannewsShareReuse this content"

Israel has been able to achieve superiority over Iran’s skies at extraordinary speed, within hours of launching its surprise assault. Its military claimed on Monday to have knocked out 120 Iranian air defence systems through a mixture of air and drone strikes – about a third of Tehran’s pre-war total.In response, Iran’s most effective weapon has been its stock of high-speed ballistic missiles, estimated at about 2,000 by Israel’s Defense Force (IDF) at the outset of hostilities last week. But the heavy targeting by Israel of launch sites in westernIran, in underground bases such as at Kermanshah – coupled with Israel’s grimly effective targeted killing of Iran’s top military commanders – have left Iran struggling to respond militarily and presenting a significant threat.Iran has so far launched more than 400 missiles at Israel, but half, about 200, were launched in the initial retaliatory barrages last Friday. Since Monday the size of its missile barrages has reduced to a maximum of 15 to 20 (including 15 on Thursday afternoon), compared with up to 40 during the weekend, according to a count compiled by a US thinktank, theInstitute for the Study of War. Iran’s ability to manufacture new weapons is also likely to be limited,estimated by the US to be 50 a monthbefore the hostilities broke out.The sheer speed of ballistic missiles makes them dangerous weapons and a number – about 10% – continue to evade Israel’s sophisticated air defences, including a strike on the Soroka Medical Center in the southern city of Beersheba on Thursday that wounded 76. But the munitions mostly do not appear to be effectively targeted at Israel’s military-industrial complex, aside from an attack on the refinery at Haifa in northern Israel on Sunday that led to the shutting down of the facilities there.Intercepting ballistic missiles is primarily the task of Israel’s newest air defence system, Arrow 3, which have a 1,500-mile range and can knock out incoming missiles beyond the Earth’s atmosphere, and its predecessor Arrow 2, though the US has been providing help with a Thaad system and destroyers based in the eastern Mediterranean. Neither Arrow system is cheap – the cost of an Arrow 3 interceptor has been put at $3.5m each, though other estimates suggest a figure of $2m and $1.5m for Arrow 2. The Israeli business newspaper Globes has suggested thatthe total cost to Israel of Arrow interceptorshas been $1bn to $1.5bn since October 2023.A key question, however, is how many interceptors does Israel’s military have available – worries compounded by a report in the Wall Street Journal, which cited an anonymous US official as saying that Israel was running low. Stock levels are kept secret and that Israel, well aware of the Iranian ballistic missile threat, is considered unlikely to have chosen to attack Iran without at least enough interceptors to match its assessment of the likely threat. Nevertheless, sophisticated defensive missiles take time to manufacture, a problem long revealed in Ukraine, where Russia continues to fire more missiles than Kyiv has available air defences.In less than a week, Israel has told allies that it is further ahead in its attack than it expected to be, having killed 21 out of 22 senior military figures in the first 24 hours, and 10 out of 12 nuclear scientists. The country’s jets face almost no air defence threat as they fly over western and central Iran – Israel has so far acknowledged the loss of one drone – meaning they are able to target sites in the country with apparent impunity. Even if Israeli stockpiles of attack missiles run down in the next week or two, and there is no US intervention, its air dominance means it can continue to attack at a slower rate.Iran’s capabilities have been “exposed as inefficient”, concluded the missile analyst Fabian Hinzin a paper for the International Institute of Strategic Studies, while the “Israeli leadership, at least for the time being, [is] accepting the risks of ballistic missile strikes on its population centres”. As Hinz puts it, the “deterrence balance” between the two countries is unravelling – and it may only change back in Tehran’s favour if a suddenly a greater number or higher proportion of its remaining ballistic missiles strike population centres or key sites in Israel. There is no sign of that yet.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelWeapons technologyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Such access is extraordinary for a Pakistani general.“Senior US officials often meet with Pakistani generals. But they don’t get entertained at the White House,” noted Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based south Asia analyst. “Ayub Khan and Zia ul-Haq were exceptions but they came as heads of state.”The shift in tone is stark. India has long positioned itself as the more reliable partner for the US as the world’s largest democracy, a bulwark against China, and a hub for expanding trade and intelligence-sharing. Pakistan, by contrast, has been dogged by accusations of sheltering terrorists and undermining civilian rule.Just a few years ago, Trump himself accused Pakistan of offering “nothing but lies and deceit”. Joe Biden later called it “one of the most dangerous nations in the world”.Indian officials continue to point to Pakistan’s links to major terror attacks, including on its parliament in 2001 and in Mumbai in 2008. Against that backdrop, Washington’s embrace of Munir strikes a jarring note in Delhi, where critics say the US is engaging with the same military establishment long accused of enabling cross-border militancy.Analysts say the pivot may be driven by more than just strategic cooperation. For Trump, it could be personal. “He has a thing for strongmen,” said one US analyst.“He sees something in Munir – the mystique, the military credentials, the aura of control. Trump responds to dominance, and Munir projects it.”That may help to explain why Munir was granted access usually reserved for heads of state. “He probably relished the opportunity to size Munir up,” Kugelman said. “Trump knows that in Pakistan it’s the army chief who really runs the show.”But Munir’s visit is taking place as the Middle East is in turmoil, with Israel striking Iranian targets and Iran firing missiles in retaliation. The US may be hoping that Pakistan, one of the few countries with diplomatic ties to Tehran, could play a role in de-escalation.There’s also a more delicate calculation, with Israel pushing the US to join its military campaign against Iran, which shares a 900km border with Pakistan. That geography puts Islamabad in a pivotal position. Some analysts believe the US may be probing whether Munir would allow surveillance flights or logistical cooperation.But Pakistan’s room for manoeuvre is limited, with public opinion strongly pro-Iran. “Even privately, Pakistan’s military would likely balk at the risks,” Kugelman said. “They can’t afford to be dragged into this. The backlash would be enormous.”For Indian officials, Munir’s reception has revived old memories of the US tendency to tilt towards Pakistan at critical junctures, such as in the cold war moments or post-9/11. But this time, analysts say, the reset may also involve commercial opportunity.Pakistan is actively courting US investment in two of the most volatile and potentially lucrative global commerce sectors: cryptocurrency and critical minerals.“The Trump-Munir meeting shouldn’t be seen only through the lens of the Israel-Iran war,” Kugelman said. “There’s been US-Pakistan engagement on crypto, minerals and counter-terrorism, and Trump takes a deep personal interest in all of these.”He added: “This is classic Trump: ‘What can you do for me? What can I get out of this?’”Explore more on these topicsPakistanUS foreign policyIndiaTrump administrationDonald TrumpSouth and central AsiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Those who tried to resist being “pushed back” were threatened at gunpoint by India’s border security force, according to several accounts.About 200 people have since been returned to India by Bangladeshi border guards after being found to be Indian citizens, with some forced to walk miles across treacherous terrain to get home.“Instead of following due legal procedure, India is pushing mainly Muslims and low-income communities from their own country to Bangladesh without any consent,” said Taskin Fahmina, senior researcher at Bangladesh human rights organisation Odhikar. “This push by India is against national and international law.”India enacts citizenship law criticised as ‘discriminatory’ to MuslimsRead moreBangladesh’s foreign ministry said it had written letters to the Indian authorities urging them to stop sending people over the border without consultation and vetting, as was previous official procedure, but they said those letters had gone unanswered.Among those deported and returned was Hazera Khatun, 62, a physically disabled grandmother. Khatun’s daughter Jorina Begum said they had documents to prove two generations of her mother’s family had been born in India. “How can she be a Bangladeshi?” said Begum.Khatun was picked up by police on 25 May and the next day was pushed into a van with 14 other Muslims who were then driven to the border with Bangladesh in the middle of the night. There, Khatun said officers from India’s Border Security Force (BSF) forced them to cross the border.View image in fullscreenHazera Khatun, 62, had to walk home through rivers and forests after being ‘pushed back’ from India to Bangladesh on 25 May.Photograph: Kazi Sharowar Hussain/Supplied“They treated us like animals,” said Khatun. “We protested that we are Indians, why should we enter Bangladesh? But they threatened us with guns and said, ‘We will shoot you if you don’t go to the other side.’ After we heard four gunshots from the Indian side, we got very scared and quickly walked across the border.”The group were taken into custody by Bangladesh’s border guards, and held in a makeshift camp in a field. However, Khatun said the authorities in Bangladesh would not allow the group to stay as their documents showed they were Indian citizens. They were driven a truck to the border and told to walk to India.“When we returned, it was terrible,” said Khatun. “We had to walk through forests and rivers … We were so scared, we thought if the BSF officers found us coming back, they would kill us. I was sure we were going to die.” Eventually she made it back to her village on 31 May. According to her family, she was covered in bruises and deeply traumatised.The escalating crackdown against so-called “illegal Bangladeshis” by the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government comes in the wake of an attack by Islamist militants in the Indian-administered region of Kashmir in April whichkilled 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, after which the BJP government vowed to expel “outsiders”.The mass detentions increased with the launch of Operation Sindhoor in May, when India launched strikes at neighbouring Muslim-majority Pakistan, which it blamed for the Kashmir militant attack and vowed to wipe out terror groups targeting India.Over its 11 years in power,the BJP government has been accusedby rights groups and citizens of persecuting, harassing and disenfranchising the country’s 200 million Muslims as part of its Hindu nationalist agenda, charges the government denies.View image in fullscreenPolice officers with men they believe to be undocumented Bangladeshi nationals after they were detained during raids in Ahmedabad, India, on 26 April.Photograph: Amit Dave/ReutersThe most widespread targeting and deporting of Muslims in recent weeks has been in the north-eastern state of Assam, as the BJP-run state government has escalated its long-running campaign against those it calls “infiltrators”. About 100 people who have been recently detained in the state are missing, according to activists.The expulsions were described by activists as a worrying escalation of along-running exercisein Assam to expel “illegal infiltrators”, in which Muslims are routinely called before “foreigners tribunals”, quasi-judicial courts, to prove they were born in India, or arrived before 1971. Acontroversial citizenship surveyalso took place in the state in 2019, resulting in thousands being put into detention centres.Only Muslims have to prove their citizenship after Hindus, Sikhs and other religions were made exempt from the exercise by the state government.This week, the hardline BJP chief minister of Assam, Himanta Sarma said it was now a policy of the state to automatically expel “illegal foreigners”. “This process will be intensified and expedited,” he said.Not all those deported who claim to be Indian citizens have been able to return. Among those still stuck in Bangladesh is 67-year-old Maleka Begam,67, from Assam, who was detained by police on 25 May.View image in fullscreenMaleka Begum, 67, at the home of a family in Bangladesh who gave her shelter after she was deported by the Indian police on 25 May.Photograph: Jakir Hosen/SuppliedSpeaking over the phone from a Bangladeshi border village in a state of distress, Begam – who is physically infirm and cannot walk unassisted – said she had been the only woman in a group of about 20 Muslims sent over to Bangladesh in the middle of the night on 27 May. She said they were ordered at gunpoint by the BSF to cross the border.Begam’s son Imran Ali said his mother had documentation to prove she was born in India, and that all seven of her siblings also had proof. “Her deportation to Bangladesh is completely illegal. However, I cannot understand now how we can bring her back from Bangladesh. She is old and sick. We are very anxious about her,” said Ali.Assam police and the BSF did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Hundreds of people, mostly Muslims, have also been deported from the capital, Delhi, as well as the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra. In Gujarat, the police claimed to have detainedmore than 6,500suspected “Bangladeshi citizens”, and thousands were paraded through the streets, but it was later declared that only 450 of them were found to be illegal. Last week, Bangladesh’s border guards turned backfour Muslim menpicked up by police in Mumbai and deported, after it was found they were Indian migrant workers from the state of West Bengal.Maj Gen Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Siddiqui, director general of Border Guard Bangladesh, condemned India’s pushback policy as “a deviation from humane governance”.“It contradicts international law and the dignity of the affected individuals,” said Siddiqui. “Acts such as abandoning people in forests, forcing women and children into rivers, or dumping stateless refugees at sea are not consistent with human rights principles.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentIndiaBangladeshSouth and central AsiaIslamRaceMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The public have been urged not to use disposable barbecues in open countryside, parks and moorland areas, and not to discard cigarettes, matches or glass bottles, as they can ignite dry vegetation.Phil Garrigan, the chair of the NFCC, said that fire and rescue services were already under “significant pressure” due to the high number of wildfires, and that “one small error” could lead to a blaze.“We are deeply concerned about the escalating threat of wildfires this summer, which have the potential to become more frequent, intense and dangerous particularly in areas where communities border the countryside,” said Garrigan.“We all need to play our part in protecting each other, our environment and our homes and businesses. We want everyone to enjoy the nice weather, we are just asking that they take extra care when out and about because it only takes one small error to lead to a significant wildfire.”Amber heat alertswere issued in England on Thursday as the UK experienced its hottest day of the year so far, with 32.2C recorded at Kew in west London.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said this week there could be “a rise in deaths” across all nine English regions due to the heatwave, with “those aged 65 and over or people with health conditions” particularly at risk.The UKHSA said “significant impacts” were also likely across health and social care services in England. The alerts came into force at midday on Thursday and were expected to remain until 9am on Monday.The Met Office said this week that the UK could exceed temperatures of 40C in the near future,and highs of 45C “may be possible”in the current climate.This would smash the record of 40.3C recorded in Coningsby, Lincolnshire, in 2022. A report by the Office for National Statistics and the UKHSA found there were 3,000 more deaths in England and Wales that summer than would normally be expected.In the first four months of this year there weremore than double the number of rural blazesthan in the months that preceded the 2022 heatwave, with the risk to people, wildlife and habitats described as “catastrophic”.The dangerous 32C heat that may be endured by people in the south-east of England this Saturday will have been made 100 times more likely by the climate crisis, scientists have calculated.Global heating, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, is making every heatwave more likely and more intense. The 32C day expected on Saturday would have been expected only once every 2,500 years without the climate crisis, the researchers said, and June heatwaves are now about 2-4C hotter than in the past.The heatwave is the latest in a series of recent extreme weather events in the country. Between February and April, England had its driest period on record, with the north-westdeclaring a drought in MayandYorkshire entering one last week.In order to avoid any negative effects from the weather, the UKHSA recommends people keep out of the sun between 11am and 3pm on the hottest days if possible, drink plenty of liquids and wear sunscreen and protective clothing when outside.It also recommends looking out for people aged 65 and over, as they are especially affected by the heat.Explore more on these topicsWildfiresUK weatherClimate crisisExtreme heatnewsShareReuse this content"

The real and ongoing distress was palpable.“I absolutely understand the need to address the ever-increasing welfare bill in these difficult economic times, but I have always believed this could and should be done by supporting more disabled people into work.“I do not believe that cuts to personal independence payment [Pip] and the health element of universal credit should be part of the solution.”Government officials brace for up to 50 Labour MPs rebelling against welfare billRead moreFoxcroft, 48, who is among a number of frontbenchers uncomfortable with the proposed changes, said she had wrestled with whether to fight the changes from within the government.“Sadly it is now seems that we are not going to get the changes I desperately wanted to see. I therefore tender my resignation as I know I will not be able to do the job that is required of me and whip – or indeed vote – for reforms which include cuts to disabled people’s finances,” she said.“I am incredibly proud to have served as part of the firstLabourgovernment in 14 years and hope that ministers will revisit these reforms so that I can continue to support the government in delivering for the people of this country.”Responding to Foxcroft’s decision to resign as a whip, a government spokesperson said: “This Labour government was elected to deliver change. The broken welfare system we inherited is failing the sick and most vulnerable and holding too many young people back. It is fair and responsible to fix it.“Our principled reforms will ensure those who can work should, that those who want to work are properly supported, and that those with most severe disabilities and health conditions are protected.”The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, plans to save £5bn a year by overhauling the welfare system, including by cutting eligibility for Pip.Claimants only able to wash half of their body or who are unable to cook a meal for themselves will no longer be able to claim Pip unless they have another limiting condition.The welfare reform bill, published on Wednesday, confirmed it would lead to benefit cuts for 950,000 people by 2030. Kendall said the country’s £326bn social security netmight cease to exist if costs continued to escalate.Under the terms of the bill, people losing their disability benefits will get additional financial support for 13 weeks, while those with severe conditions such as heart disease or spinal injuries will not have to face reassessments.Kendall has set out a separate £1bn plan to help unemployed people get back to work, but this is not related to Pip, as these payments are unconnected to employment status.At least 42 MPs have publicly said they will not support the bill, expected to be put to a vote on 1 July. But about 170 are believed to have signed private letters to whips expressing significant concern about the changes.Explore more on these topicsWelfareLabourBenefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

The study defined high risk as a one in 30 chance of flooding each year.The DfE summary, based on Met Office and University College London analysis, also said that even temperatures below extreme levels could result in “decreased ability to learn over the course of a typical academic year”.The summary said: “In the longer term, without the implementation of any adaptation measures, students could potentially lose up to 12 days of learning per year on average, as [the] result of generally warmer temperatures and not just from extreme heat.“It’s important to recognise that these are averages based on emerging evidence, giving only an indicative indication at this stage.”Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said an immediate priority should be given to rebuilding and refurbishing classrooms and buildings that were not designed to cope with extreme weather.He said: “Children feeling too hot or too cold in the classroom, or learning in buildings which aren’t equipped to handle drastic weather changes, may be exposed to serious health and safety risks, as well as struggling to focus on their learning.“Sustaining a safe and nurturing school environment is very difficult without a stable climate. Action and investment is needed by governments both to tackle climate change and support schools to prevent and mitigate the impact of extreme heat and flooding, for example through investment in things like solar panels, improved ventilation and insulation, and measures to ensure buildings are watertight.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As part of our plan for change, our 10-year infrastructure strategy includes almost £20bn to 2034-35 to rebuild more schools across England – with 250 further schools announced for the school rebuilding programme this week on top of more than 500 already selected. They will be schools for the future, net zero carbon in operation and designed to withstand future climate risks.”Explore more on these topicsSchoolsClimate crisisSchool fundingDepartment for EducationEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This is because the UK has already burned through most of the gas in thedeclining basin.Tessa Khan, the executive director of Uplift, said: “This Labour government needs to do the right thing and stand up to the oil and gas firms that have got obscenely rich while millions of people in the UK have struggled, and stop their endless polluting. All eyes are now on the government to see if this guidance provides a credible climate test.”The oil and gas industry has argued that the supreme court ruling is unfair because they cannot reduce their emissions in the same way as car companies, which can make their vehicles more efficient. Companies also argue that gas will continue to be a part of the UK energy mix for decades to come, regardless of how much is produced in the UK.Thirteen more oil and gas licences could be cancelled after Rosebank court rulingRead moreIn its submission to the government before the consultation, Offshore Energies UK, which represents the North Sea oil and gas companies, said the current draft guidance did not take into account the “relatively unusual nature of oil and gas projects”.If Equinor and Shell do reapply, Miliband could have to play a quasi-judicial role in deciding whether to grant permission to begin drilling. The Labour manifesto rules out granting new licences for new fields, but ministers say that does not apply to Rosebank and Jackdaw, which already have their licences and are now awaiting environmental consent to begin drilling.Government sources say the Treasury is pushing hard to allow the new developments as it focuses the government’s economic policy on growth. But many Labour MPs want Miliband to rule them out if there is a risk they could lead to the UK breaking its climate commitments.Labour is under pressure from the Conservatives and Reform to drop its net zero target altogether. Milibandsaid this weekthat he and other green energy enthusiasts would “win [the] fight” against climate sceptics.A Shell spokesperson said: “We are reviewing today’s guidance and remain committed to delivering Jackdaw, which is a nationally important energy project and supports the government’s growth agenda.“Jackdaw would provide enough fuel to heat 1.4m UK homes at a time when the UK remains reliant on imported gas to meet its energy needs.”Equinor said: “We are currently reviewing today’s announcement. We remain committed to working closely with all relevant stakeholders to advance the Rosebank project.“We welcome clarity and can confirm that we will submit a downstream end user combustion emissions (‘Scope 3’) assessment in full compliance with the government’s new environmental guidance.”Explore more on these topicsOilFossil fuelsEnergyGreen politicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The fact that we’re not competitive with it, with Europe, is the challenge.”For smaller manufacturers, ministers will consult on a new “intensity threshold” to provide relief.

Tonight’s game will be played as scheduled.”But Ice said in a response to the Dodgers tweet that its agents “were never there”, and Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the DHS, said in a statement that “this had nothing to do with the Dodgers. CBP vehicles were in the stadium parking lot very briefly, unrelated to any operation or enforcement.”The back and forth only added to anxiety in a city left on edge by frequent and brazen immigration enforcement actions.The homeland security presence came as immigrant communities in LA are on high alert as federal agents have raided workplaces, parking lots and a swap-meet in search of undocumented immigrants.Since the department stepped up enforcement in the region, there have been persistent rumors that the stadium of the Dodgers, a team which has a large Latino fanbase, may be a target.On Thursday, several local journalists had spotted dozens of DHS vehicles, with masked officers, near Dodger Stadium. The agents refused to tell aLos Angeles Timesreporter why they were there.A source told the newspaper that federal agents met near the stadium for a briefing but departed when photos of their meeting started to spread on social media.Kevin Takumi, a videographer and photographer for Fox’sLos Angelesaffiliate, posted aerial video on X showing several vans and SUVs, and apparent immigration officers, around entrances to the stadium.“Ice agents are taking up positions at the entrances to Dodger Stadium, media and crowd beginning to arrive,” Takumiwrote.Jack Harris, the Dodgers beat writer for the Los Angeles Times,saidon X: “Regarding the photos going around on social media this morning about ICE agents at Dodger Stadium: sources say Ice agents tried to access Dodger Stadium today, but were denied entry to the grounds by the team.”Another journalist, Fabian Ardaya, who covers the Dodgers for the Athletic,wrote: “Ice agents attempted to access Dodger Stadium this morning but were denied by the Dodgers. Images had circulated this morning of agents appearing to use the parking lots as a staging area.”Protesters arrived at Dodger Stadium soon after. Police formed a line in front of one of the stadium’s entrances, LAistreported.Television cameras showed that about four agents remained at the lot on Thursday afternoon, while officers with the Los Angeles police department stood between them and dozens of protesters, some carrying signs that read “I Like My Ice Crushed” and chanting “Ice out of LA!”Eunisses Hernandez, an LA city council member, said she had been in communication with Dodgers officials and the mayor’s office.“We’ve been in communication with the mayor’s office, with the Dodgers, with Dodgers security, about seeing if they can get them moved off their private property,” she told KABC-TV.“Public property is different. Private property – businesses and corporations have the power to say, ‘Not on my property’. And so we’re waiting to see that movement happen here.”The Dodgers and San Diego Padres are playing in Los Angeles on Thursday evening at 7.10pm local time. There will also be a celebrity softball game to celebrate Black Heritage Night, CNNsaid.The Dodgers have come under fire in recent weeks from part of its fanbase for not speaking up for LA’s immigrant community amid the raids.On Saturday, singer Vanessa Hernández sang the US national anthem in Spanish, as a protest against the immigration raids. Hernández, who performs under the stage name Nezza,saidthe Dodgers told her to sing in English.The team said it will announce its plans for helping immigrant communities harmed by recent raids later this week.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesLos Angeles Ice protestsUS immigrationLos Angeles DodgersMLBUS sportsBaseballnewsShareReuse this content"

Mojica, a father of four born in LA,came forward last week to the Guardian, which published footage of his arrest by a group of officers.Mojica, who strongly rejected the charges, was facing eight years in federal prison over the 7 June arrest, which left himinjured.“I feel a huge relief,” Mojica said on Thursday. He had spent two nights in jail and has been forced to wear an ankle monitor for nearly two weeks.“They knew they were in the wrong and they didn’t want to face the court. The truth is always going to come out in the end.”Mojica was one of nine people arrested and charged with federal crimes in a first round of charges that the Trump administration highlighted as evidence of violence by protesters.On Wednesday, US prosecutors also moved to dismiss the charges against a second protester who was arrested at the same time as Mojica and who was seen on footage being shoved by a federal agent.Civil rights advocates and defense attorneys who analyzed the Department of Justice’s criminal complaints and footage of the incidents have scrutinized the prosecutions, arguing that in some cases authorities were misrepresenting events, going after people who were themselves injured by officers and criminalizing free speech.The US attorney’s office and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday about the dismissal of charges.After hearing reports of Ice indiscriminately targeting workers and neighbors in his predominantly Latino community, Mojica said he went to the demonstration in Paramount, in southern LA county near his home. He had not participated in protests since marching with his father as a child, but after seeing how Ice caused widespread fear and panic in the region, and as a US citizen, he wanted to support the rally.Mojica, who works at warehouses in the region unloading shipping containers, said the situation escalated when increasing numbers of heavily armed agents arrived.Grainy cellphone footage, including video taken by his spouse, captured the moment when he was arrested in a chaotic scuffle. While some demonstrators shouted at officers, one agent was seen forcefully shoving a protester standing near Mojica. The videos did not clearly show what happened next, but Mojica said he was trying to de-escalate the situation and stop the protester who was shoved from retaliating. A crowd of officers then quickly took them both to the ground.“I thought I was going to die at that moment and never get up from the ground and see my kids again,” Mojica said last week. “I couldn’t breathe.”He said officers held him in a chokehold and pushed him into the pavement, causing a large contusion on his nose and bruises all over his body – some of which were visible four days later.At one point during his arrest and transport, an officer told him he could be facing 20 years in prison, he recalled.Mojica, who had no criminal record, was charged alongside three other co-defendants he said he didn’t know. A criminal affidavit included few details about Mojica but alleged he “elbowed and pushed” border patrol agents and “physically made an attempt to thwart [the other protester’s] arrest”.Prosecutors’ two-page filing to dismiss Mojica’s case provided no details on the decision, but said the request was “made in good faith and in the interest of justice”. A judge still has to sign the order.“Based on the video, I knew my client did nothing wrong,” Meghan Blanco, Mojica’s attorney and a former federal prosecutor, said on Thursday.“There was no scenario that I could see this case moving forward in a manner that would have been helpful to the government. Once they had an opportunity to look at the video themselves, I think they very quickly came to the same conclusion.”Blanco, who previously prosecuted use-of-force cases against federal agents, said Mojica’s case was not unique.“I’m hopeful this is just the first of many [dismissals] for protesters who were charged with violating the law simply based on the fact that they were protesting and exercising their constitutional rights, not because they were being violent or doing anything illegal,” Blanco said.The impacts of the prosecution have been significant, she noted. Essayli, the US attorney, earlier posted Mojica’s photo and name on X, formerly Twitter, announcing his arrest and saying the government would “continue to arrest anyone who interferes with federal law enforcement”. The post led to widespread comments calling for Mojica, a US citizen, to be deported.Mojica said he had been suffering flashbacks from his arrest and was still struggling with pain in his back and ribs from his injuries, in addition to having difficulty sleeping.“I want people to know they are not alone, there are a lot of people on our side, and they know how the officers treat people,” he said.“And if people know they are innocent, they should keep fighting and don’t be intimidated.”Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles Ice protestsLos AngelesCaliforniaUS policingnewsShareReuse this content"

Many Democratic lawmakers in recent weeks have either been turned away, arrested or manhandled by law enforcement officers at the facilities, leading to public condemnation towards Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (Ice) handling of such visits.Lawmakers are allowed to access DHS facilities “used to detain or otherwise house aliens” for inspections and are not required “to provide prior notice of the intent to enter a facility”,according tothe 2024 Federal Appropriations Act.Previous language surrounding lawmaker visits to such facilities said that “Ice will comply with the law and accommodate members seeking to visit/tour an Ice detention facility for the purpose of conducting oversight,” CNNreported.However, in the new guidance, the DHS updated the language to say that Ice “will make every effort to comply with the law” but “exigent circumstances (eg operational conditions, security posture, etc) may impact the time of entry into the facility”.The new guidance also attempts to distinguish Ice field offices from Ice detention facilities, noting that since “Ice field offices are not detention facilities” they do not fall under the visitation requirements laid out in the Appropriations Act.The Guardian has contacted Ice for comment.New York mayoral candidate arrested by Ice: ‘Trump is looking to stoke conflict, weaponize fear’Read moreIn response to the updated guidance, Mississippi’s Democratic representative and the ranking member of the House committee on homeland security, Bennie Thompson, condemned what he called the attempt by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, to “block oversight on Ice”.“Kristi Noem’s new policy to block congressional oversight of Ice facilities is not only unprecedented, it is an affront to the constitution and federal law. Noem is now not only attempting to restrict when members can visit, but completely blocking access to Ice field offices – even if members schedule visits in advance,” Thompsonsaid.“This unlawful policy is a smokescreen to deny member visits to Ice offices across the country, which are holding migrants – and sometimes even US citizens – for days at a time. They are therefore detention facilities and are subject to oversight and inspection at any time. DHS pretending otherwise is simply their latest lie.”Last month, the New Jersey representative LaMonica McIver waschargedwith assaulting federal agents during a visit to a detention facility in Newark alongside two Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation. McIvercalledthe charges against her “purely political … and are meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight”.New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy, also condemned the charges, saying it was “outrageous for a congresswoman to be criminally charged for exercising her lawful duty to visit a detention site in her own district”.On the day of McIver’s visit, law enforcement alsoarrestedthe mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, who they charged with trespassing as he attempted to join McIver’s delegation visit. The charges against Baraka were later dropped and Baraka has sincefiled a lawsuitagainst the state’s top federal prosecutor over his arrest.Bonnie Watson Coleman, another New Jersey representative who was part of McIver’s visit, rejected the DHS’s claims that the lawmakers assaulted law enforcement officers.“The idea that I could ‘body-slam’ anyone, let alone an Ice agent, is absurd,” the 80-year-old representativesaidon X last month, adding: “We have an obligation to perform oversight at facilities paid for with taxpayer dollars.”Earlier this month, law enforcement officers forced the California senator Alex Padilla on to the ground as he attempted to ask a question to Noem during a press conference in Los Angeles.Despite repeatedly identifying himself, Padilla washandcuffedand forced into the hallway before law enforcement officers shoved the two-term US senator chest-first on to the floor. Following the incident, which triggered widespreadoutrageacross both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, Noem said she did not recognize the two-term senator and claimed that he did not request a meeting with her. The two then reportedly met for 15 minutes after the incident.On Tuesday, the Illinois representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi and Jonathan Jackson were denied entry during their attempted visit to an Ice facility in Chicago.That same day, the New York City comptroller and mayoral candidate, Brad Lander, was forcibly arrested by multiple federal agents and detained for hours as he tried to accompany a Spanish-speaking immigrant out of a courtroom. The DHS claimed Lander “was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer”, an accusation Lander denies.Following his release, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul,calledhis arrest “bullshit” and said that the charges against Lander had been dropped.A day later, the New York representatives Dan Goldman and Jerry Nadler were refused entry into Ice detention facilities in Manhattan’s 26 Federal Plaza, despite requesting a visit in advance via letter, the Cityreports.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsDemocratsUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

At least 16 people have been hospitalized.FreshRealm, a large food producer with sites in California, Georgia and Indiana, is recalling products made before 17 June. The recall includes these products, which were sold in the refrigerated sections of retail stores:32.8oz trays of Marketside Grilled Chicken Alfredo with Fettuccine Tender Pasta with Creamy Alfredo Sauce, White Meat Chicken and Shaved Parmesan Cheese with best-by dates of 27 June or earlier.12.3oz trays of Marketside Grilled Chicken Alfredo with Fettuccine Tender Pasta with Creamy Alfredo Sauce, White Meat Chicken, Broccoli and Shaved Parmesan Cheese with best-by dates of 26 June or earlier.12.5oz trays of Home Chef Heat & Eat Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo with Pasta, Grilled White Meat Chicken and Parmesan Cheese, with best-by dates of 19 June or earlier.At least 10 people sickened in US listeria outbreak linked to prepared foodsRead moreThe strain of listeria bacteria that made people sick was found in a sample of chicken fettuccine Alfredo during a routine inspection in March, US agriculture department officials said. That product was destroyed and never sent to stores.Officials said they have not identified the specific source of the contamination. Cases have been identified through retail shopper records and interviews with sick people.The listeria strain tied to the outbreak has been detected in people who fell ill between 24 July and 10 May, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported. The deaths were in Illinois, Michigan and Texas. Cases have been reported in Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.The number of sick people is probably higher than now known and cases may be detected in additional states. Officials are continuing to receive reports of illnesses linked to the product and “are concerned that contamination is still occurring”, the CDC said.Consumers should not eat the products, which may be in their refrigerators or freezers. They should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.Listeria infections can cause serious illness, particularly in older adults, people with weakened immune systems and those who are pregnant or their newborns. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.About 1,600 people get sick each year from listeria infections and about 260 die, the CDC said. Federal officials in December said they were revamping protocols to prevent listeria infections after several high-profile outbreaks, including one linked toBoar’s Head deli meatsthat led to 10 deaths and more than 60 illnesses last year.Explore more on these topicsUS newsFood safetyWalmartFoodHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Even in developed countries, only about half of people fly each year andabout 1% of the world’s populationis responsible for more than half of the aviation emissions.Several countries are considering putting a charge on tickets that wouldraise money to help tackle the climate crisis, particularly for poor countries.Analysis by the Dutch environmental consultancy CE Delft, commissioned by the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force, has shown that a levy on tickets that began at €10 on short-haul flights in economy, including domestic flights, rising to €30 on long-haul flights, and €20 for short-haul business-class tickets, rising to €120 for long-haul, would produce revenues of about €106bn a year.If the levy was based on fuel consumption instead of ticket sales, it could raise about €84bn a year, but could be subject to airlines trying to circumvent the system by changing their routes.A levy would have broad public support in many regions, as polling by Oxfam and Greenpeace has found about three-quarters of people in 13 countries thought wealthy air passengers should pay more tax.Countries could also adjust the levy to fall more heavily on the rich and frequent flyers. Private jets could be subject to a separate scheme.France, Kenya and Barbados are leading calls for a flight levy, and forother potential means of raising the fundsneeded to tackle the climate crisis in developing countries, such as taxes on shipping and fossil fuels. These are known collectively as global solidarity levies, and the charge on aviation is seen as one of the easiest to implement.Laurence Tubiana, the co-chair of the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force secretariat, set up by the three countries, said: “New levies on first- and business-class tickets or private jets can raise vital funds for everything from health to trains, and climate to development. People around the world pay a lot of tax on petrol for their car, while commercial airlines and private jets often pay no or low tax on their fuel.“We can redress the balance with a modest extra contribution from those with the greatest means, without raising prices for the vast majority who work hard all year to enjoy an occasional holiday.”Governments are meeting in Bonn this week and next to discuss the Cop30 climate summit, which will take place in Brazil this November. Campaigners are concerned that too little attention is being given to climate finance, by which rich countries are supposed to help their poorer counterparts to cope with the impacts of extreme weather.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Of this, at least $300bn is supposed to come directly from rich countries, with the rest from a variety of sources, including global solidarity levies, the private sector and carbon trading.Many civil society groups are calling for fossil fuel companies to pay for the damage they have caused. TheOxfam and Greenpeace surveyfound about eight in 10 people would support such a move, in a poll carried out in Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, India, Kenya, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa, Spain, the UK and the US.Chiara Liguori, a senior policy adviser at Oxfam, said: “Rich polluters are continuing to cash in on climate devastation, and their profiteering is destroying the lives of millions of people who have done the least to cause the escalating climate crisis.“Fairer taxes on polluting industries around the world could help avoid more deaths, providing immediate and significant support to climate-vulnerable countries, and finally incentivise investment in a fast, fair transition to renewables.”Explore more on these topicsAirline emissionsClimate financeClimate crisisFossil fuelsEnergyAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The crowd at Mercedes-Benz Stadium was chanting “Messi!” Messi! Messi!” before his left-footed blast cleared the Porto wall and ripped the net in the top right corner in the 54th minute.Each team netted their first goals of the tournament after Miami tied Al Ahly 0-0 on Saturday and Porto suffered the same result against Palmeiras on Sunday.After VAR review confirmation, it was determined that Miami’s Noah Allen committed a tripping penalty in the box against Joao Mario, leading to Aghehowa’s penalty goal that was deflected by goalkeeper Oscar Ustari and in for the game’s first goal in the eighth minute.Aghehowa, 21, had 19 goals in 30 Primeira Liga matches for the Portuguese side this past season.Miami knotted the score at one less than 90 seconds into the second half, as Weigandt’s cross into the center of the box was finished by Segovia, who fired in the equalizing goal past a sprawling Ramos.Miami then continued its great start to the second half, as Porto’s Rodrigo Mora’s foul led to Messi’s successful free kick – perfectly placed in the top right corner.Inter Miami returns to South Florida on Monday, knowing a victory over Brazilian club Palmeiras at Hard Rock Stadium will lock up its spot in the Round of 16.

Barrios met it in stride and hit a first-time, right-footed shot that rattled the underside of the crossbar on its way in.Barrios’ second in the 55th minute was simpler, as he was permitted time and space to hit a half-volley past goalkeeper Stefan Frei after Seattle’s failure to clear Marcos Llorente’s long throw from the right.Before half-time, Atlético had an apparent chance to double their lead from the penalty spot taken away after referee Yael Falcon Perez reversed his initial decision after a video review.The sides then traded goals in the first five minutes of the second half. In the 47th, Witsel headed home from inside the 6-yard box in the resulting scramble after Frei pushed Llorente’s initial half-volley on to the crossbar.

Tonight’s game will be played as scheduled.”But Ice said in a response to the Dodgers tweet that its agents “were never there”, and Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the DHS, said in a statement that “this had nothing to do with the Dodgers. CBP vehicles were in the stadium parking lot very briefly, unrelated to any operation or enforcement.”The back and forth only added to anxiety in a city left on edge by frequent and brazen immigration enforcement actions.The homeland security presence came as immigrant communities in LA are on high alert as federal agents have raided workplaces, parking lots and a swap-meet in search of undocumented immigrants.Since the department stepped up enforcement in the region, there have been persistent rumors that the stadium of the Dodgers, a team which has a large Latino fanbase, may be a target.On Thursday, several local journalists had spotted dozens of DHS vehicles, with masked officers, near Dodger Stadium. The agents refused to tell aLos Angeles Timesreporter why they were there.A source told the newspaper that federal agents met near the stadium for a briefing but departed when photos of their meeting started to spread on social media.Kevin Takumi, a videographer and photographer for Fox’sLos Angelesaffiliate, posted aerial video on X showing several vans and SUVs, and apparent immigration officers, around entrances to the stadium.“Ice agents are taking up positions at the entrances to Dodger Stadium, media and crowd beginning to arrive,” Takumiwrote.Jack Harris, the Dodgers beat writer for the Los Angeles Times,saidon X: “Regarding the photos going around on social media this morning about ICE agents at Dodger Stadium: sources say Ice agents tried to access Dodger Stadium today, but were denied entry to the grounds by the team.”Another journalist, Fabian Ardaya, who covers the Dodgers for the Athletic,wrote: “Ice agents attempted to access Dodger Stadium this morning but were denied by the Dodgers. Images had circulated this morning of agents appearing to use the parking lots as a staging area.”Protesters arrived at Dodger Stadium soon after. Police formed a line in front of one of the stadium’s entrances, LAistreported.Television cameras showed that about four agents remained at the lot on Thursday afternoon, while officers with the Los Angeles police department stood between them and dozens of protesters, some carrying signs that read “I Like My Ice Crushed” and chanting “Ice out of LA!”Eunisses Hernandez, an LA city council member, said she had been in communication with Dodgers officials and the mayor’s office.“We’ve been in communication with the mayor’s office, with the Dodgers, with Dodgers security, about seeing if they can get them moved off their private property,” she told KABC-TV.“Public property is different. Private property – businesses and corporations have the power to say, ‘Not on my property’. And so we’re waiting to see that movement happen here.”The Dodgers and San Diego Padres are playing in Los Angeles on Thursday evening at 7.10pm local time. There will also be a celebrity softball game to celebrate Black Heritage Night, CNNsaid.The Dodgers have come under fire in recent weeks from part of its fanbase for not speaking up for LA’s immigrant community amid the raids.On Saturday, singer Vanessa Hernández sang the US national anthem in Spanish, as a protest against the immigration raids. Hernández, who performs under the stage name Nezza,saidthe Dodgers told her to sing in English.The team said it will announce its plans for helping immigrant communities harmed by recent raids later this week.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesLos Angeles Ice protestsUS immigrationLos Angeles DodgersMLBUS sportsBaseballnewsShareReuse this content"

He talked about the need to restore enthusiasm to anAzzurriside whose morale has been dented by recent setbacks, as well as that sense of shared purpose that bonded him to teammates in the World Cup-winning side of 2006.The word he kept coming back to was “family”, insisting: “That’s the most important thing, more than tactics or formations.” His is not a vision of paternalistic authority but of a group close enough to speak hard truths to each other’s faces.‘A symbol of Italian football’: Azzurri appoint Gennaro Gattuso as head coachRead more“In moments of difficulty, when you feel alone and don’t hear the voice of your teammate, those are the 90 minutes that feel never-ending,” said Gattuso. “This is what we need to change. We need to help each other, we need to say those things that maybe you don’t want to hear, because that’s the only way you grow.”They will have no shortage of material. Italy’s men’s team are at an all-time low. Havingfailed to qualifyfor consecutive World Cups, their attempts to reach next summer’s tournament are in jeopardy aftera 3-0 thrashing by Norwayin their opening game of Group I.That result led the Italian football federation (FIGC) to sack Luciano Spalletti as manager, though he persuaded them to allow him one more game. The idea was to leave on a more positive note, and perhaps that was achieved in a2-0 win over Moldova, though the pre-game conference at which he in effect confirmed his own termination made for an awkward occasion.How had it come to this? Spalletti’s Italy were a disappointment at the Euros last summer, putting up a feeble defence of their 2021 triumph as they scraped out of their group witha 98th-minute equaliser against Croatiabeforelosing meekly to Switzerland.The manager had been dealt a tough hand, replacing Roberto Mancini midway through qualifying. It was easy to argue he deserved time to implement his vision after steering Napoli to their first Serie A title in 33 years. But what was the point in continuing, if the federation’s faith in him was always this fragile?Gattuso’s appointment raises more questions about their approach. The FIGC’s president, Gabriele Gravina, confirmed on Thursday that they had approached Claudio Ranieri first. That would have been a popular choice – a man with a reputation for rescuing teams in times of emergency, fresh fromone last miraclewith his boyhood team, Roma.But Ranieri already has a new job, moving upstairs as a senior adviser for theGiallorossi. As he explained it this week: “I respect the national team, but I belong to Roma.” Gravina sought to portray it not as a rejection but merely a respectful conversation with the club’s ownership.Whatever the truths of that story, it is a hard pivot from Ranieri –who made Leicester championsand has written countless brilliant chapters in his almost 40 years of management – to Gattuso, who has not yet left such a mark on any of the nine clubs he has led since 2013.View image in fullscreenGennaro Gattuso during his official presentation.Photograph: Fabio Frustaci/EPAThere are always different ways to tell a story.

For Italy to miss a third consecutive World Cup ought to be unthinkable, but the lopsided nature of their defeat by Norway, who have played two more games and won both, means even a perfect record from here on may only land them back into the playoffs from which they have failed to progress in each of the past two cycles.If the goal were only to make Italy a family again, Gattuso would have every chance of success. His presence at the podium alongside Buffon felt like a homecoming, albeit an understated one, the heroes of 2006 given their opportunity to lead. Journalists prefaced questions not with deferential honorifics but instead a familiar “ciao Rino”.In the end, though, the requirements of this job remain the same as they always were. Gattuso needs to win, starting with his first game, at home to Estonia in September. This family is sick of losing. He will hear hard truths soon enough, and from more people than he may care to, if he cannot make it stop.Explore more on these topicsItalyWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mudryk is facing a four-year ban if he is found guilty by the FA of taking a banned substance.Maresca said he still trusts the Ukraine international and plans to check on his welfare soon, but Chelsea’s head coach added that he has had no contact with the 24-year-old since May. “I spoke with Misha in Poland when we played the Conference League final,” he said. “I didn’t speak with him since that time.Chelsea make Gittens top target and keep Kudus and João Pedro in sightsRead more“To be honest, I didn’t see the news. They communicated to me last night.“The last time I spoke with Misha he was quite good. I didn’t see him worried or at least I didn’t see him not good. Since that day I didn’t speak with him, so I don’t know how he is now. But for sure in the next days and weeks we are going to have direct contact with him.”Mudryk has not played since November and wasprovisionally suspended the following monthafter producing a positive A sample. It is believed the banned performance-enhancing substance meldonium was found in his system.“Misha is a Chelsea player,” Maresca said. “Until he’s not a Chelsea player, I will trust all the Chelsea players. It’s not just about Misha. It is in general.”Maresca said Chelsea would sign a winger regardless of the outcome of Mudryk’s case. They are keen on Borussia Dortmund’s Jamie Gittens and have made an inquiry for Lyon’s Malick Fofana.“We had already one entire season almost without Misha,” Maresca said. “We’re going to decide to go for a winger not because of Misha. It’s something quite clear that it’s a position that we need to improve.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Blitzer’s Danish club, Brøndby, have qualified for the Conference League.Johnson is considered the most viable option of the three bids, with his status as a former US ­ambassador to the UK from 2017-2021 and the heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune making it likely he would pass the Premier League’s owners’ and directors’ test without any difficulty.According to a source close to Textor, the other interested parties are a consortium that includes the NBA star Jimmy Butler and another private investor from the US.The offer from Johnson also has the backing of Parish, who was spotted with the 78-year-old friend of Donald Trump at Palace’s game against Nottingham Forest at Selhurst Park last month. Palace are understood to remain confident they will be cleared to participate in the Europa League, although Forest could appeal to the court of arbitration for sport after they wrote to Uefa last week raising concerns about a potential breach of multi-club ownership rules by Palace. Forest, whose owner, Evangelos Marinakis, is close to Textor, would stand to be promoted from the Conference League if Palace are banned by Uefa.It was reported on Sundaythat Textor had listed his holding company Eagle Football – which also owns the Brazilian side Botafogo and the rebranded Belgian team Daring Brussels (formerly RWD Molenbeek) – for an initial public offering in the US, with a draft registration statement having been sent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Neither the volume nor prices of the shares to be listed has been revealed but it is expected to go public in September. Textor has previously held talks over investing in Watford.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It remains to be seen how much Palace are willing to accept with Chelsea including a significant sell-on clause in his contract when he left in 2021.

Like Groucho Marx, the world’s most daily football email has its principles and if you don’t like them … well, we have other ones. Those familiar with its work will be aware that Fifa is no different, but has still come as something of a surprise that having for so long publicly (if a little hollowly) purported to be against injustice of any kind, world football’s governing body abandoned its planned campaigns against racism and discrimination across the opening three days of the Copa Gianni being staged in the USA USA USA. Following a backlash, some pithy slogans were rolled out on Wednesday, albeit seemingly on the proviso that this token gesture would be for one day of this month-long jamboree only.While the dimwits who think politics should have no place in football will view Fifa’s non-stance as a victory, it is difficult to imagine what they made of Wednesday’s delegation of Juventus representatives at the Oval Office, where assorted players, staff and suits were forced to stand behind Donald Trump as he briefed his favoured correspondents on a possible attack on Iran, a bizarre soliloquy regarding the bodycount in the American Civil War and how “bigly” the crowd at Juve’s Copa Gianni match against Al Ain would be a few hours later. With Gianni Infantino gazing adoringly from his basket in the corner, the 47th president of the United States of America also tried unsuccessfully to bait some or all of his visitorsinto making transphobic comments.View image in fullscreenThere he is.Photograph: Ken Cedeno/EPAShowing all the enthusiasm and joie de vivre of captives in a hostage video, a group of players including USA USA USA internationals Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah looked on with a mixture of thinly veiled contempt and … no,just thinly veiled contempt. Speaking after Juve’s win over Al Ain later that evening, Weah stated that he and his teammates had been forced into participating in this tawdry photo op by their employers. “It was all a surprise to me, honestly,” he sighed. “They told us that we have to go and I had no choice but to go. I was caught by surprise, honestly. It was a bit weird. When he started talking about the politics with Iran and everything, it’s kind of like … I just want to play football, man.” Previouslyan outspoken criticof Trump’s disregard for black people among his myriad other shortcomings, McKennie stayed silent on this occasion but, if looks could kill, the midfielder would almost certainly have been bundled out of the office by the president’s secret service detail.Elsewhere in Copa Gianni, Manchester City got their campaignoff to a winning startagainst Wydad AC despite losing Rico Lewis to a late red card that simultaneously looked very harsh and entirely justified, while Merseyside’s most famous Hispanophone made his eagerly awaited debut for his new sidein their draw with Al-Hilal. “It’s an incredible day for me to make my Real Madrid debut,” cheered Trent Alexander-Arnold in his post-match interview, speaking in his native tongue on this occasion, presumably out of fear any Ice goons lurking nearby would be so impressed by his proficiency in Spanish that he might end in the back of a van being ferried to a detention centre.QUOTE OF THE DAY“Many question why our national team is in this situation and why there is a lack of talent, one reason being the losses due to piracy. All the money that is lost every year is not invested in the youth teams and in the growth of our young players, a major issue that has led our national team to face many difficulties … We are already far behind the Premier League and La Liga.

It holds a place in Dutch football history because FC Twente’s stadium in Enschede hosted the 2017 European Championship final, when Roord was part of the squadthat won the title.“This is going to sound basic, but even stuff like the Dutch supermarkets makes me happy,” she says. “When you’re a footballer from abroad you don’t have a social life; you go from training to training, game to game and you don’t know anyone other than your teammates.”View image in fullscreenManchester City fans display a banner of Jill Roord before the WSL match against Manchester United in May.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersInstead, FC Twente is deep-rooted in her family. Roord’s father, René, is the club’s technical director and Roord recalls being excited when she was an “eight or nine” year-old first joining the Under-13s girls team. On returning, she says: “The reaction I got from the club and the fans was maybe a little but unexpected, it was quite overwhelming, in a good way. It is nice to feel that everyone is very happy I’m back.”Having broken through at Twente in her teens, she returns at 28, aware there will be expectations for her to act as a leader on and off the pitch. “That’s definitely a little bit new, but it’s the right time for me and it’s good for my development. I’ve never felt that responsible at a club so this is a good thing for me, something for me to work on and get better at.”Before that club reunion, a major tournament in Switzerland in July. In the Netherlands’ most recent internationals they suffered a 4-0 loss in Germany at the end of May beforea 1-1 draw at home to Scotlandon 3 June, when Roord opened the scoring.The Oranje Leeuwinnen then had what Roord feels was a much-needed break, before starting their official Euros preparation camp on Thursday. “The past two games we played wasn’t really good from us,. We were mentally and physically tired after a long season. We needed this break and now we’re going to get ready for the Euros.View image in fullscreenJill Roord slides in to tackle Kristien Elsen in a league game between Oud-Heverlee Leuven and FC Twente in August 2013.Photograph: Ruben Lamers/Alamy“I’ve been playing with the national team since I was 17 and of all the squads this one has maybe the best team. The level in training is very high. If we all do well and if we’re all fresh and fit, we can get far.”They begin their campaign against the tournament debutants Wales before facing England and France. Roord says: “It is a bit unlucky to get a group like that but I’m sure all the other teams will say the same. Nowadays in women’s football there are many teams that are on the same level so it’s difficult to get far, for every team.“Sometimes, when you have an easy group you can grow into the tournament – we don’t have time for that, but that’s the same for England, France and Wales. If we want to get far, we have to beat these teams.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Veurink previously coached Roord at Twente.She wants to see Jonker have the best-possible send-off. “I hope for Andries this will be an amazing tournament for him and for ourselves.

Chief selector George Bailey confirmed on Friday that Labuschagne would miss next week’s first Test against the West Indies.Steve Smith will also miss the match as he recovers from his dislocated finger, with medical staff to assess him ahead of the second Test. Josh Inglis will come into the XI, while it is expected Konstas will open, but Australia will unveil their batting order and bowling attack closer to the start of the first Test next Wednesday.Pat Cummins admits ‘reset’ looms for Australia after crushing loss to South AfricaRead moreIt is the decision to drop Labuschagne that will be the biggest talking point since Bailey took over as chief selector in 2021. Labuschagne was the top-ranked Test batter in the world as recently as two years ago, but has averaged just 27.82 for the past 12 months.He was moved from his regular spot at No 3 to open in the World Test Championship final loss to South Africa last week, for returns of 17 and 22.“Marnus at his best can be a really important member of this team. He understands his output hasn’t been at the level we, or he, expects,” Bailey said in a statement. “We will continue working with him on the areas of his game we feel he needs to rediscover.“We continue to value his skill and expect him to work through the challenge positively.”Konstas’s recall comes after he was left out of the team for Sri Lanka, following the teenager’s high-profile start to Test life with a half-century on debut on Boxing Day against India.Selectors opted to go with Travis Head at the top of the order in Galle, given their preference to have him open on spinning wickets. But that move was only ever temporary, leaving the opening spot free for Labuschagne at Lord’s last week and now seemingly Konstas in the West Indies.Inglis also impressed with a century on debut in Galle in January, before being squeezed out of the side for the Test Championship final.“Steve needs more time for the wound to heal so we’ll give him another week’s rest and assess his functionality after that,” Bailey said. “We have made the decision to give Josh and Sam the opportunity to replace Steve and Marnus.“We are excited to see them get the chance to further their fledgling Test careers. In his only opportunity in Test cricket to date, Josh was outstanding in Sri Lanka, showing great intent and ability to put pressure on the opposition.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With temperatures hovering over 30C on Andy Murray Arena, the Spaniard was 4-2 down in the final set, having lost four games in a row. To add to his sense of peril and woe, his serve was also misfiring and he had just hit his 50th unforced error. Yet he found a way – just as he hadduring the French Open finalearlier this month.Coco Gauff stunned in first match since winning French Open titleRead moreA few minutes – and a series of inspired winners – later Alcaraz was shaking hands with his compatriot Jaume Munar having won 6-4, 6-7 (7), 7-5 in an epic that lasted a little under three hours and 30 minutes. It was the longest match at Queen’s Club since MaliVai Washington faced Mark Keil in 1991, with the second set alone taking an hour and 42 minutes. As Alcaraz pithily wrote on the BBC TV courtside camera: “Were we on clay?”The fact Munar was able to hit a barrage of 135mph howitzers on serve told you we were on the green stuff, but nothing else about this match made sense.Alcaraz double-faulted on match point when he had a chance to win in straight sets. His serve was patchy. And while there were the usual moments of genius, this was a day of struggle and strife. However, Munar, the world No 59, was magnificent. Having lost his serve early in the first set after serving three double faults in a row, he happily traded blows from the back of the court and showed granite resolve under pressure.Meanwhile, Alcaraz took out his frustration on his coach Samuel López and complained to the umpire after a time violation as the heat and his opponent’s play got to him.“It was a really tough battle, Alcaraz said. “I struggled a lot mentally and physically. I still don’t know how I am standing here but I am really proud to have given myself another chance in the quarter-finals.”This was his 15 consecutive victory, his longest winning streak in his career but Alcaraz said that even he did not know how he was able to turn the match around. “I just kept fighting, I guess. I didn’t give up. I tried to fight and play my best on the return of the serve. But I still don’t know.”View image in fullscreenJacob Fearnley is through to his first ATP Tour quarter-final with a win over Corentin Moutet.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAEarlier, the Frenchman Corentin Moutet lost his temper and his last 16 match to Britain’s Jacob Fearnley. This time last year, few outside tennis circles would have heard of Fearnley, a 23-year-old from Worcester. But he steadily climbed into the world’s top 50, on the back of a big forehand and thoroughly deserved his 6-3, 2-6, 6-2 win which puts him into an ATP Tour quarter-final for the first time in his career.However, the match will largely be remembered for Moutet ranting at the umpire after being given two time violations in the third set – as well as a code violation for ball abuse. “I am running every day for three hours and you are telling me what I have to do,” he told the umpire. “I explain it to you and you give me a time violation without listening to me. Oh my God! This guy’s crazy. Killing me. You’re killing me every day.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Gosden stable’s seven-year-old faced two four-year-old rivals with a touch more class but no experience of racing at two and a half miles and when Buick challenged them to catch him with a quarter of a mile to run, neither Illinois nor Candelari could summon a response.Candelari was a spent force with half a mile left, while Illinois’s brief effort in the home straight scarcely made an impression on Trawlerman’s lead as he galloped on relentlessly for the line. He had a seven-length advantage at the post and it was seven more back to Dubai Future in third.Royal Ascot 2025: Trawlerman nets biggest prize with Gold Cup triumph – as it happenedRead more“It was the only way we were going to win,” saidJohn Gosden, who has won the feature event on the first three days of the meeting. “We had to say, if you’re going to beat me, you’re going to know you’ve been in a race, because you’re going to have to go two and a half miles at a proper gallop.“William [had] said: ‘From four out, I’m going to notch it up, notch it up, notch it up. So if they stay, they’re going to have to stay every inch.’ He rode him perfectly and judged it beautifully. It’s not an easy thing to do over two and a half miles.“I take nothing from the second. He’s a fabulous horse, but two and a half miles truly run is not his game. Falsely run, he’d be fine.”Gosden summoned up the memory of a great stayer of the past – the three-time winner Sagaro, with Lester Piggott in the saddle – to explain the appeal of a hard-galloping stayer like Trawlerman and acknowledged that his horse had been beaten by an outstanding champion in the now retiredKyprios in this race last year.“He ran Kyprios to a length and they were both all out,” Gosden said. “So he deserves, with Kyprios not here, to come back and show he’s a proper horse over this trip.“I remember the great horses that Lester Piggott rode, like Sagaro, the way he could run the last six furlongs in one [minute] 12 [seconds] flat. That’s what I like, a horse that can go the distance, and then go, and you can’t catch them.”Illinois was seen as a possible successor to Kyprios and Aidan O’Brien’s mighty stayer Yeats before the race, but the search for the next Gold Cup winner from Ballydoyle now seems likely to shift to the three-year-old crop. Trawlerman, meanwhile, is a gelding, and while he has left it quite late to attempt to join the list of multiple Gold Cup winners, Gosden will give him every chance.View image in fullscreenWilliam Buick kisses the trophy after he wins the Gold Cup on Trawlerman at Royal Ascot.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“He should be aimed at coming back here next year,” the trainer said, “and he shouldn’t be over-raced in the meantime. Don’t be surprised if you don’t see him again until the Henry II [Stakes in May] next year.“He doesn’t need to be going to all those [summer cup] races or he might come back here for that race in the autumn [the stayers’ event on Champions Day in October], he’s won that [before], and then we’ll put him away.”This was a fifth win of the meeting for the John and Thady Gosden team, but not enough to keep them in the lead in the race to be the leading trainer as O’Brien, the winner in eight of the past 10 seasons, completed a 44-1 treble.Charles Darwin (8-13) was an impressive winner of the opening Norfolk Stakes, while Garden Of Eden (7-1) took the Group Two Ribblesdale Stakes and Trinity College, the 5-2 favourite, made all the running in the Group Three Hampton Court Stakes.The treble sent Ryan Moore well clear of his rivals for the top jockeys’ prize with five winners. He is two clear of Oisin Murphy – who had a 42-1 double on Arabian Story in the Britannia Handicap and Never So Brave in the concluding Buckingham Palace Stakes – and three ahead of a trio of riders – including Buick and James Doyle – with two wins.Kon Tiki can sail to successZarigana, who got the Poule D’Essai Des Pouliches (French 1,000 Guineas) in the stewards’ room, is the only runner in Friday’s Coronation Stakes with a previous Group One victory to her name but still faces significant opposition as she pursues a second after two unbeaten fillies – Falakeyah and Kon Tiki – were given £46k supplementary entries at the weekend.Falakeyah in particular has captured the punters’ imagination, and Owen Burrows’s filly has since replaced Zarigana at the top of the betting with most firms.She is back in trip after running away with the Pretty Polly at Newmarket – often seen as a trial for the 12-furlong Oaks – but showed plenty of speed in the early part of the race and should cope with the drop to a mile.Zarigana could easily be unbeaten in five as her sole defeat was in a head-bobber for the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac at Longchamp in October.This is far from a two-horse race, however, and the 7-1 shotKon Tiki (4.20), who has very similar claims to Falakeyah on her form, accelerated impressively to win a Listed race at York’s Dante meeting in May.On paper, this is a significant step up in class but that was a strong field for the level and she won in an excellent time, with more in hand than a half-length margin might suggest.Royal Ascot 2.30Gold Diggershowed an excellent turn of foot to justify market support on debut at Yarmouth in May and could be over-priced at around 8-1 to follow up in what looks an open renewal of the Albany Stakes.Royal Ascot 3.05Two of 2024’s Group One-winning juveniles are in the lineup for this year’s Commonwealth Cup andShadow Of Light,who was Europe’s top-rated two-year-old thanks to a rare double in the Middle Park and Dewhurst Stakes, will be tough to beat dropping back to the Middle Park’s six-furlong trip. He showed excellent speed to quicken into the lead in the 2,000 Guineas in May before fading late on behind Ruling Court and Tuesday’sSt James’s Park Stakes winner, Field Of Gold, and this return to a stiff sprint trip promises to play to his strengths.RoyalAscot3.40Roger Varian’sFrench Dukehas yet to run this season but is the type to make significant further progress as a four-year-old having been gelded over the winter. James Doyle’s presence in the saddle is encouraging as the Wathnan operation has the fancied recent purchase Almosh’her in the field.Royal Ascot 5.00Silver Ghost beat the re-opposing Miss Nightfall by two-and-a-half lengths in a strongly run handicap at Goodwood last month and while James Fanshawe’s filly has a 6lb swing in her favour here,Silver Ghosthas improved from race-to-race this year and looks the better bet at around 12-1.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Friday tipsShowMarket Rasen2.05 Climbing 2.40 Shadows In The Sky 3.13 Greenrock Abbey 3.50 Game Beaaa 4.25 Whistleinthedark 5.05 Matoury 5.45 ShutfrontdoorRedcar2.15 Oscar’s Sister 2.50 Due Respect 3.23 Marhaba Ghaiyyath 4.00 Venezuelan 4.40 Hot Dancer 5.15 Keep The GoldRoyal Ascot2.30 Gold Digger 3.05 Shadow Of Light 3.40 French Duke 3.40 Kon Tiki (nap) 5.00 Silver Ghost (nb) 3.35 Zahrann 6.10 AdrestiaNewmarket4.47 Ibshara 5.25 Opening Bat 5.57 Tilted Kilt 6.37 I Am I Said 7.15 Royal Musketeer 7.50 Soldiers Star 8.25 Last GalileoGoodwood5.20 Blue Orbit 5.52 Babylon 6.30 Miss Dolly Rocker 7.03 Way Of Stars 7.38 Herculeus 8.13 Dan TuckerWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Royal Ascot 5.35The fast-improvingZahranndid not see a track until April but has taken a big step forward on his past two starts, including a comfortable success in a Listed race at Leopardstown two weeks ago.

One of those was adapting better when we’re up against the wall.“When those moments come in the series, that they no doubt will, it’s identifying them a lot quicker. We know that when we are on top of teams we are very, very good, and where we maybe have let ourselves down in the past is when we have been behind the game. It’s about being smarter in those situations when it’s obvious that the opposition is on top of us.“I think if [you] look at some of the victories we’ve had, they have been in a manner of complete dominance of the game throughout. But when we’ve lost we probably look back on moments. Could we have been a lot better at slowing everything down and understanding where we are in the position of the game, to then allow us to play in that natural way that we like to go about things?”View image in fullscreenOllie Pope takes a rest during a training session at Headingley before the first Tests starts on Friday.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAStokes said he thinks “conversations together in a room as a group are sometimes just as valuable as training in the nets and working harder”, but he has found time for both, with his return to full fitness after anoperation on his hamstringin January allowing him to work on his bowling action.“I can’t remember the last time I was able to work so hard on just technical stuff,” he said. “To be able to get myself back to where I feel like I was before my injuries is really good, because there were quite a few changes that crept into my action – how I was landing, how I was approaching the crease – because of my knee or because of my hamstring.

However, the Zimbabwean confirmed her family would not be following suit.Kirsty Coventry’s in-tray: six big issues facing IOC’s new presidentRead more“We won’t be staying in the Palace,” she said. “I really want my kids to grow up doing the same thing that I did, making beds and doing our chores and being kids.”Coventry, who won seven Olympic medals during her swimming career, said the significance of being thefirst female IOC presidenthad hit her only when she started reading the messages of support from other women. Asked for more details, Coventry said: “I think I will start crying, so might have to do that another time. But the sentiments were really just around: ‘Thank you;’ ‘You’re such an inspiration;’ ‘This is so incredible.’“In the last few days, I’ve started having a little bit of time to really go through or re go through some of the messages came through, and I’m now having a much greater understanding of that importance [of being appointed]. And as we get closer to the 23rd realise that, yes, it’s an exciting day, but it’s also a day with a lot of responsibility to ensure that we make and I make the right decisions. But I’m very proud of the fact that we as a membership have chosen this point in time to elect our first female president.”Coventry also made it clear she wanted IOC members to feel free to speak their minds and had invited them to stay two extra nights in Lausanne next week to have a “pause and reflect workshop” to hear their ideas. “The way I like to lead is with collaboration,” she said. “I like people to say: ‘Yes, I had a say and this was the direction that we went.’ That way you get a really authentic buy-in.”The 41-year-old made it clear she campaigned for the IOC job to change people’s lives for the better and not for the prestige involved. “After I was elected my husband started giggling at the breakfast table and he looked at me and he goes: ‘Do you realise you’re the most powerful person in sport?’” she said.“And I was like: ‘What are you talking about?’ For me, it’s not about the title. It wasn’t about power. Sometimes those things get in the way and they make you focus on maybe the wrong things. It’s just not who I am.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s where the US men’s national team will begin their World Cup campaign, and it’s where they’ll wrap up the group stage. It’s a city in the news lately due to the Trump administration’s deployment of Ice and the national guard, but it’s also a metro area synonymous with diversity. This US men’s national team, more than ever, reflects that diversity.“It’s not that there’s a record or anything of how many minorities have been on the national team before, but I feel like this has been the most diverse generation of national team,” said center back Chris Richards, who is poised to be a leader along the backline for the US next year.Christian Pulisic says questioning his commitment to US is ‘way out of line’Read moreDuring most periods of the USMNT’s modern history, Richards saying this would be a political non-factor. But today, as the Trump administration openly discourages talk of diversity in public life, it means something. Against the backdrop of polarization at home and mounting pressure to make a deep run at the World Cup, a team mostly based abroad has been careful about commenting on social and political issues in the United States.Diversity, though, remains foundational.“When we had Gregg [Berhalter] as the coach, and we had to pick our anchors for our team, and we talked about picking ‘diverse’ as one of those anchors, we started to look around the room, and you really start to realize how every single person on our team comes from such a completely different background,” said midfielder Tyler Adams, who captained the US at the 2022 World Cup. “It was the first time I started to realize, ‘Wow, we just have a very, very diverse team.’”Adams and others mean “diversity” in the truest sense of the word: Age, race, culture, birthplace; it is seemingly all there, in one roster.“This team is a microcosm of what the United States is,” said Tim Ream, who at 37 is the oldest player by far on an otherwise young and mid-career team. “It’s representative of the entire country. So many backgrounds, different cultures, different ways of doing things, different beliefs, and that’s OK, and we all get along just fine.”View image in fullscreenTyler Adams (center) and Tim Ream (left) are considered to be leaders for the USMNT.Photograph: Stephen Nadler/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty ImagesAdams, who is black, wasn’t really thinking about diversity as a kid growing up in Wappingers Falls, New York. He’s biracial, raised by his mother (who is white) and eventually his stepfather (who is also white) along with his three stepbrothers, whohe refers toas his father and brothers. Looking back, Adams said he had a lot of black friends and a reasonably diverse school, but his youth soccer environment was different.“A lot of white kids play soccer in the neighborhoods I grew up in,” said Adams, who noted that youth national teams provided an early, eye-opening experience.“A lot of the kids that were getting called in from California obviously have a Latin [American] background. And right away you could tell how diverse just America in general is,” he said. “It was a really cool thing. You become friends with people that on the west coast that you may have never met through the game, and you start to understand a little bit of the culture and why they fall in love with the game, why you fall in love with the game, and how your geography kind of dictates that.”St Louis, the New York area, and California are historic hotbeds of soccer in the US. Former US defender and notoriously opinionated pundit Alexi Lalas recently reiterated his view that the men’s national team could be better served by being more “exclusive” and concentrating player development resources on such hotbeds.But to do so would be to exclude Birmingham, Alabama – Richards’ home town. The Crystal Palace defender says he was typically the only black player on his team growing up before he joined the FC Dallas academy. During 2022 World Cup qualifying, he noticed how much the national team had changed.For the USMNT, a successful summer is harder than ever to defineRead more“I remember at one point it was Antonee Robinson, Mark McKenzie, myself, and Sergiño Dest, and I was like, ‘Oh, this is like an all black back line,’” he said. “Zack Steffen was in goal … Weston [McKennie] was playing in the midfield, we had Timothy Weah on the wing, Yunus [Musah] was playing. So that’s eight starters right there that are black, and we were just like, ‘This is kind of crazy.’ Me personally growing up, I never saw it. I know Yunus probably did because he grew up in London, but for me, it was really rare. I never experienced something like that until playing with the national team.”Richards didn’t really think about the diversity of the national team when he was younger. Today, he said it gives inspiration to his little brother, and his best friend.“His dad was like, ‘You have no idea how big this is, not just for kids in Birmingham, but kids of color in Birmingham,” Richards said. “It’s something that they never had seen on TV and something that they never really aspired [to] because they’d never seen it before.”View image in fullscreenThe US warmup jackets became a space for personalized messages in a November 2020 game v Wales.Photograph: Matthew Ashton/AMA/Getty ImagesWhen it comes to political expression, November 2020 was a turning point for the US men’s national team. After the Covid-19 pandemic had precluded the full squad from convening for a year, much of its emerging, European-based talent was on display in a 0-0 draw against Wales. So too was the team’s diversity: ten out of the 11 starters were black or Hispanic, with four born and raised abroad.Their participation in the social justice movement was also beginning to emerge. In their first game since the murder of George Floyd and ensuing protests that prompted messages of social justice solidarity throughout the sports world, the players and coaches wore jackets emblazoned with the words “Be The Change” across the front. On the back, they had the space to send their own personal message.“Whether you supported what was going on or not, it was the time to stand with your principles,” Richards said. “So some people put different messages on the back of their jackets, and whether it was a Black Lives Matter quote, whether it was just an equal rights thing, we all have something that we stand for.”Eighteen months later, under the banner of the “Be The Change,” the team sent avery direct messageto Congress regarding gun legislation and wore orange armbands in a friendly against Uruguay to raise awareness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Wednesday, Weah and McKennie were among the members of Juventus invited to the Oval Office on the eve of their Club World Cup opener in Washington DC (Weah later told reportersthat he had no choicebut to go). With McKennie, Weah and others as a backdrop, Trump answered all sorts of questions from the press. At one point, he turned to them to ask if a woman could play for Juventus – a reference to the culture war surrounding the battle over transgender rights. None of the visitors took the bait.“I was kind of like, I just want to play football,” said Weah, whose father is the former president of Liberia and Ballon D’or winner.Ream and Adams both underlined that the US team isn’t having deep discussions about politics at the dinner table during their limited time together. If commentary is to come from the team, they said, it can’t be counter-productive, engendering awkwardness or discord.“If I’m going to say something, I’m going to say something because I feel like it can bring people together and bring people closer,” Ream said.And while athletes today have their own megaphone at their fingertips, sharing their opinion or engaging with others on social media carries plenty of risk.“It’s gonna get misconstrued one way or another so there’s no point,” Adams said.Adams also stressed that ultimately, technology can only compensate so much for physically being on the other side of the Atlantic, where he and other players spend most of their time during the club season. There’s a disconnect from the reality back home that is increasingly difficult to digest.“It’s an interesting time we’re living in,” he said. “A lot of decisions that are made almost seem like they just happened in a blink of an eye. It’s hard to fathom sometimes exactly what’s happening and have a complete understanding.”View image in fullscreenWeston McKennie and Tim Weah were among the Juvenus players in an Oval Office meeting with Trump this week.Photograph: Ken Cedeno/EPAThe US men’s national team’s naming of diversity as one of its pillars didn’t seem out of the ordinary in 2020. Now, five years later, the backlash to diversity, equity and inclusion, accelerated by a second Trump administration, has changed the landscape. It is intertwined with the administration’s immigration policy, built by Trump’s deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.To him and others in the administration, the concept of diversity as a strength on its own is a political statement – the very thing the team tries to avoid without full buy-in and a lot of thought and collaboration among the group.“Within the last few years, particularly the last year, it’s been a very tough time for the country. With change, with the new president, with things like that,” Richards said. “I felt like we were moving forward with certain things, with uplifting minorities. And I feel like in the last few months, it’s felt like it’s gone backwards.”At the moment, the US appreciate their diversity but don’t feel the need to celebrate it publicly. In camp they’re curious to learn about each other’s lives, and let their performances elicit pride in their identity.“When you play well, you’re like, ‘Look at that team. Look how diverse.’ You take so many positives away from what our team stands for,” Adams said. “So that’s important as well, and we’ll get back to that way, because that’s what makes us great.”Explore more on these topicsUSAUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They analysed data provided by 258 UK Uber drivers responsible for 1.5m trips.Having initially taken a fixed 20% cut of the UK fares charged, which subsequently rose to 25%, Uber introduced dynamic pricing in 2023, an algorithm that variably sets pay for drivers and fares for passengers. It is a later iteration of Uber’s “surge pricing” that increased fares during periods of peak demand.Uber is now claiming a cut, or “take rate”, of 29% of a fare, rising to more than 50% in some cases, the researchers found.Unions criticised the movewhen it was made in 2023, claiming there was no transparency and that the technology “could push down working conditions by targeting drivers based on their willingness and ability to accept lower fares”.The Oxford research said: “Post-dynamic pricing, Uber’s passengers now pay higher prices, but the drivers are not better off.”The paper, which was published in partnership with the non-profit gig worker organisation Worker Info Exchange (WIE), concluded: “Our findings suggest that post-dynamic pricing, many aspects of Uber drivers’ jobs have gotten worse. Average pay per hour on the app is stagnant, and is lower in real terms in the year following the introduction of dynamic pricing.“Uber’s median take rate per driver has increased from 25% to 29%, and on some trips the take rate is over 50%. Furthermore, the higher take rates are concentrated among higher-fare trips, which explains how Uber can extract an additional 38% [income] from its driver’s labour on average … Many drivers are earning substantially less per hour.”The findings follow a series of controversies to have engulfed the technology firm, including a2021 UK supreme court rulingthat Uber drivers are entitled to the minimum wage and paid holidays, as well as the 2022 release ofthe Uber files, a global investigation that revealed how the company duped police and regulators, and secretly lobbied governments across the world.After the release of the Uber files,Jill Hazelbaker, Uber’s senior vice-president of public affairs, said: “We have not and will not make excuses for past behaviour that is clearly not in line with our present values. Instead, we ask the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years and what we will do in the years to come.”The Oxford research added that drivers’ average hourly pay was £29.46, using an Uber definition, or £15.98 if counting waiting time when they made themselves available to pick up passengers. Neither average takes into account costs including vehicle maintenance, insurance or fuel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Drivers choose to drive with Uber because we offer total flexibility on when they work and provide full transparency over the trips they accept.“All drivers receive a weekly summary of their earnings, which includes a clear breakdown of what Uber and the driver received from trips. We are proud that thousands of drivers continue to make the positive choice to work on Uber as passenger demand and trips continue to grow.”Explore more on these topicsUberGig economyLiving wageAppsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, in the era of global heating, heatwaves are a warning sign, not a pleasure – and as we enter a UK summer, it’s a case of when, not if, the temperature will become unbearable.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Always take care when it heats up – theNHS recommendsstaying in the shade, especially between 11am and 3pm, wearing sunscreen and hats, and avoiding exercise. It also advises taking showers, eating cold food and drinks, and avoiding alcohol, caffeine and hot drinks.And there are other things that can help. As temperatures soar, we’ve asked experts in hotspots around the world – from Australia to Dubai – about how to cope with the heat. Here’s their advice for everything from waking and dressing to sleeping(yes, it is possible in this heat, we promise).How to keep cool in a heatwaveKeep hydratedView image in fullscreenRecycled stainless steel water bottle£35 at Ryman£35 at Ocean BottleView image in fullscreenInsulated leak-proof water bottleFrom £30 at John Lewis£32 at Chilly’sView image in fullscreenGlass coffee cup and straw£27 at Anthropologie£26.95 at AmazonThe NHS recommendsdrinking six to eight glasses of water a day – the aim being that your pee remains a light straw colour. In a heatwave, you’ll likely need more water, and ideally it’ll be cold to help cool you down.Ocean Bottles are double-wall insulated, made from 65% recycled materials, and the brand collects 11.4kg of plastic from oceans with the sale of each bottle.Chilly’s water bottles claim to keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours – and everyone in your co-working space will thank you for the rubber base that doesn’t “CLANG” every time you take a sip.The NHS technically advises against caffeine in extreme heat, but if it does feel necessary, you can at least go iced with this clear Keep Cup.… andice up your lifeView image in fullscreenLékué ice cube tray£15.75 at John Lewis£19.99 at LakelandView image in fullscreenMonster ice lolly mould£12.99 at John Lewis£12.99 at LakelandWhat better way to keep cool than with frozen water?

Opt for linen, she says. A sleeveless linen dress or a loose-fitting shirt will be your saviour: the lightweight material is known for its breathable properties – the baggier the better for circulation and non-clinginess.Darker colours will help disguise sweat marks – if you’re particularly worried about this, go for polyester or nylon over cotton. Or try a sweat-wicking fabric, such as Uniqlo’s Airism.If you carry a heavy leather handbag, it’s worth swapping for a lightweight cross-body bag or cotton tote. These have longer handles, allowing air to circulate rather than being stickily clamped to your side.Underwear-as-outerwearView image in fullscreenLace trim cami top£20 at NextView image in fullscreenMini slip dress£78 at Free PeopleView image in fullscreenSeersucker stripe boxers£28 for three at John Lewis“The Australian summer can be humid and unforgiving – as such, we learn how to dress for the heat from a young age,” says Elle Australia’s fashion editor, Jordan Boorman. “I lean into vintage-style lingerie silhouettes, wispy camisoles, lace slip dresses and skirts.” Men: feeling brave?

There are several ways to combat this, and many women fall back on wearing shorts under skirts and dresses: try these M&S slimming shorts, which stay up all day and are so thin and cool that you forget they’re there.For other parts of the body, or if shorts don’t work for you, body image speaker and writer Laura Adlington recommends Megababe Thigh Rescue. “It glides on like a balm and keeps your thighs happy all day.

Look for breathable materials such as straw, they said, and wide brims that protect your face and neck from the sun.This M&S packable broad-rim hat is another great option for men looking for something to take on holiday (or not brave enough to wear it on the commute), as it folds down easily. And don’t forget caps.Wide brims are everywhere on the high street this year – the John Lewis hat above has a simple silhouette that will pair with anything, and the black canvas offering from & Other Stories is a much chicer take on last year’s bucket hat trend.Summer runningView image in fullscreenUnisex hydration bag with 1L pouch£24.99 at DecathlonView image in fullscreenThe North Face Summit Run 5L vest£134.99 at SportsShoes£135 at the North FaceAs recommended by Kieran Alger in his guide totrail running essentialsIf a heatwave persists unbroken but you want to continue your exercise streak, Esther Newman, editor ofWomen’s Running magazineand co-host ofthe Women’s Running Podcast, says it is possible, with some adjustment.“If you’re running for longer than 30 minutes, carry water with you – usually twice as much as you would do in the winter,” she says. “Decathlon’s hydration packs do the job for a good price, and enable you to run hands-free.”View image in fullscreenLululemon WundermostNulu high-waist thong£25 at LululemonView image in fullscreenUniqlo Airism boxer briefs£12.90 at UniqloWhen you’re hot and sweaty, moisture-wicking base layers can really help.

When it comes to fabrics, he says bamboo bedding will help; and for pyjamas, try modal. “Steer clear of all foams – it’s an insulator so will make you feel hotter, even if it claims to keep you cool all night – as well as down and feather, as they’ll make you really hot.”Sleep like a babyView image in fullscreenDigital room thermometer£21.99 at John Lewis£25 at ArgosView image in fullscreenOrganic cotton sleeping bag£34.50 at Natural Baby Shower£24.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenPortable blackout blinds£22.45 at John LewisFrom £24.99 at Tommee TippeeIf the baby’s not sleeping, then no one else is. Hot babies struggle to sleep, but high temperatures are also a health hazard for young children. “Keeping babies cool during a heatwave can feel like an uphill battle, especially when their sleep environment heats up,” says Rosey Davidson, sleep consultant and founder and CEO of Just Chill Baby Sleep. “My top tips are to keep blinds or curtains closed during the day to block out direct sunlight, and dress babies in just a nappy or a super-light layer. TheNHS recommendsyour child’s room be between 16 and 20C – and offers lots of tips on keeping children cool throughout the day.“The GroEgg room thermometer glows different colours to show temperature ranges – ideal for making quick, safe sleepwear decisions at bedtime. A cool muslin sleeping bag is lightweight and breathable, helping babies to sleep safely without the risk of overheating – Aden + Anais does a 1 tog range. And blackout blinds with suction cups, like this Tommee Tippee version, keep nurseries dark and cool by blocking out sunlight – they’re especially helpful for early bedtime routines.”Rhiannon Evans is a journalist and editor who’s covered everything from news and entertainment to lifestyle and parenting for some of the UK’s best titles (and some others too).

Perhaps you have a bread machine, an ice-cream maker or a toastie maker in the cupboard gathering dust?If the answer to either question is “yes”, Lucie Basch has a solution. The French entrepreneur and pioneer of a hugely successful anti-food waste app is now turning her attention to a different problem: the simultaneous underuse and overconsumption of everyday household objects.Basch has co-founded a new app, namedPoppins, in reference to the world’s most famous nanny’s seemingly bottomless carpet bag full of impossibly large items, including a hatstand. The aim is to connect people who have things they don’t need with people who might want to borrow or rent them under the slogan “own less, have more”.Basch says research has shown the average French person owns about 2.5 tonnes of objects, around a third of which are never used.View image in fullscreenThe Poppins app.“It doesn’t make sense ecologically or economically,” she said. “The aim is to allow everyone to find what they need easily and nearby. Collective prosperity is the only way forward.”She added: “The raclette machine is a great example. You buy one, use it twice a year, and it takes up half your kitchen space. Yet it is easy to rent.”Launched in April, the app attracted 40,000 users inFrancein its first few weeks. It displays objects available in an area, some of which can be borrowed, others rented. Poppins takes a commission. The wider aim is to make sharing more popular than shopping; Poppins includes rental shops and borrowing outlets like libraries in its listings.In the app’s first weeks, the most sought-after household item was a raclette machine. Basch says with the summer holidays approaching, tents and camping equipment are in demand, along with petanque sets, cots and baby beds, party items, barbecues and outdoor equipment. About 65% of the offers on Poppins are free loans. The app, which is moderated, does not allow users to advertise weapons or sex toys.Basch said: “The beauty of sharing is it combines ecological, economic and social incentives. If we make sharing normal, less is produced, which is ecological, we will spend less because it’s cheaper to rent or buy and we will be more social as we are talking to each other again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The linear model doesn’t work any more and destroys the planet. Everyone in business understands the need to do this, even big companies, who are starting to contact us.”Basch says even big high street white goods companies are moving into renting equipment. “It’s the way forward. This is the whole challenge now for company leaders: how to transform the business model.“We promise to make sharing easy, reliable and fun. The fun part is important too. You feel like alife hackerAnd we promise you can find anything you might need within a radius you decide. You can organise a whole party with rented stuff.”Paris-born Basch, 33, who studied at the prestigious Centrale engineering university in Lille, said she realised how much of a problem food waste was when working at Nestlé. She had the idea for her first app,Too Good To Go, after she saw a baker throw away unsold products and asked him if she could have them. The baker said they were not allowed to give them away, but gave her three times as much produce when she paid.The app now has more than 100 million users in 19 countries inEuropeand North America. It began after Basch realised that 40% of food produced on the planet was thrown away, producing more than 8% of greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, millions go hungry. With Too Good To Go, users buy a surprise bag to be collected at a given time from a shop or restaurant, the contents of which are worth three times the price on the app.Poppins will launch in Belgium next year and in the UK in late 2026 or 2027.Explore more on these topicsFranceAppsWasteGadgetsEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 2021, Hadi and friends won there too.If that sounds as if the British legal system left the former Somalian refugee in the driving seat, he argues that life forUberworkers is now as precarious as ever.On Thursday, academics at the University of Oxford – in conjunction with the non-profit gig worker organisationWorker Info Exchange(WIE) – launched a report analysing a mass of data relating to1.5m trips provided by 258 UK Uber drivers, who had used privacy legislation to extract their personal data from the ride-hailing app.The study gave a rare opportunity to study the workings of Uber’s technology and produced some eye-catching findings.It found that many Uber drivers have earned “substantially less” an hour since the app introduced a “dynamic pricing” algorithm in 2023, which is said to adjust trip prices in real time based on a number of factors.These include time, distance, the number of available drivers in the area, the passenger demand, traffic and the weather. The report found that these earnings drops coincided with the company taking a significantly higher share of fares.The study unearthed further data suggesting that drivers such as Hadi are experiencing less and less control over their working lives. They described their days as being controlled by increasingly sophisticated pieces of computer code, which left them unclear how much Uber would take in fees on discrete jobs.“[The old system] was clear, transparent,” Hadi told the Guardian and ITV News. “You can calculate, you can see. Say, for example here it says about eight miles, so I know eight miles plus how long it took me, plus the starting fare, minus Uber’s fee, which is 20%. Even when they increased it to 25%, I would exactly know how much. Exactly.”The new system has resulted in Uber taking a variable cut, or “take rate”, of 29% of a fare on average, rising to more than 50% in some cases, the University of Oxford researchers found. The study also found that Uber’s take rate increased on higher value rides – something the company has denied.The 29% figure appears to chime with disclosures within Uber’s latest quarterly results figures, which show that the company made$1.2bn (£890m) of income from its operationsin the first three months of this year.Meanwhile, the WIE estimates that UK Uber drivers lost out on $1.6bn in pay, as a result of Uber increasing its share of the fare, during the 12 months to March 2025.Uber said the UK take rate and lost earnings figures are inaccurate, and that its take rate had remained “steady” at 25%.The company added: “The Uber app reviews real-time information to provide the best price to appeal to the drivers in the area, helping to minimise waiting times for customers and maximise earnings. Drivers are shown their earnings for the trip before they decide whether to accept.”But as Uber grows more confident in its calculations, those transporting passengers say they are becoming less so.A driver’s livelihood depends on their ability to guess what kinds of trips they will get at particular times and places, and how much those trips will pay.However, the University of Oxford study stated that “drivers frequently complained about the unpredictability of pay post-dynamic pricing”.It continued: “Any tacit knowledge drivers have built up over years about how much pay a given trip is likely to yield may no longer help them … the predictability of pay drastically changed after dynamic pricing was introduced.”A company spokesperson said: “Uber drivers in the UK took home over £1bn in earnings between January and March of this year, which is up on the year before.“Drivers choose to drive with Uber because we offer total flexibility on when they work and provide full transparency over the trips they accept.“All drivers receive a weekly summary of their earnings, which includes a clear breakdown of what Uber and the driver received from trips.“We are proud that thousands of drivers continue to make the positive choice to work on Uber as passenger demand and trips continue to grow.”Explore more on these topicsUberGig economyLiving wageanalysisShareReuse this content"

The two struck up an unlikely but fierce friendship nearly a decade ago, and Kojima says that, as a teenager, the first two Mad Max films inspired him to become a movie director and thus, eventually, a video game maker. At the panel later, Miller is equally effusive, calling Kojima “almost my brother”; the Australian even lent his appearance to a major character in Kojima’s latest game,Death Stranding2.It’s actually because of Miller that much of this latest game is set in a heavily fictionalised version of Australia, Kojima jokes. Death Stranding, a game about slogging through vast, treacherous yet gorgeous environments to deliver parcels between isolated bunkers, is particularly suited to Australia’s diverse and varied biosphere; the game’s geography may be condensed and fantastical, but the beauty and the terror remains.View image in fullscreenFierce friends … Hideo Kojima with George Miller at the Sydney film festival, June 2025.Photograph: Tim Levy/Sydney Film FestivalIn addition to sweeping, moody outback landscapes, DS2 also has some of the most vividly detailed (or at least expensive) depictions of Australian wildlife in all of gaming. Spotting the distinctive hopping gait of a kangaroo on a sun-drenched horizon was, for this decidedly urban Australian, an oddly moving sight.“I love animals, and they’re unique here,” says Kojima, who passed on catching some early morning festival screenings to go to the zoo instead. “A lot of people [on the team] love animals … They might say no to designing a new mech, but they wanted to make more animals.”Film buff Kojima drops a few Australian cinematic references too – he likes the1971 flick Walkabout, and admits DS2’s subtitle, On the Beach, is a reference to the classic Melbourne-based post-apocalyptic movie of the same name (“I love the original novel”) – but his real reasoning behind the location choice was simple: “I wanted to go to Australia.” Though he’s visited before, he wanted to go deeper in, “to the middle of the land, the desert”.But because of the pandemic, Kojima’s team was forced to use remote location scouts to gather data; being unable to be there in person was very disappointing, he says. “It’s totally different from looking at a picture, when you’re feeling it, on location.”Remote work, during the pandemic and beyond, has been a sticking point for the game. “The hardest thing was the performance capture,” he says. Directing cast members such as Norman Reedus orLéa Seydouxremotely from Japan was the “worst experience”, his direction “almost impossible to relay” from the other side of a Zoom call. With restrictions in place during the early parts of development, the team tried to focus on scenes that didn’t utilise the main actors early on, but it wasn’t always possible.“And for the new cast especially, it was quite difficult,” he says, “Because I wanted to explain: this is the character, this is how I want you to act – but it was all remote!”View image in fullscreenAn oddly moving sight … Death Stranding 2: On the Beach.Photograph: Kojima Productions/SonyThe situation eased by 2022, he says, allowing him to fly to LA and direct in person – to build a better rapport with his cast and get them more used to the nuances of acting for games. “People who have done Marvel movies, they’ve experienced performance capture, with the green backgrounds,” he says. (In most cinematic games, real-world acting is translated to the digital realm throughmotion capture technology– which can be jarring to actors used to sets and costumes.) “We actually have a tool: if you look at the monitor, you can see the [in-game] world displayed in real time.”Kojima says he tries to keep actors performing together as much as possible, though there are always exceptions where they had to record separately, especially during Covid. And then there were problems specific to games, such as the need for multiple takes on a character’s grunts of pain or repeatable in-game actions like eating an apple. “Sometimes we’d get questions from Norman, and I’d say, ‘Eat the apple and it’s good’, or ‘Eat the apple and it’s not good’ – we want those differences! Over and over, we had to ask for those kinds of things.”View image in fullscreenKojima at the Sydney Film FestivalPhotograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianDeath Stranding made “connections” its thesis statement; players never see one another in-game, yet can pool resources and build structures to benefit themselves and others, creating intricate networks of services to make the long drudgery of delivery easier for everyone. So why is the sequel’s tagline the ominous question: “Should we have connected?”“I became sick during the pandemic, and I was totally isolated,” Kojima says. Compounding that, optical muscle damage from a recent eye surgery meant that he couldn’t even watch movies or TV. The world shifted around him: everyone was bunkering down, working online, communicating through video calls as delivery people kept the world running. His game, his vision, had come true.“It seemed like, yes, we’re all connected. But it’s not really the connection that I imagined,” he says. His company, Kojima Productions, was staffing up; he would meet new hires in person on their first day and then, due to pandemic restrictions, not see them again for the next three years.Having spoken recently about legacy (news of aUSB drive “full of ideas”he had supposedly prepared to leave behind took on a life of its own, he laughs), Kojima believes in-person collaboration remains the best way to foster new talent. “The reason why [new hires] want to work with us is they want to learn from mentors, or become better by working with other people,” he says. “But if you’re purely online … it’s almost like outsourcing. You want to talk and see what other people are doing, so you can expand yourself, you can grow.”Remote work is “almost like a fast food chain; you’re just concentrating on one thing instead of the whole project,” he says: in a collaborative industry like game-making, it introduces inefficiencies. With people siloed off, there’s no back-and-forth, he says; people discover their mistakes later and there’s less room for happy coincidences, spur-of-the-moment suggestions or alternate viewpoints.Aside from that, he adds, you don’t get to know your team members, see how people are feeling or ask them about their hobbies. “Only 1% of yourself is on show during [online] meetings,” he says. “This is not like building a team. Think about football. You hire someone, he comes to your squad – but you can’t play together remotely. So that person doesn’t change the way they played before; they won’t fit in,” he says.Still, “you can’t force people back to the office, you can only persuade them,” he says. “So not everyone came back. But the main members did, so we could work together.”View image in fullscreen‘I wanted to go to Australia’ … Death Stranding 2: On the Beach.Despite this slightly dour tone, Kojima seemingly remains hopeful. Death Stranding is a deeply lonely game, he says animatedly during a later group presentation. “But … you find other players all over the world. You’re indirectly connected … And once you turn that [game] off and go outside … you see structures in real life, like the bridge here in Sydney.Someone made that!They might have passed away years ago, but you’re connected to them. Even if you haven’t met the person. You are not alone in this world.”And there’s always new horizons. Kojima has a long-held dream of visiting outer space – not a mere billionaire’s suborbital hop, but something more. “That’s not space,” he says, firmly. “I want to train properly, learn how to do the docking, go to the International Space Station and stay there for a few months … I’m not a scientist, but I could probably make games in space. I want to be the first. There are a lot of astronauts over 60, so I guess it’s possible.” There’s no gravity in space to irritate his bad back, after all, he jokes.As we wrap up, he pauses for a moment, thinking, and adds one last ambition: he wants to be put in a situation, he says, where he risks his life doing something that would give him a feeling of really being alive. “It’s ‘Tom Cruise disease’,” Kojima elaborates. “Tom Cruise finds out his worth when living with his life on the line.”Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is out on 26 June onPlayStation5.Explore more on these topicsGamesDeath StrandingPlayStationAction gamesAdventure gamesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Garmin’s new top running watch, the Forerunner 970, has very big shoes to fill as it attempts to replace one of the best training and race companions available. Can a built-in torch, a software revamp and voice control really make a difference?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The new top-of-the-line Forerunner takes the body of the outgoing Forerunner 965 and squeezes in a much brighter display, useful new running analytics and more of the advanced tech fromGarmin’s flagship adventure watch the Fenix 8.These upgrades come at a steep cost of £630 (€750/$750/A$1,399) – £30 more than its predecessor – placing it right at the top of the running and triathlon watch pile, although less than the £780 Fenix 8.View image in fullscreenThe Forerunner 970 is a large but not enormous watch with a relatively low profile that slips under shirt cuffs and stays put during exercise.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 970 is about the same size as the outgoing 965 with a 47mm case and a beautiful, crisp and very bright 1.4in OLED screen. The touchscreen is covered in super-hard sapphire glass similar to luxury watches, while the titanium bezel finishes off the polycarbonate body in a choice of three colours.Quite a lot of the upgrades are trickle-downs from the Fenix 8 and make the 970 a better everyday smartwatch. It has Garmin’s new offline voice control system, which allows you to quickly set timers and alarms, access settings or start activities. The watch also connects to your phone’s voice assistant and takes calls on your wrist via Bluetooth.A revamped interface speeds up access to notifications from your smartphone by swiping down from the top of the screen. With an iPhone you can view and dismiss text-only notifications but connected to an Android phone you can also see images in notifications and directly reply to them from the watch. The 970 has Garmin Pay for contactless payments, althoughbank support is limited, and can control music on your phone or download playlists from Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube Music and others for phone-free music on runs.View image in fullscreenOnce you have a torch built into your watch you’ll never want to be without it. I use it at least five times a day.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe best new feature is the LED torch built into the 970’s top edge. It was invaluable on the Fenix 8 and is my favourite new addition to the Forerunner. It is bright enough to light your way on the street at night or find things buried in dark cupboards but can be turned a dim red to avoid waking everyone at home. It can also be used as a strobe light for running to help keep you visible at night.The battery lasts about six days with general smartwatch usage, including having the screen on all the time, all-day and night monitoring of health, plenty of notifications and copious use of the torch. The screen has automatic brightness but turning it down one notch in settings, which was still plenty bright enough to see outdoors, added a couple of days to the battery life. Turning the always-on display setting off extended it further to about 12 to 15 days.SpecificationsScreen:1.4in AMOLED (454x454)Case size:47mmCase thickness:13.2mmBand size:standard 22mmWeight:56gStorage:32GBWater resistance:50 metres (5ATM)Sensors:GNSS (Multiband GPS, Glonass, Galileo), compass, thermometer, heart rate, pulse OxConnectivity:Bluetooth, ANT+, wifiRunning and activity trackingView image in fullscreenThe watch charges via a USB-C cable that slots in next to the sensor cluster on the back, reaching 70% in about 40 minutes and full in 83 minutes.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianIts predecessor was a fantastic running watch filled to the brim with metrics, helpful analysis and buckets of customisation options, on which the 970 only builds. The screen is large enough to be able to clearly see up to eight data fields on screen at once. Maps look particularly good and are easy to use with touch.It has the latest dual-band GPS, while Garmin’s algorithms consistently have higher tracking accuracy than its rivals, even with similar systems. The new Gen 5 Elevate heart rate sensor on the back improves pulse monitoring in tricky conditions, and provides ECG (arrhythmia) readings.The 970 has Garmin’s suite of industry-leading fitness, recovery and training metrics, which are joined by a few new and interesting statistics, including two that attempt to help you prevent injury.Impact load quantifies how hard a run is on your body based on its intensity and difficulty compared with an easy, flat run at slower speeds. One fast, hard 7km run was rated as equivalent to a gentler 12km run, which felt about right in my feet and legs and made me consider taking a longer recovery time before the next workout.View image in fullscreenImpact load helps you avoid overdoing your training by estimating the impact of your runs on your body.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianIn addition, the new running tolerance feature tracks your mileage over a seven-day period and advises how much more you can run without increasing your chance of injury. Many runners, including myself, have injured themselves when ramping up their weekly distance too fast when training for a race, which this new stat is an attempt to avoid by giving you suggested guard rails.The 970 also has a new running economy feature that tracks efficiency of your form, including how much speed you lose as your foot hits the ground, but it relies on Garmin’s latest heart rate monitor strap, theHRM 600– a £150 separate purchase.Running battery life is a solid 11-plus hours with its highest accuracy settings and listening to offline music via Bluetooth headphones, or about 16 hours without music. Turning down the screen brightness a bit added several hours to the running battery life, while reducing the GPS accuracy mode can last up to 26 hours.Solid general health monitoringView image in fullscreenThe Forerunner looks and feels premium with flashes of colour on the body and strap but is obviously a sports watch, so may not be suitable for all occasions.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Garmin isn’t entirely about running, triathlon and its 30-plus sport tracking features. It also has a comprehensive suite of general health monitoring tools, including good sleep, activity, stress, women’s health and heart health tracking rivalling an Apple Watch or similar.Most of Garmin’s most advanced training tools also monitor your recovery from exercise during the rest of the day and night, advising you in the morning and during the day how your body is doing. It has a built-in sleep coach, a running or triathlon coach and various advisers for activity, suggesting when to do a hard workout and when to take it easy. The daily suggested workouts are dynamic and based on your sleep and recovery, so it will never prompt you to do a hardcore workout when you’ve had a terrible night. These automatic workouts can be replaced by a coaching plan, either using Garmin’s solid tools or third-party ones placed on a calendar before a race.SustainabilityThe watch is generally repairable with optionsavailable via support. The battery is rated to maintain at least 90% of its original capacity after two years of weekly charging. The watch does not contain any recycled materials. Garmin guarantees security updates until at least 21 May 2027 but typically supports its devices far longer. It offersrecycling schemeson new purchases.PriceThe Garmin Forerunner 970 costs£629.99(€749.99/$749.99/A$1,399).For comparison, theGarmin Fenix 8costs from£780, the Forerunner 570 costs£460, theGarmin Forerunner 965costs£499.99, theApple Watch Ultra 2costs£799, the Coros Pace Pro costs£349, the Suunto Race S costs£299and the Polar Vantage V3 costs£519.VerdictGarmin continues to set the bar for running watches with the Forerunner 970. It isn’t a dramatic leap over the outgoing Forerunner 965, instead adding a few bits to the already excellent formula.The screen is brighter, covered in scratch-resistant sapphire and ringed by a titanium bezel, which gives it a premium look and feel alongside a more modern and responsive interface. The added bells and whistles of voice control and faster access to notifications make using it as a smartwatch alternative much easier. Though wearing it is still a statement about your sporty priorities compared with an Apple or Pixel Watch.The upgraded heart rate sensor helps keep things locked during more difficult exercises and adds ECG readings for more comprehensive heart health tracking. But it is the built-in torch that is the best addition for daily life. Every watch should have one.Meanwhile, the new impact load and running tolerance features could be very useful for avoiding strain and injury, adding to the already excellent training and recovery tracking. Plus it has market-leading running accuracy and detailed onboard maps for routes or if you get lost.If you want a premium running and triathlon watch with all the bells and whistles, the Forerunner 970 is the best you can get. It just comes at a very high cost.Pros:super bright OLED screen, built-in torch, phone and offline voice control, Garmin Pay, extensive tracking and recovery analysis for running and many other sports, full offline mapping, offline Spotify, buttons and touch, most accurate GPS, ECG.Cons:expensive, limited Garmin Pay bank support, still limited smartwatch features compared with Apple/Google/Samsung watches, battery life shorter than LCD rivals.View image in fullscreenThere are plenty of customisable watch faces to choose from either built-in or from the Garmin IQ store.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsGarminSmartwatchesGadgetsWearable technologyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli prime minister has other ideasThu 19 Jun 2025 13.47 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 14.30 EDTShareThe maxim that wars are easy to start and hard to end does not appear to be troubling Benjamin Netanyahu. For the Israeli prime minister, conflict is an end as much as a means, extending his political survival. Under international pressure – however belated and insufficient – over the slaughter in Gaza, he launched the attack onIran. Initially presented as essential to prevent Tehran from the imminent acquisition of a nuclear bomb, a claim running counter to US intelligence, it is increasingly discussed asthe path to bringing down the regime. The defence minister, Israel Katz, has said that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, “can no longer be allowed to exist”.Donald Trump has generally seen armed conflict as a trap rather than an escape route. Hesaidthat the US would “measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end – and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into”. Yet his failure to achieve the Nobel-worthy peace deals he wants, and Mr Netanyahu’s manoeuvring, appear to have made him keener on US intervention. Israel wants US bunker-busters to attack the underground nuclear facility at Fordow. There isno guaranteethat those would succeed. Israel’s regime-ending aspirations further undermine its claim to offer what might be called, in the term infamously used of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a cakewalk. There isn’t a bad plan for the day after; there is no plan.What Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu have in common is that they consistently subsume their nations’ best interests to their personal political imperatives, and that neither cares about 90 million Iranians. The brutal theocratic regime isrepugnant to many, but hundreds of civilians have already died as Israel offers to bomb themto freedom, and the horrors of Gaza suggest that far worse could come. Many Iranianslived through the unforeseen and unwanted consequencesof toppling a hated ruler in 1979, and more watched those spawned by the US invasion of Iraq. Meanwhile, Israeli civilians now face Iranian retaliation.Israel’s impunity over its war of annihilation in Gaza has encouraged it to take this dangerous and illegal course. European leaders who were late to voice qualms about Gaza, and have muted them since the strikes on Iran began, should be takingconcrete actionto stop Israel’s assault as well as to promote negotiations. Unbelievably, Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz,described itas “dirty work Israel is doing for all of us” (he reportedly urged “moderation” in a subsequent call with Mr Netanyahu). He may change his mind if energy prices soar, this fragile region is further destabilised and state failure forces Iranians to flee to Europe.The attorney general, Richard Hermer, reportedlywarnedthat any British involvement with this war beyond defensive support would be illegal. Sir Keir Starmer is rightto call for de-escalation and negotiationto tackle the nuclear issue. Mr Trump likes the idea of quick wins, but knows high oil prices and intervention would alienate many of his backers. As of Thursday evening, Iran had avoided targeting US bases and assets, and its foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has reportedly spoken several times to Steve Witkoff, Mr Trump’s special envoy. Though that’s a long way from the “unconditional surrender” demanded by Mr Trump, there are escape routes from this crisis. Mr Netanyahu must not be allowed to destroy them.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Will they change their minds?Tayo BeroAs the president’s immigration policies take a toll on communities, some of his voters are shaken – but standing by himThu 19 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 10.27 EDTShareBy now, the cycle of Donald Trump supporters being slapped in the face by his policies is common enough that it shouldn’t warrant a response. Whatisnoteworthy is the fact that his crusade of mass deportations seems to have taken the Maga crowd by surprise in a way that makes little sense if you’ve been paying attention to Trump, his campaign promises, his party and the people hesurrounds himselfwith.Even as they witness friends and family members hurt by this administration’s immigration clampdowns, some Trump supporters appear resistant to doing a full 180.Bradley Bartell, whose wife, Camila Muñoz, was recently detained, says he has no regrets about voting for Trump. Muñoz is from Peru and overstayed a work-study visa that expired right when Covid hit. She was trying to get permanent residency in the US when she was detained.“I don’t regret the vote,” Bartell toldNewsweek. His rationale? Trump is a victim of a bad immigration system that his administration inherited. “He didn’t create the system but he does have an opportunity to improve it. Hopefully, all this attention will bring to light how broken it is.”‘Abducted by Ice’: the haunting missing-person posters plastered across LARead moreForJensy Machadofrom Manassas, Virginia, things are a bit more complex. Machado, a naturalized US citizen, was driving to work when,according to NBC 4, he was stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents, who brandished guns and surrounded his truck. According to Machado, a man facing a deportation order had given Machado’s home address as his, and when Machado assured agents that they had the wrong person and offered them his Virginia driver’s license, they ordered him to leave his car and handcuffed him.“I was a Trump supporter,” Machado, who is Hispanic, said. “I voted for Trump last election, but, because I thought it was going to be like … against criminals, not every Hispanic, Spanish-lookalike.“They will assume that we are all illegals,” he continued. “They’re just following Hispanic people.”Machado said his support for the administration had been shaken. Others have been rattled by how and where Trump’s policies are being applied.That dissonance is well articulated in a recent New York Timespieceabout a small Missouri town that supported Trump – and is now grappling with the effects of his decisions.Many residents of Kennett, Missouri, were stunned when a beloved neighbor, Carol, was arrested and jailed to await deportation after being summoned to Ice offices in St Louis in April. According to the government, Carol came to the US from Hong Kong in 2004, and has spent the past two decades trying to secure legal stay in the country, ultimately being granted a temporary permission to stay known as an order of supervision. Carol’s most recent order of supervision was supposed to be valid through August 2025, but on the day of her arrest, she was told it was being terminated.Now, despite the fact that she’s spent the last two decades building a life and community in this small town, getting married and buying a house, she’s spent weeks moving between jails as she awaits a final decision on her deportation.“I voted forDonald Trump, and so did practically everyone here,” said Vanessa Cowart, who knows Carol from church. “But no one voted to deport moms. We were all under the impression we were just getting rid of the gangs, the people who came here in droves … This is Carol.”That last line – and the Kennett story as a whole – reveals a deeply American way of thinking about law and order and civil liberties: that anything is fair game once someone is considered a “criminal”. It’s an idea that has been sent into overdrive in the Trump years, where “criminal” has become a catch-all for the most evil, dangerous and undesirable in our communities, and shorthand for referencing anyone society doesn’t want to deal with.Trump ran on a campaign of hate, and the voters who helped cement that hatred and codify it into policy are now encountering the kind of state-sanctioned violence they endorsed at the ballot box.Still, to say “I told you so” in a moment like this is not only useless, it feels like a cruel understatement when the thing you were warning about is so destructive.So what can we learn from this? US leadership is clearly invested in the destruction of vulnerable American lives. If people who have been directly affected by Trump’s behaviour still find reasons to rationalize his leadership, it’s a reminder that ousting this regime will require the rest of us to speak out against tyranny and the establishment politics that got us here in the first place.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But outrageousness has become the name of the gameThu 19 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 14.19 EDTShareNational tragedyused to bring national unity. If only momentarily, partisanship was put aside, and people of all political persuasions came together.No more. The nation received a startling reminder of that sad fact on Sunday when the Republican senator Mike Lee went online to share his reaction to the weekend’shorrible shootingof two Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses.“This is what happens,” Lee wrote in a since-removed post on X, “When Marxists don’t get their way.” Accompanying this ugly, unfounded comment was a photo of the suspect in the shooting, Vance Boelter, wearing what appears to be a latex face mask.As if that wasn’t enough, Lee posted another picture of Boelter under the caption “Nightmare on Waltz Street”, an apparent reference to the Minnesota governor and former Democratic nominee for vice-president, Tim Walz. During the 2024 campaign, Republicansaccusedhim of being soft on crime and mishandling the riots after the murder of George Floyd.So why not suggest that he is somehow to blame for the shootings?Shameful. Lee has dishonored the institution in which he serves, and he knows it.Republican Senate leaders should censure their colleague. If they do not, they will further shred whatever dignity is left in that body.Put in context, Lee’s posts show how far we have come from the vision and hopes of the founders of the American republic. Recall that James Madison, co-author of the Federalist Papers and fourth president of the US,warnedthat government by the people could become what he called a “spectacle … of turbulence and contention”, driven by passions to make decisions “adverse to the rights of others or the permanent and aggregate good of the community”.Madison preferred what he called a republic, a government in which representatives would display the wisdom necessary to “discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations”.Oddly enough, in October 2020, Lee channeled Madisonwhen he insisted“that our form of government in the United States is not a democracy, but a republic … Insofar as ‘democracy’ means ‘a political system in which government derives its powers from the consent of the governed’, then of course that accurately describes our system”. He continued: “But the word … is often used to describe … the view that it is the prerogative of government to reflexively carry out the will of the majority of its citizens.“Our system of government,” Lee noted, “is best described as a constitutional republic. Power is not found in mere majorities, but in carefully balanced power.” In that system, the job of the Senate, Lee suggested – citing Thomas Jefferson – is to cool “hot passions … It’s where consensus is forged, as senators reach compromise across regional, cultural, and partisan lines.”Perhaps the senator has forgotten those lines.His posts about theMinnesotashootings seem designed to further fuel the “hot passions” of our political moment, rather than to “cool” them. They surely do not help build consensus across party lines.Now Lee’s agenda seems different. He wants to show his Maga scapegoating bona fides by conjuring leftist plots as an explanation for every problem.And he is not the only member of the Maga crowd to do so. He was joined by Elon Musk, who wrote on X: “The far left is murderously violent.” Musk reposted the following from a person who identifies herself with these words: “GOD | #MAGA | Freedom |#Trump2024 | Constitutionalist | America First | Shall Not Be Infringed | USMC Wife”.“The left kills the CEO of United Healthcare. Kills two Israeli ambassadors staffers. Attempts twice to assassinate the President. Doxes and attempts to murder federal ICE agents and Police – all week. And now kills a MN state rep and her husband and injures a Senator and his wife. The left has become a full blown domestic terrorist organization.”Madison must be turning over in his grave.And, as to the evidence that supports Lee’s or Musk’s claims about the Minnesota suspect? There is none.Don’t forget that the president himselfhas frequently demonized“radical left lunatics” and labelled people Marxists. Last September, he blamed a “violent, radical-left monster” for the second attempt on his life.Using tragedy to demonize others and stoke fears about adversaries has become a new normal. No more rallying around the flag and doing the job that Madison thought political leaders in a representative democracy should and would do.In 2016, the Washington Post’s Karen Tumulty,writingin the wake of whatwas then the deadliest mass shootingin American history, suggested that “not since 9/11 has a moment like this brought the nation together, and that evaporated quickly. Since then, calamity seems only to drive the left and the right further apart, while faith in the nation’s institutions deteriorates further.”We know that Lee knows better than to do what he did on Sunday. He demonstrated that in 2020.So why, five years later, would he go after Walz or Marxists after a national tragedy? We can only speculate.Politicians like Leelive for and on social media. Legislating is hard; accumulating “likes” with a quick post is easier.Getting attention by being outrageous or provocative is the name of the game in whatis now referred toas the attention economy. Madison, who thought that any damage done by what he called “fractious leaders” would be limited to their local area, could never have imagined the gravitational pull of that economy or its global reach.Sadly, Lee’s posts are making him a winner in that economy. By Monday morning, the first of them had been viewed 5.3m times, and the second attracted 7.8m views.Not bad for someone with 799,000 followers on X.In a deeply divided nation riven by political sectarianism, Lee did what his partisan supporters expect him to do. Give no quarter. Be on the offensive. Push your point.These are the rules, even when a tragedy occurs. In fact, itincreasesthe “opportunity for free publicity” that people like Lee crave.But let’s be clear. While we can understand the forces that might explain why Lee turned tragedy into disinformation, that doesn’t mean we should accept or forgive him for doing so.In the kind of constitutional republic that Madison imagined and Lee once praised, tragedies like the murders in Minnesota should bring out the best in our leaders. Their dutywas, when Madison wrote, and remains today: “to remind us of our shared humanity, not deepen our political divides.”Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsUS SenateOpinionUS politicsMinnesotacommentShareReuse this content"

The court, controlled by career politicians in robes who were hand-selected for their loyalty to the right wing and their willingness to be wildly intellectually dishonest in pursuit of Republican policy objectives, has ended the right to abortion, desiccated the Voting Rights Act, made state gun regulations nearly impossible and declared the president functionally immune to criminal law. Many of us waited, with a mixture and terror and disgust, to see what cruelties the court would deliver for us in 2025.I am a trans teenager. This is what it means to hate the shape of your own skin | Elsie ThwaitesRead moreThe justices decided to start by attacking vulnerable children. In a 6-3 split, the court’s conservativesruled on Wednesdaythat Tennessee’s law banning transition-related healthcare for minors can remain in effect. The law prohibits hormone therapies and surgeries only for their use in treating gender dysphoria; cisgender minors retain access to these drugs. The statute is on its face sex-specific and designed to mandate certain forms of gender conformity: the care that it bans, it bans on the basis of a patient’s sex. This is in straightforward violation of the 14th amendment’s equal protection clause, which has long been interpreted to ban facially sex-discriminatory laws and those that encourage sex-role stereotyping. The court decided to ignore this precedent and the plain intent of Tennessee’s statute, and in the process it both imposed a cruel and needless deprivation on trans children and their families, and also substantially weakened constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the sexes.The ruling in United States v Skrmetti is likely to shield other bans on transition-related healthcare for minors, which are now on the books in most states. That alone will have a devastating impact on trans children, whom studies consistently show fare best under an affirmative model of care that retains the option to delay puberty or pursue cross-sex hormones – options that the court has now removed from these children and their parents. But the opinion’s reasoning suggests something broader, and darker, about the status of trans people under the law – with dire implications for queer people, women and anyone else not interested in or suited to living a neatly gender-conforming life. For in seeking to uphold Tennessee’s care ban, the court circumvented sex equality provisions in a way that seems to render moot much of the 14th amendment’s applicability to sex discrimination cases. Facially sex-discriminatory statutes are now broadly permissible, the court suggests, so long as they impose gendered limits on the conduct of people of both sexes.The reasoning, such as it is, of the majority in Skrmetti is thus: because the Tennessee law does not allow either assigned-male nor assigned-female minors to access transition-related care, the law must therefore not be sex discriminatory. This logic is almost laughably bad-faith: Tennessee’s ban explicitly prohibits patients from accessing medicine on the basis of their sex, prohibiting male-assigned patients from accessing estrogen while permitting female-assigned patients to access it, and barring female-assigned patients from accessing testosterone while allowing it to be prescribed to male-assigned ones. Sex is the sole determining characteristic: it is sex that, under Tennessee’s law, licenses conduct for some individuals and prohibits the same conduct for others.Facial sex discrimination, then, is not impermissible, according to the court, and not even subject to heightened scrutiny. Rather, all that functionally remains of the constitution’s protection against sex inequality is a bar on “invidious sex discrimination”, a subjective and difficult to prove standard that much functional mistreatment of people on the basis of their sex or gender identity will fail to meet. The court seemingly goes out of its way to ensure that the obvious and plain anti-trans malice that motivates this law will not meet that threshold – claiming, preposterously, that trans people are not distinct enough, and have not suffered enough as a class, to be identifiable as a targeted group deserving of legal protection. What results is a kind of separate-but-equal logic of sex discrimination, in which persons of all sexes and genders are barred from opportunities that only people of certain sexes or genders require. The court has elevated this plain discrimination into a kind of parody of equality.What’s left of equal protection? Over the past few years, the court has embarked on a project of allowing greater and greater discrimination against LGBTQ+ persons, carving out vast exceptions to allow their mistreatment under frameworks such as public accommodations civil rights law and staggeringly expansive understandings of religious freedom rights. Now, it has licensed states, too, to target trans people, and in the process, it has given them further leeway to discriminate against cis women. Skrmetti, after all, would not be possible without Dobbs, the supreme court’s most sweeping bigoted assertion that there is no sex discrimination in place when a medical procedure that is only needed on the basis of sex is prohibited to those who do and do not require it alike.Skrmetti, which erodes sex equality under the 14th amendment, does not take aim at Bostock, the 2020 decision that found that discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity were prohibited under the sex equality provision of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. But it is hard to imagine that a court with so much hostility towards the civil rights claims of the historically marginalized will continue to find that gay and trans people can claim protection from discrimination under that law, either. It is not hard to imagine Skrmetti, along with Dobbs, being the opening salvos in a broader legal assault on the status of women and queer people – one that removes our rights one by one, making us more and more vulnerable, and sanctioning more and more of our derision, degradation and unfreedom. At the very least, this week, the court ruled that gender conformity can be enforced, at least on children, by the state. All queer people – and all cis women who aspire to be free – have had their dignity demeaned as a result.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtOpinionTransgenderLaw (US)GenderWomencommentShareReuse this content"

How has No Kings managed to unite it?Emma BrockesA new slogan has offered a non-partisan rallying point – and last weekend, protests overshadowed the president’s weird military paradeThu 19 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 06.45 EDTShareTwo months ago, around the US, mass demonstrations against Donald Trump were organised in what felt like the beginning of the great unfreezing of the popular movement. Since the inauguration in January there have been plenty of ad-hoc anti-Trump protests, but compared to the huge numbers that turned out in 2017 – half a millionat the Women’s Marchin Washington DC alone – the response has been muted. What was the point? The threat was so large, and the failure of the first movement apparently so great, that Americans have been suffering from what appeared to be a case of embarrassed paralysis: a sense, at once sheepish and depressed, that pink hats weren’t moving the needle on this one.It looks as if that thinking has changed. On Saturday, in a follow-up to the protests in April, more than 2,000coordinated marches took placein the US, organised by multiple groups under the umbrella No Kings Day and attended by numbers that at a glance seem startling. While in the capital on Saturday, Trump oversaw his weird, sparsely attended Kim Jong-un stylemilitary parade, an estimated 5 million people country-wide took to the streets to protest peacefully against him, includingan estimated80,000 in Philadelphia,75,000 in Chicago,50,000 in New York,20,000 in Phoenix, and7,000 in Honolulu. More heartening still were the numbers from deep red states, such as the2,000 odd protesterswho gathered in Mobile, Alabama, and a reported4,000 in Louisville, Kentucky.These protests were different in nature to their earlier incarnations, according to the accounts of some of those in attendance. I was in New York last month and friends who’d been at the march in April recounted, with amusement and despair, how few young people had shown up. In addition, said a friend, an elderly demonstrator marching close to them had shushed the crowd and put her fingers in her ears, and another set of women had started dancing, obliviously, to the music being played by pro-Trump counter-protesters on the sidelines. All successful protests require participants to forgive each other their differences, but we shook with laughter as he told us how hopeless and uninspiring – “it’s a protest sweetie, what did you expect?” – he’d found some of his fellow marchers.It was a different story on Saturday. The crowds were bigger – by some estimates, thelargest country-wide demonstrationsever recorded – younger, more energised and more focused. There was, I gather, a sense of urgency unleashed by the feeling not only that these protests were long overdue but that, after Trump’s deployment of the national guard in LA, some critical line had been crossed. Meanwhile, as a unifying slogan, the No Kings thing really seems to be working. When I first heard the phrase I thought it was limp – my forelock-tugging Pavlovian response to the word “king” and any reference to monarchy, I guess.I forgot: Americans presented with the same word go to George III not Charles III, and the signs on Saturday took up No Kings with real relish. This is a significant victory, given how hard it is to unite diverse constituencies under a single, snappy umbrella. There were a lot of very funny signs on the marches (some standouts: “Only he could ruin tacos”; “If Kamala were president we’d be at brunch” and my favourite, “Trump cheats at golf”.) But overarching them all was a slogan that in the most efficient way possible presented multiple groups with a non-partisan way to come out against Trump.So far, No Kings has also avoided some of the mistakes of the Women’s March, in which the celebrity of the organisers came to overshadow and poison the movement. The No Kings motif was coined earlier this year by the progressive group 50501 – the name is a reference to 50 protests, 50 states, one movement – and was created before the 17 February demonstrations as an alternative to the hashtag #NotMyPresidentsDay, which it was felt, shrewdly, struck the wrong tone. Instead, the group launched the phrase “No Kings on Presidents Day,” which by this month had compacted down into No Kings Day. As yet, 50501, which grew out of a Reddit post, has no identifiable leaders.This makes it a much harder target for Trump’s “black propagandists” to divide protesters via their political differences. Instead, No Kings seems to be offering a very broad on-ramp to protesters by way of a story that is simple and true: that opposition to Trump’s autocratic style is an act of patriotism with its roots in the country’s very foundations.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsProtestOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump’s obscene plans for aGaza “riviera”and “humanitarian” initiatives that breach humanitarian principles were creating distance with the US, and European governments were starting to craft their own course.France and Saudi Arabia hadplanned a conferenceon the two-state solution, which might have led to Paris’s recognition of Palestinian statehood. More significantly, the EU hadaccepted a reviewof the EU-Israel association agreement, which, in light of Israel’s war crimes, should lead to the suspension of EU preferential trade with Tel Aviv, but now may not.However, Israel’s military attack on Iran and the US’s ambiguous yet evident support for this belligerence have upended Europe’s shift towards greater autonomy and moral clarity.Of course, there is no love for the Iranian regime in EU capitals because of its human rights violations and military cooperation with Russia, notably in the war in Ukraine. Moreover, Europe rightly remains adamant that Iran should not have nuclear weapons. There is particular alarm over the International Atomic Energy Agency’s mostrecent reporton Iran’s breaches of the non-proliferation treaty.But we have traditionally stood firm on the need to resolve the Iranian nuclear question through diplomacy. This is why in the early 2000s European negotiators invented the “E3/EU format”, comprising diplomats from France, Germany and the UK alongside the EU high representative to mediate on Iran’s nuclear file.Today that world is gone. When Trump launched a direct negotiation with Iran, Europe was sidelined, excluded from any mediation process. Now, with Israel’s military assault on Iran, we have failed to position ourselves with the necessary clarity: where was the denunciation of the bombing as a breach of the UN charter (article 2), and the additional protocol to the Geneva conventions (article 56), which specifically prohibits attacks against a state’s nuclear facilities? It is one thing to uphold Israel’s (or any other state’s) right to self-defence. Quite another to legitimise pre-emptive strikes.This chronic impotence arises because Europe has traditionally viewed the world through a transatlantic lens. On most international issues, it has, for decades, worked hand-in-glove with Washington, using aid, trade, diplomacy, sanctions, defence and EU integration to support US foreign policy aims, convinced that the overarching values and interests were shared.Only on rare occasions have European countries openly opposed the US – as France and Germany did with the Bush administration over the US-led war on Iraq in 2003. Even where there is a difference of approach, Europe has sought to influence US foreign policy by mitigating its hard edges rather than thwarting it. European mediation on the Iran nuclear weapons question, for example, led to the joint comprehensive plan of action in 2015. And as the global rivalry between the US and China deepened, EU governments distanced themselves from US calls for decoupling the western and Chinese economies, instead promoting the softer alternative of “de-risking”.Trump’s foreign policy wrecking ball, however, has created a world in which Europeans have to stand on their own feet. And they are struggling.OnUkraine, Europe has learned the hard way and stands firm, maintaining financial and military assistance to Kyiv while exploring ways of filling the gaps in the event of US disengagement.But apart from Ukraine, we are at a loss. It is true that Europe has toughened up on Beijing; it is no longer starry-eyed about China’sbelt and road initiativeand the strategic risk posed by Beijing’s policies in Europe. The EU has started screening Chinese investments in Europe andraised tariffson Chinese electric vehicles.But Trump’s mixed signals mean that Europe needs to figure out alone what it thinks and wants from Beijing. The EU cannot afford a trade war on multiple fronts, especially if its own trade talks with Washington derail.European governments also know that there is no way they can meet climate neutrality by 2050, now enshrined in law, without cooperating with China, which is a leader in the green economy. Even in the unlikely event of a comprehensive “deal” between Trump and Xi Jinping, it’s hard to imagine Europeans reverting to the old days in which China was solely viewed as an economic partner and ally in defence of multilateralism. Europeans need to develop their own ideas and policies independently of an erratic White House, but they don’t know how to get there.In its political wavering on the latest war, Europe has neither won favour from Washington nor improved its standing with Israel. In the meantime, it has lost all credibility as an honest broker with Iran. The cherry on the cake is that Russia has angled itself as a possible mediator instead, with Trump winking at this preposterous proposition.The risk is that Europe will also now block its own route to a more morally principled approach to the horrors in Gaza: the coming days will tell if the EU suspends its trade agreement with Israel, or if that too is put on the back burner.Ukraine is Europe’s foremost security interest. Yet war, chaos and nuclear proliferation in the Middle East – which could be the unwanted consequence of the Israel-Iran war – are more consequential for Europe than for the US. So far, the European response is a far cry from thought or action, independent of the US.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It said she would “draw a line in the sand” and “get the job done”. She did not know what it might cost or when it might actually open. But since it would be at least eight years overdue, no one need really care.Every other spending minister has a right to howl. Each day of the year, Alexander signs away £20m to fund a 12-year-oldvanity projectof a Tory prime minister, David Cameron. That is to meet HS2’s current Treasury subsidy of£7bn a year.Alexander’s statement clearly indicated that she was forbidden to challenge any aspect of the project beyond the ineptitude of its management. This enabled her to play the familiar Starmer card of blaming the opposition for everything that goes wrong, and imply that in her hands all would be fine. We have heard this from a decade of HS2 ministers, not one of whom was in office long enough to withstand its lobbies.It is a measure of the rottenness of British government that Cameron’s project dazzled politicians of both parties as well as the media establishment. Labour’s Ed Balls once said it would cancel HS2 if itcosts went beyond the then £50bnprice tag. But infrastructure is a religious creed. Its shrines, once sanctified by the Treasury, are beyond criticism.HS2 is clearly a project too big to stop. Everyone I have ever known in government agrees it was a mistake. But to say so in political circles is like questioning the virgin birth. The result is that no transport secretary, no chancellor and no prime minister has felt strong enough to order cancellation.Boris Johnson, who had once dismissed HS2 as a “gimmick”, merely hacked off its north-east limb. Rishi Sunak hacked off its north-west one. In doing so they slashed whatever value still attached to the project as a whole. It is now no more than a surplus line from an isolated station in central Birmingham to Acton in London, and possibly on to one of London’s least busy terminuses, Euston.Alexander is so in awe of HS2 that she appears to have reversed Sunak’s bizarre insistence that new extension be privately financed. This will give Eustonfour to six extra platforms. It is simply astonishing expenditure, a staggering £6bn for a few platforms. You could rebuild London’s most derelict hospitals with that. No one mentons that HS2 at current costs will pocket about £2,000 each from the average British taxpayer.HS2’s contractorswere toldthat they would be reimbursed for all their costs, plus inflation plus profit. Typical of Whitehall project management, this was insane. It meant that absolutely nobody had an interest in restraining costs rather than inflating them. That is how the company’s “world class” bosses havelong earned£400,000-£600,000 a year, while more than 40 senior staffearn over £150,000.The result is that HS2’s 30,000 staff, officials and consultants, its Whitehall civil servants, local councils and businesses, have formed a massive lobby for continuation. Johnson’s Downing Street transport adviser, Andrew Gilligan,tells of officialswho “lied, covered up and fired whistle-blowers”. One whistleblower known to me felt as though he was working for the mafia. The lobby sent a deputation to the Guardian to explain to me why my opposition was so wrong. The former owner of the Euston sitecalled the projecta giant “Ponzischeme, a gravy train to nowhere”. And they all walk away with their pay, perks and honours intact. It is a classic of Britain’s “deep state” at work.Alexander is now repeating the old ministerial mantra that the project will be fine if managed by her. It always starts with more reports. Alexander is now waiting for another Wild report. It follows theOakervee reviewand countless others fromStephen Glaister, the National Audit Office and thepublic accounts committee. All warn of trouble ahead. All have been ignored.The continued uncertainty over HS2 costs can only mean continued increases. The project is now way below normal Treasury value for money estimates, and survives only by the grace of politics. Its cancellation would of course cost more money. But of the currently assumed £100bn, only between £30bn and £40bnhas been spent. There is still about £60bn needed for what is a purely political gesture of growth machismo.Keir Starmer is fond these days of parroting Reform’s leader, Nigel Farage. He should listen to what Faragesaid on Wednesday: “Scrap HS2”, and spend the money on something worthwhile.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHS2OpinionLabourRail transportcommentShareReuse this content"

He is far from the first warmonger to do soThu 19 Jun 2025 10.59 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 13.27 EDTShareThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has invoked the Iranian regime’s heinous women’s rights record to justify his heinous war on Iran. This is the man whose genocide of Palestinians in Gazakilled more women and childrenin its first year than the equivalent period of any other conflict over the past two decades.“They’ve impoverished you, they’ve given you misery, they’ve given you death, they’ve given you terror, they shoot down your women, leaving this brave, unbelievable woman, Mahsa Amini, to bleed on the sidewalk for not covering her hair,” hetold Iraniansin an interview with Iran International.It is incredible to hear Netanyahu call on the Iranian people to rise up against the very things he has subjected Palestinians to. But it is not surprising. I am all too familiar with the ways imperialists, occupiers and invaders weaponise Muslim women’s bodies and rights to justify their wars.As an Egyptian, I know that colonisers such as Evelyn Baring, the 1st Earl of Cromer and the de facto ruler of Egypt between 1883 and 1907, supported greater rights for Egyptian women while being an anti-suffragist back home. Far from emancipating Egyptian women, Baring made it almost impossible for those opposed to the occupation and European influence to criticise traditions or religious practices without looking as though they were taking the side of the west.As a woman of Muslim descent, I remember vividly the US claiming its invasion of Afghanistan was to “liberate” women from the Taliban’s misogyny. Twenty years after that reckless invasion, an increasingly disastrous war and occupation, and a criminally chaoticwithdrawal from Afghanistan, the Taliban once again rule.Even worse and more shamefully, as a feminist I know that, unlike Afghan feminists, white feminists in the US were cheerleaders of that invasion, failing to understand the dangers of imperial powers co-opting women’s rights. Leaders of the Feminist Majority Foundation – including Eleanor Smeal, the former head of the National Organization for Women – attended events at the state department and met administration officials. The spring 2002 issue of Ms magazine called the invasion a “coalition of hope”.“As we achieve our objective, we are also clearing the path for you to achieve your freedom,”said Netanyahuin another televised speech aimed at Iranians. “This is your opportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard. Woman, life, freedom – zan, zendegi, azadi.”Thedeath of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, in a hospital in Iran in September 2022 days after being detained by the regime’s “morality police” for allegedly not complying with the country’s hijab regulation, sparked the feminist “woman, life, freedom” revolution. Women, queer people and marginalised minorities in Iran rose up to fight not only the regime’s compulsory hijab law but its decades of repression.They did not need Netanyahu to fight for their freedom then, nor do they need him now. On the contrary, his attempt to co-opt the courageous uprising is the quickest way to discredit feminism itself – often dismissed as “western” and alien. Wars and invasions harm, not strengthen, revolutions. As an Egyptian, I know all too well that the Egyptian regime tried its hardest to claim our25 January revolutionin 2011 was being masterminded from abroad.Easy regime change in Tehran is a nice idea. But look to history: it’s a near-impossible one | Martin KettleRead moreProtecting the “liberal” and “western” values of women’s rights is an easy moral cover for what is an invasion, war or colonisation always motivated by a desire for power, resources or both. If western leaders really cared so much about female bodily autonomy, perhaps they could look closer to home. The same George W Bush who claimed to defend women from the burqa and the Taliban was the same George W Bush who, on his first day in office, cut off funding to any international family-planning organisations that offered abortion services or counselling.Would the white feminists call for the invasion of the US today, where a premature baby was extracted from the decaying body of a brain-dead Black woman who, against the wishes of her partner and family, wastreated like an incubatorbecause of the state of Georgia’s ban on abortion? The patriarchy-atop-theocracy melange of Iran’s “morality police” is easier to see because it is so visibly expressed in the enforced hijab. But what is the enforced pregnancy of the Christian zealots in the US but a melange of patriarchy built atop theocracy right there?Wars and invasions do not liberate women. Ask the women of Afghanistan today. Every time an imperial power claims to “liberate” women from “their” men, those men will seek to wrestle back control over “their women” when the invaders are gone. Taliban 2.0 have banned girls’ education and barred women from working in public and private sectors, except for Afghan healthcare and a few other departments. They have barred women from travelling long distances by road or air unless accompanied by a male relative, and from visiting public places such as parks, gyms and bathhouses without a male relative. The Taliban have shut down even women-only beauty salons.As a feminist, I marvelled at and cheered on fellow feminists in Iran rising up for woman, life, freedom.

Molly! God! I was devastated.”The play imagines two days in the writers’ room of A Country Practice, dreaming up what they went through to kill off Molly Jones, arguably the show’s most beloved character – played with charm, wit and truth by actor Anne Tenney. Tenney had become Australia’s sweetheart and one of its biggest TV stars. It was a big deal to off her.It’s a television death that really meant something to the viewers at the time, and in the four decades since it broadcast in June 1985. When I asked people about their memories of the episode, two responses stood out.The theatre director Lee Lewis, a teenager in rural Goulburn at the time, wore funeral blacks to watch the episode: “I lived my life through the television – it was an important window into other lives, growing up in the country. Molly was dying, and I was dressing in black for her funeral.”A Country Practice: the 10 best moments in Australia’s beloved soap – sortedRead moreKate Mulvany, who’s gone on to be an actor and television writer herself, remembers the night of Molly’s death profoundly. Eight years old when it aired, “I was so grief-stricken afterwards that I asked to sleep in my parents’ bed. I wet the pillowcase with inconsolable tears, then changed the pillowcases before my parents came to bed so that they didn’t think I’d had some kind of ‘accident’. That’s how much I cried.”Why is it consistently on lists of the best episodes ofAustralian television? Why is it such a formative memory for so many?After watching it at least 30 times, I think it’s because the episode, written by the screenwriter Judith Colquhoun (who wrote more than 100 episodes of A Country Practice and pretty much every other great show of the 80s, 90s and noughties), provides a blueprint for the perfect death.Of course, there’s nothing perfect about a young mother dying of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in her late 20s but the way Molly dies is how most of us would wish to go: at home surrounded by people we love.Molly died over a 14-episode arc, for a couple of reasons: the late James Davern, the creator of A Country Practice, hoped his star might change her mind and stay on the show. If she was determined to leave, he wanted his team of writers to remember that children loved Molly, and he didn’t want to traumatise them. The audience lived through the progression of her illness. They were there for the first rumblings of ill health, the diagnosis, the treatment – just as they’d been there in the years before as Molly had a baby, lost a baby, ran for council and tied herself to trees.Her death ultimately became about the importance of love and community, and believing in a future of beauty even though you’re not going to be there. Molly is brought home from the hospital to die on her beloved farm, which has been painted lovingly by her community while she was in hospital.How Molly’s death on A Country Practice touched a nation: ‘the writers’ room was shedding tears’Read moreIn the days leading up to her death, as an audience, we’re offered a glimpse into her world. There’s the barbecue with her friends, each of them having time to say goodbye and letting her know how much she means to them. The uneasy discussion with her best friend, Vicky (played with an exquisite vulnerability by the latePenny Cook), about the mothering Molly’s daughter might need when Molly is gone. A heartbreaking and practical conversation with her husband, Brendan (a beautifully underrated performance from Shane Withington), about the importance of him allowing himself to move on: “We’ve had a perfect marriage … well, nearly. And you can’t live with just a memory.”These are the conversations we dream of having with those we love, and often circumstances or a lack of emotional courage prevent us from having them.These hard conversations never become saccharine. You can feel the love these actors all have for each other and their sadness at losing their colleague but there also is humour. Somehow, while our beloved friend Molly is being taken away from us before the final ad break, we’re laughing at one character marinating a steak with garlic (these are tomato sauce people!), and Molly is joking about who Brendan needs to stay away from after she’s dead.Nothing is left unsaid. Even though she is so young, Molly has had a full life, she’s accepted her fate and she’s loved to her final moment. Maybe that’s why we still love this incredible episode of television 40 years later – because who among us wouldn’t want the same when our screen fades to black?Melanie Tait is a playwright and journalist living in SydneyExplore more on these topicsAustralian televisionOpinionSoap operaDeath and dyingcommentShareReuse this content"

Welcome to the 93% ClubAlastair CampbellThe civil service, judiciary and media are still dominated by the privately educated 7%. Lasting change is not a pipe dream – but it’s up to usThu 19 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 11.06 EDTShareFor the first time in our history, we have a cabinet made up entirely of people who went to state schools. Several, including prime minister Keir Starmer, come from working-class backgrounds; some, such as deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, were raised in conditions of poverty that feel as if they ought to belong to another age.So far so good. What better signs could one ask for to show that Britain is a meritocracy, social mobility is real and anyone can rise to the top provided they have talent, commitment and determination?And yet it might be that in some ways these are exceptions that prove a rule: the rule being that for all the changes made down the years, a private education continues to give a disproportionate advantage to those – currently 7% – who use it. Yes, we have a state-educated cabinet and more state-schooled MPs than ever. Yet more broadly throughout the establishment, when looking at senior positions across Whitehall, the judiciary, law, media and finance, the 7% club continues to hold a disproportionate presence, and therefore to exercise disproportionate cultural and political power.That 7% figure is what gave rise to the93% Club, the UK’s network for state-educated people. Its latest report, theBig State School Survey, merits careful reading by anyone who thinks that because we have the most working-class cabinet of our lifetime, the old class divides are gone and the dream of genuine social mobility has been delivered.The survey suggests that though state-educated students may be the majority by far, it is the 93% who have to fit in with the attitudes and actions of the 7% rather than the other way round. The overwhelming sense of the research is that talk of class continues to be brushed aside as impolite conversation – yet it continues to determine who will thrive, who will falter and who is forced to adopt a new cultural identity just to get into the room.What the survey does is show the emotional cost of having to leave parts of your identity and community behind to thrive. It brings a darker side of social mobility into the light.The journey starts at university. For many, the culture shock is instant. Nearly three-quarters of all state school students reported experiencing it. That figure rises to 91% among those from working-class backgrounds, and 94% of students believe that university culture naturally caters to the wealthy.The little things add up. Three in four students say they miss out on formals and dinners (a component of life at universities such as Oxford and Cambridge). Many say they can’t afford to join sports teams or take part in extracurricular activities. The result is not just feeling out of place but feeling like the place was never meant for you despite your having worked hard to get there.The divide doesn’t end with a degree. In fact, it deepens: 93% of working-class professionals say their background clashes with workplace culture. Many end up straddling two worlds, the one they came from and the one they now operate in, feeling that they don’t fully belong to either.To fit in, people say they start to change. Accent. Clothes. Hobbies. Even what they eat and drink. These are not small cosmetic tweaks. They’re survival tactics in environments that reward polish over potential.And while a lot of this happens quietly – with a smile, a nod, a stiff upper lip mentality – the impact is loud and lasting; 61% of respondents said they had to leave their community behind to progress. Nearly half said their friendships changed. Some grew distant from their families. This is not social mobility – it’s a social trade-off.I’ve long been a fan of the 93% Club, not least because its 29-year-old founder, Sophie Pender, knows first-hand what it means to come from nothing and make it in the City with few tools or support at her disposal. And what’s refreshing about what her organisation is doing is that it’s not accepting the status quo or burning it down. Instead, it is retooling the idea of an old boys’ network to serve state school graduates – an old boys’ and old girls’ network for the many, not the few, you might say.The question now is: do we want a country where success still depends on knowing the right people, sounding the right way and fitting into the right mould? Or do we want one where talent is prized and diversity of thought guaranteed?State schools should set up debating clubs, says senior Eton leaderRead moreReal social mobility shouldn’t come at the cost of your character. It shouldn’t mean sanding down your accent, hiding where you’re from or second-guessing how you dress, speak or behave. It should mean being able to walk into any room and be taken seriously. A cabinet that reflects that reality is a start – but it can’t be the end goal.If we want lasting change, we need more than symbolism – we need infrastructure. A nationwide state-school alumni network that offers the kind of cultural capital, career support and peer sponsorship long taken for granted by the privately educated. A network that not only helps people navigate elite spaces but also mobilises them to rework the cultures within them. The 93% Club has already made significant strides in creating this infrastructure, but it still has work to do. They’re asking others to join in – to share their time, open doors and help rewire the systems that still quietly reward one kind of background over another.It’s not a pipe dream. It’s a proven model that private schools have used for centuries. It’s high time we repurposed it to build a country where people can succeed by not leaving their identity at the door but by walking through it the way they are.Alastair Campbell is a former journalist turned strategist and spokesperson for the Labour party.

Rumours of a foreigner assaulting a local woman resulted in groups roaming through a small British town, breaking windows of homes belonging to “outsiders”. A few days later, the police attempted to stop mobs from reaching another nearby multiracial area. Eventually they broke through, ransacking shops and burning down a house, while local media reported that the violence had developed into “something like a fever”.Sound familiar? This isn’t Ballymena, the County Antrim town inNorthern Irelandthat has seen several nights of unrest in which immigrant homes were attacked after reports of an alleged sexual assault on a local girl by two teenagers, who had a Romanian interpreter read them the charges. These incidents actually took place more than a century ago, during the summer of 1919, as racial violence spread throughout south Wales, eventually reaching Cardiff and the diverse district of Tiger Bay.Back then, a number of things were blamed for the violence, among them a lack of jobs and housing for returning white servicemen, many of whom were disgusted by the relationships between local women and black men who had served in the merchant navy and madeWalestheir home during the first world war. The media also played their part. The South Wales Daily News claimed that it had never seen “so black a blot on an otherwise fair and thriving town”, before suggesting a fire like the Great Fire of London “would be a godsend” that could cleanse Tiger Bay (now known as Butetown).In Ballymena, the spark was the alleged attempted rape, coupled with the recent influx of immigrants who rioters said have “invaded”, “infested” and “ruined” their community. In the 2001 census, just 14,300 people, or 0.8% of the overall population of Northern Ireland, belonged to a minority ethnic group. By 2021, it was 65,600 people, or 3.4%. Still small numbers compared with England (18%), orScotland(11%), but each of those countries saw a similar outburst of racial violence when immigration was at a comparable level.England also witnessed riots in 1919. There was violence in North Shields and Liverpool, where a sailor called Charles Wooten drowned after beingchased by a mob. Liverpool again saw Ballymena-esque scenes in 1948 when a seamen’s hostel was assaulted and in 1972 when a racially mixed housing estate was attacked by skinheads. (Housing is still a flashpoint; last year, at leasteight African families– half of them including nurses – were forced toflee an estate in Antrim town.) In between those incidents in Liverpool there were the race riots in Nottingham and Notting Hill in London in 1958, followed by theracist murder of Kelso Cochranein the capital by teddy boys a year later.Throughout the 1970s, the rise of the far-right National Front, which had 12,000 members at its peak, created a dangerous environment in England: the historian Peter Fryer estimated that between 1976 and 1981, 31 people had beenmurdered by racistsin Southall, Brick Lane (both in London), Swindon, Manchester and Leeds. Politicians also inflamed the issue: in 1978, in an attempt to outflank the NF, Margaret Thatcher claimed in an interview that “People are really rather afraid that this country might be swamped by people with a different culture.”There’s a much more recent history of violence in England too: last summer, mobs attacked mosques, hotels housing migrants and the homes of “foreigners” in Hull, Hartlepool, Manchester and Liverpool after the murder of three children in Southport.Scotland also had its, albeit delayed, racial reckoning. Although Glasgow saw race riots in 1919, it wasn’t until 1989 and the murder of Somali student Axmed Sheekh that a group of activists and Black Scots forced a conversation about racism north of the border, which until then had been presented as an “English disease”. Anti-racist activists were told that there wasn’t a problem because there simply weren’t any black or brown people in Scotland. In 1991, ethnic minorities accounted for 1% of the population, but a Runnymede Trust report showed that there had been ahuge spike in racist assaultsnorth of the border as these tiny communities became more visible.There’s an established pattern that Ballymena is a part of: an influx of immigrants, hostility to their presence, a denial that there is a problem with xenophobia, then a spark followed by indiscriminate violence. But many people in Britain can’t see this pattern – or choose not to.The years 1981, 2001 and 2011 linger in the memory and are what many people think of when they hear the phrase “race riot” in a British context. Each one of those years saw unrest in black and brown communitiestriggered by policing(1981),far-right activity(2001) and thekilling of Mark Duggan(2011), followed by hand-wringing and commentators wondering where Britain went wrong on race. The events of 1919, 1948 and 1972 dissolve quickly into the forgotten past, footnotes at best; they are certainly not woven into the national story of racial violence.These incidents – of white violence – are presented in isolation. In Ballymena, it’s impossible to understand what’s happening without engaging with the recent history of Northern Ireland. The fact that most of the people attacking immigrants and the police were Protestants whose own families emigrated to Ireland generations before places the violence not just in the context of the Troubles, but also British colonialism. But they’re also part of a continuum, one that links different eras and parts of the United Kingdom.This history of violence is part of an established pattern that isn’t inevitable but instead manufactured by a combination of political failings, distorted media coverage and opportunism by the far right.It is this context that made Keir Starmer’s“island of strangers” speechso offensive. That language isn’t benign; it helps set the stage for another inevitable spate of attacks. Less than a month after the speech, Ballymena exploded. Now the rhetoric doesn’t just seem opportunistic but dangerous, a shameful decision that now sits alongside Thatcher’s “swamped” comments as a political intervention that further causes divisions for short-term gains. The NF collapsed in the 80s, but today Reform – led by a man whosepolitical herois Enoch Powell – is pulling Labour to the right.What happens next in Northern Ireland is crucial. History shows that in the UK it’s often the victims of racial violence who are blamed. After 1919 in Wales, there was a voluntary repatriation scheme, while authorities installed a new piece of draconian immigration legislation, which forced all seamen to carry an identity card, known as a “certificate of nationality and identity issued to a British Colonial Seaman”. It was a measure that treated them like criminals.Immigrants have already started to leave Ballymena but, as in Cardiff, many will stay. Their lives will be shaped by whether or not political leadership learns the lessons of Britain’s history of racial violence.Lanre Bakare is an arts and culture correspondent for the Guardian.

The actor, fresh from a stint as Emcee in the London run of Cabaret, and about to reprise the roleon Broadway, speaks in a poised, purposeful, regal fashion. Each word is selected with care and weighed in his hand as if it were an avocado in the fruit and veg aisle, the gaps between words so lengthy that it isn’t always clear when he has finished speaking. Seated around the table in the south London studio where Porter is overseeing rehearsals for This Bitter Earth, which marks his UK directorial debut, are the playwright Harrison David Rivers and the actors Omari Douglas (It’s a Sin) and Alexander Lincoln (Emmerdale). Everyone maintains an attentive silence while Porter is speaking, until there can be no doubt that he has completed his thought.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“The …beautiful… part of this play,” he says, easing his feet out of a pair of marshmallow-soft cream-and-ebony moon boots and nudging them to one side, “is we get to watch two people who love each other try … time … and time … and time … andtimeagain … and they never give up … onthemselves… or on love. There is hope … We don’t have to be divided. Having conversations that are complicated is what makes the healing happen … without blame … without shame.”This Bitter Earth is a fragmentary, non-linear portrait of the passionate but strained relationship between two queer men in their late 20s and early 30s. The action ricochets back and forth across the years between 2012, when Barack Obama was still in the White House, and 2015, when Donald Trump (who goes entirely unmentioned) announced his own presidential campaign.Neil, played by Lincoln, is a white Black Lives Matter activist described in the dramatis personae as “an enthusiast [who] means well”, while Jesse (Douglas) is a Black playwright upbraided by Neil for his apparent lack of political engagement. Protest, though, can take many forms. As Jesse argues: “I’m living my fucking life! What else do you want from me?”View image in fullscreen‘I wish it felt different now’ … Alexander Lincoln and Omari Douglas in rehearsals for This Bitter Earth.Photograph: Danny KaanOnce the actors have read through a scene in which Neil expresses disappointment because Jesse gave only a passing greeting to his white activist friends, Porter turns to his actors: “Great. So what is this about? What bug is up your ass and what are you trying to incite?” While they debate the characters’ intentions, Rivers looks on. His play premiered in 2017, and he isn’t usually involved in new productions of it. “It’s fun for me to re-meet the play after eight years of living and the world shifting,” he says.Or not shifting. “I wish it felt different now. You write a play and you hope that you’ve solved all the problems. The dream is that people will pull out what you wrote and be, like, ‘Remember when we didn’t respect people and there was violence and we didn’t know how to talk with one another?’ The play is important now because we can step out of this room and into a very similar world. That’s sad. But let’s speak to it anew and try again to make a change.”“We have to keep trying!” booms Porter in his distinctively husky battle-cry.Back to the scene. Lincoln, wearing a grey singlet that shows off his tats, clearly comprehends what his character cannot: “Neil doesn’t see that simply stepping out of your house in the morning can be your protest.”View image in fullscreenHarrison David Rivers.Photograph: Danny KaanIt is an argument with which Porter can readily empathise. “Living is a protest,” he says. “Or walking down the street … wearing … ahat. When David Bowie does it, he’s a genius. When Kiss do it, they’re rock stars. Because they’rewhite.” He peers over the top of his glasses with a disdainful look. “But it’s just a hat. It’s … just … ahat. Now shut the fuck up!” In the space of one monologue, Porter has apparently slipped between the roles of director, memoirist and actor, his final admonition addressed to the fictional Neil rather than to anyone in the room. As a directing style, you might call it cubist.Rivers commends Porter for being “present” and for living “now, now, now”. He explains: “I think Billy’s urgency is being directed into the play.”When I ask whether the two actors recognise the sort of “whitesplaining” comments that Neil makes to Jesse, Douglas rolls his eyes: “Oh God, yes. If I told you about them, we’d be here all day.” I confess that I was wincing too, hearing echoes of myself in Neil’s patronising liberalism. “Why ‘wince’?” Porter demands across the table. “I would encourage you – andI’mnot interviewingyouhere – to take the ‘wince’ out of it. The openness to having the conversation is the point. ‘When you know better, do better,’ is what Maya Angelou always said. Now, when you know better and youdon’tdo better –that’swhen I’m comin’ at you!”This Bitter Earth is atSoho theatre, London, until 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatrePolitical theatreBlack Lives Matter movementActivismRaceBilly PorterOmari DouglasinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But his heart remains in Shropshire – the backdrop to his ambitious, grief-stricken latest recordThu 19 Jun 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 13.27 EDTShareThe sun is shining, birds are tweeting and a river gently flows just yards away as Jerskin Fendrix tells me about his love of growing up in Shropshire. “It was so gorgeous and majestic,” he says, sitting in the garden of a friend’s house where he spent a lot of time in his youth. “It was nature, forests and hills and then just normal teenage life. The combination of this numinous, big landscape and getting wasted in a cornfield with your mates listening to Kanye West on a Bluetooth speaker while seeing a massive sunset.”Such vivid scenes fill his latest album, Once Upon a Time … in Shropshire. The opening track, Beth’s Farm, captures an idyllic scene where animals roam and rural teens party. “I thought it was a really nice symbol of this naive innocence,” he says. “Trying to get across how bucolic and heavenly this was before it starts to get corrupted.”Jerskin Fendrix: SK1 – video.The corruption he speaks of is some recent personal turmoil that has at once intensified, sharpened and darkened the reflective lens he’s looking back through. “A close friend of mine killed himself,” he says. “Then more stuff happened, and more people died.” He wrote about it as a means of dealing with it, along with exploring the complexities and contradictions of grief. “We’re taught by songs or Hollywood films that someone dies and then there’s very slow strings and you cry for six months and it gradually gets better,” he says. “That’s not how it works. Sometimes it’s not as bad as you think, sometimes it’s way worse. It can be trivial, funny or sometimes it’s these massively different combinations at the same time. Death is the same thing as life – it’s as complicated and kaleidoscopically beautiful.”‘I never thought about Oscars’: Brutalist composer Daniel Blumberg on the happiness and horror of his big winRead moreOnce Upon a Time … in Shropshire reflects these vast, knotty emotions. It’s bold and dramatic, heart-wrenching, vulnerable, intimate and funny. From eruptive post-rock to sweeping chamber pop via avant classical explorations, tender ballads and group sing-alongs around the family piano, it’s a singular piece of work.Joscelin Dent-Pooley was assigned the name Jerskin Fendrix as a joke by a friend at school and it stuck. A trained pianist and violinist, he moved to London in the late 2010s to be in the band Famous, but soon began playing solo shows and collaborating with the likes of Black Midi. His 2020 debut album, Winterreise, touched on hyper-pop, warped electro and leftfield baritone ballads. It was a cult record but it caught the ear of acclaimed film director Yorgos Lanthimos, who has since employed Fendrix to score three films:Poor Things, Kinds of Kindness and the upcoming Bugonia. The former even landed Fendrix an Oscar nomination and he’s buzzing about the next one. “It’s gonna be sick,” he enthuses. “It’s a wild film. I’m very proud of it. We got a 90-piece orchestra, so it’s a big fucking score.”However, we are deliberately back on home soil to talk about his latest record. Which is not always an easy process. One of the people Fendrix lost during the writing of the record was his father, whose death was sudden and unexpected. Before many of his answers, he takes a long inhale and sits in silence before answering. He tailgates cigarette after cigarette, blazing his way through a pack of Camel Blues.View image in fullscreenIdyllic scene … Fendrix pictured in Shropshire.Photograph: Tim GuttWhile the album is rich and joyful, it also contains real pain and anguish. Fendrix stretched his voice to new places, both emotionally and in terms of its register. “I really pushed myself,” he says. “To have gone through so many things that were so unusual, new and testing, and then to make music that was safe and comfortable … it wouldn’t have been reflective.” You can hear on some songs that he is close to breaking. “I wanted to record it myself in my own little studio, and that was fairly brutal for my emotions,” he says. “This was not very long after my father had died, and it was probably a good process, but it was a pretty heavy thing to impose on myself. There are some takes that just felt like self-punishment. I was very isolated, but I always felt people were with me. Having those ghosts there, of the living as well as dead, was almost conversational.”Experiencing such loss so close to home, Fendrix basked in memories of growing up nestled around a close-knit group of friends and family, being daft, “getting ratted in the kitchen” at parties, and extracting beauty from the simple things you sometimes take for granted. “A lot of people who grow up somewhere remote are like, ‘Oh, it was shit and there was nothing to do’,” he says. “But being bored is fucking great because you invent things. Even if that’s just being a dumbass. One has permission to find their life beautiful and not a lot of people give themselves that, regardless of what your environment is. And that’s not necessarily somewhere idyllic or utopian but just to find a real deep, beautiful meaning in what’s happened to you.”At the beginning of our conversation, Fendrix said to remind me to ask him about the river in front of us, as it was important. So as our conversation wraps, I bring it up. Another deep breath and long silence. “My friend who died, we had his wake here,” he begins. “And he really loved nature.” With eerie synchronicity, we are now cowering in a corner because the heavens have opened. Fendrix sucks down one last cigarette while looking out at the droplets hitting the flowing stream. “A thing that happened that day really stuck with me: the water came all the way up to here, and the entire town was flooded overnight. It was like the river rose up to come and get him.”Once Upon a Time … in Shropshire is released via Untitled (Recs) on 10 OctoberIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

How do you rationalise– and, hopefully, enjoy –the fact that your audiences often encounter you as a beacon of beauty, sexuality and eroticism?GeroellheimerPeople can see me in whatever ways they want. As long as what I do brings them joy or helps them think about things, I don’t contemplate how they view me – it’s too abstract. When people share their opinions about me with me, I wonder who they’re talking about, but I go along with it to be polite.How do you move on and decompress after playing such intense roles?mansurzAfter Showgirls and Bound, I had so much residual energy that I ended up going to Greece, cut off some of my hair and released it into the sea. I thought: “This is very Greek.” There was a lot of energy that came with playingDonatella Versace. When I played Nancy Sinatra, I don’t want to say “I channelled her”, but I tapped into her energy. The next thing I knew, I had all these stomach ulcers. I asked her about it. She said: “I’ve had seven or eight of those.” I thought: “Oh my God, really?”View image in fullscreenGina Gershon in her new movie, High Rollers, with Lukas Haas and John Travolta.What do you think of your status as a gay icon?KooooonanI think it’s fabulous. I’m just happy it’s brought so many people so much joy. A lot of women have come up to me and told me how Bound helped them either come out or accept certain things. So that feels nice, you know?Did the Wachowskis invite you to audition for The Matrix?GlozboyThey wanted to doThe Matrixbefore they did Bound, but they needed to prove themselves. Once we started working on Bound, they told me about The Matrix. I said: “That sounds insane – and great.” The storyboards all had my face on, so I naturally assumed I was playing Trinity. Then I guess they fell in love with Carrie-Anne Moss and I didn’t do it. It was kind of heartbreaking.View image in fullscreenGina Gershon as Cristal Connors in Showgirls.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyDid “the joke” of Showgirls go over the rest of the cast’s heads, or were you all on the same page?RjoepenkI was a bigPaul Verhoevenfan. I loved Turkish Delight and Spetters, so I knew it was going to be very heavy and intense. I went deep down into Cristal, thinking I’d be playing Margo instead of Eve [in All About Eve], thinking about Aphrodite. It felt as if I was preparing for a Wagner concert or something. When I walked on to the set, it was a Technicolor pop concert of jewels and feathers. There was a moment when I was hanging on a rope in an S&M outfit, looking down at a load of naked bodies dancing around me, where I had this weird existential moment. I thought: I studied the classics! I wanted to play Medea. I wanted to do Chekhov. How did I get here? I thought: I better be really, really good in this, or else my career is over before it begins. As it turned more campy, I decided not to take things so seriously and thought: the drag queens will love me and want to dress like Cristal on Halloween.Your cameos inCurb Your Enthusiasmwere hilarious. Howhard is it not to laugh?Galdove19Playing Hannah the Horny Hasid, as I like to call her, was some of the most fun I’ve ever had. I had no idea what I was getting into. When they called, I was sitting with [the music producer] Rick Rubin. I said: “I don’t really have time. I’m doing a movie. I’m doing a TV show.” He said: “If there’s only one thing you should do all year, it’s Curb Your Enthusiasm.” When I got on set, I assumed I was playing myself. They said: “No, we want you to play the Hasidic Jew.” Larry [David] said: “Can you think of an accent?” I thought about my waxer, Rochelle – a French-Israeli woman who lived in the Bronx. I always loved her voice, so I just did her. Larry was laughing so hard. Any time you do something that makes Larry laugh, you feel great. But it’s not so great when you’re shooting, because they say: “We have to do it again because you laughed.” But then you just want to make him laugh, because it feels so satisfying to make him break.What was it like working on thetruly absurdFace/Off? If you could swap faces with anyone, who would it be?Bauhaus66I’d like to swap faces with my cat, because he’s so handsome. He’s called Lord Louis. Lord Louis Zuzu the Magnificent. He’s a 28lb [13kg] bundle of handsome love. He’s part African savannah domestic and looks like a lion. I wouldn’t mind having Benicio del Toro’s face; I just saw him in the new Wes Anderson movie [The Phoenician Scheme]. I could watch his face all day long.Did you feel you were on track tobecome a femme fataleafter your guest stint onMelrose Place?Kal_85Can I tell you the only thing I remember about Melrose Place? I was in Toronto with a bunch of people and we went to a strip club, like you do in a weird location. It was pretty tame and actually quite sweet. This dancer came walking down the runway, doing her bit. She looked at me, pointed her finger and went: “Melrose Place!” I thought I was going to die. I’d never been pointed out like that before. I can’t even remember who I played on Melrose Place. Is that terrible?View image in fullscreenGina Gershon in Bound.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyWhat was it like being part of a typically alpha-dogMichael Mannenvironment working on The Insider?leroyhunterI always thought I was too young. I said to Michael at the audition: “I’m too young to be believable. We’re talking about a 40-year-old woman.” She seemedsoancient to me. I thought: should I have grey in my hair? I walked on to set with no makeup, looking like a kid. I remember Al Pacino looking at me, as if to say: “What the fuck? How is she going to play this person?” I said: “Don’t, worry. I’m gonna age up quickly.”My first scene was with the great Christopher Plummer – the scene where he yells at me right in the face. He was so intense. It was the first time I felt: wow, I don’t even really have to act. When you’re working with someone so great, you just stay present and it becomes electric.What was it like ordering amultipleorgasm fromTom CruiseinCocktail?TopTrampI almost broke his nose. I had never done a love scene before and it was going to be with Tom Cruise. I thought: God, I get paid for this. He was so cute. I had a crush on him immediately. He was very protective and very much a gentleman, saying: “Let’s keep you covered.” He was very concerned.View image in fullscreenGershon as Coral in Cocktail.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyOriginally, we were supposed to be running around naked, but I thought: I don’t wanna do that. That seems dumb. I suggested: “Why don’t you go down on me under the covers? Then when you pop up, it’ll be a surprise.” He loved the idea, but I’d told him I was very ticklish, because he had started to tickle me earlier. I said: “Just don’t do that. I lose control because I was tortured as a child by my brother.”Right before the take, he was down there and grabbed my waist in a tickly, sweet manner. I didn’t mean to, but I had a kneejerk reaction right into his nose. It was full of blood. I thought: I just broke Tom Cruise’s nose. I will never work in Hollywood again. I was mortified because I really kicked him good. I didn’t mean to. He said: “Nope. My bad. You warned me.” I remember thinking: this guy is a movie star. He deserves everything he gets. He was just so kind and so sweet with me in a situation where I was quite vulnerable. I’m glad he was my first.High Rollers is on digital platformsExplore more on these topicsFilmFilm & Music reader interviewTelevisionUS televisionThe MatrixCurb Your EnthusiasmTom CruiseLarry DavidShareReuse this content"

I’ve worked in and around the art world for 20 years, and until recently I hadn’t heard of Rosso either.In artists’ ateliers, however, Rosso has long been a familiar and revered name. Auguste Rodin, the father of modern sculpture, was his champion and friend until the pair’s fallout. Émile Zola was a fan. The playwright Edward Albeeowned a version of his sculpture Enfant Juif; French poet Guillaume Apollinaire described him as “without a doubt the greatest living sculptor”.Rosso, a new retrospective at Kunstmuseum Basel, contends, brought sculpture into the modern era with busts and figures that seemed to materialise organically out of his materials – wax, plaster, bronze – like spectres in motion. The Swiss art institution has had no trouble finding 60 contemporary artists who feel a kinship with his sculptures, photographs and drawings, his fleeting impressions of street scenes, cafes and clouds – from Louise Bourgeois’s textile sculptures that look like entrails to Francesca Woodman’s wraithlike photographs.“If you sit 10 gallerists and collectors around a table, nine out of the 10 will not know who Medardo Rosso is,” says Elena Filipovic, the director of Kunstmuseum Basel, which is holding a retrospective on this shadowy figure. “If you sit 10 artists around the table, nine out of the 10 will fall to the floor with excitement.”View image in fullscreenSickly yellow lumps: Rosso’s Ecce Puer, made of wax on plaster.Photograph: Courtesy Galleria Russo, RomeThere are good reasons why Rosso has fallen into relative obscurity. Some, albeit unintentionally, are Rosso’s fault. For instance, his practice was neurotically self-contained. While Rodin followed the template for becoming famous, Rosso followed his own instincts. Rodin knew to create monumental works – “size matters,” says Filipovic – and that professional marketing was key. Rosso created small-scale works, works seen in the studio, home and exhibitions but not out on the boulevards, and he liked to promote them himself.Rodin created monumental works and knew professional marketing was key – Rosso worked small scale and promoted himselfHe worked, repeatedly, on a relatively small number of motifs. One of his most famous works, Ecce Puer (1906), is of a boy’s head shrouded in a sheet; he’s there but not there. Another, Enfant Malade (1893-95), features the inclined head of a sick child, tipping possibly towards death.We often use the term “in the flesh” when standing in front of a sculpture, but with Rosso the phrase has a particular resonance: his faces, just that little bit smaller than in real life, with dimensions that add to a sense of unease, look as if they might blink their waxy eyelids. His sickly yellow lumps are not pretty. They’re not Degas’s dancers.Perhaps the most disturbing of all though is Aetas Aurea (1886), a study of his wife, Giuditta, and their son, Francesco, in which the pair look conjoined at their cheeks. They melt into the background. It’s a horror movie prop rather than a loving family portrait. Other figures are drunk, leaning, screaming. His wax sculptures are the colour of nicotine stains.View image in fullscreenSize matters: Auguste Rodin’s Les Bourgeois de Calais, 1884-1889.Photograph: Martin P Bühler/Kunstmuseum BaselBorn in Turin in 1858, the second son of a railway worker, Rosso opened his first atelier in Milan in 1882 and circulated with members of the artistic group Scapigliatura – translated as “dishevelment” – a Bohemian set of a socialists and anarchists. Living up to the name, Rosso’s studies in the city’s esteemed Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera were cut short when he was expelled for assaulting another student. Three years later, however, he had a wife and son, and was successfully forging a career in Paris, wooing patrons and winning commissions.Rosso was definitely a “very idiosyncratic personality, very persuasive, powerful, winning, someone with a big heart, especially for children, but also suspicious, controlling, obsessively pursuing his cause,” says Heike Eipeldauer, a curator and Rosso expert at the Mumok museum in Vienna, Austria. There were a lot of disagreements: his wife left him and one of his closest friends cut him off after an argument about debts. And then there was Rodin, who he got into a public spat with over who had influenced whom. “They were friends, until they weren’t,” says Filipovic.View image in fullscreenSpirit photography: Ecce Puer, pictured inside Rosso’s studio on Boulevard des Batignolles, Paris.Photograph: Mumok/Markus WörgötterHis intractable nature could work against him. He cast his own works – eating into his time and reducing the number of works created – while Rodin used foundries. And Rodin hired Edward Steichen and other well-known photographers to capture his works and produce portraits of him as the great master in the studio (often with a hammer and chisel, even though he never carved marble himself). Rosso’s sculptures were only ever photographed by the artist himself.“He wanted to control the image,” says Filipovic. “He understood that photography and how you saw the work was also the work.” The exhibition features about 200 of Rosso’s photographs: frail prints of sculptures, some as small as stamps, otherworldly portraits rather than iconic marketing shots. He lit and staged them, with an ethereal aesthetic that echoed the Victorian craze for spirit photography.While Rosso’s photographic studies reanimate objects, his studio-set self-portraits conjure up a phantom, his scruffy features bleached by the sun through his studio’s skylight, his figure blurred in movement: studies as faint and mercurial as his artistic footprint.Having spent his last two decades constantly reworking a few subjects, the artist died in 1928, aged 69. He had dropped glass negatives on his foot, resulting first in the amputation of several toes, then part of his leg and finally a fatal case of blood poisoning. A gradual erosion.Today, Rosso’s complicated nature hampers research, explains his great-granddaughter, Danila Marsure Rosso, who manages the artist’s estate. “He destroyed all the letters he received because he said that nobody should enter in his private life,” she says.View image in fullscreenAn artist’s artist: Rosso’s Portinaia next to modern works by Isa Genzken and Yayoi Kusama at Kunstmuseum Basel.Photograph: Max EhrengruberThere are no biographies of Rosso. There are dozens of Rodin. Rosso’s auction record stands at £341,000 (for a version of Enfant Juif, sold in London in 2015); Rodin’s record was set in 2016, when the master’s marble Eternal Springtime sold in New York for $20m (£14m). Legacies can pay dividends.But Rosso’s quirks had their own creative rewards. He invited groups into his studio to watch him sculpt and cast his works, as if he were a performer. “It was about understanding that there is magic in this making,” says Filipovic. “Rodin couldn’t do that because he used a foundry.”Another idiosyncrasy was Rosso’s fondness for installing sculptures in collectors’ homes in strange, jarring configurations. Context was everything, but not always logical. I can imagine him sitting uncomfortably close to guests at dinner parties just to observe their reaction. Was he a control freak? “Certainly,” says Filipovic. “But don’t you want that in an artist?”Explore more on these topicsArtSculpturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Christopher Polk/Penske Media/Getty ImagesAs the 80-year-old gears up for Worthy Farm, we pick the best of his post-Faces career, from moving ballads to silly, sleazy pop, and cover versions that became definitiveByAlexis PetridisThu 19 Jun 2025 08.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 10.29 EDTShare20. Baby Jane (1983)This is essentially a lyrical update of (I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone or Where Do You Go to (My Lovely)? – in summary: peeved ex complains that former girlfriend now moves in lofty circles. But Baby Jane was as good as 80s-pop Rod got: very of-its-era arrangement, great melody, big old chorus, a UK No 1.19. Brighton Beach (2013)“I hear you’ve written songs for your new album,” Elton John remarked to Stewart on stage in London. “What’s it called – Rarities?” And indeed, Time’s standout track was good enough to make you wonder why Stewart didn’t make the effort more often: a sweet, sad acoustic memoir of love lost in the singer’s beatnik youth.18. Gasoline Alley (1970)The title track of Stewart’s second album is his early solo approach in a nutshell. Folky and sensitive yet tough in sound and mood, it somehow manages to rock despite the languid pace and lack of drums. The interplay between Rod’s rasp and Ronnie Wood’s slide guitar is a marvel.17. Downtown Train (1989)A perfect example of Stewart’s skill as an interpreter of others’ songs: he digs deep and finds a melody in the verses not fully evident in Tom Waits’s original – it’s masked by Waits’s trademark vocal approach – and emerges with a song transformed into the stuff of arena singalongs.16. I Don’t Want to Talk About It (1975)The same year Neil Young belatedly released Tonight’s the Night – his racked response to the deaths of roadie Bruce Berry and guitarist Danny Whitten – Stewart covered Whitten’s signature ballad. One is harrowing, chaotic and dissipated, the other smooth, orchestrated pop-rock, but they’re equally moving: Stewart’s vocal is understated, capturing the song’s lovelorn misery.15. Every Picture Tells a Story (1971)View image in fullscreenStewart and Ronnie Wood performing in 1974.Photograph: Mick Gold/RedfernsCo-written by Stewart and Wood, the glorious title track of Stewart’s solo breakthrough – a transatlantic No 1 – has a lot of the Faces’ ramshackle charm. The lyrics detail romantic mishaps around the world, the 12-string guitar is out of tune, and the backing vocals come from former mentor Long John Baldry.14. I Was Only Joking (1977)Noticeably more thoughtful than the rest of his Foot Loose and Fancy Free album, the remorseful I Was Only Joking unexpectedly suggests a certain darkness – and weariness – behind Stewart’s playboy image: “Illusions of that grand first prize are slowly wearing thin.” Also home to a great bit of fourth-wall breaking: “Verse seven is never clear.”13. (I Know) I’m Losing You (1971)Throughout his career, Stewart has recorded dozens of Motown covers, but this might be his best: essentially a Faces track in all but name (it features all four members), it transforms the Temptations’ original version into loose-limbed rock, complete with unexpectedly thrilling drum solo, without sacrificing its intensity.12. Forever Young (1988)Stewart spent much of the 80s obviously coasting, but could still, unexpectedly, deliver something with emotional punch. The production on Forever Young suggests someone had heard U2’s Where the Streets Have No Name and decided it needed a layer of gloss – but the song’s reflections on parenthood are really moving.11. You’re in My Heart (The Final Acclaim) (1977)For all its lyrical references to Aubrey Beardsley and faintly Gallic-sounding violin (actually the work of bluegrass innovator Richard Greene), something of the pub at last orders rather charmingly clings to You’re in My Heart: its bottom-of-the-fourth-pint blend of confession and teary sentimentality, its arms-around-your-mates chorus. A million copies were sold in the US alone: cheers!10. Handbags and Gladrags (1969)Mike d’Abo’s Handbags and Gladrags had already been recorded by Chris Farlowe and the Love Affair’s Steve Ellis. Both were fantastic vocalists, but it’s Rod’s version that nails the song. He is less anguished than Farlowe but wearier-sounding than Ellis: the perfect voice to fit the hard-won wisdom of the lyric.9. Sailing (1975)Another example of Stewart’s transformative interpretative powers. The Sutherland Brothers’ original is an ominous harmonium-and-bass-drum drone – the key line is definitely “Will I see you, who can say?” – but Stewart recasts the song completely, making it wistful, but soaring and celebratory. Anthem status swiftly followed.View image in fullscreenThe disco years.Photograph: ITV/Rex Features8. Da Ya Think I’m Sexy? (1978)To borrow an old Smash Hits phrase, there were points where Stewart’s late 70s brand of raunch turned a little Uncle Disgusting – Hot Legs; the frankly creepy Tonight’s the Night (Gonna Be Alright) – but his “disco spoof” is so preposterous, so evidently performed with tongue in cheek, that it’s weirdly irresistible.7. The First Cut Is the Deepest (1977)It had already been recorded umpteen times – by author Cat Stevens, PP Arnold, and the Love Affair (them again!) among others. You can argue for hours about the definitive reading, but Stewart’s careworn take is in with a shot at the title: the cathartic orchestrated finale is particularly fine.6. The Killing of Georgie Pt I & II (1976)An affecting account of a homophobic murder delivered with a cocktail of empathy, sadness and a desire to celebrate the victim’s life. Part II contains the most glaring of the perennially light-fingered Stewart’s musical steals, so indebted to the Beatles’ Don’t Let Me Down that John Lennon publicly raised an eyebrow.5. Mandolin Wind (1971)For a moment, it looked as if Stewart might not just be one of the 1970s’ major singers, but a major singer-songwriter. It didn’t turn out like that, but when he was producing songs as great as Mandolin Wind – poignant, moving, ultimately joyous – you could understand why.View image in fullscreenShowing his support during the 1982 World Cup.Photograph: Rex Features4. Young Turks (1981)One of the 70s old guard’s finest responses to new wave: a Springsteen-esque “love on the run” narrative set to a wired, urgent drum machine and synth pulse, complete with phenomenal chorus and – awww! – a happy ending. Why he didn’t make more music like this is a mystery.3. Reason to Believe (1971)In which Stewart transforms Tim Hardin’s beautiful, but brief and sparsely arranged original into an understated epic, the piano and organ seemingly taking the title as a cue to dive into gospelly waters. It’s big on shiver-inducing moments where the band drop out and his rasping voice sings unaccompanied.2. You Wear It Well (1972)A follow-up that matches the big hit for quality: honestly, there’s not a cigarette paper between this and the song at No 1 here. You Wear It Well wraps a saga of lost love in a melody and a loose performance that oozes an infectious, slightly boozy joy. An unmitigated delight.1. Maggie May (1971)Apparently based on a true story (Stewart has said it’s about the woman he lost his virginity to in 1961), Maggie May was initially released only as a B-side; perhaps his label balked at the idea of releasing a single without an identifiable chorus. But it doesn’t need one, because it has a melody that alternately breezes and sighs – the perfect complement to the emotional twists and turns of a lyric that can’t work out whether to be rueful, affectionately reflective or optimistic – and immediately lodges in your brain. Proof that sometimes, an artist’s best-known is also their best full stop.Explore more on these topicsRankedRod StewartPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They play a divided self, it seems, reflecting on illness, shame, self-loathing, love, betrayal, medication culture and – importantly – the prospect of ending it all at exactly 4.48am.Co-produced by theRoyal Shakespeare Company, the play is again staged in the upstairs theatre at the Royal Court (after which it will travel to Stratford-upon-Avon). It is variously abstruse and lucid in its arguments on life, death and suicide, and still original in form. But this production feels like the reconstruction of a seminal performance rather than a seminal performance for today. Maybe this is because Kane’s position has changed in the intervening decades: she sits firmly in the canon. So this replica-like revival has the strange effect of a museum piece in this “new writing” space, posthumous and reverential.Jeremy Herbert’s set is a white square with functional table, chairs and an overhanging mirror that reflects the audience and the protagonist’s selves which acquire more fractured counterparts in shadow. Light alters in this room, glowing sharp or soporific, like the setting and rising of the sun (beautifully designed lighting by Nigel Edwards). There are bursts of disturbance within, reminiscent of the grey fuzz of an old TV set, which becomes an inspired visual analogy for the dismal brain fog of depression.View image in fullscreenEnraged at life … Jo McInnes in 4.48 Psychosis.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe protagonist variously lies prone, circles the stage or sits in antagonistic conversation with a psychiatrist (another inner voice). There are deep, startlingly lyrical passages (“the cold black pond of myself”) alongside bathos and grim humour; the script is an exemplar of Kane’s perceptive and emotionally unswerving gifts as a writer.But dramatically it is sedate. You wish for something messier, louder, angrier. There are flickers of this – a stunning moment when the protagonist (McInnes) shouts as she lies on the table, enraged at life – yet it then returns to blankness. Maybe this non-mood is the point – a depression that leaves meaningful emotion quashed – but it evokes a kind of vacancy in the air nonetheless.‘She plumbed our secret, shameful depths’: why are Sarah Kane’s plays still so shocking?Read moreThere is still value in its staging and poignancy, too. It is beautifully performed with moments of bared anguish and delicate detail. The opening of the stage windows, a countervailing gesture to the reflection of a closed window on stage, is a haunting, yet exhilarating, final image.At theRoyal Court theatre, London, until 5 July.

Wonder, nostalgia, love, hurt, excitement, hard-won peace: these are the emotions his voice tends to catch on. When combined with his typically blissed-out sonics – feathery breakbeats, dreamy piano figures, delicate synth washes, gently plucked guitars – the results are often very nice. Sometimes a bit too nice. So it is on Feel at Home, the sentimental love song that opens the 30-year-old’s fourth album, Hopefully!View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Hopefully!Photograph: Publicity imageCarner – whose moniker is a spoonerism of his real name, Benjamin Coyle-Larner – never makes music that is boring or basic. As well as the slushy lyrics and comfortingly toasty chords, Feel at Home is buttressed by madly skittering percussion and what sounds like a blurry reproduction of young children’s playground chatter. But much like the outpouring of earnestness and loveliness on the Croydon-raised rapper’s first two albums, Hopefully! may well have you hankering for a shred of dissonance or disruption – especially after 2022’s Mercury-shortlistedHugo, which gratifyingly offset Carner’s trademark tenderness with a more abrasive sonic palette. Initially, the musician seems to have moved on – or perhaps backwards – from that record.Then he starts singing. Carner has said he was duped into doing so by his producer, Avi Barath (he originally thought his vocal track was a placeholder for another performer). It was a trick worth playing: whenever Carner slips into his low-pitched, totally unaffected croon, it cuts through any over-sweetness like a squeeze of lemon. The combination works particularly well on the exceptional In My Mind – whose lugubrious self-laceration and loose, clattery instrumentation recalls King Krule’s thrilling early work, while always remaining characteristically Carner – as well as in the choruses of Lyin and Strangers. The latter’s singsong central refrain is flatly murmured in a way that feels authentically uncertain and all the more appealing for it.Loyle Carner: Lyin – videoVulnerability has always been Carner’s lyrical stock in trade. It tends to manifest in two ways, first in open-hearted sincerity that has generated songs about grief and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and which is in full flow on the album’s title track: “You give me hope in humankind, but are humans kind? / I don’t know but I hope so.” Second, in a less anodyne and far more striking form of introspection: on In My Mind, he admits a tendency towards myopic self-obsession and alludes to the bitter dismissal of a “minor friend”.Carner has two young children, and the artwork for Hopefully! features the kind of felt-tip scrawl most toddler-wranglers will recognise. Parenting is the album’s major theme, and there are moments when Carner approaches it from a compellingly raw angle. On About Time, covering the tensions between fatherhood and artistry, the narrator lists the thrills of his job before describing what sounds like a fight with his partner, in which he lets slip yet “another fucking thing I know you couldn’t forgive”. Yet for all Carner’s accounts of the internal and external conflict involved in fatherhood, it’s hard to buy the more damning self-critique – on Lyin he claims to be “just a man trained to kill, to love I never had the skill” – from an artist who makes music this heartfelt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Progressing from anxiety to confusion to a strange elation, he is overcome by the way his child’s hand reflexively tightens as he attempts to let go of it and how bright the sky looks in the middle of the night. His voice radiates awe and trepidation-tinged delight. It is magical songwriting, and his most impressive work to date.Even before fatherhood, Carner’s work fixated on family: his mother is unusually omnipresent in his music, even by hip-hop’s standards. His 2019 song Dear Jean even took pains to insist that his new girlfriend was no threat to the pair’s intimacy. She’s still never far away; over luminous guitars on All I Need, he recalls the smell of “the sheets on my mother’s mattress – just the place I learnt my backflips”. It’s classic Carner: the place where heady feeling threatens to tip over into cloying soppiness. Yet thanks to a pleasingly precarious new vocal style and some levelled-up lyricism, he’s more adept than ever at this specific balancing act.This week Rachel listened toBig Thief – IncomprehensibleThis taster of the Brooklyn band’s sixth album, Double Infinity, ups the tempo as frontperson Adrianne Lenker makes peace with the aging process in her trademark stream-of-consciousness style.

Peploe’s family told the Guardian he died in Florence, Italy, after a long illness.Peploe’s prominence centred on the screenplays he wrote for some of the great European directors of the era, notably Italian new wave auteurs Antonioni and Bertolucci. Despite its chequered release history, the 1975 film The Passenger, directed by Antonioni and starring Jack Nicholson, has since been acclaimed as one the decade’s cinematic masterpieces, and Peploe went on to forge a regular partnership with Bertolucci, winning an Oscar in 1988 for best adapted screenplay for The Last Emperor.Jeremy Thomas, producer of The Last Emperor, told the Guardian: “Mark was a Renaissance man, a brilliant writer of screenplays, and also an artist – he had a particular gift of a cultivation of the past which informed him as a writer. Mark was never without a notebook and a copy of the International Herald Tribune. He was a very impressive person.”Peploe was born in 1943 in Nairobi into an artistic family. His grandfather on his father’s side was celebrated Scottish colourist SJ Peploe, while on his mother’s he was the great-grandson of German sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand. (His mother, Clotilde, was also a painter of note and his father, Willy, was an art dealer.) After a brief period living in a villa the family owned in Florence, Peploe studied at Oxford university, and was subsequently hired by London-basedCanadian producer Allan King, working on documentaries about a wide range of creative figures including writer Norman Mailer, op-art pioneer Victor Vasarely and Never on Sunday star Melina Mercouri.Peploe said he turned to writing after becoming “frustrated” with documentary-making: “I thought that if you wrote the script, you would be able to control the movie more than I did. It was an illusion, but I thought so at the time!” Peploe worked on the script for Jacques Demy’s 1972 musical The Pied Piper (starring Donovan and Diana Dors), and then had his story The Passenger – originally titled Fatal Exit – picked up by Antonioni as the third in the Italian director’s trilogy of English-language films, following Blow-Up and Zabriskie Point.View image in fullscreenJack Nicholson in The Passenger (1975).Photograph: Ronald GrantAfter co-writing the script with film theorist Peter Wollen, Peploe had intended to direct the film himself, but producer Carlo Ponti offered it to Antonioni after the latter’s earlier project, entitled Technically Sweet, was shut down over budgetary concerns. Starring Nicholson as a TV reporter who swaps identities with a dead man, The Passenger also features Maria Schneider and Jenny Runacre and became renowned for a seven-minute tracking shot during its final scene. Due to a dispute with producers MGM, Nicholson acquired the rights to the film, and itre-emerged in the mid-2000s to considerable acclaim.Peploe’s sister Clare was also a film-maker, and the pair collaborated on the script for High Season, her directorial debut in 1987. The same year also saw the release of The Last Emperor, on which Peploe had worked with Bertolucci (who had married Clare in 1979). Produced by Thomas, the film won nineOscarsin 1988 for its lavish treatment of the story of Chinese emperor Puyi, who was deposed in 1912 but allowed to live in Beijing’s Forbidden City until 1924. Peploe subsequently worked on two more of Bertolucci’s films: the Paul Bowles adaptation The Sheltering Sky, released in 1990, and Little Buddha, starring Keanu Reeves as Prince Siddhartha, in 1994.Peploe achieved his ambition of moving into directing with the 1991 psychological horror Afraid of the Dark, starring James Fox and Fanny Ardant, which has becomesomething of a cult film, and an adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s story Victory, released in 1996 and starring Willem Dafoe and Irène Jacob.Peploe is survived by his partner, art historian Alina Payne; he was previously married to costume designer Louise Stjernsward, with whom he had a daughter Lola, and was subsequently in a longterm relationship with Gina Marcou.Explore more on these topicsFilmMichelangelo AntonioniBernardo BertolucciOscarsFilm adaptationsAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

The shadowers’ choice medal for illustration went to Homebody by Theo Parish.The winners were announced at a ceremony at the Cambridge theatre in London on Thursday. McDonald and Lomenech Gill were awarded £5,000 each, while Lessore and Parish were given £500 each to donate to libraries of their choice.Writing Glasgow Boys, McDonald worked with a children’s therapist to depict the care system in an authentic way. The novel, which incorporates Scots dialect, is “an immersive and visceral read that completely draws the reader into the present and past lives of Finlay and Banjo”, said judging chair Ros Harding.“Neither of [the characters] can remember the last time they had a hug; both are determined to hold on at all costs to the uncertain hope of a brighter future”, wrote Imogen Russell Williams in aGuardian review. The book “is a paean to the power of friendship, and daring to be vulnerable in the face of past hurt”.McDonald is donating her prize money to Action for Children, which helps young people in care and other vulnerable groups of children, while Lomenech Gill plans to use the money for a project supporting schools, education and libraries in Palestine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Earlier this year, the novel topped the older readers category in theWaterstones children’s book prizeand won theJhalak children’s and young adultprize.“It’s testament to Lessore’s lightness of touch and believable characters that despite delving into big topics such as toxic masculinity and grief, this is an immensely readable book that never feels too worthy,” wrote Fiona Noblein the Guardian.Homebody, the shadowers’ choice winner for illustration, follows “the protagonist’s search for self-acceptance, so that the house of their body can feel like a true home”, wrote Imogen Russell Williamsin the Guardian. “Investigating the subtleties of trans and non-binary identities, its soft greys and pinks and joyful emphasis on self-discovery will appeal to Heartstopper fans.”The Carnegie writing medal was established in 1936, while the illustration prize was launched in 1955. Previous winners of the writing award include Frank Cottrell Boyce, CS Lewis, Philip Pullman and Ruta Sepetys; past illustration winners include Shirley Hughes, Quentin Blake and Lauren Child.Last year, Joseph Coelhowon the writing awardfor The Boy Lost in the Maze, illustrated by Kate Milner, while Aaron Becker took home the illustration medal for The Tree and the River.Explore more on these topicsBooksCarnegie medalAwards and prizesChildren and teenagersnewsShareReuse this content"

The creator of the 90s megahit’s new show is an opportunity to wallow in nostalgia – albeit with added drug runningLucy ManganThu 19 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 19 Jun 2025 00.53 EDTShareDo you miss Dawson’s Creek now that you’re all grown up? Kevin Williamson sees you. And he has reinvented his late-90s/early-00s tale of a close knit community round a watery area for an adult market. Not adult-adult, you understand – we’re talking drug-running and crumbling family empire rather than sauce – but the main ingredients of his first TV hit are all here. Namely, masses of plot and some lightly sketched characters to keep it moving swiftly enough that nobody has time to stop and say “Hang on, fellas – I simply don’t believe a word of this!” Those of us who sat through several young women choosing Dawson over Pacey are only here for the second part of the phrase “credible drama”.The Buckleys and their fleet have long dominated the small fishing town of Havenport, North Carolina. They are rich and troubled. More so the latter as they become less of the former because business is getting tougher and mighty patriarch Harlan (Holt McCallany, charismatic, humourless) took his hand off the tiller to have two heart attacks and left his inadequate son Cane (Jake Weary, uncharismatic, humourless) to run things for a bit. Cane decided the best way to do this was to start shifting illegal narcotics for wodges of cash and an unseen gangster called Owen. Alas, we open with a set of Cane’s smuggling crewmen being offed by a gang of armed men, and Owen’s $10m shipment going missing. Cane asks his cousin Lynette (Bethany DeZelle), at whatever the nautical equivalent of the DVLA, North Carolinian office is, to amend some paperwork to say that he sold the murder boat three months ago. I am sure this is a foolproof cover and that nothing will escalate.The Drug Enforcement Administration descends – but the family is so steeped in internecine warfare that they hardly notice. Harlan returns to the office to beat the living daylights out of Cane and advise the clan that the problem lies not in drug smuggling but innotdrug smugglingenough. They need to cut the middle men out of the picture and take hold of the supply line themselves. OK, grizzled boomer.Cane’s mother, Belle (Maria Bello), is secretly cutting a deal to sell a stretch of Buckley land to a developer. But! This stretch of land is sacred to the memory of Harlan’s late mother, and he won’t be grizzly pleased when he finds out. And! The developer wants to develop Belle’s site too, if ya know what I mean. She is considering the offer.Meanwhile! Cane’s sister Bree (Supergirl’s Melissa Benoist, flying here too – albeit metaphorically – and, like Bello, improving the show with every scene she is in) has been given a job in the family bar and restaurant after rehab for alcohol and pill addiction. She is keen to get back to proper work but the Buckleys don’t think she is ready. She has also lost custody of her son, Diller (Brady Hepner) to her cruddy ex-husband and is trying to repair their relationship on the boy’s weekend visits. Unfortunately, Diller is unforgiving of her catalogue of sins – which I suspect goes back to naming him ‘Diller’ – and progress is slow. Harlan gives Diller a job in the restaurant, putting Bree in near-permanent breach of a court order to stay 300 feet away from anyone she has nomenclaturally abused since infancy, so, you know, that’s a worry.Meanwhile, again! On top of the multimillion dollar drug debt, Cane is tormented by the return of his first love/high school sweetheart/soulmate, who is a totally differently pretty brunette from his wife and also married. His wife is called Peyton (Danielle Campbell) and his former girlfriend is called Jenna (Humberly González). That’s really all there is to say about them.Twists and reveals come thick and fast. You’ll never guess who Bree is seeing on the down-low, or where they met! You’ll never guess which character played by an established character actor whose part initially seems too small for him turns out to be a double-crossing major player in the whole caboodle! You’ll never guess how efficient and uninspiring the script is! You’ll never guess which issues it nods towards so you don’t feel like you’re entirely wasting your time! Toxic masculinity, generational trauma, the father-son bond, class divides and the problems of the one per cent in a coastal location? Oh, you CAN guess – well done!You get the idea. It is escapist summer nonsense with – God, I hope – no pretensions to being otherwise. Dive into the adult creek and wallow in nostalgia as the waves of absurdity sweep towards shore.The Waterfront is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

In Hark, the author Alice Vincent goes to extreme lengths to eradicate noise as she spends time in an anechoic chamber, a heavily soundproofed space designed to swallow up sound waves. There she becomes aware of the noises of her own body, from involuntary swallowing to the soft, high-pitched ringing in her ears. But rather than feel unease, she is “confronted with a comfort I couldn’t have imagined – and a familiarity with quietude I didn’t realise I was living in”.Hark is a book about listening, being heard and the author’s shifting relationship with sound in the early years of motherhood. While working as a music journalist in her 20s, Vincent had been surrounded by noise. But now, in her 30s and plunged into domesticity, she finds herself craving quiet. She also examines how others experience sound, investigating misophonia, an acute sensitivity to everyday noises; deep listening, a practice that ensures the speaker feels heard; and the concept of “deaf gain”, which turns the notion of “hearing loss” into something positive and empowering.The actor Fiona Hampton is the book’s narrator, though her reading is interspersed with voice notes from Vincent in which she shares reflections and asides not available in the printed edition; ahead of a chapter entitled Ghosts, she recalls her mother talking about the “baby in the head”, her expression to describe the phantom crying often heard by new mothers. The audiobook also concludes with a wonderfully warm conversation between Hampton and Vincent where they discuss their experiences of motherhood and the ways it fundamentally changed how they listen.Available via Canongate, 8hr 44minFurther listeningLootTania James, Penguin Audio, 9hr 23minMaanuv Thiara narrates this epic tale constructed around the real-life theft of an 18th-century wooden tiger from Mysore in India by British soldiers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Her husband, Matt, discovered he had pancreatic cancer; her father-in-law, aunt and stepfather all died; and her then 81-year-old mother, the novelist and poet Erica Jong, was diagnosed with dementia. “My mother is just a body now,” she states in How to Lose Your Mother. “Erica Jong the person has left the planet.”That year also marked the 50th anniversary ofFear of Flying, Jong’s autobiographical novel. Hailed as a landmark of feminist literature, it made a star of its author, selling more than 20m copies and leading to appearances on The Tonight Show and the cover of Newsweek. The book coined the phrase “the zipless fuck” to describe casual sex. “Now think about being the offspring of the person who wrote that sentence. And pour one out for me,” writes Jong-Fast.How to Lose Your Mother documents this annus horribilis when, along with working and parenting three children, the author found herself juggling meetings with doctors, carers, accountants and funeral directors. It also provides snapshots of a life spent in the shadow of her mother’s celebrity. Jong-Fast, who is an only child, learned early that the problem with success is that it tends to wane, leading to grief, bitterness and, in Erica’s case, alcoholism. “Becoming normal like the rest of us, the journey to unfamousness, was for [Erica] an event so strange and stressful, so damaging to her ego, that she was never able to process it.”Her mother’s dementia crept up slowly. In the past, people would come up to Jong-Fast to tell her what Erica’s writing meant to them; now they reported her saying or doing something inappropriate, such as writing the word “Neat” under a social media post announcing someone’s death. Visiting her at home, Jong-Fast often found her once glamorous mother shuffling around with her robe open, a breast exposed. Yet the elderly, absent-minded Jong wasn’t so different from her younger self, when she was dreamy and distracted. She never came to school performances or sat down and played with her daughter. For long stretches of her childhood, her mother was absent and parenting was handed over to a nanny.While Jong-Fast is aware of her privilege – she blithely refers to her “nepo baby” status – she nonetheless paints a bleak picture of familial dysfunction and neglect. After a childhood spent longing for Erica’s attention, she finds her mother is now dependent on her and pleading for her company. Mirroring the way Erica relied on others to look after her daughter all those years ago, Jong-Fast finds herself doing the same, hiring others to deal with the day-to-day business of caring.The writing veers between punchy and meandering, with moments of deep sadness leavened by a sardonic humour. There is a sense, at times, that we are eavesdropping on an extended therapy session. Guilt is a running theme. Her honesty not just about her mother’s shortcomings but her own, specifically her reluctance to spend time with Erica, is affecting. So too is her agony over her decision to move her mother and stepfather out of their apartment and into a care facility, selling their home and belongings without their knowledge.But there is another less convincing seam of agony here, related to her spilling the beans. “[I’ve] always hated the idea of writing a book like this,” she notes more than once, to which the obvious response is: “Then why do it?” Certainly, Jong-Fast’s assertion that she is a bad daughter for writing about Erica’s decline strikes a disingenuous note. You don’t tell the world you have found shit in your mother’s bed if you are fundamentally uncomfortable with revealing the details of her infirmity.Jong-Fast is most convincing when describing the blunt reality of her situation. She learns that, though we are shaped by our parents, seeking redress or closure following an unhappy childhood is a fool’s errand. She also discovers that simultaneously wrangling elderly dependents and children along with a critically ill spouse while in the throes of middle age can drive a person to the brink, and that it is normal to wish to run away. Yet she makes it out the other side of her terrible year, not through bravery or superhuman stoicism, but because there is no other road available. As she tells her husband in the aftermath of his cancer treatment: “The only way through is through.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It was a marriage so heinous that one would be tempted to think it was parody had it not existed in a film so entirely devoid of humour and self-awareness. The Chris Evans/Ana de Armas vehicle became the new nadir of the action comedy, a subgenre that has been run down into the sewer by streamers, carelessly cobbling together big stars and bad quips on an almost weekly basis.28 Years Later review – Danny Boyle’s zombies on the rage rampage againRead moreBut as dreadful as it was, there was something fascinatingly dreadful about it, a cacophony of bad decisions that became almost instructive to the industry in its of-the-moment awfulness. In this week’s Bride Hard, the latest tinny genre mix to get chucked at us, when Rebel Wilson’s shoddy kitchen-based fight scene is scored to Geri Halliwell’s It’s Raining Men, you’ll be too bored to even roll your eyes, if you’re even awake at that point.The awfulness of Bride Hard just isn’t worth pointing and laughing at, it’s the kind of joyless slog that pushes you to check out early and never gives you reason to check back in. Even in a season where we’re somewhat forced to be a little more forgiving given the limited options, this really is as bad as it gets (and it’s gotten to be pretty bad already).The makers would like you to think of it as Die Hard meets Bridesmaids and it certainly hits enough of those assembled beats in theory, shamelessly so when it tries to copy the formula of the latter. Like that film it centres on a maid of honour whose behaviour causes a rift with her oldest friend turned bride-to-be and a rivalry with a rich, catty bridesmaid. But unlike Kristen Wiig’s hit, still one of the greatest comedies of the last 20 years, it doesn’t find any humour or texture within that set-up and when an action plot is thrown on top, there are also none of the base pleasures one would expect from a Die Hard rip-off.The maid of honour is Sam (Rebel Wilson, funnier in a handful of scenes in Bridesmaids than she is in this entire movie), who is hiding her job as a superspy from best friend, Betsy (Wilson’s Pitch Perfect co-star Anna Camp). When she is forced to abandon her bachelorette party in what’s allegedly Paris, Betsy loses her patience and replaces her with Virginia (Anna Chlumsky, doing too much yet not enough), heading into the wedding on bad terms. But after a group of criminals (led by Stephen Dorff) take the guests hostage, Sam must reveal her true identity and save the day. Cue Geri.Even taking Bride Hard on its own low-stakes terms – a cheap rip-off made two years ago and released by an almost brand new company – it’s a total disaster, a tedious and maddeningly laugh-free endurance test that’s also made without a shred of competence. Its ugliness is a slight surprise, given that it’s directed by the British film-maker Simon West, who was behind Con Air, one of the most enjoyable action films of the 90s. He went on to make lesser yet still slickly efficient films like The General’s Daughter and Tomb Raider but with studio backing stripped away, any confidence behind the camera has gone awol, the action sequences as uninvolving as the script is unfunny. The only amusing moment is unintentional, as a character lies next to some Fiji water bottles while another digs into a bag of Lay’s chips before the camera glides past a selection of elf beauty products, swiftly explaining where some of the budget came from …Paul Feig followed Bridesmaids with two of the best contemporary action comedies – The Heat and Spy – films that could easily rest on the skills of a dynamo like Melissa McCarthy. Wilson just doesn’t have those chops, a limited comedic actor who only works in small doses in certain roles visibly struggling as a straightforward lead and despite having made three Pitch Perfect films with Camp, they have zero chemistry together. Lower down the cast is also a wasted Da’Vine Joy Randolph, one of the most deserving Oscar winners of late, forced into tiresome shtick that should be beneath her (one hopes after this andShadow Force, she can move on to better things). Films like Bride Hard, proudly recycling well-known popcorn plots without any attempt at originality, rely on heavy-lifting star power but there’s just none of that here.It leaves screenwriter Shaina Steinberg with far too much to do. Her decision to pair crude R-rated dick joke comedy with PG-rated Home Alone sequel action means that no one really knows what the hell they’re doing and who on earth it might be for. The answer might just be no one.Bride Hard is out in US cinemas on 20 June, Australia on 31 July and in the UK at a later dateExplore more on these topicsRebel WilsonComedy filmsComedyAction and adventure filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet it all feels a little clinical; the edge-of-the-seat excitement is missing. Perhaps it has been engineered out: the sound feels over-tweaked, and although the spatial effects at the beginning of the third movement – with the cor anglais duetting with a faraway oboe – come over beautifully, elsewhere it sometimes feels as though we’re being shown exactly what to listen to.The symphony is paired with Ravel’s La Valse, which fares better: the orchestra are again on sparkling form but here the energy keeps on fizzing. Mäkelä keeps the tempo whirling and the momentum rising; by the end the whole thing feels held together by centrifugal force alone.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

And as she gears up for a performance at this year’s Glastonbury festival, PP Arnold will be answering your questions.Born into a family of gospel singers in Los Angeles, Arnold could have easily never ended up in music: by the age of 17 she was a mother-of-two in an abusive marriage. But she auditioned for Ike and Tina Turner and was hired as an Ikette, fleeing her husband to perform backing vocals on tour and in the studio, with Tina becoming a mentor.After the Turner band toured with the Rolling Stones in the UK in 1966, Arnold left and stuck around in England. The admiring Mick Jagger helped secure her a record contract, and she was quickly in the thick of swinging London as British pop and rock swept to cultural dominance. Arnold sang backing vocals on the Small Faces’ Itchycoo Park and the band in turn backed her own studio recordings; she duetted with Rod Stewart on Come Home Baby; her backing band for a time were the Nice, featuring Keith Emerson; and the Bee Gees’ Barry Gibb produced some of her work.Her debut album contained a cover of Cat Stevens’ The First Cut Is the Deepest which many consider to be the definitive version, while the follow-up Kafunta – orchestrated by Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones – contained another iconic cover, of Angel of the Morning, both British chart hits.The unlikely return of PP Arnold: 'I put myself in God's hands'Read moreThose would be her biggest solo successes, but Arnold remained rooted in the entertainment business, segueing to musical theatre and collaborating with Eric Clapton, Nick Drake and singing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel’s megahit Sledgehammer. She was sought after in the 80s and 90s dance scene, doing vocals for the Beatmasters and Altern-8 and singing the hook of the KLF’s 3am Eternal. She also partnered with Ocean Colour Scene and Primal Scream.Now 78, she has continued to release her own music – 2019 brought The New Adventures of... PP Arnold – and she will perform songs from her remarkable discography at Glastonbury’s Acoustic stage on Sunday 29 June at 4pm. Before she does, she’ll answer your questions – post them in the comments before 10am BST on Tuesday 24 June.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockFilm & Music reader interviewcalloutShareReuse this content"

The two struck up an unlikely but fierce friendship nearly a decade ago, and Kojima says that, as a teenager, the first two Mad Max films inspired him to become a movie director and thus, eventually, a video game maker. At the panel later, Miller is equally effusive, calling Kojima “almost my brother”; the Australian even lent his appearance to a major character in Kojima’s latest game,Death Stranding2.It’s actually because of Miller that much of this latest game is set in a heavily fictionalised version of Australia, Kojima jokes. Death Stranding, a game about slogging through vast, treacherous yet gorgeous environments to deliver parcels between isolated bunkers, is particularly suited to Australia’s diverse and varied biosphere; the game’s geography may be condensed and fantastical, but the beauty and the terror remains.View image in fullscreenFierce friends … Hideo Kojima with George Miller at the Sydney film festival, June 2025.Photograph: Tim Levy/Sydney Film FestivalIn addition to sweeping, moody outback landscapes, DS2 also has some of the most vividly detailed (or at least expensive) depictions of Australian wildlife in all of gaming. Spotting the distinctive hopping gait of a kangaroo on a sun-drenched horizon was, for this decidedly urban Australian, an oddly moving sight.“I love animals, and they’re unique here,” says Kojima, who passed on catching some early morning festival screenings to go to the zoo instead. “A lot of people [on the team] love animals … They might say no to designing a new mech, but they wanted to make more animals.”Film buff Kojima drops a few Australian cinematic references too – he likes the1971 flick Walkabout, and admits DS2’s subtitle, On the Beach, is a reference to the classic Melbourne-based post-apocalyptic movie of the same name (“I love the original novel”) – but his real reasoning behind the location choice was simple: “I wanted to go to Australia.” Though he’s visited before, he wanted to go deeper in, “to the middle of the land, the desert”.But because of the pandemic, Kojima’s team was forced to use remote location scouts to gather data; being unable to be there in person was very disappointing, he says. “It’s totally different from looking at a picture, when you’re feeling it, on location.”Remote work, during the pandemic and beyond, has been a sticking point for the game. “The hardest thing was the performance capture,” he says. Directing cast members such as Norman Reedus orLéa Seydouxremotely from Japan was the “worst experience”, his direction “almost impossible to relay” from the other side of a Zoom call. With restrictions in place during the early parts of development, the team tried to focus on scenes that didn’t utilise the main actors early on, but it wasn’t always possible.“And for the new cast especially, it was quite difficult,” he says, “Because I wanted to explain: this is the character, this is how I want you to act – but it was all remote!”View image in fullscreenAn oddly moving sight … Death Stranding 2: On the Beach.Photograph: Kojima Productions/SonyThe situation eased by 2022, he says, allowing him to fly to LA and direct in person – to build a better rapport with his cast and get them more used to the nuances of acting for games. “People who have done Marvel movies, they’ve experienced performance capture, with the green backgrounds,” he says. (In most cinematic games, real-world acting is translated to the digital realm throughmotion capture technology– which can be jarring to actors used to sets and costumes.) “We actually have a tool: if you look at the monitor, you can see the [in-game] world displayed in real time.”Kojima says he tries to keep actors performing together as much as possible, though there are always exceptions where they had to record separately, especially during Covid. And then there were problems specific to games, such as the need for multiple takes on a character’s grunts of pain or repeatable in-game actions like eating an apple. “Sometimes we’d get questions from Norman, and I’d say, ‘Eat the apple and it’s good’, or ‘Eat the apple and it’s not good’ – we want those differences! Over and over, we had to ask for those kinds of things.”View image in fullscreenKojima at the Sydney Film FestivalPhotograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianDeath Stranding made “connections” its thesis statement; players never see one another in-game, yet can pool resources and build structures to benefit themselves and others, creating intricate networks of services to make the long drudgery of delivery easier for everyone. So why is the sequel’s tagline the ominous question: “Should we have connected?”“I became sick during the pandemic, and I was totally isolated,” Kojima says. Compounding that, optical muscle damage from a recent eye surgery meant that he couldn’t even watch movies or TV. The world shifted around him: everyone was bunkering down, working online, communicating through video calls as delivery people kept the world running. His game, his vision, had come true.“It seemed like, yes, we’re all connected. But it’s not really the connection that I imagined,” he says. His company, Kojima Productions, was staffing up; he would meet new hires in person on their first day and then, due to pandemic restrictions, not see them again for the next three years.Having spoken recently about legacy (news of aUSB drive “full of ideas”he had supposedly prepared to leave behind took on a life of its own, he laughs), Kojima believes in-person collaboration remains the best way to foster new talent. “The reason why [new hires] want to work with us is they want to learn from mentors, or become better by working with other people,” he says. “But if you’re purely online … it’s almost like outsourcing. You want to talk and see what other people are doing, so you can expand yourself, you can grow.”Remote work is “almost like a fast food chain; you’re just concentrating on one thing instead of the whole project,” he says: in a collaborative industry like game-making, it introduces inefficiencies. With people siloed off, there’s no back-and-forth, he says; people discover their mistakes later and there’s less room for happy coincidences, spur-of-the-moment suggestions or alternate viewpoints.Aside from that, he adds, you don’t get to know your team members, see how people are feeling or ask them about their hobbies. “Only 1% of yourself is on show during [online] meetings,” he says. “This is not like building a team. Think about football. You hire someone, he comes to your squad – but you can’t play together remotely. So that person doesn’t change the way they played before; they won’t fit in,” he says.Still, “you can’t force people back to the office, you can only persuade them,” he says. “So not everyone came back. But the main members did, so we could work together.”View image in fullscreen‘I wanted to go to Australia’ … Death Stranding 2: On the Beach.Despite this slightly dour tone, Kojima seemingly remains hopeful. Death Stranding is a deeply lonely game, he says animatedly during a later group presentation. “But … you find other players all over the world. You’re indirectly connected … And once you turn that [game] off and go outside … you see structures in real life, like the bridge here in Sydney.Someone made that!They might have passed away years ago, but you’re connected to them. Even if you haven’t met the person. You are not alone in this world.”And there’s always new horizons. Kojima has a long-held dream of visiting outer space – not a mere billionaire’s suborbital hop, but something more. “That’s not space,” he says, firmly. “I want to train properly, learn how to do the docking, go to the International Space Station and stay there for a few months … I’m not a scientist, but I could probably make games in space. I want to be the first. There are a lot of astronauts over 60, so I guess it’s possible.” There’s no gravity in space to irritate his bad back, after all, he jokes.As we wrap up, he pauses for a moment, thinking, and adds one last ambition: he wants to be put in a situation, he says, where he risks his life doing something that would give him a feeling of really being alive. “It’s ‘Tom Cruise disease’,” Kojima elaborates. “Tom Cruise finds out his worth when living with his life on the line.”Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is out on 26 June onPlayStation5.Explore more on these topicsGamesDeath StrandingPlayStationAction gamesAdventure gamesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It was originally titled Eccentric Abstraction, but the eccentrically abstract isn’t nearly as sexy as the erotic – yet somehow neither title quite fits the strange and compelling sculptures and little objects, drawings and reliefs by Alice Adams, Eva Hesse andLouise Bourgeoisthat, even 60 years on, are as alive as ever they were.Eccentric Abstraction was the first exhibition Lippard had ever curated, and was, she said, “an attempt to blur boundaries, in this case between minimalism and something more sensuous and sensual – that is, in retrospect, something more feminist” – although, at the time, feminism was far from her mind. The exhibition was crucial in the development of the now 88-year-old’s thinking and her subsequent activism.Although many of the works here were included in the original show, this is not a thorough restaging, and all the male artists, including the then recently graduated Bruce Nauman, are absent. Eccentric Abstraction is largely remembered for the contributions the three female artists made, for the coherence of their approaches to materiality, form and artistic process, and the ways their work addressed the psychosexual and the human body.There are fewer than 30 sculptures, reliefs and drawings here, occupying two small rooms. But size isn’t everything. One of the delights of this exhibition is to do with scale. Only one work is bigger than we are. Others you could put in your pocket or carry in your arms. The works of all three artists sit close to the walls, hang from the walls, dangle on wires in front of them, or sit on shelves in a vitrine, jostling in and out of view, emphasising intimacy and proximity. It is a show of close relations, filled with delicate things and enigmatic things, and things as incomprehensible as they are beguiling.View image in fullscreenA show of close relations … Eva Hesse, No title, 1966.Photograph: Stefan Altenburger Photography Zürich/© The Estate of Eva Hesse. Courtesy Hauser & Wirth. Photo: Stefan Altenburger Photography ZürichIt isn’t all about forms directly analogous to body parts, although there are plenty of those. There is instead an unnerving slippage between the skin and the interior, between the whole and the part, just as there is between sculptural form and drawing, between object and image, threat and tenderness, familiarity and otherness.A black shape like a pear or a lightbulb, by Hesse, dangles from the wall on a string that loops around a nail to another object that just touches the pear thing. This object is like a skinny black sausage that narrows at its tip then bulges out again, like a bratwurst giving birth to a cocktail sausage. All the elements are painted with black enamel. Stark and graphic, the arrangement is funny and lewd and very satisfying to look at – reminding me, distantly, of Giacometti’s 1930-31 surrealist sculpture Suspended Ball. While movements and idioms come and go, distant debts to surrealism and Freud persist. The unconscious is always with us.A steel cable passes through the holes in a perforated metal plate and gets entangled there. Another rusted steel cable is woven through a metal grid. Their relations are complicated and they ensnare me. These tensile amalgamations were the work of Adams, who first trained as a weaver and previously worked with looms and fibre. There is a direct link between her earlier textile art and these sculptures. Other, later works use chain-link fencing, and yet more lengths of springy, twisty, recalcitrant cable that could only be manipulated with difficulty. Their torsions have lives of their own, and can’t be forced to follow paths they don’t want to take. Adams’s materials told her what could and couldn’t be done. Some things twist and coil and are held in dynamic constraint. They have the brevity of a sentence but look as if they could explode.View image in fullscreenThey have the brevity of a sentence but look as if they could explode … Alice Adams, Sheath, 1964.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and David Hall Gallery, Wellesley MA. ©️ Howcroft Photography, Boston. Beth Rudin DeWoody CollectionAnother work – an interpenetrating conjunction of a chain-link cylinder and a rusted, woven steel cable funnel – conflates the two forms into a conundrum of interior and exterior. A bulging roll of aluminium fencing hangs like a great intestinal tract in mid-air, a huge skeletal drawing in wire, the form dramatically lit and entangled with its own shadow, which is cast on the wall just behind it.If Eccentric Abstraction seems like a long time ago, the ways the artists worked endure, in their approach to materiality, their disregard of neat divisions between abstraction and figuration, and the ways their works not only occupy space but actively inhabit it. This sensibility is still with us. If the ideas are still alive, much of the works Hesse made using hand-poured sheets of latex resin are now extremely difficult to show or to conserve, the material having darkened and become brittle by age exposure to daylight.The same is true of the sculptures Bourgeois made using latex. Several of Bourgeois’s sculptures here have darkened and shrivelled, and acquired a feel of the archaeological relic, if not the fossilised. Her latex and cloth Le Regard, a kind of rounded bowl or vessel split open to reveal something (are there teeth in there, is that an eye or a clitoris?) now seems to belong to an archaic past. Perhaps timelessness can only ever be accidental.Bourgeois’s art is filled with ambivalent images and forms. Her Fée Couturière is a dangling off-white sac, a little like a wasp’s nest penetrated by apertures. It might be a head, it could be a habitation. Even the version of her Fillette, a dangling erect penis and balls, sheathed and swaddled in some kind of blanket, is as much female as it is, just as inescapably, male. Gender in almost all the works here is slippery, when it can be ascribed at all.View image in fullscreenRecords of her own emotional weather … Louise Bourgeois, Untitled, 1968.Photograph: Photo : Christopher Burke, © The Easton Foundation, Licensed by DACS, UK and VAGA at ARS, NYWhat a can of worms all this is. On cue, sitting on a shelf behind glass, are two small cylindrical containers by Hesse, one most likely the original lid to the other, both filled to overflowing with little worms, fashioned from cord and wire, everything painted in white enamel.Many of Hesse’s works from the mid-1960s can be seen as impromptus or asides, things made in the moment, without much regard to their permanence. Wrapped objects bulge in sagging net bags, like so much shopping. It’s as if Hesse made things to see what they would look like, how they would look back at her and tell her what to do next: one thing leading to another, and another. Many of the compound forms Hesse created were made using inflated balloons as a kind of armature, their surfaces built up and solidified using tape and paint. The process is immediate and daft, as basic as breathing.Along with Abstract Erotic, The Courtauld is also showing a room of drawings by Bourgeois. Filled with maelstroms and turbulence, repetitive gestures and breast forms, waves and rows of marks and unnameable, unstoppable eruptions, they are more records of her own emotional weather than any formal search. These drawings often have a great touch, but the sculptures in Abstract Erotic say it all, even when we don’t know what it is.Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Alice Adams atthe Courtauld, London, from 20 June to 14 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsArtLouise BourgeoisExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Every now and then, I join him and we then walk for a bit (there is nothing like a caffeine-baba spring in your step), and congratulate each other for not smoking while both wishing that we had a cigarette.In Poland, the word “baba” can refer to a variety of baked goods, and one in particular is made with rye flour and sweet wine. Baba al rum came about thanks to the greediness of twice king of Poland Stanislaus Leszczyński, who, exiled in Lorraine, thought hiskougelhopftoo dry, so asked for it to be soaked in rum. This inspired his pastry chef to perfect the dish and, in turn, subsequently inspired other pastry chefs, like baba dominoes. It is a project, though, and remember to chill the eggs.Arrange the babas in a serving dish, then, just before eating, spoon over a little of the reserved syrup, so they shine.In the Gastronomy of Italy, Anna del Conte describes babas soaked in rum as also being covered with enough thin icing to hold a few flaked almonds, and topped with a hot sauce made from sweet local wine – a description that makes a Sicilian cassata seem reasonably sweet (not that I don’t love the idea). Also, consider serving baba al rum with fridge-cold double or whipped cream and an espresso, and thengo.Mini babas al rum (small sponge cakes soaked in rum)Makes12Oil,to grease300g plain flour12g fresh yeast,crumbled6 very cold eggs5g salt20g caster sugar100g butter, cut into 6 piecesFor the syrup350g caster sugarA few strips of lemon or orange zest100-150ml rumLightly oil 12 baba moulds or ramekins. Working in a food processor with a dough hook, put the flour and crumbled yeast in the bowl, then start the hook at medium-low. Add the eggs one at a time, making sure each is incorporated before adding the next - this will take about eight minutes. Now add the salt and sugar, followed by the butter piece by piece, making sure each bit is incorporated before adding any more. Cover the bowl and leave to sit in a warm spot to rise and double in volume – this should take between two and three hours, depending on the temperature.Rub your hands with water, then ease the dough away from the sides of the bowl (it will deflate). Still working with wet hands, pull off roughly 40g pieces of dough (it’s an idea to weigh the first one, to get an idea of the right size), then squeeze each lump tightly in your fist so it oozes into the lightly oiled moulds. Cover and leave to sit for an hour, or until the dough rises just above the top of the mould.Arrange the moulds on a baking tray and bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 16-20 minutes, then remove and leave to cool completely, or overnight, before un-moulding.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app. Scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.Make the syrup by warming 500ml water with the sugar and a few strips of lemon or orange zest over a medium flame, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Pull off the heat, add the rum, then leave to cool until tepid. Add the babas and let them bob around like apples for a couple of minutes (help them along by turning occasionally). Then, with clean hands, lift out the babas one by one, squeeze gently (this helps enormously with absorption), then return to the syrup for another minute-long soak.Lift out the babas out again and put them on a baking rack to drain. Pour the remaining syrup into a jug. Arrange the babas in a serving dish, then, just before eating, spoon over a little more of the syrup, so they shine.Explore more on these topicsDessertA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkBakingSpiritsEggsCakerecipesShareReuse this content"
