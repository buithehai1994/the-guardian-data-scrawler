By its end, you are filled with questionsLucy ManganSun 3 Aug 2025 18.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 18.34 EDTShareWhen three times more babies than expected die on a neonatal ward and one nurse is on duty during those deaths, it’s got to be pretty much an open-and-shut case, hasn’t it? Especially when breathing tubes have been clearly deliberately dislodged by someone from their tiny bodies and blood tests show spikes in insulin that can only be explained by the stuff being injected. And if you find someone who has written notes to herself about her guilt, then the way forward is clear. Lock the perpetrator up. Throw away the key.Such was the initial and still persisting narrative in the case of Lucy Letby, the neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester hospital in Cheshire who became, in tabloid parlance, “Britain’s worst child serial killer”, when she was convicted in 2023 ofseven murders and seven attempted murdersof the infants in her care.Since then, there has been growing disquiet about the quality of the evidence against her and the reliability of her conviction. Lucy Letby: Beyond Reasonable Doubt sets itself the formidable task of forcing passion and sentiment aside and unpacking the science and statistics around the most contended pieces of evidence so that, perhaps, facts – buried, missed, distorted or otherwise – can be examined by a newly informed mass audience.In its marshalling and explanation of complicated medical and mathematical issues, it succeeds brilliantly, covering more ground more meticulously in an hour than any documentary I’ve seen in recent years, and perhaps ever. It also – and this is possibly an even greater and more precious rarity – trusts its audience emotionally. It acknowledges but does not linger on the terrible suffering of the bereaved parents. If you cannot see that we all appreciate that their pain was and remains fathomless, the makers’ message seems to be that the fault lies with you and we will carry on with our stated objective meantime. It’s a confidence that I wish all documentaries could show.Via a proliferating army of world experts on an array of issues brought up by the case, the alternative narrative is carefully put together. First there are questions asked and answered. Why was there a spike in mortality rates around the time Letby arrived? It is argued that she arrived at a time when the hospital was suddenly required to take in much sicker babies than it had before, babies it was hardly equipped to cope with. How do we explain that Letby was on duty every time a baby died or collapsed? The claim is made that she wasn’t – that the infamous shift chart that the prosecution used did not explain how its data was compiled and in fact showed only the fatalities and deteriorations during which she was present. If you compile a chart showing the proportion of all those that occurred on the ward during her period of employment, the correlation – and damnation – disappears.What, then, of the dislodged tubes? As a witness for the prosecution, paediatric doctor Ravi Jayaram asserted that infants that age could not dislodge them themselves. This is simply not true, say experts including Dr Richard Taylor, a specialist in neonatal care with 30 years’ experience. “We’ve all seen it.” We hear that, on the stand, Dr Jayaram also stated that he saw Letby standing by doing nothing and raising no alarm as one baby’s oxygen levels dropped dangerously. However, we’re told that an email he wrote, which has been discovered since, suggeststhat he was present precisely because she had called him.On we are taken, step by step, through alternative explanations for the insulin results, the Post-it notes on which Letby apparently confessed her guilt, and the rest of the circumstantial evidence amassed by the prosecution. Just one witness was called in Letby’s defence at trial – a hospital plumber, to testify to sewage issues and therefore possible hygiene problems on the ward. We also hear that the prosecution’s main witness, Dr Dewi Evans, has since changed his mind on how one of the babies Letby was convicted of killing died. And we are invited to consider how all of this should be weighted against Letby’s apparent lack of motive and, more implicitly, the extreme rarity of young, female serial killers of children.The makers do not dwell on why Letby’s team put forward such a minimal defence, though I’m sure further and broader analyses will come in time, probably encompassing such factors as the trust we place in ministering angels and the fury we feel when it appears to have been betrayed, as well as the general public’s relative ignorance of science and how to compute data. But, by the end of this considered, brilliantly cogent hour you cannot help but feel that at the very least Letby’s conviction is unsafe. The final scenes are of her (new) lawyer Mark McDonald delivering an application to have her case re-examined to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. But this can only be granted if new evidence has come to light – and, technically, everything he has submitted was available to her original defence at the time. The question of what constitutes justice continues.Lucy Letby: Beyond Reasonable Doubt? aired on ITV1 and is available on ITVX.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewLucy LetbyDocumentaryFactual TVCrimereviewsShareReuse this content"

Amid euphoric scenes, Ferrand-Prévot, gold medallist at theParis Olympics last year, followed up her lone win on the Col de la Madeleine on Saturday with another solo exploit in the Tour’s final stage.Ferrand-Prévot is the first French rider to win theTour de France Femmes, 36 years after her compatriot Jeannie Longo won the Tour de France Féminin, although that race did not compare with the scale, difficulty and global renown of the latest incarnation. Suddenly, after waiting 40 years for a successor to Bernard Hinault in the men’s Tour, all France is now enamoured by women’s cycling and with the 33-year-old from Reims, who was called within minutes of confirming her victory by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.Ferrand-Prévot’s achievement, of winning the Tour de France andParis-Roubaix in the same year, and both within 12 months of winning an Olympic gold medal for mountain biking, confirms her versatility and ambition. With the Olympic rings tattooed on her arm, she had reverted to road racing from mountain biking and stated that it was her ambition to win the Tour within three years. She did it in one.“I think I put the bar really high this year in terms of preparing for this race,” she said. “There have been a lot of sacrifices. Now I just want to enjoy the moment, because it might only happen once.”The writing was on the wall even on stage one, when she jumped clear of the peloton on the final climb of the Côte de Cadoudal in Plumelec, with a sharp acceleration. But she bided her time and has remained calm and contained throughout, even during the mid-race public spat between her team manager, Jos van Emden, and Demi Vollering’s team manager, Stephen Delcourt.View image in fullscreenFrench rider Pauline Ferrand-Prévot had double cause to celebrate, claiming stage nine and the overall title.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPAFor seven of the nine stages she remained discreet, but when her moment came she was ready. If her first stage win, on the Madeleine on Saturday, confirmed the earlier impressions of her speed in Plumelec, her win in Châtel emphasised her dominance.“I’d said to the sports directors this morning that if I could win in yellow then I’d try to,” she said. “It all came down to how I felt on the last climb. I attacked but I didn’t think I’d be able to keep going like that and win.”As the final stage began there were, initially, some nerves and Ferrand-Prévot was put under pressure almost immediately as she lost ground with the main peloton on the long descent from the start to Sallanches.“I made a mistake on the first descent,” she said. “I think I was just a bit scared with the pressure of the jersey, so afterwards I stayed close to the front and made an effort to stay there.”However, the race leader rejoined the main group on the approach to the first climb, the Cote d’Arâches-la-Frasse. Even before top of the first category climb a selection had been made with the favourites all moving ahead of the splintering bunch, in pursuit of the lone breakaway, Anna van der Breggen.The Dutch rider, 12th overall as the stage began, built up a near two-minute lead on the approach to the hardest climb of the stage, the Col de Joux‑Plane. Behind her the main peloton dwindled further after Cédrine Kerbaol, then fifth overall, crashed at the foot of the climb and was distanced quickly.The Joux-Plane’s gradients reduced the lead group to just seven riders, including Ferrand‑Prévot, second-placed Sarah Gigante, the 2023 winner, Vollering, and the defending champion, Kasia Niewiadoma.Five kilometres from the top, Gigante accelerated, taking her rivals with her, but as on Saturday’s climb, to the top of the Madeleine, the Australian was not able to open a gap. Instead, it was Vollering and Niewiadoma who combined on the fast descent to distance Gigante, in the hope of pushing her out of the Tour’s top three. By the foot of the descent they had succeeded and she was never able to recover.Vollering, second overall, and Niewiadoma, who finished third, have shown remarkable consistency. They have appeared on the podium in every edition of the Tour de France Femmes since its inauguration in 2022. But this past week was all about the rebirth of French cycling. With the yellow jersey plus four stage wins out of nine days of racing, two for Ferrand-Prévot and two for the irrepressible Maëva Squiban, the hosts have dominated. There is, at long last, life after Hinault.Explore more on these topicsTour de France FemmesCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the crustaceans that make for some of the most ingenious footage, thoughJack SealeSun 3 Aug 2025 15.20 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 19.41 EDTShareThere must be a rule printed on parchment somewhere at the BBC that says all big wildlife documentaries must feature a sweeping shot of the African savannah at the top of episode one. Wildebeest or buffalo must roam majestically across the grasslands in search of water, only for one of the herd to be brought down by a cunning lion or cheetah. The awe is bittersweet: sorry, big guy, but a cat’s got to eat.This sappingly familiar narrative plays out in the opening instalment of Parenthood, a Sunday-evening naturefest narrated byDavid Attenborough, before we have blown the steam off our tea. It sets us up for a show that offers BBC One natural history in a cuter, less spectacular and groundbreaking mode than the channel’s classic shows – but the suspicion that it may not have anything fresh to impart is soon dispelled.View image in fullscreenA lioness leads her cub through a newly formed swamp in the central Kalahari, Botswana.Photograph: Jeff Wilson/BBC/Silverback FilmsOur interest picks up as we leave Botswana – with its lionesses teaching cubs to hunt buffalo and then having to implement a shared-parenting protocol when one of the mums is gored to death in the melee – and dive into the ocean, to a reef off the Indonesian coast.A boxer crab sits on 1,000 eggs, keeping her strength up via the ingenious life hack of holding an anemone in each claw and sucking plankton off the tentacles. An ugly, crusty cuttlefish attacks, but anemones are weapons as well as tasty pom-poms, so the boxer crab survives. Then a jealous rival crab mother, rubbing her claws together in the background like a 1940s movie villain, attempts to take the anemones by force. Pincers furiously pince, but, like all the best matriarchs of large families, our pal with 1,000 children always has another clever trick.Next, we are off to wild Arizona, where it’s dating season: a young male is looking for a good hole. He is a burrowing owl; any prospective mate will want him to have secured a home, which for this species is a burrow abandoned by another animal. When he has found a spot that isn’t still occupied by the angry rodent who dug it, or already colonised by other owls, he and his new partner settle in and have chicks, which consigns them to a long spell of thankless hunting, feeding and saving the offspring from being eaten by roadrunners. Then the chicks grow up, glare at their parents contemptuously – although that could just be the default owl countenance – and leave the nest.View image in fullscreenAn African social spider sacrifices herself to her hungry and growing young.Photograph: Tharina Bird/BBC/Silverback FilmsWhat the ageing, knackered Mr and Mrs Burrowing-Owl do once they have fulfilled their nurturing duties and finally have time for themselves isn’t specified, but even a weary owl divorce couldn’t be as dispiriting as the fate of the African social spider in Namibia. She is the headline act of the episode, initially thanks to the creepy – even for spiders – way in which she and her sisters hunt. Finding prey that has become snagged in their giant Miss-Havisham’s-hair mess of a nest involves a horrific game of grandma’s footsteps, all of them moving together and then stopping dead, as one, so they can listen for tiny vibrations. But when her many kids grow up and Mum gets old, her own movements across the silky filaments become jerky and erratic. In spider language, this sends a clear message: eat me.View image in fullscreenAn endangered Iberian lynx and her young kitten in central Spain.Photograph: Domingo Garcia Llanos/BBC/Silverback FilmsBeing devoured alive by ungrateful children is as bad as it gets. The galumphing cuteness of lowland gorillas in Gabon, where a silverback dad is eyed casually by his other half as she muses on whether to trade him in for someone younger and fitter, is benign in comparison, as is a tale of endangered iberian lynx that upturns the usual warnings about humankind’s malign influence on the natural world. Mother and baby lynx live prosperously as a result of farming practices that have been recalibrated to benefit the wildlife.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

And although it now hangs 80 miles from its original home, where no one has any ability to jump on a train to Watford Junction or anywhere else, it is still plugged into the national network and doing its old job, like a nostalgic retiree unable to let go.It’s a surreal sight in an eccentric place – part storage facility, part private museum – which is home to a collection of trains, models and memorabilia now in the care of the multimillionaire asset manager, rightwing political donor and self-confessed railway nut Jeremy Hosking.As well as restoring and giving a home to old locomotives, carriages and scale models, Hosking part-owns Crystal Palace football team, a luxury hotel in Sussex andBritain’s only private train(even the royal family don’t own theirs). In addition, he has investedmore than £100m in fossil fuel interests, was thesole funderof Laurence Fox’s Reclaim party, and this week confirmed he wasbacking a £100m bidto buy the Daily Telegraph. It’s quite the investment portfolio.View image in fullscreenSome of Jeremy Hosking’s collection of trains.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianGiven his lifelong love of trains – which he calls “childhood obsession meets midlife crisis” – and deep pockets, Hosking was an obvious person to approach to take the 25-year-old Euston board when it was replaced by Network Rail in 2022. Unlike several museums, he said yes. But his offer to house it was, it transpires, based on a major misunderstanding.The businessman revealed to the Guardian that he thought he was getting the original, analogue 1960s display board, which operated on the clacking “split flap” mechanismonce commonat airports and railway stations, rather than a 20-year-old board with LED lights. “It still wouldn’t have been an antique, but it would have been the authentic, late 60s, white-hot technology of its day,” said Hosking. “And actually, what we’ve got is the white-hot technology of 2003.”Was that a disappointment? “To have given house room to the wrong departure board? Yes! But hopefully in decades to come, people will come to regard this board in a similar way,” he said.View image in fullscreenNew information boards outside Euston last November.Photograph: Andy Hall/The GuardianHe may be right, given the vexed saga of Euston’s departure displays since. The board’s removal was part of a plan to address overcrowding at thenotoriously dysfunctionalstation, but its replacement by multiple smaller information points – and one huge advertising board –caused such furythat it prompted the then transport secretary, Louise Haigh, to demand the changes be reversed.No such drama in Margate, where the departures board now hangs quietly above a collection that includes multiple steam and electric locomotives, the 1830s Broadstairs horse-drawn mail coach, an original 1990s Channel tunnel train, complete with onboard Passport Office facilities that were never used, and an exquisite art deco “Beavertail” observation car commissioned to mark the 1937 coronation of George VI.The Margate warehouse was previously a storage space for the model train manufacturer Hornby, which operates asmall visitor attractionfrom its former factory next door. Though Hosking has spent huge sums to make his site fully accessible to visitors, there are no current plans to open it to the public regularly, according to Frank Martin, the former Hornby CEO who now runs the businessman’s Locomotive Services Group, which also operates a number of heritage lines around the country.View image in fullscreenA carriage made for George VI’s coronation.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianNext weekend, however,both will open their doorsfor a weekend marking the200th anniversaryof the modern railway, and visitors can, if they wish, relive the experience of pacing in front of the Euston board harrumphing over delays at Crewe.It is left to flicker constantly with live information, said Martin, “because every time you switch it off and switch it on again, you stress the electrical components. So in order to keep it running for the longest possible time, it’s better to leave it switched on, just ticking away in the background.”The fact that it still showing live information, he said, “means that it’s been kept alive. It sounds a bit emotional, but it’s been kept alive – and the alternative was for it to be scrapped and lost.”Explore more on these topicsRail transportHeritageKentTransportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s what five sober years have taught meTo give up drinking once seemed unthinkable – and when I finally made the leap, it didn’t go quite as expectedPhil DaoustSun 3 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTShareEveryone needs a hobby, and for 40 years mine was booze. I was 17 when I drank enough to throw up for the first time, and 57 when I stopped. In between I spent most nights, and thousands of lunchtimes and afternoons, with at least a gentle buzz on. One cheeky pint would turn into three, four, a binge. I blacked out. I had fumbling, regrettable sex. I vomited out of cars and on to lawns. I drank wine at 50p a bottle and £15 a glass – and a sea oflager, lager, lager. There was vodka flavoured with everything, from raspberries torhubarb and bacon, plus gin and armagnac and amaretto and tequila and eggnog and crème de menthe and Baileys and sherry and blue curaçao and bourbon and cider and Kahlúa.Some evenings I would laugh and laugh and laugh; other times drinking felt more like a grim duty.I talked bollocks, I slurred my words, I lost the ability to speak, I had drunken arguments. I stole a huge block of cheese, a library book, a punt, a traffic cone. (I was arrested for the last one, and when I was being cautioned the officer said I seemed like a bright lad, and had I considered a career in the police?) I slept terribly, waking to a splitting head and a sweaty fear of what I might have got up to.All this again and again and again and again. Account for inflation, and I spenthundreds of thousands of poundson drinks I didn’t particularly enjoy, meals I didn’t need, clubs, taxis, all the crap you’d never buy if you were in your right mind. That’sthe price of a housedown the drain.View image in fullscreen‘My little house in the woods had a cellar, and booze flowed in and out of it like the tide’ … Daoust in France, 2003.Photograph: Ed Alcock/The GuardianMost of this happened in London, when I worked in an office and there was always someone to drink with, but in my 40sI lived on my own in deepest rural France, and that wasn’t much better. Drop in on a neighbour, even at 10am, and you’d be offered a tumbler of wine. My little house in the woods had a cellar, and booze flowed in and out of it like the tide: beaujolais, bordeaux, bourgogne, côtes du Rhône, corbières, corbières-boutenac; Grimbergen, Blanche de Bruxelles, Leffe Blonde, Leffe Brune, Leffe Triple …I arrived in 2003, and sat out that year’s heatwave in a deckchair, drinking Pelforth in the shade of my favourite spruce, and using the bilberries that grew all around to flavour supermarket spirits. Every now and again, I would send photos of dewy glasses to friends back in Britain: look at me, I’m living the life, this stuff is practically free!My home was in the mountains, on the side that caught the storms. On summer nights lightning would hit the power lines, plunging the house into darkness. One August, as thunder shook the forest, I sat under the tallest tree, thrilling to the flashes, knocking back the vodka and oblivious to the fact that the next bolt might be aimed at me. Most evenings, though, I would open a bottle of rasteau and sit on the terrace to enjoy the sunset. One night, polishing off a last few glasses by starlight, I spotted a man with a rifle lurking near the house – and decided it would be a good idea to chase him through the woods, while shouting that I had a gun of my own, which I didn’t. Most shamefully of all, I’d been drinking with my grownup daughter, and I dragged her along with me.I didn’t wrong anyone so badly that I can’t look myself in the face, but there are a lot of people I ought to say sorry to.View image in fullscreen‘Booze helped me relax’ … watching the Oxford v Cambridge boat race, London, 2010.Photograph: Teri PengilleyIt wasn’t all bad. I had some lovely drunken meals, drunken chats and drunken romances. I’m shy, and booze helped me unbend, make friends and meet women. Without it, I might never have got more than a hug from the woman who is now my wife. All the same, the more I drank, the more I tired of the crap that went with it – not just the misbehaving and the hangxiety but the knowledge that none of this was good for my health.AskDr Jeevan Fernando, an associate at the charityAlcohol Change UK, how booze can damage your body and he’ll mention liver disease, of course, and sleep problems, andosteoporosisand drunken falls. “But one that I worry about most is the risk of dementia and cognitive decline,” he says. “Heavy alcohol use is very strongly related to the decline and atrophy of your brain. There is a normal shrinkage that occurs with age, but alcohol can increase that – and the risk of dementia later in life. Then there’s mental health. There is very, very strong evidence of a link to increased anxiety and rates of depression.”There’s more. “Also, chronic alcohol use is related to cardiovascular issues. You have a much higher rate of heart attacks, strokes; your blood pressure is worse.Alcoholis also a known carcinogen – heavily related to breast cancer, liver cancer, bowel cancer …”By my mid-50s, I had seen one close friend drink herself to death.

One mouthful was enough to get me in the zone and wash away my resolve. “This is nice,” my mind would say. “More will be even nicer.”As for stopping completely, that wasn’t on my radar. Booze was how I switched off after a stressful day, how I put a smile on my face. How would I relax without it? How would I fill the evenings? I could hardly become Teetotal Phil if I couldn’t even visualise Teetotal Phil.But then, five years ago, on 2 August 2020, I just packed it in. This may not mean much unless you’re a hardened drinker, but I have got through Christmas parties sober, and office leaving dos. I have survived twowedding receptionson nothing more than alcohol-free wine and beer. Oh, and cocaine, but I never set out to give that up.Joke! I have barely touched drugs in my life, apart from the liquid, legal, socially acceptable one. I’m not about to start now.View image in fullscreen‘Every now and again, I would send photos of dewy glasses to my friends back in Britain’ … France, 2012.Photograph: Phil DaoustI’m not going to lie: I don’t socialise as readily as I used to. Right now, as I write this, I could be at a summer drinks party with my workmates. But I know that as the evening wears on we’d drift apart, like radios that can’t hold a frequency. I’d bring everyone down, the dry ghost at the feast. This is a me-problem, as other non-drinkers seem to cope. Practice would help – but, although I have never thought of myself as tight, the new me struggles with the idea of paying 30 or 40 quid for a round when I’d be knocking back Diet Coke.How have I filled the hours when I would have been drinking? I watch more TV than I used to, and fuss over our two dogs, who soak up attention like hairy sponges. And I exercise –running, yoga, Hiit, calisthenics. A class here, a workshop there. I’ve set up some gymnastics rings in the garden. I’m studying to be a personal trainer. I’d like to learn to juggle. I meet more people than I ever did, and I can actually remember their names afterwards. I’m happier and more stable than I used to be, and now that I have learned there are other ways to handle stress, I don’t worry that some disaster will send me back to the bottle.I was struck – and inspired – by something that the personal trainerTara LaFerraraposted on Threads last month, after the sudden death of her mother. The two had a “tough” relationship, which left a lot to untangle. “I could have easily drunk alcohol during this time of grief, family drama and loss,”LaFerrara wrote, “but I have not. Not one sip of alcohol in almost 1,000 days. Proud of that.”She gave up on her first wedding anniversary, almost three years ago. “I just realised it wasn’t serving me any more,” she tells me. “I didn’t like the taste or how it made me feel during or after. Now I sleep better, have more energy, more clarity, better relationships with my friends and my partner.”How did she take her mind off her mum? “Getting outside in nature, walks, meditation, and working out has helped more than anything else.” And drinking? “I wasn’t tempted. Sitting in this pain and really feeling your raw emotions iswild.”View image in fullscreenIt’s just mineral water, honest.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe wild thing about my own journey, at least to me, is not that I gave up, but how easy it was. I had – still have – the occasional wistful longing for a cold beer on a hot day, or a glass of red when I’m cooking, but that’s it. I didn’t need hypnosis, medication or a support group, although I am not against any of those things. I didn’t feel ashamed abouttaking antidepressants when I needed them, or gettingtherapy for insomniaand anxiety. I am aware of how very lucky I have been. Cold turkey will not be right for everyone. “If you are a very heavy drinker,” Dr Fernando warns, “abruptly stopping may cause withdrawal symptoms, so you should speak to your GP.” All that said, and without wishing to trivialise anyone dealing with addiction, not everyone will find abstinence an uphill struggle.What helped me? Clearly – and miraculously – my dependency on alcohol was far more psychological than physical. Despite the amount I had been drinking, stopping didn’t give me headaches, or jitters, or overpowering cravings. And I was lucky enough to have a good marriage, to a woman who had also drunk her fill. Hannah was the one who first decided to take a break from booze, and I just tagged along, partly to support her. She wasn’t a world-class boozehound like me, but she did enjoy a drink. “Ever since I was little,” she says, “it has been the ultimate treat, the ultimate reward, the ultimate celebration, the ultimate commiseration.”On the downside: “As I got older,” she says, “my hangovers were fucking biblical.” The day after my 57th birthday, “absolutely annihilated”, she announced she was taking three months off the booze. Ten days later, when I got back from a long-planned holiday, I followed suit.Never write yourself off! 25 things I’ve learned about getting fit – after almost 60 years of slothRead moreWhen the three months were up, we both decided to carry on. “After a while,” as Hannah puts it, “the idea of going back becomes absurd. And you think, ‘Well, I could maybe drink on special occasions’ – but I don’t know what occasion could possibly be special enough.” There have been no dramas, no relapses, none of that tension you’d get between a spouse who gets sloshed every night and one whose body is a temple. We’re closer now than we were five years ago. The only fly in the ointment is that 10-day head start. Unless she falls off the wagon, she’ll always be slightly more awesome than me. I’m trying to get over it.A survey of British drinkers last year found48% wanted to cut down or stop entirely. It’s a similar story in the US and Australia. Do I have any advice for them? Nothing that would qualify me to open a detox clinic. But I will say that even if you think you can’t give up, there may come a point when you find yourself pushing at an open door. And, however much you wish you had done it before, you may not have left it too late. I’ve had a lot of tests in the year or so since I started writing about health, and as far as I can tell my liver, brain, heart etc are all in good shape. My teeth are yellower than I’d like, which I blame on the wine, and there are broken veins in my nose and cheeks, but that’s all the obvious damage.Despite those 40 stupid years, I’m hopeful I dodged a bullet. Maybe I was staggering so much it didn’t hit me.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleFit for everAlcoholHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Jason P SmithDivorce‘They ate my ex’s furniture!’: people on their drastic divorce decisions, from training huskies to getting plastic surgeryWhether it’s quitting a job and hitting the road, selling precious gems or jumping out of a plane, the agony of a breakup can spark huge changes – for better or worse …Sam WollastonSun 3 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTShareShe had green eyes that “could see through walls”, Chris remembers, not unruefully. When he and his Russian girlfriend broke up, Chris, originally from Sussex and now living in Maine in the US, admits he had Siberia (Elena came from the city of Novosibirsk) on the mind. He did the obvious thing: went and got a pair of three-month-old Siberian husky puppies: Loki and Freja, brother and sister – also with piercing eyes, but icy blue, especially Loki’s. “People would just stop on the street as he walked by.”Chris had owned dogs before– labradors. “I figured that huskies were labradors with fur coats on,” he says, talking to me from his pickup truck after an early morning paddle in his kayak. “They absolutely are not.”The dogs got bigger, and wilder. “I was completely ill-equipped to train them as the role of dominant alpha doesn’t come naturally to me. They didn’t seem to want to reason with me. Despite four hours of walking a day, it wasn’t enough.” Chris even bought a sled for them, because huskies are bred to pull. (Take note of the sled – it will come back later in this story.)But the dogs frequently escaped, killing chickens and chasing horses. “Twice they were brought home in the back of a police car. They ate my ex-girlfriend’s furniture and bit through electrical and internet cables. I had to duct-tape the fridge closed, because they could open it with their noses. The final straw was when Freja started ripping the plasterboard off the wall.” Now everyone could see through walls.“I returned them to the breeder and wept in her arms,” Chris remembers. “But she did tell me that in her 25 years of breeding huskies, she had never had two returned in such good condition and with such well-kept fur.”A big breakup can often prompt people to overhaul their life – whether that’s a new haircut, career change or, say, acquiring two strapping great Siberian huskies. Why is such a painful time also one of renewal? And when the dust settles, do people look back with regret?Joanna Harrison, a couples counsellor, former divorce lawyerand authorof Five Arguments All Couples (Need To) Have and Why The Washing-Up Matters, understands this better than most. As well as all the big stuff – children, houses, money etc – it’s often the everyday things that people miss after a split. “The quietness at home, not being able to talk about the little things – people feel alone, miss company. Getting a pet may be a way not to feel so alone again. And to have a new project, a new identity. Animals are a key part of people’s identity; the animal we choose might reflect an aspect of our identity that we’re trying to convey.” Chris just chose the wrong animal. Times two.Harrison says divorce or separation can have a profound effect on a person mentally. There’s the pain, for starters. “For some, there may also be relief, but there’s still something that needs mourning – the relationship, the hopes and dreams that are no longer possible.”Of course, the pain will be much greater if you didn’t want the relationship to end. “There are all these different phases we know about: of grief, feelings of anger, shock,” she says. “I work with people who are devastated by the end of a relationship, don’t know which way is up or down. They feel disoriented, lost, broken, numb.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Lalalimola/The GuardianNumb is what Victoria, in Switzerland, felt when her long-term partner unexpectedly walked out. “I doubted myself and everything. I was in shock, not able to feel anything – no anger, no pain, nothing,” she tells me. “How could anyone feel so numb? Was I really dead inside? I decided to put it to the test, put myself into a situation I knew would provoke strong emotions to see if I would still be indifferent to life. My solution? Do something that had been on my bucket list for a long time – skydiving.”And so she found herself in an aeroplane, strapped to an instructor, looking out at the mountains, but still not registering any emotions. It all changed on hearing the instruction to open the door and thinking: hang on, we’re on a plane, the door shouldn’t be open. After watching two other pairs jump and disappear it was Victoria’s turn. “I was on the edge; I closed my eyes and let myself go. The adrenaline rush was something I’ve never felt in my life. I felt fireworks in my brain. Freefalling hundreds of metres above ground, I was happy, I was free. I took in the beautiful day, the wonderful landscape, my audacity to put myself through all that, the fact I was not only alive but ecstatic.”After landing safely, Victoria had a grin so big it began to hurt. “I wrote immediately in my journal a note to myself: ‘This period is not going to be easy, and it will take time to feel like yourself again, but life is much more than this episode. You will heal and you will laugh and love again.’ It took years to fully get over my heartbreak but, as I promised myself, I went back to who I was, eventually. Since then, I always share with anyone going through a heartbreak: have you considered skydiving?”Or indeed backpacking? When Rachel’s relationship of seven years came to an abrupt end, she found herself in a rut. “I phoned my boss, gave my notice and began to plan,” she tells me. “A couple of months later, I flew out of the UK for a solo round-the-world backpacking trip, at the ripe old age of 38. The following two years, I backpacked through Asia and Australia, then visited 30 US states in a beat-up old camper van. I gained a whole new view of the world, met a wonderful girl and emigrated to Germany to start a new life.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Lalalimola/The GuardianHarrison says that in virtually every relationship there are things you might like to do but, “because of your dynamic, what works in your relationship, they don’t happen”. It might be intolerable, because you can’t properly express yourself, and it could contribute to a relationship ending. Or it could be something to do after the relationship ends – set off round the world with a pack on your back.A geographical move, a change of scene, is something that cropped up a lot among the people I spoke to. After her breakup, Deepa travelled from the US to Europe and immediately fell in love all over again: with Prague, where she signed up for an English teaching course. Now back in the US, she admits: “We are sort of back together. But I would leave him for Prague and my own dreams all over again!”Harrison says the urge to go far away is understandable. “Something possibly humiliating has happened, or you feel betrayed; maybe everything you see is going to remind you of it. It’s quite human to wish to have a bit of space to lick your wounds.”She does have a couple of words of warning. “The feelings will follow you. Going to the other side of the world isn’t necessarily going to stop you hurting about the loss of your relationship. You might get there and feel just as awful.” The old problem with any kind of travel is that you tend to bring yourself – and your baggage – along, too.Separation might be an opportunity to get unstuck, says Harrison. “You can claim some of those things back that you may have let your partner do, learn a new skill or do something intrepid, and discover you’re more competent in that area than you realised. It’s reclaiming some identity, and that could be quite positive and exciting.”When John in Belfast was, in his words, “given the old heave-ho” by a girlfriend, he decided to fill the empty space in his life, and in his room, with a synthesiser. “I learned the notes, a few chords, practised scales – no longer was I going to be pigeonholed as a mere boyfriend. I had recovered from the rejection and was forging ahead with a brilliant new life and future, quickly on the way to becoming the nextJean-Michel JarreorDave Greenfield[of the Stranglers] … ”But then John met someone else. “She swept me off my feet, leaving the instrument to gather dust.”It became a repeated sequence, a loop perhaps, if you were looking for a musical analogy. “I found myself with another synth to fill the gap, but it, too, found itself in the corner as I hit the dancefloor, new girlfriend in hand … until, inevitably, another black-and-white-keyed friend with lots of buttons and switches joined the growing army of 1980s music technology.”You won’t have seen John on Top of the Pops. “I was never single long enough to program or even play them. But by the time I bought a house and tied the knot, I had an enviable collection of synthesisers and other beats-making hardware. Today, most have gone, but I do occasionally find myself browsing vintage synthesiser listings on eBay, to keep the marriage sharp … ”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I heard about lizard tattoos, drastic haircuts and dyes (orange and blue). Han in Korea got breast-enlargement surgery after divorce. “But I realised they were too big for my lifestyle, so I downsized two years later. Since then, I have promised myself not to make important decisions after a breakup.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Lalalimola/The GuardianWeight loss came up. Significantly, in the case of Christian in California, who dropped 100lb (45kg). “After 15 years married to a narcissist, I was 315lb and very unhealthy. I wasn’t always like that, but people in toxic relationships often end up not taking care of themselves and gaining weight.” Christian joined his healthcare provider’s supervised weight-loss programme and was able to lose that weight over about eight months. “The road is still ongoing, but the divorce was definitely drastically needed, not only for my happiness, but also for my health.”It wasn’t the only change Christian made. “I threw away my wardrobe of mostly black clothing and started wearing colours again. I wish I had done it sooner.”Rhyannon in Gloucestershire transformed her health – physical and mental – through open-water swimming. After ending her unhappy marriage, she realised she desperately needed significant change in her life. As well as getting a new job, she committed to swimming outdoors throughout the winter. “After years of neglecting my body and succumbing to the demands of work and family obligations, I stumbled upon the pure exhilarating joy of cold-water swimming. It rekindled a long-buried need to indulge in activities that spark joy within me. In my late 40s I confronted my fears, including the intimidating uncertainties of what lay beneath the surface, and discovered I had the ability to swim distances I never thought were possible.”View image in fullscreenRhyannon jumping into a lake in October 2020.Photograph: courtesy of RhyannonThree years after the end of her marriage, Rhyannon swam the length of Windermere – nearly 11 miles (18km). “Change can feel daunting, yet it’s those moments of stepping into the unknown that can uncover the profound joy we deserve.”Harrison says that separation means “a shift from thinking about the needs of the relationship and more to protecting yourself. There can be a need to go into survival mode, and that might go alongside trying to take more care of yourself, look after things that maybe you haven’t.”She also warns that dealing with a breakup is a long process as well as a stressful one. “And it isn’t necessarily linear – you might feel better, then go back to feeling not so good.” She thinks that people can make big decisions very quickly “to get away from something really painful. My advice is often to slow things down, because you can’t really bypass the mourning that needs to be done at the end of a significant relationship.”Some of the decisions I heard about might have benefited from a bit more time. Lawrence in Manchester had a partner who was obsessed with crystals, which he went along with because she was fun. He even collected some for her while out walking, including one “which I was admittedly rather taken with myself, as it was almost perfectly shaped like a neolithic hand axe. Obviously, it wasn’t really a neolithic hand axe, I told myself, as cavemen weren’t making axes out of pretty crystals, were they …”You see where it’s going, right? After Lawrence was dumped, he decided to sell his collection of pseudo-mystical rocks, which he did to a “wizard” who only really seemed interested in the hand axe – £60 for the lot.The folly of his actions began to emerge on a trip to Lisbon where, in the prehistory section of the city museum, Lawrence found a cabinet of crystal hand axes. Then, on another trip, to the Scottish Highlands where he had originally found his, he learned “it was one of few confirmed sites for hunter gatherers in the UK. And that their favourite material to work with was – you guessed it – crystal.”Lawrence doesn’t know for sure that it was the real neolithic deal, but he has seen on the internet cruder versions selling for £4,000-£5,000. “I think it should be in the National Museum of Scotland.”And remember Chris in Maine? You could say his purchase of two Siberian huskies to replace his one Siberian girlfriend wasn’t the wisest of decisions. But this one does at least have a happy(ish) coda. Four years later, clearing out his basement, Chris came across the dog sled he’d forgotten about. With no use for it, he decided to take it to the breeder he had got the dogs from (and to whom he had later returned them).“There were all these huskies running about, some loose, others in pens with runs attached. I asked her what happened to Loki and Freja. ‘They’re here, over in that pen,’ she said. I stayed where I was, she went and opened the door, and out looked this big blond head with bright blue eyes – Loki! He took one look at me and came charging, followed by his sister. They jumped up, pinned me against the wall with their paws on my shoulders, licking me to pieces.”They had a better life now, Chris says – dog sledding in northern Maine in the winter, then spending summers on the farm. Has he seen them again? Does he visit? “I  think that would be too confusing, definitely for me.”The Russian ex had quickly found – and married – someone else. And what about Chris, what’s his current relationship status? “Single. And wary.”Explore more on these topicsDivorceRelationshipsMental healthHealth & wellbeingMarriageFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The world is in a “plastics crisis”, it concluded, which is causing disease and death from infancy to old age and is responsible for at least $1.5tn (£1.1tn) a year in health-related damages.The driver of the crisis is a huge acceleration of plastic production, which has increased by more than 200 times since 1950 and is set to almost triple again to more than a billion tonnes a year by 2060. While plastic has many important uses, the most rapid increase has been in the production of single-use plastics, such asdrinks bottles and fast-food containers.As a result, plastic pollution has also soared, with 8bn tonnes now polluting the entire planet, the review said, from thetop of Mount Everestto thedeepest ocean trench. Less than 10% of plastic is recycled.‘Total infiltration’: How plastics industry swamped vital global treaty talksRead morePlastics endangered people and the planet at every stage, the review said, from the extraction of the fossil fuels they were made from, to production, use and disposal. This results in air pollution, exposure to toxic chemicals and infiltration of the body with microplastics. Plastic pollution can even boost disease-carrying mosquitoes, as water captured in littered plastic provides good breeding sites.The review,published in the leading medical journal the Lancet, was released before the sixth and probably final round of negotiations between countries to agree a legally bindingglobal plastics treatyto tackle the crisis. The talks have been dogged by a deep disagreement between more than 100 countries that back a cap on plastic production and petrostates such as Saudi Arabia that oppose the proposal. The Guardian recently revealed howpetrostates and plastic industry lobbyists are derailingthe negotiations.“We know a great deal about the range and severity of the health and environmental impacts of plastic pollution,” said Prof Philip Landrigan, a paediatrician and epidemiologist at Boston College in the US, and lead author of the new report. He said it was imperative the plastics treaty included measures to protect human and planetary health.“The impacts fall most heavily on vulnerable populations, especially infants and children,” he said. “They result in huge economic costs to society. It is incumbent on us to act in response.”Petrostates and the plastics industry have argued the focus should be on recycling plastic, not cutting production. But, unlike paper, glass, steel and aluminium, chemically complex plastics cannot be readily recycled. The report said: “It is now clear that the world cannot recycle its way out of the plastic pollution crisis.”More than 98% of plastics are made from fossil oil, gas and coal. The energy-intensive production process drives the climate crisis by releasing the equivalent of 2bn tonnes of CO2a year – more than the emissions of Russia, the world’s fourth biggest polluter. Plastic production also produces air pollution, while more than half of unmanaged plastic waste was burned in the open air, further increasing dirty air, the report noted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Many plastic chemicals were linked to health effects at all stages of human life, the report said, but there was a lack of transparency about which chemicals were present in plastics.The analysis found that foetuses, infants and young children were highly susceptible to the harms associated with plastics, with exposure associated with increased risks of miscarriage, premature and stillbirth, birth defects, impaired lung growth, childhood cancer and fertility problems later in life.Plastic waste often breaks down into micro- and nano-plastics which enter the human body via water, food and breathing. The particles have been found inblood,brains,breast milk,placentas,semenandbone marrow. Their impact on human health is largely unknown as yet, but they have beenlinked to strokes and heart attacksand the researchers said a precautionary approach was needed.Plastic is often seen as a cheap material but the scientists argue it is expensive when the cost of health damages are included. One estimate of the health damage from just three plastic chemicals – PBDE, BPA and DEHP – in 38 countrieswas $1.5tn a year.The new analysis is the start of a series of reports that will regularly track the impact of plastics. Margaret Spring, a senior lawyer and one of the report’s co-authors, said: “The reports will offer decision-makers around the world a robust and independent data source to inform the development of effective policies addressing plastic pollution at all levels.”Explore more on these topicsPlasticsPollutionHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

At least 1,400 people have been killed while seeking aid since 27 May, most of whom were killed near GHF sites, while others were killed along the routes of aid convoys, the UN said on Friday. The GHF says it only uses pepper spray or fires warning shots to control crowds.In total, 119 people were killed in Gaza by Israeli shootings and strikes over the last 24 hours, including those seeking aid, the Gaza health ministry said.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military targeted its headquarters in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, on Sunday, killing one staffer and wounding three more. Video taken by an employee showed the headquarters in flames after the strike, which had destroyed much of the building.A separate Israeli strike hit a school in Khan Younis that displaced people had been using as shelter, killing at least two people.Gaza’s population is growing increasingly desperate as the territory sinks further into famine, which experts say is a product of Israel’s continued blockade of aid. Israel has vehemently denied there is a starvation crisis in Gaza and announced expanded aid measures last week, but humanitarians say Israel is still severely restricting the entry of aid.Chart of deaths while seeking aidSix people have died of starvation or malnutrition in the past 24 hours, health officials said, bringing the total number who have died from hunger to 175, 93 of whom were children. The pace of starvation deaths surged in July with more people dying from hunger than in the previous 20 months combined.Humanitarians say a far greater amount of aid needs to enter Gaza to help stabilise the starvation emergency.“We need the sustainable entry of humanitarian aid to flood Gaza with aid for a relatively long period of time. Patients and hospitals need more food than usual to contribute to their recovery,” said Hisham Mhanna, a spokesperson for the ICRC in Gaza.He said the emergency compounded Gaza’s existing crises, which include a devastated healthcare system and the spread of disease. Faced with starvation and lack of humanitarian supplies, aid groups are struggling to help the population of Gaza.In total, at least 60,839 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel’s current military operations, launched after the Hamas-led attack in Israel on 7 October 2023 which killed about 1,200 people.While Israeli strikes continued in Gaza, Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, led prayers at al-Aqsa mosque in occupied East Jerusalem, provoking outrage among regional powers. Ben-Gvir was among a group of about 1,250 people who prayed at the compound on Sunday under the protection of the Israeli military.The compound, which Jews call the Temple Mount, is a highly revered site – the holiest in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam. The site is under Jordanian custodianship; under a decades-old agreement, Jews are allowed to visit but not pray there.Al-Aqsa compound mapJordan condemned the visit, which it described as “an unacceptable provocation”. Its foreign ministry said it “affirmed the kingdom’s absolute rejection and strong condemnation of the continued unacceptable incursions by the extremist minister Ben-Gvir”.Ben-Gvir’s visit was in honour of Tisha B’Av, when Jews mourn the destruction of two Jewish temples, and was the first time that an Israeli minister had publicly prayed at the site.The compound has been the scene of clashes in the past, with Israeli police raiding the mosque in 2023 after Palestinians occupied it in response to reports that Jews were planning a religious ceremony there.Ben-Gvir called for the annexation of Gaza and for Palestinians to leave the territory while at al-Aqsa on Sunday. He said in a post on X: “A message must be sent: to ensure that we conquer all of the Gaza Strip, declare sovereignty …. This is the only way that we will return the hostages and win the war.”Benjamin Netanyahu put out a statement after the visit saying the policy governing the compound “has not changed and will not change”.The controversy came as the Israeli public was reeling from therelease of two videosover the weekend showing emaciated hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza, which triggered protests on Saturday.Netanyahu on Sunday requested the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide food and medical aid to the hostages in Gaza.Hamas responded that it was ready to provide Red Cross aid to the hostages if Israel halted “all forms of air traffic” during the delivery of packages.The occupiedWest Bankwas also gripped by demonstrations on Sunday, with thousands protesting against the war in Gaza and the detention of Palestinians in Israeli prisons. Protesters carried photos of Palestinians killed or detained by Israel, as well as photos of starving children in Gaza.More than 10,800 Palestinians are held in Israeli prisoners. Rights groups have documented widespread torture of Palestinians by Israeli prison guards and soldiers, including sexual abuse, food deprivation and physical abuse.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelWest BankPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Figures released last week showedmore than 25,000 people had arrived in the UK via small boats in 2025so far, a record for this point in the year.Graph of small boat arrivalsProtests outside hotels housing asylum seekersspread this weekend. Nine people were arrested on Saturday in Islington, north London, after brief clashes between protesters and counter-protesters outside the Thistle City Barbican hotel.On Sunday afternoon, more than 100 people, many of them women wearing pink T-shirts, gathered outside the Britannia International hotel in Canary Wharf after reports that asylum seekers had been bussed in under the cover of darkness. Grainy footage on social media appeared to show men getting off a coach and being escorted into the hotel in the early hours.A group of men wearing face masks were also seen outside the Britannia hotel later in the afternoon. Chants of “send them home” broke out.Protesters jeered at people going in and out of the hotel, and officers were forced to step in after flares were let off in the crowd, the Metropolitan police said.A group of people were “harassing occupants and staff” and trying to prevent deliveries being made, the force added. They were also trying to “breach the fencing and access the hotel”.One man had been arrested in Canary Wharf “on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker” after an officer was pushed, police said.Fresh protests had erupted on Thursday outside a hotel in Epping, Essex – the latest in a series of demonstrations after an Ethiopian asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault against a local girl.The “one in, one out” deal agreed with France last month means the government will for the first time be able to send people back there in exchange for asylum seekers with links to Britain.The scheme is uncertain in scale and timing – critics have claimed it will not be a deterrent because it will only result in the exchange of up to 50 people each week.In a statement, Cooper said the additional funding would “turbo-charge the ability of our law enforcement agencies to track the gangs and bring them down, working with our partners overseas, and using state-of-the-art technology and equipment.“Alongside our new agreements with France, this will help us drive forward ourplan for changecommitments to protect the UK’s border security and restore order to our immigration system.”In a separate development, academics at the University of Oxford have concluded that £20bn has been spent on “migrant-welcoming schemes”, including asylum accommodation, over 10 years, but with little focus on integration and community cohesion.A team from the Centre onMigration, Policy and Society (Compas) said the money from 26 different spending streams over the decade to April 2024 included a £10bn overspend on asylum accommodation, while only “small amounts of money” had been spent on long-term goals such as community consent.Jacqueline Broadhead, a senior researcher at Compas, said the government had an opportunity to redress the balance.“While there have been very high levels of overspend on asylum hotels, there has not been equivalent investment on cohesion and integration, which could help mitigate some of the pressures on local communities,” she said.On Saturday, the government released plans to introduce anew offence for advertising irregular small boat crossingsunder the border security, asylum and immigration bill going through parliament.Assisting illegal immigration to the UK is already a crime. Officials believe the offence would give police and other agencies more power to disrupt criminal gangs.And in yet another announcement on Saturday, Cooper said she planned to introduce a fast-track scheme to tackle the asylum backlog, with the aim of turning around decisions within weeks.There are tens of thousands of refugees who have been waiting for longer than a year for an initial decision on their applications for asylum. More than seven in 10 are eventually granted permission to stay in the UK.The Conservatives criticised Cooper’s funding announcement as a “desperate grab for headlines, which will make no real difference”.Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition, told Trevor Phillips on Sky News that Labour should revive Boris Johnson’sditched £700m plan to send people to Rwanda, and should close the hotel in Epping.“What we need is a third-country deterrent so that people can be processed elsewhere,” she said.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeYvette CooperMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The Met Office issued warnings of potential “injuries and danger to life” as a result of “large waves and beach material being thrown on to sea fronts, coastal roads and properties” and “flying debris”.The amber warning has been issued from 10am until 10pm on Monday, with yellow warnings still in effect in Northern Ireland and across northern England between 6am and midnight the same day.Severe travel delays are also expected throughout the UK owing to potential debris caused by the storm.The Met Office warned there would be a “spell of unusually strong west or north-westerly winds to much of Scotland”, with the chief operational meteorologist, Matthew Lehnert, stating that “many inland areas are likely to see gusts of 40-50mph, with 60-70mph more likely at higher elevations and around exposed coasts in Scotland”.Lehnert also warned there was “a small chance that some locations here could even record gusts of 85mph”, with such winds strong enough to break windows, damage roofs and uproot trees.On top of the strong winds, heavy rain is expected to come from the west, hitting Ireland before reaching Great Britain and covering most of Scotland, north Wales and northern England, as some areas such as the Highlands and Lake District are expected to receive heavy showers of between 16 and 32mm of rainfall in the space of an hour.Severe travel delays are expected, with rail travel particularly affected by storms owing to the dangers that debris on the tracks can cause. Trains and ferries have already been cancelled, with Network Rail to close a number of routes at noon on Monday. All other routes will see a reduced timetable and longer journey times due to speed restrictions. National Rail has warned commuters to be aware it is “likely that speed restrictions will be in place and your journey may take longer”.Weatherwatch: it is time meteorologists agreed what is meant by a ‘heat dome’Read moreOther modes of transport are also expected to be affected. Ferries operating on the west coast of Britain, such as those going between the Scottish mainland and the Western Isles, are cancelling services, with the Scottish ferry operator CalMac confirming a series of cancellations.Road travel will also be affected, with motorists told to take extra care during the storm. In a statement, the AA encouraged anyone who insisted on travelling on Monday to do so with care, including allowing extra time for their journey, being careful of other cars and looking out for branches and debris on the roads.The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo said on Sunday it had cancelled its Monday show due to the storm. Other shows in Edinburgh are also expected to be called off.Storm Floris is the sixth named storm to hit Britain during the 2024-25 naming season, which runs from early September to late August, and the first since January’s Storm Éowyn, whichcaused three casualties and more than 1 million power outagesacross Britain, Ireland and Norway.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The programme followed the performer for six months and included her claim to have had sex with 1,057 clients over the course of 12 hours.Visa and Smirnoff are among a number of businesses that have pulled online advertisements from streaming of the documentary, after reviewing the content. The film was condemned by the children’s commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, for “glamorising and normalising” extreme pornography.The documentary also includes footage of Tia Billinger, whose stage name is Bonnie Blue, in a classroom preparing to film an orgy with a group of models dressed in school uniform; the performers acknowledge that they have been selected because they look very young.UK online safety law leads to 5m extra age checks a day for pornography sitesRead moreLady Bertin said she planned to lodge amendments to the crime and policing bill in the autumn to make it illegal for online platforms to host any content that could encourage child sexual abuse, including pornography filmed by adults dressed as children.“This content is pushing at the boundaries. We will be trying to address the ‘barely legal’ aspect legislatively,” she said.The Online Safety Act charged the regulator Ofcom with monitoring whether pornography sites are protecting UK viewers from encountering illegal material involving child sexual abuse and extreme content, such as portrayals of rape, bestiality and necrophilia. However, other forms of harmful pornography that are regulated offline (in cinemas, for example) are not subject to similar restrictions online. This regulatory anomaly means adults role-playing as children to create pornography that appears close to child sexual abuse imagery is not prohibited online.TheChannel 4documentary only showed preparations for the classroom scene rather than the footage itself. Clips showing Bonnie Blue having sex with more than 1,000 men were pixellated, but the programme has still been widely criticised for promoting her brand and for failing to challenge adequately her assertion that her activity is harmless.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now this documentary risks taking us a step back by glamorising, even normalising the things young people tell me are frightening. Bonnie Blue’s content showcases violence against women as entertainment and allows sexist ideas that women are ‘lesser’ than men to go unchecked.”Visa’s advertisements were placed by a third-party agency, but the company requested that they be removed from online streaming of the Channel 4 documentary after staff viewed it and judged that the content did not align with its internal guidelines. Staff at the drinks company Diageo are assessing how a Smirnoff advertisement was cleared to appear during online transmission of the show, and have also subsequently pulled their advertising from streaming of the programme.An Ofcom spokesperson said the regulator was assessing the documentary and would decide whether to launch a formal investigation.The policing minister, Diana Johnson, said last week that she would discuss the ease with which children could access the documentary on Channel 4’s website with ministerial colleagues. Channel 4 requires users to be 16 to register an account, but there is no age-verification process, so children could lie about their age.A Channel 4 spokesperson said the observational film was designed to provoke debate. “The film looks at how Bonnie Blue has gained worldwide attention and earned millions of pounds in the last year, exploring changing attitudes to sex, success, porn and feminism in an ever-evolving online world. Director Victoria Silver puts a number of challenges to Bonnie throughout the documentary on the example she sets and how she is perceived, and the film clearly lays bare the tactics and strategies she uses, with the audience purposefully left to form their own opinions.”Explore more on these topicsPornographyChannel 4TelevisionTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Harry got the better of Andrew by all accounts, leaving him with a bloody nose before the fight was broken up.”Lownie’s biography, Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, also claims Andrew told his nephew that his marriage to Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, would “not last more than a month”.He allegedly “accused Meghan of being an opportunist and thought she was too old for Harry, adding that his nephew was making the biggest mistake ever,” and told his nephew he had gone “bonkers”, accusing him of not doing “any due diligence into her past” before they got engaged in 2017.View image in fullscreenPrince Andrew has kept a low profile since he was stripped of his royal and military titles in 2021.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersLate on Saturday, a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan said: “I can confirmPrince Harryand Prince Andrew have never had a physical fight, nor did Prince Andrew ever make the comments he is alleged to have made about the Duchess of Sussex to Prince Harry.”The duke and duchess have sent a legal letter to the Daily Mail over the publication of what their spokesperson described as “gross inaccuracies, damaging and defamatory remarks”.The Guardian has approached Buckingham Palace and representatives for the Duke of York for comment.Prince Andrew fell from grace after adisastrous Newsnight interview in 2019about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the late American financier and convicted sex offender. The duke was stripped of his royal and military titles in 2021.The book claims Harry and his brother, William, had “problematic” relationships with Andrew for years and that Andrew was also rude about William’s wife, Catherine, the Princess of Wales.King Charles has allowed his younger brother to stay in the Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion in Windsor Great Park owned by the crown estate. However, last year the kingended Andrew’s allowance, estimated at £1m annually, raising questions about future arrangements.Prince Andrew wrote birthday letters to Xi Jinping, ex-adviser told courtRead moreThe source quoted in Lownie’s biography claims the Prince of Wales is keen to “evict” the duke and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, who lives with Andrew though the couple divorced in 1996.According to Entitled’s source, “[William] also loathes Sarah … and can’t wait for the day when his father throws them both out. If Charles doesn’t, I guarantee you the first thing William does when he becomes king is to get them evicted.”Harry broke ties with his family citing the “toxicity” of royal life and alleged racism towards his wife, moving with his young family to Canada and then the US in 2020. In 2022 he published a memoir, Spare, in which he detailed strains in his relationships with his father and brother.Earlier this year he told the BBC he had forgiven his family andwould “love a reconciliation”.Explore more on these topicsMonarchyPrince HarryPrince AndrewKing Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

The traditional banks’ market share in deposits dropped from 84% in 2019 to 80% in 2024, it added.Meanwhile the banking sector collectively suffered a £3.7bn combined drop in total pre-tax profits last year, marking the first major downturn since the rebound in the wake of the pandemic.The sector’s average return on equity, a key performance measure, is expected to fall by more than a third, from a peak of 13% in 2023 to 8% by 2027. That is equivalent to an £11bn drop in annual profits.KPMG warned that banks were under pressure to adapt to major changes in the sector, including increased competition and rising costs.The flight of customers from high street lenders follows a period in which banks wereaccused of “profiteering” from rising interest ratesby offering paltry returns for savers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Similar policies were introduced in the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Spain, but UK politicians have so far refused to follow suit.Peter Westlake, a partner in KPMG UK’s banking strategy team, said: “Banks are facing a lower-growth, higher-cost environment that demands transformation at pace. While we can expect profitability to broadly remain sound this year, the entire sector needs to show how they are preparing for challenges ahead.”Bank costs rose by 6% in 2024, which – together with falling productivity among workers – could put bank profits under further pressure, according to KPMG’s report.Westlake suggested that banks could turn to less conventional methods to boost profits, including by embracing artificial intelligence. “The winners will be those that move beyond tactical cost-cutting and proactively address oncoming market headwinds through business model transformation,” he said.Explore more on these topicsBankingBanks and building societiesSavingsSavings ratesKPMGUK cost of living crisisTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

It will include habitat mapping, contacting boroughs across the capital to gauge their interest and surveying the public about the birds.The White Stork Project in Sussex has sought to create new colonies of rehabilitated injured birds at Knepp and Wadhurst Park since 2016. These can act as a “magnet” for wild birds that visit from the continent, and the project’s first breeding success was in 2020.In the four decades before the start of the project there were just 27 records of white storks across Greater London, but there were 472 sightings between 2016 and 2023, with the numbers increasing year on year, conservationists said.Elliot Newton, a co-founder of Citizen Zoo and its director of rewilding, said: “If you look across European landscapes, this is a bird that can actually thrive in urban landscapes. What we want to see is how we can make London a more white stork-friendly environment, and embrace it for its ability to inspire people about the nature we can and should have close to where we live.”The survey is being led by Dr Rachel White, of the University of Brighton, with two phases that mirror a national survey she conducted as part of the White Stork Project in Sussex.The first phase has involved surveying a representative sample of 1,000 Londoners, and the second phase is asking residents and frequent visitors to give their views on white storks and their place in the capital.TheLondon surveywill feed into Citizen Zoo’s wider assessment of the political and public enthusiasm and habitat availability for storks, and potential next steps such as creating more habitat to encourage natural colonisation or even a release similar to that in Sussex.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photographs: Tamati Smith. Interactive:Nick Evershed,Andy Balland Victoria HartWarning: This article contains historical records that use racist and offensive language, and descriptions of events that will be distressing to some readersIt’s early morning in the Battye library in Perth, Western Australia, and we’re scrolling through microfilm pages of the diary of a prominent and powerful colonist called Major Logue.Logue kept the diary for 50 years, until his death in 1900. He wrote in it almost every day. Entries are written in looping script, sometimes neat and measured, other times messy and cramped. Pages are peppered with sketches of horses and faces, designs for a house, mud maps, lists of crops and stock. It’s all fairly mundane. Most entries simply recount the work done on the farm by Logue and his men: fences mended, potatoes planted, cattle lost and found.Major LogueThere is some sort of code hidden in the diary, Guardian Australia has been told. But we’re not sure what to look for. The microfilm machine we’re using to view it is an analogue artefact. It’s hooked up to a computer so we can adjust light and contrast and take screenshots. It’s already crashed several times.To view each page we wind the film gently from one side of the light box to the other. The machine takes a while to pull each one into focus. Even so, some of the writing is impossible to read. The ink on the page has faded with age and the photographs are grainy. The diary was copied to film in the 1950s and has lain undisturbed on the public catalogue ever since.But then, suddenly, there it is. A line of strange, angular symbols slips on to the screen. As the years spin by – 1851, 1852, 1853 – the code, a series of right-angled shapes, some with dots, appears more frequently.It stands out. If Logue used it to hide something, he failed. It’s easier to make out than his handwriting.There’s one person who knows for sure what it says, and we’re going to Geraldton, about 400km north of Perth, to meet her.She has spent the past several years removing this code – and what she knows it says – from Logue’s diaries to prepare them for publication.The strange symbols represent a horrific story buried in the banality of early colonial farm life. It is the story of murder and massacre, of a family divided, of shame and fear and the shattering of colonial silence.****Major Logue was an early settler of Western Australia.Born in Ireland, the young Major – his given name, not a military title – arrived in the colony as a child and acquired pastoral property near Geraldton in 1850. Landed and respectable, he served in the state’s Legislative Council from 1870 to 1874 as the first MP for Geraldton.That’s the official version.Logue was also a killer of Aboriginal people. But he hid his exploits in this diary that has remained secret – until now.He wrote about who he killed, where, when and how, using the code.On 16 March 1852 Logue wrote that some cattle went missing, so he “SHOTTHREEOFTHEMFORIT.”Logue was not alone in this endeavour. On 24 March he wrote that the “natives at Mr Burgess’ had been stealing sheepANDTHATTHEWHITEFELLOWSHADSHOTSEVERALOFTHEMFORIT.”On 4 April he was among a group of armed men who set out to find “natives who had taken the cattle”.4 April 1852View originalToggle codeStarted after breakfast and accompanied by Carsons we pushed in search of the natives who had taken the cattle saw smoke about 2 miles from Walkaway reached within a mile of it… proceeded from a native encampment tied up our horses in a thicket as the [ground] was very rough and crawled on our hands and knees within 200 yards when the natives saw us and scatteredFIREDBOTHBARRELSOFMYGUNANDWOUNDEDONEFELLOWINTHERUMP.THOMSONANDDICKYSHOTONEDEADThere are 11 coded diary entries between 1851 and 1853 that describe shooting and killing people; witnessing others in his employ doing the shooting; going on a “campaign” to kill natives; and later riding over the “battlefield” and seeing the bodies of those he had killed lying dead or “hastily buried”.By his own account he was part of groups who shot and killed at least 19 Yamatji people around what is now called Ellendale, Walkaway and the Greenough River.On 23 June, 1852, Logue wrote that he had been part of a party who killed three Yamatji people.23 June 1852View originalToggle codeWednesday started after breakfast and [Karney] and I [went round] on  our side of the [tracks] Menzies and Norries took the other   after a couple of hours tracking we met at an appointed place and were all equally puzzled by the number of tracks [travelling] in every direction.

But they were loaned for copying to the State Library of Western Australia in 1955 and have been available for public reading in the stacks of the Battye library ever since.Some of Logue’s other descendants, and those of other colonist families in the Geraldton region, have spoken to Guardian Australia. They want to break the silence surrounding their ancestors’ involvement in frontier violence. They have begun meeting with the Yamatji descendants of the survivors.Australia’s archives contain many colonial diaries. They are how we are able to understand just how widespread frontier murders and massacres were; how commonplace it was among colonists to shoot and kill Aboriginal men, women and children on sight, for no reason and without consequences.What makes Logue’s diaries unique is that he wrote about these exploits using code at a time when such killings were frowned upon by colonial society. And, because he kept those diaries for 50 years from his arrival in the Geraldton region until his death, we can see how he materially benefited from those killings.Historian Nan Broad at Greenough Museum, south of GeraldtonA ‘pathetically simple’ codeA Geraldton-based historian and author, Nan Broad, has spent the past six years transcribing and decoding Logue’s diaries. Broad came across them in the late 1990s while researching her PhD on stock routes and communication in the north of WA. She knew the Logues, having grown up in one of the prominent colonial families in the area – where “everyone knows everyone”.She’s preparing to publish a version of the diaries this year.“I knew it was very, very unique to have 50 years straight of a diary,” she says, adding that as a historian: “I knew the value of the things.”7 July 1852View originalToggle codeWednesday Tom, Liffy and Bryant started at day break to gather the cattle found and got in 82 before breakfast after breakfast Bryant went to look for the others Thomson and [family] went home … told by Thomson that the [indecipherable] was at the Greenough looking for the cattle againANDTHATHEANDPARTYHADSHOT3NATIVESTHEOTHERDAYANDTHATEGOISAMONGTHENUMBERWhen she first saw the diaries about 30 years ago, they were in boxes under a bed. Their owner gave her access. When she began editing them for publication, the Geraldton library helped her to make copies so she could return the originals to their owner. This took a few days a week over the course of about a year.But Broad says the publisher and the diaries’ owner have decided to leave out all the sections in which Logue wrote about frontier killings.“To protect the person who holds the diaries we felt it was … expedient, perhaps, to not have that in writing,” she says. “Everyone knows what Major Logue did. Everyone knows what all the other settlers did.”It is quite clear to Broad that he was writing about killing people – using a “pathetically simple” code.“He did the code, which is interesting, because he obviously felt guilt, I would suggest – it’s only my interpretation of it. He felt guilt about it, and he knew the diaries were only a day-to-day thing on the farm, and I don’t think he ever thought they would go any further.“It was all just run of the mill. That’s what we did. We went and dug holes for the fence there, and then we went over and we took those fellows out, and then we went back and milked the cow, or whatever we did.Rocks and she-oaks near Ellendale Pool, a grassy oasis on the Greenough River“It was just part of the day, and he didn’t go into the fact they’d been spearing this, or doing that, or doing something. There was no talk through the diary about that, just ‘we did it’. It was just facts each time he did that.”‘Full of shame’Logue used a modified form of masonic code known as “pigpen”.Guardian Australia combed through his diary page by page from 1850 to 1900 and hired a professional transcriber to detangle relevant passages of his handwriting. The diary entries in which he used code are reproduced here.This line, written in code, comes from Major Logue’s diaries. The code used is known as the pigpen or masonic cipher. So what is this code, and how does it work?The pigpen cipher begins with a grid, then letters are placed inside the grid in the following fashionEach letter then corresponds to a symbol derived from the part of the grid that it lies withinTo get the full alphabet, multiple grid types and dots are usedIn Logue’s case, the letters might be assigned to the grids non-sequentially – here’s the pattern that matches the cipher Logue usedSo applying this pattern to decode Logue’s writing gives us the translation of the initial sentence we sawChris Owen has studied Western Australian frontier history for \n                    20 years. He wrote abook about policing on the WA frontierand was a researcher for the University of Newcastle’s groundbreakingmassacre map, published by the Guardian in 2019 in ourKilling Times series.Owen says he has read “hundreds” of colonial diaries but has never seen the use of code before. Logue’s diary is “very, very unusual”.“Shooting the blackfellas was pretty common, and getting them off the country for pinching a sheep or something,” he says. “The British were watching this, going, ‘You can’t kill the blackfellas, they’re British citizens, you can’t just shoot them.’ So the [settlers] learned how to leave it out completely. Just hide it from history.“They wouldn’t write things down that someone would read because even though Aboriginal people weren’t really considered human, it was still murder.”A plaque at the campground at Bootenal Springs, with scratch marks over some of the phrases describing the massacre thereOwen says he is “horrified” to hear that a version of the diary might be published with the coded entries omitted. “It’s just historical truth,” he says. “It’s not fabricated or anything. I'd leave it in,  just run with it.”He has his own theories as to why this decision has been made. “I think they’re full of shame that their ancestors did this, and they don’t want their [ancestor’s] reputation tarnished. I think that’s the main reason, especially [among] the older generation. But it’s important for truth-telling to just tell the story.”‘We prefer nothing to be in writing’Geraldton is famously battered by fierce winds that blow in from the Indian Ocean. In the fields are stands of trees with their trunks bent double, almost horizontal to the earth, contorted by airborne salt blasting across the plains from the sea. One of the city’s most famous sons, the author Randolph Stow – a descendant of the Logues – described them as stooped like “women washing their hair”.The soil here is heavy with sand. The invaders found this country difficult for cropping. Further inland, along the Greenough River, was more fertile land where an enterprising colonist could prosper.Tucked away from the open country is Ellendale Pool, an oasis on the river. The waterhole is deep and serene, nestled at the base of a steep sandstone cliff, with a wide, sandy bank shaded by gumtrees, perfect for camping.The reed-fringed water of Ellendale Pool, which is sacred to the Yamatji peopleYamatji people hold this place sacred, where Bimarra the serpent rested on his journey from the ocean up the river all the way inland to Meekatharra.When arriving at the water’s edge, Yamatji people greet the ancestors and spirits by throwing a handful of soil into the water, to show respect and announce their presence.They had been here for millennia. When Logue first saw the river in October 1850 he wrote about passing more than “200 native men … and though they had no spears they all had very formidable clubs”.The sheep “rushed wildly to the river [and] we set up camp with a crowd of natives watching on[.] Davis called to me to look out as the natives were inclined to be mischievous.”He wrote he had cracked his whip at them, which sent “those that were about the camp off” and they “all collected on a hill to the south and watched us”.Logue “took up” about 400 hectares of this land, first with that whip and later with guns. He named it Ellendale in 1865 for his new wife, Lucy Ellen Shaw. By then there were no more accounts of groups of “more than 200 natives” in his diaries – or anywhere. The killing was ruthlessly, brutally efficient. Logue became an important and influential pastoralist and politician.Yamatji always knew about the 1854 massacre at Bootenal near Geraldton, where at least 30 Aboriginal people were killed by colonists. They say the real death toll was in the hundreds.Kehlani and Derek Councillor at Bootenal SpringsEven though Bootenal is not mentioned in Logue’s diary, Broad says: “Everyone knows they did it.” That massacre was led by John Nicol Drummond, Logue’s brother-in-law.“I mean, everyone knows up here that Logue shot them, and Logue would have been part of Bootenal,” Broad says. “He would have been right in the front there, he was only just up the river, for goodness sake, he and probably his men.“But there’s nothing in writing, and we prefer nothing to be in writing.”There were stories of other killings at Ellendale and at Walkaway, along the river – knowledge passed down in Yamatji families but always denied by settlers.Logue’s diaries now reveal those stories to be true.****Derek and Theona Councilor are cousins who grew up in their Naaguja Yamatji country learning the stories passed down by their elders. Theona is a poet and writer. Derek conducts cultural tours of the region including the Bootenal massacre site.They are both quietly spoken, thoughtful people, and welcome us into their home in Geraldton for a yarn around the kitchen table.There’s a significance in how many of my recent ancestors were born out here and what their prosperity cost in the blood spilled ... I feel immensely privileged to have been asked to careMoss LogueNaaguja elders Edna Corbett, Peta Watkins and Avriel Maher with Margaret Jones, born Criddle, at the Bootenal Springs campgroundTheona says many descendants of settler families still aren’t able to face up to the past but it’s not for her to tell them how. They have to come to terms in their own way, in their own time, she says, but the truth is long overdue.“Stop clinging to the silence,” she says. “Stop clinging to a false narrative and say, ‘OK, this, what we claim as history, could be true – but you were there with us, the black people were there too. So let’s add the black history in there, and be brave enough to hear it.’“Maybe nothing will happen. Maybe they’ll get a medal for telling the truth. I don’t know. I really don’t know. Release it. Release themselves. We’re releasing ourselves.“The blood called out to us. So we’re telling this story, we’re writing these songs. We’re singing our songs again. I’m releasing myself.”Theona and Derek reach out to the descendants on the “other side of the shield” to bring understanding, not pain.“I wouldn’t want them to feel the way we felt, and I wouldn’t want them to suffer what we suffered, living in reservations and tin sheds … just so basic, simply because we’re black,” she says.“Maybe there could be something good now because we’re black. Truth-telling because we’re black. Recompense because we’re black. It’s always been a negative. I would like to see it as a positive.”Despite these hardships, Theona says she doesn’t hate anyone for the way her people have been treated. “I just want my children and my grandchildren to have equal standing. No more standing at the back, no more last in line to get something. We are side by side now.“I think then we truly could be a great nation. Great because it’s not afraid of the truth. Great because they don’t leave anybody behind, don’t earn riches on someone else’s back, steal someone’s inheritance and give it to their own children.”‘They knew not to write it all down’All around Geraldton there are sites named for the perpetrators of the Bootenal massacre: Criddle Road, Drummond Cove. Descendants of other colonial families still occupy neighbouring properties. They are intermarried. As Nan Broad says, everybody knows everybody.Ellendale is still held by the Logue family, 175 years later. Ellendale Pool remained their private property until the 1960s when the council took ownership of it for public use. Today it’s a popular tourist spot, home to a gang of screeching corellas hanging from every tree. There is a sign that warns you not to swim, for fear of amoebic meningitis. Another sign tells you the history of the site. It mentions Randolph Stow.Goats fight for a high point on the ruins of a colonial homestead near PerenjoriIt does not tell you what the pool means to Yamatji people. It does not tell you what it cost them.Yes, let’s get over it. Just tell it right. Tell it truthfully first. You can’t get over something if you don’t even know what happenedTheona CouncillorMajor Logue has descendants who do want to break the silence and face the truth.We drive out to a property near Perenjori, three and a half hours into the WA wheatbelt, to meet one of Logue’s great-grandsons.Phil Logue and his family have been to Bootenal Springs and attended the 170th anniversary of the massacre last August.  He has not seen the diaries but does not doubt the family history, and he strongly supports the truth coming out.“If this is an indication of what happened everywhere, in WA, South Australia, Queensland, wherever, well, it’s going to be fairly hard truth-telling,” he says. “It’s not an isolated incident. Because we learnt, the wadjulas [white people] learnt, not to document it, or to hide it.“You’ll find that this area here [Western Australia] was the last one settled, and because this area was the last one settled, they knew not to write it all down. They learnt from what happened through Queensland and the flak that they were getting from back home, back in England. Don’t write it down but keep doing it.”He says the way stories are passed down among non-Indigenous families is different. Secrets are held, or written down, whereas in Aboriginal culture, stories are sung and shared across generations.Phil Logue and his son Moss Logue at a farm outside Perenjori“I didn’t know,” he says. “Dad died 20 years ago, but he was only the grandson. He never told me.“We don’t sing the stories down the line. If it’s not written, we don’t see it, and if it’s written, it disappears in 20 years with silverfish or  hidden in [someone’s] back yard. Or it’s edited, cleansed. You cleanse the story, and you tell the good bits.”Phil says it was only in the past few years that he heard the “nitty gritty” of what his ancestor had done. “At the time, I wasn’t living here, and it didn’t mean a lot. Those things were just history. But now they’re not. It’s a little bit closer to home.”Moss Logue is sitting with their father, proudly part of a younger generation of descendants prepared to talk about the past and come to terms with it.“There’s a consequence to doing this,” they say. “And when it’s not faced, it carries on in the bloodline. There’s a significance in how many of my recent ancestors were born out here and what their prosperity cost in the blood spilled.“It’s an honour, in a really strange sense, to offer grief and be willing to feel it. I feel immensely privileged, in a very weird way, to have been asked to care and to heed the call.”‘Give them the truth’Derek and Theona say they will keep telling the story. Those who wish to listen are always welcome. On the day we visit Bootenal Springs with the descendants of both sides, Theona has her grandchildren with her. They listen intently while seeming not to, the way children do, as Derek recounts what happened when the white men burst through the she-oaks in military formation, armed to the teeth, giving people nowhere to run.Everywhere in Australia where people were massacred, there is unfinished business. The land holds the truth of this destruction, just as it holds all the stories of beauty and creation, of what Theona calls the genius of her people. It’s important to tell them all, sing them all. Side by side.Elders Peta Watkins, Edna Corbett, Theo Councillor and Avriel Maher with Theona’s daughter and grandchildren at Bootenal Springs“You’re not teaching the children anything if you don’t give them the truth, you know,” she says.And it’s time for non-Indigenous people to listen.“Why do they get to become an adult before they hear adult stuff?” she asks. “They say, ‘It happened so long ago. Get over it.’“Yes, let’s get over it. Just tell it right. Tell it truthfully first. You can’t get over something if you don’t even know what happened.”Alongside Theona and Derek, descendants from the “other side of the shield” are breaking the silence of their ancestors. They are working for change, for truth, for reckoning. They are responding with art and writing to a deeply messy and confronting legacy, turning the anguish of the past into creative inspiration.Some collaborated on the Museum of Geraldton’sSilence Listening exhibition, featuring work by the Yamatji poet Charmaine Papertalk Green and the artist and colonial descendant George Criddle.Moss Logue recorded a piece of writing for the show. In it they recalled their first visit to Ellendale Pool as an eight-year-old, of imagining a peaceful swimming spot and instead being “unmoored” to find an “eerie oasis”.George Criddle looks out over land near Ellendale Pool“Major Logue committed cruelty and malice against Indigenous Australians and, as a consequence, got to name the land he stole after the woman he loved.”Moss wrote that they had long felt trapped beside their ancestors’ “soulless graves” and praised the “tireless truth-telling” of Indigenous Australians.Breaking the silence about that bloody past is “the strangest, most hallowed privilege of my life”, they wrote.“It is the reason I don’t sit at their graves holding the violence behind my teeth, and why I have stopped dreaming of it.”****Guardian Australia tried over several weeks to interview the owner of Logue’s diaries. In several private conversations, the owner spoke about them and Logue family history but declined to comment publicly.In one communication with Guardian Australia, they said they had destroyed the originals. Other local landowning families did that long ago, they said. Potentially incriminating – and historically significant – records were thrown down wells and burnt.Nan Broad says she doesn’t believe the diaries have been destroyed but the claim is illustrative of fears among some descendants that they may face consequences for crimes of the past.“I suppose we are trying to hide something,” she says. “We’re trying to hide the written word from future repercussions. And when you think deeply, there could be … And we don’t want future problems, and we just don’t want it in writing.”Broad later says she thinks Australia is “too close” to colonisation to reckon with the full truth: “It's not old history yet to be looked at dispassionately.”Peter Bridge, whose small imprint Hesperian Press is publishing the diaries, rejects the suggestion that the code was being omitted to hide the truth. He says the coded sentences are “in unique characters” and adds: “They are not omitted – they are simply unprintable.” The locations of the omitted sections “will be clearly indicated” in the forthcoming book.“Our edition makes no attempt to deceive, suppress, or editorialise; rather, we have published a primary document, faithfully and unflinchingly, as is our usual method,” he says in a written statement to Guardian Australia.“If your concern is that the code may conceal politically potent material – I suggest that you take that up with Logue himself, who is, unfortunately, unavailable for an interview. We publish the diaries because they are historical documents, not a moral confession.”A dead tree stands prominently on a lookout point overlooking a salt lake on a farm just outside PerenjoriBridge'slatest booklist, published in July 2025, includes descriptions of historical works using outdated and racist language. He argued in a recent book that reports of Aboriginal “criminal matters” have been minimised by “our masters” and tells Guardian Australia he answers to “history, not hashtags”. He also accuses the Western Australian Museum of censorship for refusing to stock his books.“We do not censor our findings,” he says. “By publishing Real History, and especially accurate aboriginal history and culture we have upset some mainstream media, the WA Museum, the National and State libraries, and other degenerating institutions.”Broad says she supports truth-telling – just not in the published version of the diaries. “It’s got to come out,” she says. “And I want you people doing what you’re doing to really ramp it up. So the good part of it, let’s get on with it. Let’s get together, and work. Please push it hard. Push it hard and get people like us talking.”• Indigenous Australians can call 13YARN on 13 92 76 for information and crisis support; or call Lifeline on 13 11 14, Mensline on 1300 789 978 or Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636• Lorena Allam is a professor at the Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous research at the University of Technology SydneyCreditsReporting:Sarah Collard, Lorena Allam and Ella Archibald-BingePhotography:Tamati SmithDesign and development:Nick Evershed, Andy Ball and Victoria HartHandwriting transcription:Transcription Services LtdEditing and production:Calla Wahlquist, Lucy Clark and Nikki MarshallWith thanks to the State Library of Western AustraliaSupported byAbout this content"

The president repeatedly drifts off topic, including during a cabinet meeting this month when he spent 15 minutes talking about decorating, and appears to misremember simple facts about his government and his life.During his presidency,Joe Bidenwas subjected to intense speculation over his mental acuity – including from Trump. After Biden’s disastrousdebate performancein June 2024, when he repeatedly struggled to maintain his train of thought, scrutiny over Biden’s fitness eventually led to him not running for re-election.Trump, however, has largely been saved the same examination, despite examples of confusion and unusual behavior that have continued throughout his second term and were on full display on his recent trip to the UK.Trump’s Truth Social posts make no sense – what do they say about his mentality?Read moreOver the weekend Trump, during a meeting with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, abruptly switched from discussing immigration to saying this: “The other thing I say to Europe: ​we’ve – we will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States​. They’re killing us. They’re killing the beauty of our scenery.”Trump proceeded to speak, non-stop and unprompted,for two minutesabout windmills, claiming without evidence that they drive whales “loco” and that wind energy “kills the birds” (the proportion of birds killed by turbinesis tinycompared with the amount killed by domestic cats and from flying into power lines).The abrupt changes in conversation are an example of Trump “digressing without thinking – he’ll just switch topics without self-regulation, without having a coherent narrative”, said Harry Segal, a senior lecturer in the psychology department at Cornell University and in the psychiatry department at Weill Cornell Medicine.For years, Trump has batted away questions about his mental acuity, describing himself as a “stable genius” and bragging about “acing” exams – later revealed to bevery simple tests– which check for early signs of dementia.But Democrats have begun to more aggressively question the president’s fitness,includingJasmine Crockett, the representative from Texas,andCalifornia’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and this week alone offered multiple examples of Trump exhibiting odd conduct.Asked about the famine in Gazaon Sunday, Trump seemed unable to remember the aid the US has given to Gaza, and forget that others had also contributed.Trump claimed the US gave $60m “two weeks ago”. He added: “​You really at least want to have somebody say thank you. No other country gave anything.“Nobody acknowledged it, nobody talks about it and it makes you feel a little bad when you do that and you know you have other countries not giving anything, none of the European countries ​by the way gave – I mean nobody gave but us.”Trump seemed to not realize or remember that other countries have given money to Gaza – the UKannounceda £60m ($80m) package in July, and the European Unionhas allocated€170m ($195m) in aid. And the Guardian could not find any record of the US giving $60m to Gaza two weeks ago. In June, the US state department approved a $30m grant to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a group backed by Israeli and US interests which has been criticized by Democrats as “connected to deadly violence against starving people seeking food in Gaza”.The White House did not respond to questions about Trump’s claimed $60m donation.Segal said another characteristic of Trump’s questionable mental acuity is confabulation. “It’s where he takes an idea or something that’s happened and he adds to it things that have not happened.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump launched into a monologue about windmills when he met European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on 27 July 2025.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersA high-profile example came in mid-July, whenTrump claimedhis uncle, the late professor John Trump, had taught Ted Kaczynski, better known as the Unabomber, at MIT.Trump recalled: “I said: ‘What kind of a student was he, Uncle John? Dr John Trump.’ I said: ‘What kind of a student?’ And then he said: ‘Seriously, good.’ He said: ‘He’d correct – he’d go around correcting everybody.’ But it didn’t work out too well for him.”The problem is: that cannot possibly be true. First, Trump’s uncle died in 1985, and Kaczynski was only publicly identified as the Unabomber in 1996. Second, Kaczynski did not study at MIT.“The story makes no sense whatsoever, but it’s told in a very warm, reflective way, as if he’s remembering it,” Segal said. “This level of thinking really has been deteriorating.”Aside from the confabulation, there have been times when Trump seems unable to focus. During the 2024 campaign there was the bizarre sight of Trump spending 40 minutesswaying to music onstageafter a medical emergency at one of his campaign rallies. Trump’s rambling speeches during his campaign – he would frequently drift between topics in a technique he described as “the weave” – also drew scrutiny.The White House removed official transcripts of Trump’s remarks from its website in May, claiming it was part of an effort to “maintain consistency”. It is worth reading Trump’s remarks in full, however, to get a sense of how the president speaks on a day-to-day basis.At the beginning of July, Trump was asked, “What is the next campaign promise that you plan to fulfill to the American people?” He then rambled about meeting foreign leaders and removing regulations,adding:skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You’re washing whole – water barely comes out it’s ridi – this was done by crazy people. And I wor – wrote it all off and got it approved in Congress so that they can’t just change it.”“Any fair-minded mental-health expert would be very worried about Donald Trump’s performance,” Richard A Friedman, a professor of clinical psychiatry and the director of the psychopharmacology clinic at Weill Cornell Medical College,wrotein the Atlantic, after a stumbling performance from Trump in his debate against Kamala Harris last September.He added: “If a patient presented to me with the verbal incoherence, tangential thinking, and repetitive speech that Trump now regularly demonstrates, I would almost certainly refer them for a rigorous neuropsychiatric evaluation to rule out a cognitive illness.”Ata recent cabinet meetingcalled to discuss the flooding tragedy in Texas, the war in Ukraine and Gaza, the bombing of Iran, and global tariffs, Trump went on a 13-minute monologue about how he had decorated the cabinet meeting room.After talking about paintings which he said he had personally selected from “the vaults”, Trump said. “Look at those frames, you know, I’m a frame person, sometimes I like frames more than I like the pictures,” and added he had overseen the cleaning of some china.As department heads, including the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, waited to be dismissed so they could go and do their jobs, Trump continued:Here we put out – you know these, these lamps have been very important actually, whether people love them or not but they’re if you see pictures like Pearl Harbor or Tora! Tora! Tora!, you see movies about the White House where wars are being discussed, oftentimes they’ll show those lamps or something like those lamps, something that looks like them. Probably not the reals, because I don’t think they’re allowed to – this is a very important room, this is a sacred room, and I don’t think they made movies from here.You never know what they do. But they were missing, er, medallions. See the medallions on top? They had a chain going into the ceiling. And I said: ‘You can’t do that. You have to have a medallion.’ They said, ‘What’s a medallion?’ I said: ‘I’ll show you.’ And then we got some beautiful medallions, and you see them, they were put up there, makes the lamps look [inaudible] so we did these changes.And when you think of it, the cost was almost nothing. We also painted the room a nice color, beige color, and it’s been really something. The only question is, will I gold-leaf the corners? You could maybe tell me. My cabinet could take a vote. You see the top-line moldings, and the only question is do you go and leaf it? Because you can’t paint it, if you paint it it won’t look good because they’ve never found a paint that looks like gold. You see that in the Oval Office.Er, they’ve tried for years and years. Somebody could become very wealthy, but they’ve never found a paint that looks like gold. So painting is easy but it won’t look right.”The White House pushes back aggressively on the issue of Trump’s mental fitness.“The Guardian is a left-wing mouthpiece that should be embarrassed to pass off deranged resistance leftists as ‘experts’. Anyone pathetic enough to defend Biden’s mental state – while being labeled as unethical by their peers – has zero credibility. President Trump’s mental sharpness is second to none and he is working around the clock to secure amazing deals for the American people,” said White House spokesperson Liz Huston.So do his political allies. “As President Trump’s former personal physician, former physician to the president, and White House physician for 14 years across three administrations, I can tell you unequivocally: President Donald J Trump is the healthiest president this nation has ever seen. I continue to consult with his current physician and medical team at the White House and still spend significant time with the president. He is mentally and physically sharper than ever before,” said congressman Ronny Jackson.In April, Trump’s White House physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, wrote that the president “exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the commander-in-chief and head of state”. He said Trump was assessed for cognitive function, which was normal.That report hasn’t stopped people from questioning Trump’s mental acuity.“What we see are the classic signs of dementia, which is gross deterioration from someone’s baseline and function,” John Gartner, a psychologist and author who spent 28 years as an assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University Medical School, saidin June.“If you go back and look at film from the 1980s, [Trump] actually was extremely articulate. He was still a jerk, but he was able to express himself in polished paragraphs, and now he really has trouble completing a thought and that is a huge deterioration.”Gartner, who during Trump’s first termco-founded Duty to Warn, a group of mental health professionals who believed Trump had the personality disorder malignant narcissism, warned: “I predicted before the election that he would probably fall off the cliff before the end of his term. And at the rate he is deteriorating, you know … we’ll see.“But the point is that it’s going to get worse. That’s my prediction.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He was sadly pronounced dead at the scene,” the spokesperson said. “The stadium was busy, and we believe it is likely a number of people witnessed the incident, or may knowingly or unknowingly have caught it on mobile phone video footage.”The Met has asked anyone who has information that could help to confirm what happened to contact the force.Oasis said in a statement: “We are shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic death of a fan at the show last night. Oasis would like to extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the person involved.”The band dedicated the track Live Forever to “all the people who can’t be here tonight” during their Wembley Stadium gig on Sunday night. Liam Gallagher said: “This one’s for all the people who can’t be here tonight, but who are here if you know what I mean, and aren’t they looking lovely. Live Forever.”One fan, who was sitting in a lower tier, said on social media that she had witnessed paramedics trying to revive the man. “I was directly underneath in section 211. At first glance I thought it was a coat falling from the above tier but then I looked and saw the bloke on the concrete. It was horrific to see,” she wrote.A Wembley Stadium spokesperson said: “Last night, Wembley Stadium medics, theLondonambulance service and the police attended to a concertgoer who was found with injuries consistent with a fall.“Despite their efforts, the fan very sadly died. Our thoughts go out to his family, who have been informed and are being supported by specially trained police officers.”The Oasis reunion tour, with Liam and Noel Gallagher at the band’s helm again for the first time in 16 years, includes seven shows at Wembley and five in the Gallaghers’ home town of Manchester. They will then tour the US, Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Australia, before ending in South America in November.Explore more on these topicsOasisWembley stadiumLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

My reasons are the reliability of nuclear, the compactness. It’s unfair to judge nuclear on Chornobyl. The causes of that disaster were largely unqualified people and political interference, rather than science. It was the politicians running it, not the engineers.BernardThe cost of Hinkley Point is immense. The French are building it, aren’t they?

A few rebels opted for futons (or even waterbeds), but back in the 20th century, most of us had mattresses with tufted surfaces and a belly full of springs that bounced when you jumped on them.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Memory foam began sneaking into our beds in the 90s, ushering in a brave new world of cushioned peace. Most of the products I’ve considered for the Filter’sbest mattressesroundup contain memory foam layers to boost comfort and limit bounce. But traditional sprung beds remain unstoppably popular, and one example – the Millbrook Wool Luxury 4000 – is a bestseller atMattress Online.I slept on the Millbrook during some of the hottest weeks of the summer, that annual ordeal of fruit flies and night sweats. Memory foam is notorious for trapping heat, so this seemed a good time to find out whether Millbrook’s old-fashioned breathable design could help me stay cool and get a decent sleep.View at Mattress OnlineView at B&QHow I testedView image in fullscreenBesides firmness and comfort, the mattress was tested for sinkage, motion isolation, heat retention and edge support.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianI was sent a double-size Millbrook Wool Luxury 4000 in early May, when the days were warm but the nights reassuringly cool. My familytesting panelcame over to rate it out of 10 for firmness and comfort when it was fresh from its wrapping. They also helped me run lab-style experiments with heat pads, weights and wobbly cups of water to measure its sinkage, motion isolation, heat retention and edge support.My husband, Alan, and I slept on the Millbrook for six weeks until late June. By then, the heatwave had descended, and Alan had moved to the spare room. (Don’t judge. When it’s 28C in your bedroom at night, the last thing it needs is another human.) This gave me a chance to test the mattress as a solo sleeper on some of the muggiest nights of the year.What you need to know, from price to firmnessView image in fullscreenThere are actually 5,000 springs in the Luxury 4000.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianView at Mattress OnlineView at B&QThe Millbrook Wool Luxury 4000 is affordable for a pocket-sprung mattress of such hefty construction. Its RRP is high (£1,214.63 for a double), but Millbrook sells this mattressonly through third-party retailers, which normally knock off hundreds of pounds.Mattress Onlinehas the double for £615.94, whileB&Qwas asking for £620 at the time of writing. Mattress Online’s prices range from £453.57 for a single to £1,146.20 for the superking zip and link.The Luxury 4000 sits in the middle of Millbrook’s range of pocket-sprung mattresses, both in terms of price and spring count. The most affordableis theWool Ortho 1000(£415.20 for a double) and the most luxurious is theSupreme Collection 11,000(£1,899), which has more than 10 times the number of springs of its cheapest cousin.There are actually 5,000 springs in the Luxury 4000: one layer of 1,000 large pocket springs between two layers of 2,000 “Comfonomic” micro springs that add bounce and help offset the firmness of the pocket springs.Most pocket-sprung mattresses, even the budgetIkea Valevåg, use other materials to cushion the springs. That doesn’t make them hybrids (“hybrid” usually means a mattress that contains memory foam, gel or latex as well as springs), but it does make them more sophisticated than the cheap fabric-wrapped boxes of springs that you may have slept on as a child.The Millbrook contains 11 layers in all, including cotton, silk, “cashgora” – from cross-breeding cashmere and angora goats – and wool sourced from Millbrook’s Hampshire locale.View image in fullscreenOne of the mattress’s tufts is black, to represent a black sheep.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianThe viscose-cotton cover is tufted with Hampshire wool, and one of the tufts is black to represent a black sheep – a lovely touch. The edges are stitched and reinforced with a metal rod for extra support, so you can’t remove the cover to stick it in the washing machine as you can with theOtty Original Hybridor theSimba Hybrid Pro.The mattress is double-sided and needs regular turning to avoid dents where you sleep. Full disclosure: Alan and I left it more than two weeks before we flipped the mattress in exasperation at the dents we’d created – and only then realised we should have been turning it once a week for the first month. This is a more frequent flip recommendation than many mattresses, and also unfortunate, because the Millbrook is an absolute beast to manoeuvre.At 28cm deep and a thumping 65kg for the double, this behemoth is one of the heaviest mattresses I’ve ever tested. Even Millbrook suggests that you “seek assistance” when turning it, so bad luck if you live alone. At least you’re helped by having two turn handles on each end as well as along each side.Millbrook describes the Luxury 4000 as “medium to firm”. This was accurate initially, but it’s no more than medium once you’ve slept on it for a few weeks. Before sleep-testing, my family scored it 8/10 for firmness, and it sank a maximum of 19mm under 7.5kg of weight. After one month, it scored 7/10 and sank 35mm. This is within the 40mm “acceptable settlement” specified by Millbrook and is caused by the compression of fibre layers.You get a 10-year warranty, although you’ll have to register your mattress within 60 days of purchase to benefit from it. Mattress Online also offers a 60-night trial, during which you can return it for an exchange if you don’t get on with it.SpecificationsType:pocket sprungFirmness:advertised as medium to firm; testing panel rated as 8/10, then 7/10Depth:28cmCover:not removableTurn or rotate:turn weekly for four months, then every monthTrial period:60 nightsWarranty:10 years once registeredOld mattress recycling:£35 with Mattress Online if you buy a new mattressSustainability credentials:Millbrook Beds uses no memory foam or chemical treatments; all fabrics and fillings are “from sustainable sources”; Planet Mark certifiedDeliveryView image in fullscreenUnusually, the mattress arrived mattress-shaped.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianThe Millbrook was the first mattress I’ve tested that arrived mattress-shaped, rather than vacuum-shrunk into a plastic-wrapped sausage. It was shipped by Mattress Online and delivered the next day by AIT, whose drivers offered to carry it to any room but left it in the hallway as requested.I should’ve taken them up on the offer. Alan and I got it upstairs with some difficulty (Alan was literally doing all the heavy lifting there). We found it relatively easy to unpack thanks to the absence of shrink-wrap polyurethane, although there was still plenty of plastic sheeting to take to the dump.The Millbrook was ready to test and sleep on immediately, and there was none of the chemical “off-gassing” smell that I’ve experienced with memory foam hybrid mattresses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Its upper layers yielded quite a bit over the weeks, and I was less disappointed than my husband about this: I liked the way it cradled my hips, knees and shoulders when I slept on my side. If you live with joint pain, you’ll welcome the pressure relief.Night sweats weren’t completely avoidable, because no mattress can actively cool you down on a sweltering night – it can just avoid trapping your heat. The Millbrook genuinely helped me dial down the sogginess, but couldn’t stop it completely. I’ll be interested to see if its temperature-regulating powers help in winter, too, when I’ll be seeking warmth rather than trying to escape it.After Alan left for the solitary cool of the spare room, I often found myself switching to his vacant side of the bed halfway through the night. Not only was it drier, but it also felt firmer, because the fabric layers had decompressed and regained their full size. This would help to explain why the mattress benefits from such frequent turning. The compression of the layers never felt like sagging, in the way that memory foam can.The Millbrook’s edge support is the best of any mattress I’ve tested. The edges are so robust that they sink significantly less under weights than the middle of the mattress does; about 1cm less under 7.5kg of hand weights. The edges lost no height at all after we’d slept on the Millbrook for a few weeks, either. As well as making it easy to get in and out of bed, this strong edge support suggests that the Luxury 4000 has the durability to last many years.What we don’t loveView image in fullscreen‘Tossing and turning was more noticeable than on a hybrid.’Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianThe comfort layers gave the Millbrook slightly better motion isolation than the Ikea Valevåg, but it’s still no match for memory foam when it comes to absorbing the bounce of springs. Its hilly surface made it difficult to test motion isolation with a glass of water, but test it we did – and the results were messy enough to confirm our suspicions that our tossing and turning was more noticeable than on a hybrid.Even though I like a bit of cushioning, I felt slightly cheated when the initially firm surface gradually smushed beneath me – I could see and feel the indentation where my body had been lying. The surface decompressed quickly when not being slept on, which I liked, but that’s not much help when you’re craving more pushback in the middle of the night.I didn’t feel much benefit from the Millbrook’s “ErgoZone 7” zoned layout, which uses thicker-gauge wires for firmer support under your hips, head and feet. This may be because I’m barely 5ft (152cm) on tiptoes, and the world and its mattresses tend to be designed for adult men. But then Alan – 5ft 10in (178cm) and average weight – didn’t seem able to find the firm zones either.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe natural fibre covers and fillings make the mattress sustainable and durable.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianMemory foam is one of the least sustainable materials used in furnishings, and its absence here gives the Millbrook the best environmental credentials of any mattress I’ve reviewed. Even the simplest pocket-sprung mattresses usually contain synthetic material, such as the polyfoam in the Ikea Valevåg. Millbrook’s decision to use only natural, biodegradable fibres for its soft covers and fillings adds to the price, but has considerable benefits in sustainability and durability.Millbrook Beds’Sustainable Sleeppage is full of information about its materials and practices. Neither wool nor cashgora is vegan, but Millbrook sources the wool locally in Hampshire. The mattress’s cotton content involves a more emission-heavy journey because it’s grown in the US, but it is at least natural, renewable and biodegradable.All Millbrook mattresses are treated to meet flame-retardant standards using “a fully biological solution”. This has helped the company earn certification by sustainability bodiesPlanet MarkandSedex.Millbrook Wool Luxury 4000: should I buy it?View image in fullscreenBesides the plastic wrap it comes in, the Luxury 4000 is a more environmentally friendly option than memory foam mattresses.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianBuy this mattress if you love the breathability of a pocket-sprung bed – and sleep well knowing that it’s more environmentally friendly than a memory foam hybrid. The Millbrook doesn’t retain heat in the way that foam can, and its wool layers can help regulate your body’s temperature through the sweaty and shivery excesses of summer and winter. Just be aware that it may feel too soft if you like your beds on the orthopaedic side, and its weekly turning requirements will be a real challenge if you live alone.View at Mattress OnlineView at B&QJane Hoskyn is aconsumer journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and ‘testing’ coffee machines while deadlines loom.

Recently, I’ve found myself waking early, with dawn on the horizon. I think it might be beautiful to catch the sunrise, and in those quiet moments, I am reminded of the bustle of the city, or a lover’s hand in mine, or the words that I couldn’t quite say, and, looking back towards the sky, find the sun already risen. I rue that I’ve missed it; I’m surprised it arrived so quickly. But for a moment, the light shines bright; and briefly, the parts of myself I don’t always get to are illuminated. In these moments, I’m reminded of our aliveness.Much of my writing practice is concerned with closing the gap between emotion and expression. The sense of loss in this chasm is inevitable; it’s impossible to translate the excitement of seeing a loved one across the room, or the bodily jolt that arrives when you pass a friend on the street and realise you have become strangers. But still, I try to write, asVirginia Woolfdid, not so much concerned with knowledge, but withfeeling.And since language won’t always get you there, I employ music, rhythm.Woolf does this masterfully in Mrs Dalloway. She was not just concerned with the notes of an instrument, but moments when a pianist’s hands might hover over the keys, or the break before a trumpeter blows; and even before that, what route did the pianist take to work today? What did the trumpeter say to his wife before they slept the night before, and what did she say back? And even further back: what might the musician have witnessed, at 18, which has shaped their life? How did Sally Seton kissing Clarissa Dalloway – a moment Woolf describes as a revelation, a religious experience – shape both their lives? The question that pulses through this novel: how do we come to be? They may not be musical notes but these questions and their answers are all music of some kind.Woolf also writes with a painterly touch. The images she conjures remind me of work by my favourite painter,Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, in which the interior preoccupations are externalised in the strokes on the canvas, both tender and sure; in the ways characters fill the frame with their bodies, their personhoods; in the ways the backgrounds speak as much to the narrative as the foremost subject does.London is not just a backdrop but an essential character – it is a living, breathing organismIn Woolf’s work, there are rarely any direct gazes. Everyone looks away, unable to wrangle with the feeling of being seen, or they glance away when caught. And you understand. It can be scary to be seen. All these emotions and feelings, preoccupations and fears, all out in the open, with nowhere to hide. And yet, if we don’t show ourselves, Woolf suggests, it’s impossible to truly live.Speaking of backgrounds, allow me a couple of indulgences here: the first, the city. Specifically, the city of London, which I’ve always known as home, have always known and loved, for all its ways. In Mrs Dalloway, London is not just a backdrop but an essential character. It is a living, breathing organism, to be held, touched, traversed, poked and prodded. To be, in some way, loved. Woolf writes in relation to our love of London, foolish as it may be. And yet, I cannot resist the allure of the city, because it’s home to me. The way the streets speak; the frenetic pace of its workers; the all-knowing boom of Big Ben, followed by St Margaret’s; “the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands”;the way quiet breaks open on entering St James’s Park accented only by the slow steps of others, or the flap of ducks swimming in the pond; the way the symphony starts back up as soon as you break out of the park, on to the streets, a distinct hum being heard all round, rising up from the ground. The city hums.View image in fullscreenCaleb Azumah Nelson photographed in Peckham in April 2023.Photograph: Ejatu Shaw/The ObserverBut the hum isn’t coming from the pavement. Home, whether it is a city, or town, or village, can only really be its people. The London of Mrs Dalloway, the London I know, is filled with parents and children, lovers and enemies, strangers and familiar faces; filled with love and envy, ambition and grief; filled with an immense beauty, a beauty she, I, might witness “in people’s eyes”. And if we look closely, as strangers and lovers pass us, we might see this beauty as further evidence of our aliveness.And, if you’ll allow me, I’d like to speak briefly on love. When I mention the ecstatic or this notion of aliveness, I’m speaking to the moments that are at the height and depths of the human experience. Love encompasses all of these categories. Early on in the novel, Woolf broaches Clarissa’s relationship with Sally Seton: “had not that, after all, been love?”It makes me wonder, is love a question, or does it make us question? Does it make us ask “who is that?”when confronted with our pull towards another? Does it make us reframe this pull as something that cannot be resisted,as if desire is something to be resisted, as if it is weakness and not virtue?There are no answers, only more questions. But I’d like to point to ecstasy, to one person’s lips meeting with another: “the radiance burnt through, the revelation, the religious feeling”.Is this not how it feels to be closest to oneself? To feel the most alive? There are no answers, only more questions. But I think, this is what love does. It expands our lives and the ways we express ourselves by making space for our truest, deepest desires, even if we’re only glimpsing these needs for a moment. It questions how we came to be, and what we need to go on; it finds us in the space between who we have been and who we are trying to become. And right there, in the midst of it all, love holds up a mirror to see ourselves, our full selves.Grief, I think, is both love’s opposite and companion. The grief of a life you might have lived. The grief of a person you might have been. And grief arrives not as loss but its inarticulacies. Clarissa is able to say what happened to her sister, Sylvia, felled by a tree, but she struggles to say how it made herfeel.She’s able to understand that if she had married Peter, “this gaiety would have been mine all day!”but she struggles with the emotional heft of this possibility. Some people never find the language to express their grief, or else it tumbles down the chasm between emotion and expression; but we try. “It is a thousand pities never to say what one feels”,but we try. Sometimes, the moonlight briefly vanishes as night does; the sun doesn’t blaze but a new dawn breaks; and with that first light, that early sunshine before any clouds appear, the grief eases. And, doused in sunlight, once more, we are reminded, we are alive.Extracted from a talk commissioned by Charleston festival 2025.Explore more on these topicsFictionVirginia WoolffeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her follow-up stars Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans in a romance about dating across the class divideSun 3 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTShare‘Our financial literacy is so fucked,” says Celine Song. We’re having breakfast in Manhattan on a sunny Saturday in early July, a few weeks after her new film, Materialists, has opened in New York City. She’s wearing a charmingly ironic outfit: a T-shirt that says “HOWDY” and a baseball cap that says “Big” (she’s petite, 5ft 4in, for the record) – but she speaks with almost disarming earnestness.She’s frustrated, she tells me, that people have described one of the characters in her film, a private equity manager with a $12m apartment, as a “billionaire”. “If you’re a billionaire, your big apartment is not $12m!” she exclaims. “The average income of an American adult is $35,000. What that means is half of America makes less than $35,000. Three times that is $100,000. Ten of that is $1m. And a billion dollars is not a hundred of that. No, it’s a thousand of that.”She’s offended because a billionaire would never be a likable character in her movie. “I think because of how visible billionaires are, we think that’s what wealth is. And I’m like: no, that’s justcrime.”View image in fullscreenStoop to conquer … Celine Song (left) with Dakota Johnson and Chris Evans on the set of Materialists.Photograph: Atsushi Nishijima/APIt’s a bit unusual to be talking about financial literacy in the context of a romcom, the genre that Materialists defiantly embraces with its story of a high-end matchmaker (Dakota Johnson) torn between an old flame with no money (Chris Evans) and a suave, moneyed suitor, the “not-billionaire” in question (Pedro Pascal). Romantic comedies, particularly those set in New York City, tend to be escapist fantasies: you’re not supposed to wonder how the heroine can afford to live in a swanky one-bedroom in Manhattan or wear Louboutins; you’re certainly not supposed to ponder the moral implications of the hero’s wealth.But in Materialists, every detail is spelled out. Early in the film, Lucy (Johnson) announces to Harry (Pascal) that she makes “$80,000 a year before taxes” – something the private equity partner should keep in mind before pursuing her. The characters’ apartments, Song says, were carefully researched and designed based on their economic situations. There’s Harry’s $12m penthouse in the expensive Manhattan neighbourhood Tribeca. Lucy lives in an aspirational studio in the posh neighbourhood of Brooklyn Heights that she rented right before the Covid-19 pandemic (Song looked on US real estate website Zillow to estimate the rent); Evans’s character John lives with three roommates in south-west Brooklyn’s Sunset Park. (It was supposed to be in Williamsburg, before the film’s construction crew said that he’d never be able to afford that.)The American dream is not achievable. One of the few ways you can jump class is marriageIt’s not that Song is a mercenary realist. The only subject that makes her eyes light up as much as money is love, which she describes as “being hit by lightning”. Song’s first feature film, Past Lives, which nabbed two Oscar nominations in 2024, spins a beautiful time-crossing and bicultural saga around a happily married Korean immigrant in the US – a stand-in for Song – who re-encounters a childhood sweetheart and confronts the life that could have been. The characters talk about inyeon, a Buddhist belief in relationships as something fated and cosmic, cutting across life cycles.There’s no such wistful dreaming in Materialists. Harry’s romantic overture to Lucy is to tell her that he’s interested in her “intangible assets”; he wants to date the broker, the person who decides who is and isn’t valuable. “I feel like as we grow into this efficiency-focused, productivity-focused way of thinking about the world, everything we do is so that we can be better, faster, stronger,” Song says of our culture of relentless optimisation. “Where is the place where you’re just like an animal who’s trying to live?”View image in fullscreenLove nor money … Dakota Johnson and Pedro Pascal in Materialists.Photograph: Atsushi NishijimaSong, 36, was born in Seoul to artist parents. She says her father, a film-maker, named her after the impish stage magician played by Juliet Berto in Jacques Rivette’s French new wave classic Céline and Julie Go Boating. When Song was 12, the family emigrated to Ontario, Canada, where she lived throughout her college years, before moving to New York to pursue a master of fine arts degree in playwriting at Columbia University. By the time she started making movies, she had achieved considerable success in theatre for deeply personal, yet daringly experimental plays, including 2019’s Endlings, which weaves together the stories of three female Korean divers and a Korean-Canadian writer in New York, and a live production of The Seagull on the Sims 4, staged during lockdown in 2020.Song never really suffered the indignities of modern dating. As portrayed in Past Lives, she met her husband, the screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes – who recently wrote Luca Guadagnino’s tennis film Challengers – at a writing residency in Montauk in Long Island when she was 24. But in her early years in New York, she got a pretty acrid taste of dating culture when she worked as a matchmaker for six months, after hearing about the gig from a friend in the industry. It seemed like an “HR job” with a more “involved client-facing element” – and Song had studied psychology in her undergraduate years.But she knew she couldn’t make lightning strike for her clients, and they knew it, too. “I was basically given instructions on who to say no to,” she says of the job. “They were saying: ‘I’m not even available to get hit by lightning by certain people who don’t meet my criteria.’” The worst of them, sampled in the film, were brazen with their bigotry. “People would rank what races they wanted. They would literally say: ‘No Asians’. They wouldn’t admit that even to their therapist.”She had wanted to make a film about the experience for years, but the script had never quite worked. Then she realised why. “I thought the focus was on the clients. But the problem is that the clients are not that interesting, because they all want the same thing. If I asked 10 clients what kind of guy they wanted, they would all say: over 6ft tall, makes more money than me, great body, strong hairline.”View image in fullscreenMatch point … Dakota Johnson in Materialists.Photograph: Atsushi NishijimaThings clicked when one day, years ago, she ran into an old friend from graduate school at a fancy gala dinner for theatre donors. She was there as one of the rising playwrights that wealthy patrons could rub shoulders with; he, once a very promising acting student, was there as a server. When she went over to greet and hug her friend, she sensed that they were both embarrassed. It was as if they were breaking an invisible barrier – like Rose going below deck to fraternise with Jack in Titanic.“How Victorian is that?” she says. “But it’s 2017!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Early in Materialists, when Lucy meets Harry at a fancy wedding she’s helped facilitate, John interrupts them – he’s there as a waiter. It’s our first indication that Lucy is an impostor in the world of wealth that she’s insinuated herself into so elegantly and seamlessly. The cold calculus with which she surveys people as dating prospects hits something of an iceberg whenever she’s with John: love, as always, gets in the way of logic.Lucy eventually undergoes a reckoning in Materialists, but Song doesn’t judge her protagonist too harshly. She has deep empathy for women like her, who trust in logic to rescue them. She brings up the “tradwife” trend taking over social media, where women embrace traditional gender roles and domesticity, as a symptom of a crisis beneath the surface. “I think it has so much to do with how deeply broken our economic systems are, especially in the US. As we have learned, the American dream is not achievable. You cannot jump your class. But what’s one of the few ways that you can still jump your class? Well, marriage.”View image in fullscreenFateful encounter … Teo Yoo and Greta Lee in Past Lives.Photograph: Jon PackIf there is an element of escapist fantasy to the film, it’s that the protagonists, all deeply insecure in their own ways about their desirability, are played by three of the most beautiful people in the world. To havePedro Pascaland Chris Evans vying for your hand is an embarrassment of riches, and Song admits that even casting Dakota Johnson as Lucy – a woman who believes there’s nothing special about her – was a bit of a “fantasy trick”. “But the thing is, it wasn’t a stretch for my actors to play these roles; they got it better than me. Who feels more like merchandise than the guy who plays the Mandalorian or Captain America?”For all its hard-nosed cynicism, Materialists is even more sentimental of a romance than Past Lives; its declarations about romance are all the sweeter for the superficial, number-crunching conventions they resist. Even so, making a star-studded romantic comedy after the critical success of Past Lives is a bold move.The genre is more or less dead today, or relegated to Christmas specials on streaming services. Even A24, which distributed the movie in the US, seemed to be self-conscious about releasing a romcom: the company published a “syllabus” for Materialists, a list of Song’s reference films, replete with highbrow names such as Thomas Vinterberg and Mike Leigh, as well as Merchant Ivory productions and Martin Scorsese’s The Age of Innocence. But Song herself is unselfconscious about her love for romances.“I still remember showing Past Lives at this festival in Ireland,” she says. “This one really burly Irish guy was asking me a question during the Q&A. And he started crying, telling me the story of his own childhood sweetheart. And I remember thinking: it’s funny that when it comes to the matters of love, we relegate it to the girlies. But the truth is that everybody’s just actually starved of love and affection. I knew, when I was making Materialists, that there is a very real market for it.”She embraces the idea that Materialists might spark more conversations about love and romance. “It is so romantic that I get to invite the audience to the movie theatre for two hours to do nothing but talk about love and dating and relationships and marriage.” But then again, there’s always the matter of money. “We get to be so real! I get to say things like $12m [apartment]! You know, the most reliable, audible response in every screening I’ve been in is the moment when Harry says ‘$12m’.”Materialists is inUKcinemas from 13 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsRomance filmsPedro PascalChris EvansDakota JohnsonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The west must pursue a different strategySun 3 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 03.06 EDTShareHanging is the preferredmethod of executionin Iran, although stoning and crucifixion offer alternative options for an ever-vengeful theocracy. Death by hanging is not necessarily quick. Strangulation and suffocation can take several minutes. The UN saysmore than 600 peoplehave been judicially murdered so far this year. Iran has more executions per capita than any country in the world. Since June’s US and Israeli attacks, growing numbers of victims arepolitical dissidents.Fifty days on, nothing remotely positive has resulted from the illegal bombing raids and missile strikes mounted by the US president, Donald Trump, and Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, despite their boasts of world-changing success. Iran’s nuclear facilities were not obliterated, as Trump claimed. Tehran has not abandoned uranium enrichment. The regime did not fall, despite Netanyahu’s call for an uprising. If anything, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ismore defiant. He has since launched anew crackdown on opponents, hence the executions.Deploring last weekend’s hanging of political prisoners Behrouz Ehsani and Mehdi Hassani, Amnesty International linked their fate to the US-Israeli attacks. Arrested in 2022, the two men were charged with rebellion and “enmity against God”. They were tortured, forced to sign confessions and sentenced last year after a five-minute trial. The decision to execute them now “highlights the authorities’ ruthless use of the death penalty as a tool of political repression in times of national crisis to crush dissent and spread fear”,Amnesty said.Hundreds have been arrested since June in a regime drive to unmask spies and collaborators, real or imagined. Glaring intelligence failures that, for example, allowed Israel to locate and bomb a national security council meeting,injuring Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, are officially blamed not on gross incompetence but supposed fifth columnists. Iran’s parliament wants to expand use of capital punishment.Up to 60 political prisoners face execution.This typically harsh reaction by clerical hardliners around Khamenei, and within the judiciary and Revolutionary Guards, comes despite a surge in patriotic sentiment after the attacks, which reportedly killed at least 935 people, mostly civilians, and injured more than 5,000. Byintensifying repression, the regime squandered a chance to harness public anger, not least against Britain and European governments thatturned a blind eye.US-Israeli actions have had other far-reaching, negative consequences. The attacks breached the UN charter and international law, as theBrics group of “global south” countries noted. They led Tehran to suspend UN nuclear inspections. They exacerbated US-Europe divisions. And, ironically, theyincreased the likelihoodof Iran building a bomb for self-defence.1:22Khamenei says Iran will strike back if US hits again, in first remarks since ceasefire – videoIran insists it does not possess and does not want nuclear weapons. For all Israel’s vaunted intelligence capabilities, neither Netanyahu nor anyone else has definitively proved otherwise. The decision to attack was based on a guess, driven by fear and hatred. It caused serious physical damage, but did notchange mindsets. Iran is adamant it willcontinue to enrich uraniumfor civilian purposes. The bombing was a bust. Trump’s angry threat tostrike againis confirmation of failure.What this reckless act of aggressiondiddo is encourage rogue states such as Russia to believe they, too, may attack other countries with impunity. It reinforces the belief in Iranian ruling circles, and not only among rejectionist factions, that the west cannot be trusted and acloser alliance with Chinais necessary. It strengthens the hand of hardliners whose fondness for regional proxy warfare, and recently documentedcovert operationsagainst Britain, has entrenched Iran’s pariah status.Historically speaking, Iran was and is an avoidable tragedy – one of the west’s worst-ever geostrategic own goals. Unthinking support for the shah helped spur the 1979 revolution. The subsequent, far from inevitable ascendancy of conservative clerics plus abiding, irrational US animosity, feeding off memories of thehumiliating Tehran embassy siege, rendered the rift permanent. Europe tried and failed to chart a middle path. In 2018, Trump reneged on the US-, UN- and EU-ratified nuclear deal with Tehran andreimposed sanctions. This last of many disastrous policy mistakes led directly to today’s impasse. With wiser heads, it could have been very different.In this time of rancour, fear and war, peaceful nuclear cooperation in the Middle East is still possible | Javad ZarifRead moreAll parties to this conflict should study the French Enlightenment philosopherCharles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu, a foe to tyranny in all its forms. Writing in his 1721 bestsellerPersian Lettersmore than 300 years ago, he issues an impressively prescient warning about what were then imaginary weapons of mass destruction. “You say that you are afraid of the discovery of some method of destruction that is crueller than those which are used now,” his fictitious Persian traveller Usbek writes to a friend. “If such a fateful invention came to be discovered, it would soon be banned by international law. By the unanimous consent of every country the discovery would be buried.”In the sense that nuclear weapons are outlawed, Usbek’s optimistic prediction was correct. Butnot “every country” complies. If the US and Israel are sincere about preventing Iran acquiring the bomb, they should set an example and reduce, and ultimately eliminate, their nuclear arsenals. They should stop threatening renewed attacks. And they should back talks on a regional nuclear pact, as proposed by Iran’s former foreign ministerMohammad Javad Zarif.Only then, perhaps, will Tehran come in from the cold. Only then, perhaps, will its paranoid leaders stop hanging innocent people.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He’s also accused in many civil suits of sexual abuse of adults and minors. It seems like everyone promptly forgot about Combs when the facts about the financier Jeffrey Epstein’s decades of horrific sexual abuse of at least a 100 girls and women, with the help of his extensive staff, deep pockets, banks, and elite connections became the next front-page ruckus.In June, the movie producer Harvey Weinstein wasfound guiltyin a New York retrial for some of his decades of horrific sexual abuse of women, with the help of his extensive staff, top lawyers, the film industry, some ex-Mossad agents and of course his deep pockets. In February afederal appeals court upheldthe convictions and 30-year prison sentence of the singer R Kelly for racketeering and sex trafficking; last year hisother20-year sentencewas also upheld, for producing child abuse images and enticement of children for sex. Of course his deep pockets and extensive assistance had also been factors in how he too was able to abuse girls for so long.Why the US is burning $10m worth of birth control | Moira DoneganRead moreOne of the reasons the epidemic of violence against women is so unacknowledged is because cases like these are talked about individually, and often treated as though they are shocking aberrations rather than part of a pervasive pattern that operates at all levels of society. Another is that it is in the most literal sense not news – there are tides of hatred and violence against other groups that ebb and flow, but violence against women is global and enduring, a constant rather than an event. Another is that law enforcement and the legal system have often been more interested in protecting perpetrators and society has often normalized and even celebrated violence against women.Imagine that we had no word for cancer and no recognition of the varieties of ways it manifests, so that we just had occasional lurid news stories about strange and sometimes fatal growths in various parts of various people, not connecting the versions in brains to the versions in prostates and breasts. If we didn’t recognize the common denominators, we couldn’t develop diagnoses and treatments or address root causes. Feminism has in fact offered a diagnosis, steadily, for decades and centuries: that the cause is misogyny and the violence is intended to perpetrate the inequality, exploitation and subordination of women. But the one-case stories avoid this recognition by treating something ubiquitous as exceptional and isolated.The only thing exceptional about Epstein’s crimes was their scale and maybe the complexity of the international financial, transportation and other systems he used to traffic, control, abuse and silence victims. The nature of the crimes was ordinary and common. In the US, there’s arape every 68 seconds, a woman is beaten by an intimate partnerevery nine seconds, and while more men are murdered annually than women, “over half of female homicide victims are killed by a current or former male intimate partner”,according to the CDC. Globally a woman or girl ismurdered by her partner or family memberevery 10 minutes. A high percentage of human trafficking worldwide is of women and girls for sexual exploitation.Instead of focusing on high-profile cases in my opening paragraphs, I could have found examples from the hundreds of cases of sexual abuse of women, girls and boys by ministers of the Southern Baptist church. NPR reported in 2022 that, “the Southern Baptist Convention’s Executive Committee mishandled allegations of sex abuse, stonewalled numerous survivors and prioritized protecting the SBC from liability”. Or thegrotesqueriesof Andrew Cuomo’s allegedsexual harassment and gropingwhile he was governor of New York, followed by his persecution of those who spoke up. I could have brought up that both US and Canadian residential schools for Indigenous children are being exposed as former students who were sexually abused in them find the space to speak out.The pretense that we will find out whether or not Donald Trump is a sexual predator if the Epstein files are released is itself a kind of cover-up, since we already know he is – though I’m all for finding out exactly what it is he’s so frantic to hide. He wasfound liablefor sexually assaulting E Jean Carroll in a 2023 civil trial and has been credibly accused of groping, grabbing, and assault by numerous women. His worse-than-creepy behavior around the teenage girls in beauty pageants he managed iswell-documented, as is his closeness to Epstein.Now, like all the men mentioned in the first paragraphs of this essay, Trump has a protection machine at work – one without precedent. Our own federal government, funded by our taxes, is apparently striving to protect Trump from whatever’s in those files. Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, hasadjourned Congress to protect Trumpfrom Democratic measures meant to force Republicans to vote on releasing the Epstein files. Many high-level officials are serving not We the People, but Trump the Frantic.As the Hillreports, Senator Dick Durbin of the judiciary committee “says he has received information that Attorney General Pam Bondi ‘pressured’ about 1,000 FBI personnel to comb through tens of thousands of pages of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and flag any mention of President Trump”. A thousand workers pulled off their official jobs – this extraordinary effort only makes Trump look like he has a lot to hide.But in another sense the whole society is hiding something: that this violence is everywhere and it deeply shapes – or misshapes – our society. The statistics I cited above address the victims of specific crimes. But all girls and women are impacted by the reality that so many men want to harm us and these crimes could happen to any one of us. This violence affects the choices we make about where to go and when, what jobs to take, when to speak up, what to wear. The threat of violence and actual violence by some men against some women and girls establishes female vulnerability and fear and disempowerment far more broadly. Society has largely required us to alter our lives to avoid this, rather than society being altered to make us free and equal. This violence is an engine of inequality that benefits all men, insofar as being “more equal than others” in this respect is a benefit.The piecemeal stories – “here is this one bad man we need to do something about” – don’t address the reality that the problem is systemic and the solution isn’t police and prison. It’s social change, and societies will have changed enough when violence against women ceases to be a pandemic that stretches across continents and centuries. Systemic problems require systemic responses, and while I’m all for releasing the Epstein files, I want a broader conversation and deeper change.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

I was supposed to have a break for a few weeks while those pieces ran, but I found I couldn’t: I was making notes before I left the hospital.Looking back, I can see that there are a few things I got wrong in those few years. I never pretended to be an expert, and tried to be upfront about the fact that I was very much learning on the job. So here is a potted list of things I regret: I was wrong to be so dismissive ofbaby-led weaning. I had anxiety from a difficult birth and my son being hospitalised, and I was neurotic about choking. My son was preterm and wasn’t ready to be handling big bits of food at six months, but I didn’t realise that at the time (still, I maintain that people are weird and culty about it). Also, I was wrong to make a joke about “tummy time” not mattering: tummy time matters, especially for kids with certain disabilities. And I was wrong, possibly, or at least inconsiderate, to write about how having a baby had madeChristmas feel so special. A woman who had just had a miscarriage sent me a message saying it had made her cry, and I think, were I to write that column again, I would try to better acknowledge the pain of those with infertility and baby loss – the subject ofmy columnthe following Christmas.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Pia BramleyStill, there is a lot I stand by. I still think two weeks ofstatutory paternity leaveis pathetic and embarrassing. I still don’t think dads can have it all, either. I still don’t think there is a quick fix tobaby sleep. I still thinkbreastfeeding promotion policyin this country is a disaster, which sidelines maternal mental health anddoesn’t even workin the process. And I still passionately hateBill Thompson, from Postman Pat – the snarky little sod with an attitude problem whose voice continues to grate on me even as my son giggles with delight at his antics (although his favourite character is Michael).If there’s one lesson I’ve learned in the last three years of being a mother – and of writing about it – it’s that all of my readers were right: those first days, weeks and months really do pass so quickly, and though they can be hard, a part of you will long for them. Had I not written it down, I am sure there is so much I would have forgotten. In that sense, it’s been a gift. I’ll never get to hold my son as a baby again, or to hear the little truffle pig grunts as he sought me out for milk, but the writing of an experience helps to hold it in time, can even transport you back. Readers, too: I have been so moved by how many of you said you were in the trenches with me, or those, older, who said my writing helped conjure that time for them.It’s a funny thing, being a columnist. I picture my readers all the time, mainly because I hear from so many of you (your messages, emails and comments below the line have been the best part of this job), but it didn’t occur to me that you might picture me. The reality three-and-a-half years ago wasn’t pretty: I was newly postpartum, reeling, sleep-deprived. Often I wrote while “the bairn” screamed in the other room, cared for by my husband, or my mother – both of them are the hidden labour behind this column. For some reason, I had been arrogant enough to think writing with a newborn would be easy.Of all the things I have got wrong as a writer, that was probably the main one. There was this look I used to get in the run-up, when I told friends and family who were already parents that I was planning to document it all, in real time, and report on others’ experiences, too. It was a kind of wordless, smiling nod, the sort you also often get when you say that you want a water birth with no pain relief, or that you and your partner are solid and that a baby won’t change that. It’s often followed by a hesitant sentence before the person trails off.Just you wait,the knackered goblin in their head is hissing, but they’re too nice to say anything, and so they don’t.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Pia BramleySo that was my first error. In a way, I’m glad I made it, because otherwise I would not have written, and despite the fact that any time a female writer produces anything at all about motherhood she’s accused of thinking she’s the first woman in the world to have ever had a baby, when you look at the history of humanity we are still very much in the early days of women writing about this. We forget that for many centuries we weren’t even taught to write. Our knowledge was passed between us, and passed down, through the words that we spoke to one another, and to our daughters. I started this column because very little of the writing that existed then – brilliant as it is – seemed to speak to parents of my generation and younger, who face unique challenges. Now, there is far more, and it feels as though with every year that passes our voices are being taken more seriously.Choosing columns from this series to stitch together into a book was an emotional process. The thread that runs through them all is the feeling that, when it comes to parenting, having a feeling of community and solidarity are paramount. So it’s my story,but you have all been a part of it, too, from the many, many readers who have sent encouragement and advice, to the grandfather who said that he dances with his baby granddaughter now because he won’t live to see her wedding. Even the dad who said you don’t need to do anything with your kids until their teens, whereupon you can simply take them white-water rafting, taught me something. So many of you have been a part of this journey.

He writes here in a personal capacitySun 3 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 12.50 EDTShareGaza has been held under water for 22 months, allowed to gasp for air only when Israeli authorities have succumbed to political pressure from those with more leverage than international law itself. After months of relentless bombardment, forced displacement and deprivation, the impact of Israel’s collective punishment of Gaza’s people has never been more devastating.I have been part of coordinating humanitarian efforts in Gaza since October 2023. Whatever lifesaving aid has entered since then has been the exception, not the rule. More than a year after the international court of justice (ICJ)ordered Israelto “take all measures within its power” to prevent acts of genocide – and despite all our warnings – we are still witnessing starvation, insufficient access to water, a sanitation crisis and a crumbling health system against a backdrop of ongoing violence that is resulting in scores of Palestinians being killed daily, including children.Powerless to change this, we humanitarians have resorted to using our voices – alongside those of Palestinian journalists who risk everything – to describe the appalling, inhuman conditions inGaza. Speaking out, as I’m doing now, in the face of deliberate, preventable suffering is part of our role to promote respect for international law.But doing so comes at a price. After I held a press briefing in Gaza on 22 June in which I described how starving civilians were being shot while trying to reach food – what I called “conditions created to kill” – the Israeli minister of foreign affairs announced in apost on Xthat my visa would not been renewed. The Israeli permanent representative to the UN followed up at the security council announcing that I would be expected to leave by 29 July.This silencing is part of a broader pattern. International NGOs face increasingly restrictive registration requirements, including clauses that prohibit certain criticism of Israel. Palestinian NGOs that, against the odds, continue to save lives daily are cut off from the resources they need to operate. UN agencies are increasingly being issued only six, three or one-month visas based on whether they are considered “good, bad or ugly”. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (Unwra) has been targeted through legislation, its international staff barred from entry and its operations slowly suffocated.These reprisals cannot erase the reality we’ve witnessed – day in, day out – not just in Gaza but in the West Bank too. What I have observed there looks different from what is unfolding in Gaza, but there is a unified purpose: severing territorial continuity and forcing Palestinians into ever-shrinking enclaves. Palestinians in the West Bank are daily being coerced and contained: coerced by settler violence and demolitions out of areas where settlements are expanding and contained by a network of movement restrictions into disconnected built-up areas where there are increasing military operations.Gaza is also being fragmented. Its 2.1 million people are now being crammed into just12% of the land area of the Strip. I remember receiving the chilling call on 13 October 2023 announcing the forced displacement of the entirety of northern Gaza. Since that brutal opening act, almost all of Gaza has been forcibly displaced – not once but repeatedly – without sufficient shelter, food or safety. I have seen first-hand what appears to be the systematic dismantling of the means to sustain Palestinian life. As part of our role to coordinate humanitarian operations, my colleagues and I have helped carry patients out of dark, cat-infested ICU wards in destroyed hospitals overtaken by Israeli forces where the dead were being buried in the courtyard by the last remaining sleep-deprived staff who had witnessed their colleagues being marched away.We helped uncover mass graves in other hospital courtyards where families searched through scattered clothes trying to identify loved ones who had been stripped before being killed or disappeared. We have argued with soldiers who were trying to forcibly remove a screaming spinal cord injury patient from an ambulance while being evacuated from a hospital. We have repatriated the bodies of humanitarian workers killed by drone strikes and tank fire while trying to deliver aid, and collected the bodies of family members of NGO workers who were killed in sites acknowledged by Israeli forces as “humanitarian” locations.We have seen medics in their uniforms killed and buried under ambulances crushed by Israeli forces. Overcrowded shelters for displaced people bombed, with parents clutching their injured or dead children. Countless bodies in the streets being eaten by dogs. People calling from beneath rubble, with help from first responders denied until no one was left breathing. Children wasting away from malnutrition while aid navigates an insurmountable obstacle course of obstructionism.Israeli authorities accuse us of being the problem. They say we are failing to collect goods from the crossings. We aren’t failing, we are being obstructed. Just last week I was on a convoy headed to Kerem Shalom crossing from inside Gaza. We escorted empty trucks through a densely crowded area, an unnecessarily complicated route provided by Israeli forces. When the trucks were lined up at a holding point and the green light to move to the crossing finally came from Israeli forces, thousands of desperate people moved with us, hoping the trucks would return with food. As we crawled forward, people clung to the vehicles until we saw the first dead body on the side of the road, shot in the back from the direction of Israeli forces. At the crossing, the gate was shut. We waited around two hours for a soldier to open it.That convoy took 15 hours to complete. With other convoys, Israeli forces have delayed returning trucks while crowds gather and killed desperate people who were waiting for the trucks to arrive. Some of our goods have been looted by armed gangs operating under the watch of Israeli forces.During the ceasefire, we ran multiple convoys a day. Now chaos, killing and obstruction are again the norm. Aid is vital, but it will never be a cure for engineered scarcity.The ICJ has been clear. In its binding provisional measures, it not only ordered Israel to prevent acts prohibited under thegenocide convention, it also ordered Israel to enable urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance, including by increasing aid crossings. In a separate advisory opinion, the ICJ left no room for doubt: Israel’s ongoing occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is unlawful under international law. Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, are different parts of the same picture.What is unfolding is not complicated. It is not inevitable. It is the result of deliberate political choices by those who create these conditions and those who enable them. The end of the occupation is long overdue. The credibility of the multilateral system is being weakened by double standards and impunity. International law cannot be a tool of convenience for some if it is to be a viable tool of protection for all.Gaza is already drowning beneath bombs, starvation and the relentless grip of the blockade on essentials for survival. Every delay in enforcing the most basic rules meant to protect human life is another hand pressing Gaza down as it struggles for breath.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But users must be wary of the many risks involvedThe modern mindis a column where experts discuss mental health issues they are seeing in their workSun 3 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 19.04 EDTShareTran* sat across from me, phone in hand, scrolling. “I just wanted to make sure I didn’t say the wrong thing,” he explained, referring to a disagreement with his partner. “So I askedChatGPTwhat I should say.”He read the chatbot-generated message aloud. It was articulate, logical and composed – too composed. It didn’t sound like Tran. And it definitely didn’t sound like someone in the middle of a complex emotional conversation about the future of a long-term relationship. It also did not mention anywhere some of Tran’s contributing behaviours to the relationship strain that Tran and I had been discussing.Like many others I’ve seen in therapy, Tran had turned to AI in a moment of crisis. Under immense pressure at work and facing uncertainty in his relationship, he’d downloaded ChatGPT on his phone “just to try it out”. What began as a curiosity soon became a daily habit, asking questions, drafting texts and even seeking reassurance about his own feelings. The more Tran used it, the more he began to second-guess himself in social situations, turning to the model for guidance before responding to colleagues or loved ones. He felt strangely comforted, like “no one knew me better”.His partner, on the other hand, began to feel as though she was talking to someone else entirely.ChatGPT and other generative AI models present a tempting accessory, or even alternative, to traditional therapy. They’re often free, available 24/7 and can offer customised, detailed responses in real time. When you’re overwhelmed, sleepless and desperate to make sense of a messy situation, typing a few sentences into a chatbot and getting back what feels like sage advice can be very appealing.But as a psychologist, I’m growing increasingly concerned about what I’m seeing in the clinic; a silent shift in how people are processing distress and a growing reliance on artificial intelligence in place of human connection and therapeutic support.AI might feel like a lifeline when services are overstretched – and make no mistake, services are overstretched. Globally, in 2019one in eight people were living with a mental illnessand we face a dire shortage of trained mental health professionals. In Australia, there has been a growing mental health workforce shortage that is limiting access to trained professionals.Clinician time is one of the scarcest resources in healthcare. It’s understandable (even expected) that people are looking for alternatives. But turning to a chatbot for emotional support isn’t without risk, especially when the lines between advice, reassurance and emotional dependence become blurred.Many psychologists, myself included, now encourage clients to build boundaries around their use of ChatGPT and similar tools. Its seductive “always-on” availability and friendly tone can unintentionally reinforce unhelpful behaviours, especially for people with anxiety, OCD or trauma-related issues. Reassurance-seeking, for example, is a key feature in OCD and ChatGPT, by design, provides reassurance in abundance. It never asks why you’re asking again. It never challenges avoidance. It never says, “Let’s sit with this feeling for a moment, and practise the skills we have been working on.”From corner office to crossroads: navigating purpose and identity after retirement |  Gaynor Parkin and Dave WinsboroughRead moreTran often reworded prompts until the model gave him an answer that “felt right”. But this constant tailoring meant he wasn’t just seeking clarity; he was outsourcing emotional processing. Instead of learning to tolerate distress or explore nuance, he sought AI-generated certainty. Over time that made it harder for him to trust his own instincts.Beyond psychological concerns, there are real ethical issues. Information shared with ChatGPT isn’t protected by the same confidentiality standards as registeredAhpra professionals. Although OpenAI states that data from users is not used to train its models unless permission is given, the sheer volume of fine print in user agreements often goes unread. Users may not realise how their inputs can be stored, analysed and potentially reused.There’s also the risk of harmful or false information. These large language models are autoregressive; they predict the next word based on previous patterns. This probabilistic process can lead to “hallucinations”, confident, polished answers that are completely untrue.AI also reflects the biases embedded in its training data. Research shows that generative models can perpetuate and even amplify gender, racial and disability-based stereotypes – not intentionally, but unavoidably. Human therapists also possess clinical skills; we notice when a client’s voice trembles, or when their silence might say more than words.This isn’t to say AI can’t have a place. Like many technological advancements before it, generative AI is here to stay. It may offer useful summaries, psycho-educational content or even support in regions where access to mental health professionals is severely limited. But it must be used carefully, and never as a replacement for relational, regulated care.Tran wasn’t wrong to seek help. His instincts to make sense of distress and to communicate more thoughtfully were logical. But leaning so heavily on to AI meant that his skill development suffered. His partner began noticing a strange detachment in his messages. “It just didn’t sound like you,” she later told him. It turned out it wasn’t.She also became frustrated about the lack of accountability in his correspondence to her and this caused more relational friction and communication issues between them.As Tran and I worked together in therapy, we explored what led him to seek certainty in a chatbot. We unpacked his fears of disappointing others, his discomfort with emotional conflict and his belief that perfect words might prevent pain. Over time, he began writing his own responses, sometimes messy, sometimes unsure, but authentically his.Good therapy is relational. It thrives on imperfection, nuance and slow discovery. It involves pattern recognition, accountability and the kind of discomfort that leads to lasting change. A therapist doesn’t just answer; they ask and they challenge. They hold space, offer reflection and walk with you, while also offering up an uncomfortable mirror.For Tran, the shift wasn’t just about limiting his use of ChatGPT; it was about reclaiming his own voice. In the end he didn’t need a perfect response. He needed to believe that he could navigate life’s messiness with curiosity, courage and care – not perfect scripts.*Name and identifying details changed to protect client confidentialityCarly Dober is a psychologist living and working in Naarm/MelbourneIn Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, and atMensLineon 1300 789 978.

As a country that was once colonized by the British, I am wary of the ways that inequalities between the global north and global south risk being perpetuated in the digital age.When we consider the lack of inclusion of the global south in discussions aboutartificial intelligence(AI), I think about how this translates to an eventual lack of economic leverage and geopolitical engagement in this technology that has captivated academics within the industrialised country I reside, the United States.As a scientist, I experienced an early rite of passage into the world of Silicon Valley, the land of techno-utopianism, and the promise of AI as anet positive for all. But, as an academic attending my first academic AI conference in 2019, I began to notice inconsistencies in the audience to whom the promise of AI was directed. AI researchers can often identify consistent choices for locations where such conferences are hosted, and where they are not. NeurIPS, one of the top AI conferences, has highlightedannual issues for obtaining visas for academic attendees and citizens from the African continent. Attending such a prestigious conference in the field grants one the opportunity to gain access to peers in the field, new collaborations and feedback on one’s work.I often hear the word “democratisation” within the AI community, an implication of equity in access, opportunity and merit for contribution regardless of one’s country of origin. Associate professor of economics Fadhel Kaboubtalksabout how “a lack of vision for oneself results in being a part of someone else’s vision”, reflecting on how systematically lacking an access to infrastructure results in local trade deficits in economies.As in the time of Nafta’s promise of “free trade”, promises of “AI democratisation” today stillexistandbenefitmainly countries with access to tech hubs not located in the global south. While the United States and other industrialized countries dominate in access to computational power and research activity, much of the low-paid manual labour involved in labelling data and the global underclass in artificial intelligence still exists in the global south.Much like coffee, cocoa, bauxite and sugar cane are produced in the global south, exported cheaply and sold at a premium in more industrialized countries, over the past few years we have seen influence in AI inextricably tied to energy consumption. Countries that can afford to consume more energy have more leverage in reinforcing power to shape the future direction of AI and what is considered valuable within the AI academic community.What would an AI community inspired by the Brics organisation look like for the global south?In 2019, Mary L Gray and Siddharth Suri published Ghost Work, which exposed the invisible labour of technology today, and at the beginning of my tenure at graduate school, the heavily cited paper Decolonial AI: Decolonial Theory as Sociotechnical Foresight in Artificial Intelligence waspublished. It has been five years since these seminal works. What would an AI community inspired by the Brics organisation, which united major emerging economies to advocate for themselves in a system dominated by western countries, look like for the global south?I often ask myself how AI has contributed to our legacy, and whose stories it won’t tell. Has AI mitigated issues of mistrust and corruption in less-resourced countries? Has it benefited our civic communities or narrowed educational gaps between less-resourced regions? How will it make society better, andwhosesociety will it make better? Who will be included in that future?A historical mistrust can impede adoption by developing countries. Furthermore, many developing countries have weak institutional infrastructures, poor or nonexistent laws and regulatory frameworks for data projection and cybersecurity. Therefore, even with an improved information infrastructure, they are likely to function at a disadvantage in the global information marketplace.A currency is only as good as its perceivedglobaltrust. When thinking about the democratization in AI and a vision of what itcould bein years to come, AI’s survival requires including more perspectives from regions such as the global south. Countries from the global south should work together to build their own markets and have a model of sovereignty fortheirdata and data labour.Economic models often consider a definition of development that includes a measure of improvement in the quality of life of themost marginalizedof its people. It is my hope that in the future that will extend to our evaluation of AI.Krystal Maughan is a PhD student at the University of Vermont studying differential privacy and machine learning"

Forget the longevity bros – and be more Mariah CareyEmma BeddingtonThe singer has a reputation for cancelling anything she takes against, from stairs to overhead lighting. When it comes to our increasingly toxic obsession with wellness, she’s absolutely rightSun 3 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 14.33 EDTShareBig news, everyone: time is cancelled. Mariah Carey says so. “I don’t allow it – it just doesn’t happen,” thediva delle divetold Harper’s Bazaar. “I don’t know time. I don’t know numbers. I do not acknowledge time.” Carey made this proclamation in response to a question about how she deals with ageing while wearing “white Fendi pyjamas over a plunging black bra, with six-inch Gianvito Rossi heels”, which is exactly how I want my supreme planetary dictator to dress.Carey is famous for cancelling stuff – stairs (won’t do them), J-Lo (doesn’t know her), James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke (refused to sing) and overhead lighting (no) – but this might be her finest work yet. She has had time in her sights for a while, tellingOutmagazine: “I don’t count years, but I definitely rebuke them,” in 2014 and claiming onCapital FMthat she doesn’t have a birthday.She is hardly the first diva to deny ageing, but I don’t think anyone else has had the audacity to axe seconds, minutes and hours. While it might prove challenging for students of physics, I love this for her – and for us.We are making heavy weather of ageing. Everywhere I look, I’m assailed with questions and commandments about how to “age well”:build muscle,quit booze, sleep longer,eat ferments, stand up, walk fast,squat deep, jump around (the longevity benefits of the hokey cokey are unconfirmed).I know that goes for everyone – our society is solipsistic and obsessed with wellness – but it seems to apply doubly when you hit midlife, presumably because the older worried-well, feeling the chilly whisper of mortality, are a great demographic to target.HTSI, the expensive fripperies section of the Financial Times, recently launched a “longevity project” (hardly necessary for its readership, given thatbeing rich already adds nine years on to your life). I took its quiz to assess how well I’m ageing (which is surely the most depressing summer magazine quiz ever: “Mostly D? You’re staggering to an early grave”) and it suggested I cut out takeaways and eat more slowly, targeting my only remaining pleasures: tearing through food like a famished raccoon and not cooking.I thought I was fine with ageing, but, eight months after turning 50, the facts suggest otherwise. My breakfasts look like sweepings from the bottom of a hamster cage; I take multiple supplements, I worry about mybone densityand blood pressure and I try to“lift heavy”. Sometimes, as my husband and I pass each other the vitamin D spray (may slow biological ageing) in the morning before brushing our teeth, eyes closed, balanced on one leg, (doing it for longer predicts survival), I remember wistfully the gin-sodden nights and croissant breakfasts in bed of our youth. I don’t truly believe I can delay decrepitude, but I seem to have become a low-budget version of the immortality broBryan Johnsonanyway. Deluged with anxiety-inducing messaging, I’m spending my finite days planking, pulse-soaking and fretting rather than living.I’m doing it because I’m a craven rule-follower; plenty of people manage to ignore this noise and live outward-looking, exciting, second acts. But it’s also because the other options – getting weak or sick, burdening my kids and, yes, death – are worse.But here, finally, is my philosopher queen with a third way. I can’t possibly tell you how old Carey is, but having been born in 1969 to my 1974, she looks like a superior species: glossier, happier, thriving. It’s possible, I suppose, that “not acknowledging time” involves a punishing diet and exercise regime, but I don’t believe it. Carey isn’t sprinkling ground hemp seeds on her unsweetened porridge and taking her statins before going to power pump basics – she is too fabulous for that (and probably asleep: shecancelled mornings, too). She is also still having fun, as the Bazaar interview surely proves.You wouldn’t want to overuse the question: “What would Mariah do?” It could get lesser mortals arrested. But I think, now and then, as I’m dully dithering over cholesterol in coconut yoghurt or whether I need more cardio, I may whisper it to myself.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Starmer should be honest about this, and get on with the hard work it will requireSimon McDonald was the British ambassador to Israel from 2003 to 2006Sun 3 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 09.18 EDTShareThe idea that if you really, really believe something you can make it happen seems to be the best explanation for Britain and France’s recent statements that they willrecognise a Palestinianstate. No matter how fervent Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are, their fervour will not make an impossible thing happen. There is no Palestinian state, and there certainly won’t be one by September.For mostly domestic political reasons, they have decided to set aside that fact. Recognition is an understandable gesture, but it will do nothing to solvethe current famine, and is doomed in the short term because there is no real state to recognise. But there’s also a clear reason why some sort of action – even if it’s purely symbolic – is needed. The situation in Gaza is appalling. If Starmer and Macron proceed with recognition, how can we manage the short-term disappointment of recognising a state that does not exist, while moving towards a two-state solution in the long term?In 1933, the Montevideo convention, a treaty signed in the Uruguayan capital by 19 states, all from the Americas, set out criteria that had to be fulfilled when recognising a new state. The criteria were agreed at the international conference of American states but are applied by the whole international community. Although not formal legal requirements, they provide a useful framework when considering whether or not to recognise a state. The three most important are “people”, “territory” and “governance”. Is there a permanent population? Does that population occupy a defined territory whose borders it controls? And does it have a single recognised government?The international community has recognised the distinctiveness of the Palestinian people since the 1970s. That’s the main reason why 78 countries recognised the state of Palestine within months of the Palestine National Council’s declaration of independence in November 1988. But the Palestinians have never controlled their territory. The Oslo accords in 1993 gave full security control to the Palestinians in 18% of the West Bank. Over time, that area was supposed to enlarge. That never happened.And in 2007, Hamas took control ofGaza. The Palestinian Authority (PA), under the control of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), remained in charge in the West Bank, while Hamas controlled Gaza. Two rival Palestinian administrations remain in place.Widespread international recognition of Palestine has made no difference to the lives of ordinary Palestinians. So far, 147 UN member states have recognised Palestine, including China and Russia. When Ireland, Norway and Spain recognised Palestinian statehood last year, all four governments claimed that recognition sent a signal that couldn’t be ignored. But it hasn’t helped the Palestinian people one jot.Israel(and the US) barely noticed, beyond saying disobliging things about rewarding a “death cult”. They didn’t change their policy.UK and French action will probably be treated with the same contempt in Jerusalem and Washington. But, despite Israeli denigration of their action, London and Paris won’t be able to agree effective measures to penalise Israel, such as sanctions. Both governments still believe in Israel and its right to defend itself. Both still abhor what happened on 7 October 2023, and still see manifest shortcomings in the way the PA is run. Both the UK andFranceas part of the EU proscribe Hamas as a terrorist organisation.In fact, British and French recognition may make matters worse. Hamas may see advantages in sweeping away the corrupt gerontocracy in Ramallah; it is more popular than the PA in the West Bank these days. Benjamin Netanyahu, who doesn’t subscribe to a two-state solution, may step up operations in both Gaza and the West Bank to underline who’s in charge, and send a rather more effective message to Britain and France than they send to him.A two-state solution remains the only way to achieve long-term peace, but right now conditions for one could not be more hostile. For that reason, Britain and France recognising Palestine is an empty gesture. But the recognition boat seems to have sailed. Both Britain and France have made forward-leaning statements; governments find it hard to ignore incessant public demands.And public opinion is responding to what Israel is doing in Gaza. Collective punishment is unlawful. What Israel is doing to the population of Gaza because Hamas refuses to hand over 50 hostages (about 20 living and 30 dead) and dismantle its leadership amounts to collective punishment. Israel is not doing nearly enough to prevent starvation.By September, Israel won’t have fulfilled the conditions that Starmer has set out to avert recognition. And Israel (and its supporters) will say that’s no fault of Israel’s. The British government will still have freedom of manoeuvre either to recognise the state of Palestine or postpone recognition. But at that point failing to recognise would look just as weak as I believe recognising looks right now. What to do?The government could recognise Palestine while acknowledging the weakness of doing so. Ministers should go easy on rhetoric claiming it’s a historic moment, and focus instead on basic principles and the future. The only way for two peoples to live side by side in peace is for each to have its own state. Israel did not fulfil the criteria for statehood when it was first created. But Israel’s friends overlooked its shortcomings, while its foes (such as Stalin) argued that the Jews were not even a people.The unique complexity of Israel/Palestine’s history and geography will mean that the state of Palestine, when it’s real, is likely to look different from any of the other 193 members of the UN. It might not have an army. It might not have exclusive control over its borders. But it will still be worth it. The Palestinian people deserve better than the fate they have suffered for decades, a fate which has deteriorated horribly since theceasefire broke down in March this year. We must not forget them.Perhaps the best option in September would be for Britain to embrace the fact that it’s making a gesture, and not pretend that gesture had immediate, far-reaching consequences. It would make the gesture recognising that time, hard work and imagination were still needed to reach the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but that, at this desperate time, such a gesture was the last best hope to keep that solution alive. In diplomacy, it is vital not to mistake activity for effective action. But sometimes activity is all we have to offer.Lord McDonald of Salford was the British ambassador to Israel from 2003 to 2006, and permanent secretary at the Foreign Office from 2015 to 2020.

The courts said this was unfair. It’s time for regulators and ministers to deliver redressSun 3 Aug 2025 12.52 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 13.56 EDTShareWith itsrulingin the car finance case, the UK supreme court sent a clear message: some motorists purchased vehicles with deals that were indeed unfair, but it’s not the judiciary’s job to redraw the boundaries of consumer protection law. That burden, the justices suggested, rests with regulators and elected governments. This reasoning is in line with a major speech in June by the court’s president, Lord Reed, whoarguedthat judges aren’t policymakers – and shouldn’t be. He led a bench that nonetheless upheld a finding ofunfairnessin the case of the factory supervisor Marcus Johnson. The court flagged the danger, defined the threshold – but stopped short of imposing redress itself.Now, the baton has been passed. Millions could get payouts if theFinancial Conduct Authority(FCA) follows the court ruling with its proposed redress scheme, now out for consultation. The regulator admits what courts and campaigners have long suggested: that hidden commissions and opaque contracts were endemic, and that consumers were misled on a large scale. It may be 2025, but the roots of this scandal stretch back decades. More than 90% of new car purchases are financed, and for years, buyers weren’t offered the best deal – just the one that earned the broker the biggest cut.LastOctober, the court of appeal saw hidden commissions as tantamount to bribes – secret incentives to push pricier loans. Banks had been on the hook for potentially £40bn in compensation had that view prevailed. But the supreme court disagreed. Dealers aren’t fiduciaries, it said. They’re not priests or doctors. They’re salespeople and everyone knows it. The Treasury had tried, and failed, to intervene on behalf of banks that feared big payouts. The supreme court dismissed that petition with waspish brevity.Rachel Reevesmay argue she was guarding financial stability, but it is not a good look to be siding with lenders over misled consumers, especially when there is a strong case to suggest regulators had been asleep at the wheel.The FCA now admits that many firms broke the rules. It plans a compensation scheme covering loans dating back to2007, including both discretionary and some non-discretionary commission arrangements. The potential bill? At least £9bn, and possibly double that. Most individuals will probably receive less than £950 in compensation. The court’s refusal to stretch the law to encompass issues of trust wasn’t a shrug; it was a signal. The law allows unfairness to be addressed. But the heavy lifting must be done by the state.Thisepisodelays bare a deeper malaise. Britain’s credit system often runs on skewed incentives and asymmetric information. Brokers pose as advisers but act as commission-driven salespeople. In Mr Johnson’s case a£1,650hidden commission – a quarter of the car’s price – went undisclosed. That’s not a quirk; it’s economics’ classiclemonsproblem. In car finance, consumers didn’t know how much brokers were pocketing or how that skewed the deal. Without trust or clarity, quality suffers – and everyone overpays for “lemons” (duds).The court of appeal did focus minds; and failing to interpret the law robustly in the face of clear wrongdoing is itself a judicial choice. The supreme court smartly redirected the narrative. The regulator is stirring.Ministersmust now support a consumer-facing system of redress and notshield the Cityfrom the consequences of its own mis‑selling.

Defence budgets are rising. Threats are mounting. The US is distracted. Surely now is the moment. Except, of course, it isn’t.For all the politicalsoundbitesthat rattle sabres with increasing confidence, Europe is probably no closer to fielding a unified military force than it was when the Frenchrejectedthe European Defence Community in 1954. The problem is not one of capacity. Europe, including the UK, collectively boasts about1.5m active military personnel, and some of the world’s most successful defence firms. The problem, as ever, is politics. Or more precisely: who leads?Germany, claiming aZeitenwende(turning point), and asking the EU to exempt military investment from budget rules, might be the frontrunner. Poland isspendingmore as a share of GDP than anyone. The French would like to think they would be at the front of any queue. But their Gaullist, unilateral instincts run deep. Italy has industrial knowhow but lacks the economic heft. Post-Brexit, the UK is buildingbridgeswith the EU’s military powers but it still sees itself as Nato’s keystone. And the Baltic states? They want no European project that might scare off Washington.Evendefininga European army is difficult. Would it be a single force under the EU flag, combining the 27 national armed forces of the EU members into one common force? Or something looser, to keepIrishand Austrian neutrality intact? Could it be a smaller European intervention force? Or a joint effort by regional groupings in a new hat? The short answer is no one can agree on anything but disagreement.Squabbling might not be the best response to an increasingly assertive, hawkish and unpredictable Russian giant. Moscow’s full-scaleinvasionof Ukraine made territorial defence a pressing concern. Suddenly, Europe remembered why armies exist.Brussels pins its hopes of an industrial renaissance on afive-year rearmament planthat is meant to reduce reliance on US contractors. European firms likeRheinmetallandMBDAare scaling up, but the economies of scale found in the US military industrial complex elude the continent. Everyone wants to protect theirlocal champion. No wonder the bloc has appointed a commissioner for defence whose role is about overseeing the companies making drones, shells and missiles – not the armed forces per se.AGalluppoll in 45 countries last year showed deep ambivalence toward war among Europeans. Four of the five least willing to fight were in the EU – including Spain, Germany, and Italy, where only 14% said they’d take up arms. Even in frontline states like Poland and Lithuania, fewer than half were willing to fight. This pacifist mood reflects an EU integration designed to make war between member statesunthinkable.The irony is that the European army is seen as a symbol of independence from the US – while quietly relying on American satellites, command structures and munitions. Many European countries have upped defence spending, but they are not ready to go it alone. An integrated force would demand pooled sovereignty, unified command and a level of political consensus that don’t currently exist. That may change. But for now, Europe continues to depend on Washington’scapriciousleadership – even as it dreams of “strategic autonomy”.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionDefence policyNatoFranceGermanyPolandItalyeditorialsShareReuse this content"

AndTom Chancesays communities should have a seat at the tableSun 3 Aug 2025 12.27 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 12.29 EDTShareThere is a very real danger that, in its bid to reform the planning system and build 1.5m homes across England at pace, the government will neglect the basic requirements of livable communities (‘No shops, no schools’: homes in England built without basic amenities, 27 July).As your article makes clear, already “thousands of homes across England are being built without urgently needed community infrastructure”. The planning system cannot allow such fundamental aspects of quality, sustainable placemaking to be neglected. It would do well to recognise the solution offered by a landscape-led approach to development.Landscape is everywhere – not just in protected countryside, but in every high street and cul-de-sac. It is the setting in which we all live, study, work and play. By thinking landscape first and engaging landscape architects early, planners and developers can design-in essential community infrastructure from the outset, creating resilient places that deliver what people need.So, let’s build quality as well as quantity by prioritising landscape.Carolin GöhlerPresident, Landscape InstituteOne of the problems with the way we build homes in England is that local people have no role beyond complaining and objecting.In one case in your article, the community offered to finish off and run a community centre if the developer would just build the shell. But the idea that communities could roll up their sleeves and build, own, run these things just isn’t considered by our housing and planning systems. The developer considered and rejected the idea; the community had no say.In a small but growing number of places this opposite is happening.Communitiesare gaining a seat at the table in the design and build-out of new homes, and taking ownership of shops, playgrounds, open space, community centres and affordable homes. Developers have to work with, and negotiate with, local people over what is built. This little bit of leverage and agency, achieved through a community land trust, builds better places with a stronger sense of community.TheLabourgovernment has talked a lot about supporting communities. The prime minister recently spoke of people tired of being excluded from decisions about their own lives. Here’s your chance, Sir Keir, to include them in decisions about housing by wiring community agency and ownership into the planning system.Tom ChanceChief executive, Community Land Trust NetworkExplore more on these topicsHousingCommunitiesArchitecturePlanning policyLabourKeir StarmerlettersShareReuse this content"

The People’s Commission on the Water Sector hasinvestigated the £100bn figure in detailand found that the costs are based on biased evidence and have no basis in law. We have also found that any temporary funds needed to refinance the water sector would be through ringfenced bonds and would not affect the NHS budget. The environment secretary should not use figures that are clearly misleading and have no bearing on the actual costs of public ownership.The £100bn figure is the regulatory capital value (RCV) of the water companies, used by Ofwat and calculated using the market value of water companies in 1989, adding capital spending and depreciation since, multiplied by the retail prices index. Two water companies listed on the stock exchange have market values around half their RCV. KKR merely offered £4bn in its takeover bid forThames Water, which has an RCV of £21bn, before it pulled out in June.RCV bears no resemblance to the market value of the company and should not be used as the cost of public ownership. Market value is also not the correct way to value a water company. In law, the government would simply need to pay a fair value, not market value, to take a company into public ownership. This would take into account the inadequate investment in the sewage infrastructure, the dividends paid, the high debts incurred which have weakened financial resilience, and the huge costs required to rectify the damage done under private ownership.The law ultimately has to ensure that a “fair balance” has been struck in the public interest, and “appropriate value” for secured creditors. In the case of failed water companies that have returned billions to shareholders and creditors, while leaving billions more in repair costs, this would mean paying something closer to zero for transfer into public ownership.Prof Becky Malby,Dr Kate Bayliss,Prof Frances Cleaver, Prof Ewan McGaugheyThe People’s Commission on the Water SectorHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Labour must look to the future, not the past, 31 July). Keir Starmer has drawn on Harold Wilson for inspiration, but more pertinent to Kettle’s argument is David Lammy claiming a role model in Ernest Bevin. Made minister of labour in 1940 and foreign secretary in 1945, Ernie Bevin dominated the decade. Bevin sought a continued US military presence in Europe but had no illusions about the “special relationship”. The 1956 Suez crisis was a calamitous reality check, confirming the White House’s prioritising of US self-interest above any presumed obligation to an ally, however close.Larry Elliott’s pessimism over Trump’s trade deal with Europe is understandable (This trade deal is the EU’s Suez moment – its subservience to Trump is on show for all to see, 31 July), but the EU can take heart from how France responded to the United States torpedoing its joint effort with the UK to regain control of the Suez canal: a renewed commitment to pan-European economic collaboration saw the swift confirmation of a six-nation common market, and a determination that French foreign policy would never again be subject to transatlantic pressure saw the Fourth and then the Fifth Republic develop its own advanced weaponry, both conventional and nuclear. Had Attlee, not Eden, been prime minister in 1956, we can be certain that he would never have sanctioned collusion with France and Israel to invade Egypt, and then repeatedly denied having done so. Attlee’s greatest quality wasn’t succinctness – it was integrity.Adrian SmithEmeritus professor of modern history, University of SouthamptonI do not feel Martin Kettle is entirely fair or correct to say that Clement Attlee, on becoming prime minister, “pulled Britain out ofIndiaas fast as he could”.Attlee had been closely involved in India for more than 20 years, going back to the Simon commission, which had been established in 1927, specifically to consider the possibility of Indian independence and self-rule. As an MP and a member of the commission, Attlee visited India several times before the war (no mean feat in those days), understood the issues and knew the leaders of the political parties and factions.He did not underestimate the problems that independence might bring (although certainly not the violence and bloodshed), noting that partition would “necessarily leave minorities in both states” but emphasising that hisLabourgovernment was “in earnest in seeking to implement the promises made by Britain”.Eighty years on, another Labour prime minister now faces similar challenges over Palestine. I am sureKeir Starmer, like his distinguished predecessor, will rise to the occasion.Robert EvansFormer chair of the south Asia delegation, EuropeanparliamentMartin Kettle’s interesting article on Clement Attlee referred to his wife driving him to Buckingham Palace to meet King George VI on his historic 1945 victory over Churchill. Mrs Attlee was apparently a notoriously bad driver. My late father told me Mrs Attlee once collided with his car when driving the prime minister on a foggy night in London.

Who angered the gods?Cricketgods. Weather gods. Sport gods. All the gods. Because quite clearly, the gods, well, the gods are clearly deeply annoyed. As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods of fifth-day stewarding costs. They lead us on, whiz us into a frenzy, and drag us back the next day for their sport.It felt fitting in the end that England and India will get to face one anotheron the 25th of 25 daysin this brain-manglingly fine Test series, played out now by two teams operating on fumes, caffeine, ship’s biscuits and blood‑sodden socks.Siraj carry sums up Test series of great moments to live long in the memory | Simon BurntonRead moreEveryone was winning this game and simultaneously losing it by the time England and India were called from the field at 5.29pm, first by bad light and then a squall of rain. England need 35 runs, India four wickets, one of those the single swishing arm ofthe injured Chris Woakes.Runs had ebbed away like smoke wafting up into the vast flat open sky above the Oval stands asHarry Brookand Joe Root played like princes in the afternoon session. By the end those same runs had become the most grudgingly hoarded substance on earth as India fought back with great heart, took wickets, and jammed a pick handle in the revolving door.How in the history of all cricket, has anyone managed to score 35 runs, you wondered, as Jamie Smith and Jamie Overton prodded and flinched, feet encased in an invisible mobster’s tub of industrial concrete.Something will happen on Monday morning. Narratives will be set, themes that we always knew to be true nailed into place by hindsight in that final push to the line. For now there is a bonus element: time to digest a wonderful, thrilling fourth day, one of the great days of the Bazball project. And above all to talk about Brook.Brook’s 111 deserves to sit alone in its own brilliant square of light, innocent of all outcomes. Victory would probably nudge it up as the greatest on this ground in the modern age, or at least up there with Kevin Pietersen’s 153 20 years ago against an all-time Australian attack.For now the best way to look at Brook’s innings is to start with the key moment. Not the hundred itself, celebrated with a huge warm wave of noise from an utterly rapt Oval crowd. Instead the moment to remember on a deeply hallucinogenic fourth day arrived half an hour before lunch, in a game that history, gravity and the scorecard suggested England were losing.At which point Brook walked out of his crease and hit Akash Deep over cover for six. This wasn’t just an impossible shot, but an act of pure gangsterism. Brook was on eight off 18 balls at the start of the over. England were 126 for three and paddling. Johan Cruyff said that when he was playing badly he used to just smash into someone, start a row, upset the day. This is not far from what Brook does when the adrenaline jab is required. Here it came with a moment of space age skill and precision, all hands, eyes, easy grace, and somehow a kind of carelessness too, like a man swatting an apple over a tennis court with a walking stick.View image in fullscreenHarry Brook scored 111 runs from 98 balls to give England a chance to win the fifth Test.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt is hard to overstate the brilliance of being able to do this, but also choosing to do it at that moment. This is hoodlum cricket. It’s turning up to the Brits with a fake Uzi in your pocket. It’s Cherringtony Soprano. It is talent from another place. And it is entirely logical, too. If you can play that shot, you have a duty to do so. The moment will exist now, a collage of intent, shapes, lines, discarded conventions.Its timing was cold-eyed too. At that moment England were losing. Ben Duckett had battled hard, prodding and swishing and looking, as ever like Paddington bravely facing down the new ball. Ollie Pope had come and gone, trying to hit everything through square leg, an elite player with an obviously flawed technique.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A little later he hooked Deep into the hands of Mohammed Siraj just over the rope in front of the groundsman’s shed. There were pulls and glides and wallops, Brook seeing the ball like a single still point of light. He walked off at lunch to a huge, dizzy roar, 38 off 30, and the game broken open.This is shock and awe batting. England plan for this, choose the moment to shift the energy. It seems fitting that Brook, the Sedbergh scholarship boy, but also a man from a different pathway, should be the spirit animal of this style. His entire game is contained in that easy swing, the perfect hands, the clarity of his eye. The best players are always orthodox, but with shapes that are their own, that express some note of their own character and physicality. Brook has this, is graceful, but also splay‑footed, with a slouch but also a silk-hatted elegance.Has anyone ever had a better time playing Test cricket for England? Brook has played 29 Tests and won 19 of them, averages 57, has more sixes per game than anyone ever, is just told to go out and be Harry Brook, stretching out into the far reaches of his own startling talent in real time.Brook and Root gorged on the chase with both hands after lunch. Brook’s 50 came up off 39 balls. India started bowling short, tired men banging it into a placid pitch. Brook sent one Ravindra Jadeja long‑hop to the mid-wicket fence with the freewheeling disdain of a man hurling a discarded television set into a skip.There will be a temptation for some to dwell on his absurd and very funny dismissal. Brook was lofting the bowling to every corner when he tried a swipe too far and literally threw his bat to square leg, only to be caught at cover.Why, why, why not knuckle down and take it home? Which is of course to miss the point. That clip over cover was the impossible thing that made the very difficult thing look do-able. You either want this or you don’t, with all its edges. And, frankly, whatever the outcome, who could seriously wish to have it any other way?Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025Harry BrookEngland cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

He gave monosyllabic answers to questions and when asked why, said: “I have got nothing else to say.”He leaves the paddock on tenterhooks with the summer break beginning and the next round not until the Dutch GP on 31 August, about which he was similarly cryptic. He was “very much” looking forward to the break, but when asked if he would be driving at the next round, was less equivocal: “I look forward to coming back … Hopefully I will be back, yeah.”His Ferrari team principal, Fred Vasseur, maintained that his driver was just disheartened by a tough weekend. “I don’t need to motivate him, honestly, he’s frustrated, but not demotivated,” he said. “I can perfectly understand the situation. He’s demanding.

I can understand the frustration from Lewis. This is normal. He will come back.”Hamilton’s former team principal at Mercedes, Toto Wolff, also felt he would bounce back. “Lewis is wearing his heart on his sleeve. It was very raw what he said [on Saturday], he was hard on himself,” Wolff said. “We have seen it before when he felt he had not met his own expectations. He’s been that emotionally transparent since he was a young adult.“Lewis has unfinished business inFormula One. You ask me if he still has it?

It may be of little consolation to the English golfer as her wait for a maiden major win goes on but Hull’s surge was the only thing that ever looked like halting Miyu Yamashita’s Porthcawl procession. What an afternoon of stirring drama this quickly became on the stunning links, which should be rewarded with more high-profile events before too long. To Hull, plenty of plaudits for such a swashbuckling display.Yamashita eventually prevailed, by two, at 11 under par. The Women’s Open was denied a British winner for the first time since Georgia Hall lifted the trophy at Royal Lytham & St Anne’s in 2018. Still, Hull must feel she is closer than ever to winning one of her sport’s biggest prizes. She now has four second places in majors.The Women’s Open 2025: Miyū Yamashita wins at Porthcawl – as it happenedRead more“Coming into this week I didn’t think I was going to make the cut,” Hull admitted. “That’s the truth of it. I wasn’t hitting it very well. I couldn’t prepare as well as I wanted to because I was poorly. I obviously collapsed three timesin the round at the Evianand then I still wasn’t feeling well until Sunday last week. So I think I did pretty well and considering my mindset coming into it. I’m pretty proud of myself.“At the end of the day, it’s just a game. That’s what I think about and I enjoyed it out there. I just love that adrenaline feeling. It’s so good, it’s like a massive hit.”Minami Katsu tied Hull’s aggregate but was never a threat to the winner. Hull sat 11 adrift after 36 holes of this major. With three front-nine birdies in round four, Hull closed to within one of the leaderboard’s summit. What happened next turned the Women’s Open back in Yamashita’s favour. As she delivered birdies at the 8th and 9th, Hull could only par the 9th and 10th. The leader’s advantage was three.Hull displayed typical tenacity over the closing stretch. She had promised to play like a kid, to attack every hole and stayed true to her word. Her iron into the par three 12th was laser-like, setting up a birdie. The 29-year-old picked up another shot at the 14th, outstandingly so after finding thick grass from the tee. Was Yamashita now feeling the heat? A drive into the bunker at the par-five 13th, followed by a tame greenside chip, suggested so. Yamashita steadied herself and jabbed back at Hull with a wonderful, converted par putt from long range.The final, key moments were still to arrive. Hull hit into sand from the 16th tee. She could barely advance the ball far from there before overshooting the putting surface with her third. Hull bravely rescued a bogey, just as Yamashita slammed home an 8ft par putt two holes behind. Yamashita was two clear with four to play. Another Hull dropped shot at the penultimate hole meant Yamashita doing likewise made no material difference.View image in fullscreenCharley Hull lines up a putt on her way to second place in the Women’s Open.Photograph: Nigel French/PAYamashita is the third player from Japan to win this tournament but the second since it was afforded major status. Her swing is so stable one wonders how she can ever miss. A putting wobble towards the end of round three proved the exception to Yamashita’s 2025 Women’s Open rule. That she withstood everything Hull threw at her on a gusty afternoon says so much for the new champion’s mentality. “To win such a historic tournament in front of all these amazing fans is such an incredible feeling,” said Yamashita. Victory came the day after her 24th birthday.South Korea’s Kim A-lim and Japan’s Rio Takeda shared fourth at seven under. Lottie Woad’s tournament closed with a 71 and four-under total for a top-10 finish. Woad will have learned a lot in Wales, including what it is like to play under such a burden of expectation. Victory at last weekend’s Scottish Open on her first professional start meant she was in uncharted territory here. She will relish settling into the United States and the LPGA Tour over the coming weeks.“I don’t think it affected my golf but there was definitely a lot more attention, a lot more eyes on me,” Woad said. “I feel like I handled it pretty well overall and was just sticking to my game, just trying to focus on the preparation really and not let it distract me too much. It was a pretty good week overall, it was pretty solid.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's OpenGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

The question now forArsenalsupporters is whether Martin Zubimendi, Christian Nørgaard, Noni Madueke, Viktor Gyökeres, Cristhian Mosquera and Kepa Arrizabalaga can help them take that elusive final step to becoming champions for the first time since the Invincibles in 2004.The arrival of Gyökereswill certainly quieten the clamour for a new No 9 that has rumbled on for several years, although the pressure will immediately be on the Sweden striker to hit the ground running. Longstanding target Zubimendi should provide metronomic accuracy at the base of a new-look midfield that Arteta will hope can continue to get the best out of Declan Rice and rejuvenate the captain Martin Ødegaard, while Madueke will surely provide much better back-up for their talisman Bukayo Saka than Raheem Sterling managed last season and could also push Gabriel Martinelli for a starting place on the left flank.But even with theteenage sensations Myles Lewis-Skellyand Ethan Nwaneri having committed their futures to the club after enjoying outstanding breakthrough seasons, there remain concerns about a lack of creativity in the squad. A move for Crystal Palace’s FA Cup hero Eberechi Eze could depend on players departing before the end of August to balance the books.Yet while Arsenal may end up paying more than £200m for the additions to their squad so far, seeing champions Liverpoolcomfortably outspend themafter finishing 10 points ahead last season has left many fans wondering if they have gone far enough. The squad definitely looks stronger than this time last year but with other rivals also closing in, it could be make or break for Arteta.Past five seasonsThe managerEnding yet another campaign without silverware was a bitter pill to swallow for Arteta, who celebrated his fifth anniversary in charge just before Christmas. A solitary FA Cup a few months later is not a fair reflection on the progress Arsenal have made since then – especiallygiven the run to the Champions League semi-finalslast season – but Arteta knows he will be ultimately judged on delivering titles. He made no secret of his frustration over the lack of cover in Arsenal’s squad as the injuries mounted up last year. With plenty of reinforcements now added, Arteta must seize his opportunity.Off-field pictureThesurprise departure of EduGaspar in November disrupted plans for the January transfer window but Berta has provided some fresh perspective since joining in March. Arsenal’s American owners, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, were rated as the most valuable sports ownership group on the planet in July at an estimated $21.3bn (£16.1bn) thanks to a portfolio that also includes the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams, the NHL’s Colorado Avalanche and the NBA’s Denver Nuggets. So funding another summer spending spree wasn’t an issue after keeping their powder relatively dry last year. They – like Arsenal’s supporters, who pay for one of the most expensive season tickets in the country – however, will want a return for their investment at some point.Last seasonStar signingNo Arsenal player managed 10 goals in the Premier League last season so the onus is on Gyökeres – who scored a staggering 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting – to fill the void. The only issue is that the 27-year-old never played in English football’s top flight despite being on Brighton’s books and then excelling in the Championship for Coventry. He will be expecting to get plenty of opportunities in a side that usually dominates their opponents in midfield but struggled to break teams down last season, drawing 14 times in the league. Having eventually opted for Gyökeres rather than RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko or Alexander Isak of Newcastle, Arsenal must now find a way to utilise his obvious strengths.View image in fullscreenArsenal fans replicate the trademark goal celebration of new signing Viktor Gyökeres before the pre-season friendly against Newcastle in July.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesStepping upIt is highly probable that only Premier League regulations prevented Max Dowman from taking Nwaneri’s record as the competition’s youngest ever player last season. The attacking midfielder has been training with Arsenal’s first team squad since celebrating his 15th birthday at the turn of the year and was described as “special” by Arteta after coming off the bench to win a penalty in their pre-season win against Newcastle in Singapore. “What he’s done against this team in the time that he had on the pitch is something certainly not common to witness for a 15-year-old,” he said. Dowman is expected to be handed an opportunity sooner rather than later and it will be intriguing to see what impact he can have.A big season for …Martin Ødegaard was the first to admit that his performances last season lacked their usual sparkle, with a return of three league goals his lowest since moving to north London permanently in 2021. The 26-year-old captain was also substituted on 12 occasions after missing part of the season due to an ankle injury as he struggled to find his best form. The Norwegian must rekindle his relationship with Saka that has proved so effective down the years, while Arteta will be hoping that Gyökeres can finish off some of the chances Ødegaard will inevitably create given the lack of other options besides the inexperienced Nwaneri and Dowman.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26ArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Aki is yet to meet his fifth child, Aine, and said reuniting with his family is his top priority after helping the Lions to wrap up the series.Aki was a second-half replacement in the first Test, coming off the bench after 57 minutes and all the while ­coping with the drama unfolding in Auckland. Aine is Aki’s fifth child – all five have names beginning with A – and Aki’s remarkable revelation details the sacrifices made by the touring side, who first got together for a training camp in Portugal in early June.Tupou weeps golden tears as Wallabies win back respect in bittersweet victory | Angus FontaineRead more“I want to enjoy my break, my family time,” Aki said. “I haven’t seen my family for eight weeks. I have a newborn child who I haven’t met yet. She was born when we were playing in Brisbane, so I haven’t met her. Her name is Aine, so I’m looking forward to going and meeting my newborn child and we’ll go from there.“Credit to my wife [Kayla]. She’s a powerful woman, a strong woman. I have to say it to her. If you only knew the story of what happened, it’s a funny story in itself. It was a good day. I was in the hotel. I knew we were overdue. The missus calls me and she’s like: ‘Water hasn’t broke but I’m going to the hospital, I’m feeling contractions.’ I go: ‘Yeah, fair enough.’ She goes to the hospital, we’re getting ready for the team meeting pre-match, and then she calls me and says she’s on the way to the hospital, so I said: ‘Fine, be safe.’“Five minutes later, she sends a photo, her water broke. I was like: ‘Cool, OK, are you almost there?’ This is like 30 or 40 minutes away from the hospital, so I said: ‘You’ll be all right, Mum is there.’ Ten minutes later, she video-calls me and I was like: ‘Shit, what’s going on?’ I saw a baby on the video call, so she had it in the car on the way to the hospital. They’re both strong and healthy, so happy days. I knew it was good juju so I knew we were going to have a good day.”Aki went on to start the second and third Tests,struggling in ­appalling conditionson Saturday night in Sydney. After being part of the side that lost against South Africa four years ago, however, the 35-year-old was happy to settle for series success even if the targeted whitewash slipped by. “We’ll take the positive out of it,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The England international was carried off on a stretcher and appeared to be in obvious pain after going down unchallenged late in the game.Maddison, 28, missed the closing stages of last season, including theEuropa League final, with a knee problem and his latest injury affects the same joint. The Spurs head coach, Thomas Frank, said: “I think sometimes in life and football things can be both beautiful and brutal – that’s what we got today. It looks like with Madders a bad injury, and then on the other side unbelievable scenes for Son from his teammates and the respect from the Newcastle players.”Tottenham need to find a way to capitalise on legacy of trailblazer Son | John DuerdenRead moreThe friendly, which ended 1-1, was otherwise notable for the emotional reception thedeparting Son Heung-minreceived from fans in his home city. Son, 33, confirmed this week that he is to leave Spurs this summer after a decade at the club. The South Korea international, who wore the captain’s armband, was given a standing ovation and a guard of honour from players of both teams when he was substituted in the 64th minute.Son, who scored 173 goals in 454 competitive appearances for the club, said the occasion was an emotional one. The forward also thanked Frank for his understanding having told him he wishes to seek a fresh challenge. Son told the club’s website: “It was a perfect moment. Sharing these beautiful moments are something that I will never forget and I will always appreciate it – from the fans, the players and the gaffer.“He understood my situation and was always on my side. He always listened to me and asked what I wanted to do. I have a huge respect and am very grateful.” Reflecting on his time in north London, he said: “I wish them all the best. There are five competitions ahead and I hope they win all the five competitions. That’s my wish.“Spurs will always be in my heart and the boys will always be in my history books. It was incredible. They’ve gone so fast, the 10 years. I can only think about the beautiful moments, amazing moments.”Tottenham later announced the signing of thePortugal midfielder João Palhinhaon loan from Bayern Munich. The 30-year-old’s move is subject to international clearance and obtaining a work permit, with Spurs holding an option to make it a permanent transfer next summer.Palhinha returns to the Premier League having spent two seasons at Fulham before joining Bayern in July 2024, going on to win the Bundesliga title last season and then helping Portugal to Nations League success.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most tellingly, she spoke with a big smile.It was, she revealed, immediately after a disappointing run at the Eugene Diamond League four weeks ago that she decided a major change was required and there was no time to wait.Zharnel Hughes dedicates British 100m title to aunt after missing her funeral to raceRead moreMid-season upheavals are rare in athletics, and Asher-Smith had only moved to Texas to work with the coach Edrick Floréal at the back end of 2023. But something – and, for now, she does not want to reveal precisely what – was not working. So, with barely more than one month until the Tokyo world championships, the former world 200m champion packed her bags and flew home to London.Asher-Smith has run twice since: first finishing a fine second to the Olympic silver medallist Julien Alfred over 200m at the London Diamond League a fortnight ago, and then clocking 22.14sec to triumph in Birmingham on Sunday. That was a time good enough time to make the Olympic podium last summer; one she has bettered only once since 2022.Whatever has changed since returning to London – and the details are deliberately lacking, for now – it is clearly paying off. “I am back in London and so grateful to have an incredible support system,” she said, determined to avoid specifics.“Everybody is different, and different set-ups in different locations mean different things for everybody. I just think, for me, and the personality type I am, I need to be happy, free and my fullest, most vibrant self. I need to be in an environment where I can have discussions and work hard through my races week on week. I think it’s really important to be in an environment that recognises that and fosters it.“I’m more than happy to talk about it after Tokyo but I just want to stay focused because I am in great shape and know I can go there and perform really well. I’ve been really happy with these last two races because I’ve been able to be me and run really fast.”The clock showed as much on a blustery Sunday afternoon at the Alexander Stadium. Aided by a perfect 1.9m/s tailwind, Asher-Smith claimed the British title by a whisker from Amy Hunt, who had been crowned 100m champion a day earlier in Asher-Smith’s absence. The finish was so close that Hunt was awarded the same time, but had to make do with silver. They will resume battle in Tokyo in September, alongside Daryll Neita, who finished third.There was also an incredibly quick championship record of 19.90sec from Zharnel Hughes, who added the 200m crown to the 100m he hadclaimed on Saturday, when dedicating the win to his aunt whose funeral he missed to compete this weekend.View image in fullscreenZharnel Hughes celebrates after winning the men’s 200m final in a competition record time of 19.90sec.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAElsewhere, Georgia Hunter Bell gaveherself the headacheof whether to run just one or both of the 800m and 1500m in Tokyo after easing to the British title over the shorter distance in 1min 59.53sec. The Olympic 1500m bronze medalist must decide before the British team announcement at the end of this month.“I am probably in better shape over 800m on the world stage,” she said. “But the 1500m is first, so I could really tire myself out by doing three rounds of hard 1500m and coming fifth or sixth after running a crazy fast time.“It is head over heart. How cool would it be to follow in the footsteps of the great British athletes like Seb Coe, Kelly Holmes, Steve Cram, who did double up, and were successful? It is hard to decide.”Hunter Bell’s 800m triumph came in the absence of the Olympic champion and her training partner Keely Hodgkinson, who has not raced this year but is due to return from injury this month.Asked whether she can beat Hodgkinson, Hunter Bell said: “I don’t know. We train together all the time. She’s such a good athlete and it will be the first time we’ve raced where we’re kind of close. Whenever I have raced her before she’s been so far ahead. It will be interesting. I still think she’s a league ahead, so we’ll see.”There were British titles for a number of world medal hopefuls, including the reigning world 1500m champion Josh Kerr, who cruised to 5,000m gold. Amber Anning and Charlie Dobson picked up 400m crowns, while Max Burgin front ran his way to 800m victory. Morgan Lake won the high jump, with Jazmin Sawyers continuing her comeback from an achilles rupture to take long jump gold.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsDina Asher-SmithnewsShareReuse this content"

Volunteers in fluorescent hi-vis vests directed protesters away from puddles that had amassed on the concrete.Each time a train whistled past, marchers on the bridge, which links the north and south sides of the city, erupted into cheers and whistles, singing “Free, free Palestine” to passengers going past.Tourists summiting the bridge’s 1,332 steps waved down from its steel arched peak, witnesses to an unfolding moment in history that the state’s premier, Chris Minns,had tried to stop.The NSW police acting deputy commissioner Peter McKenna described the protest as the largest he’d seen in his time in the force in Sydney. “Gee whiz, I wouldn’t like to try and do this every Sunday,” he said. “We’re very lucky today that the crowd was well behaved.”At the front of the march,several high-profile Australians, including Julian Assange, held a sign that read “March for Humanity Save Gaza”. Five NSW Labor MPs were alongside Assange, defying their premier.Two of Minns’ ministers were there too: Penny Sharpe and Jihad Dib. The federal Labor MP Ed Husic – dumped from the Albanese cabinet in May – was in the crowd.Husic reiterated calls for the Albanese government to sanction Israel and recognise Palestinian statehood.“People power has come out, I think, largely because they just cannot abide the treatment that has been seen of little kids,” he said.Abib, in the crowd, agreed. She marched across the bridge carrying a Palestinian flag alongside her daughter. She said it was “humanity” that had brought marchers out in what was truly atrocious weather.View image in fullscreenA crocheted banner on the bridge.Photograph: Caitlin Cassidy/The Guardian“I think a lot of people are starting to wake up,” she said. “We’re going on two years [of war]. People that were quiet in the beginning have started to speak.”Abib, whose husband is Palestinian, was struck by the diversity of people. Middle-aged women carried a banner crocheted by volunteers. Elderly couples completed the 4km journey on walking sticks. A group of British men held a sign reading “Gay Jews 4 Gaza”.As the day began to wind down, Josh Lees, one the main organisers of a march that will be long remembered, told Guardian Australia: “It’s even bigger than my wildest dreams.“It’s a mass march for humanity to stop a genocide, our politicians have to now listen to the will of the people and sanction Israel.”Explore more on these topicsSydneyIsrael-Gaza warProtestSydney Harbour BridgeNew South WalesAustralian police and policingLabor partyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They had drilled through dozens of meters of rock to reach the stranded workers.“We deeply regret this outcome,” Cubillos said.The five miners – Gonzalo Núñez, Jean Miranda, Alex Araya, Carlos Arancibia, and Pávez were trapped deep inside Chile’s El Teniente mine on Thursday after a section collapsed following a 4.2 magnitude earthquake that instantly killed miner Paulo Marín and injured nine other workers.The trapped miners were located by using GPS devices but rescue teams were not able to communicate with them.Authorities are investigating whether it was a naturally occurring earthquake or whether mining activity at El Teniente caused the tremor. Chilean prosecutors also launched a criminal investigation to determine whether any safety standards were violated.El Teniente, located in the Andes mountains in central Chile, is the world’s largest underground copper mine and is owned by state company Codelco.Shortly after Thursday’s collapse, Codelco halted operations in the affected section of the mine and evacuated 3,000 people from the broader site to safe areas.The company cancelled a presentation of its first-half financial results, set for Friday morning, due to the rescue efforts.Chile, the world’s biggest copper producer, lies in the seismically active Ring of Fire that surrounds the shores of the Pacific Ocean.In 2010, Chile’s government rescued 33 miners trapped in a copper mine in the country’s north for two months in a dramatic operation that made global headlines and was later depicted in a Hollywood movie.Explore more on these topicsChilenewsShareReuse this content"

Job growth numbers were revised down by 285,000 for the two previous months as well.On CBS News’s Face the Nation, GreerdefendedTrump’s decision to fire McEntarfer, a respected statistician, saying: “You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.”He added: “The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch.”Senate confirms Trump ally Jeanine Pirro as top federal prosecutor for DCRead moreBut William Beach, who served as Trump’s commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in his first presidency, warned that McEntarfer’s dismissal would undermine confidence in the quality of US economic data.The BLS gave no reason for the revised data but noted that “monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors”.“This is damaging,” Beach said on Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union. “I don’t know that there’s any grounds at all for this firing.“And it really hurts the statistical system. It undermines credibility in BLS.”McEntarfer on Friday published a statement on social media reacting to her dismissal, calling it the “honor my life” to have served as BLS commissioner.She said the BLS employs “many dedicated civil servants tasked with measuring a vast and dynamic economy”.“It is vital and important work, and I thank them for their service to this nation,” McEntarfer’s statement on the Bluesky platform said.Uproarover McEntarfer’s firing has come as a series of newtariff ratesare due to come into effect this month. While the president has predicted a golden age for the US economy, many economists warn that higher import tariffs could ultimately weaken American economic activity.On CBS, Greer said that Trump’s tariff rates are “pretty much set” and unlikely to be re-negotiated before they come into effect.The first six months of Trump’s second terms have been characterized by a seesawing of tariff rate announcements that earned the president the moniker on Wall Street ofTaco– “Trump always chickens out”. But last week heissuedanexecutive orderoutlining tariff modifications for dozens of countries after he had twice delayed implementation.Yet Greer also said many of the tariff rates announced “are set rates pursuant to deals”.“Some of these deals are announced, some are not, others depend on the level of the trade deficit or surplus we may have with the country,” he said.On NBC’s Meet the Press, the national economic council (NEC) director, Kevin Hassett, said modified US tariff rates were now “more or less locked in, although there will have to be some dancing around the edges about exactly what we mean when we do this or that”.Asked if tariff rates could change again, he said, “I would rule it out because these are the final deals.”On Fox News Sunday, Hassett said he also supported McEntarfer’s dismissal. “I think what we need is a fresh set of eyes at the BLS, somebody who can clean this thing up,” he remarked.But former treasury secretary Larry Summers told ABC’s This Week that McEntarfer’s firing was “way beyond anything that Richard Nixon ever did”, alluding to the late former president who resigned in 1974 over the Watergate scandal.Trump news at a glance: inquiry launched into Trump prosecutor as backlash grows over firing of statistics chiefRead moreSummers said Trump’s claim that the poor job numbers were “phony” and designed to make him look bad “is a preposterous charge”.“These numbers are put together by teams of literally hundreds of people following detailed procedures that are in manuals,” Summers said. “There’s no conceivable way that the head of the BLS could have manipulated this number. The numbers are in line with what we’re seeing from all kinds of private sector sources.”Summers placed McEntarfer’s firing, Trump’spressureon Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, to lower interest rates, and the strong-arm tactics that the administration has aimed at universities, law firms and media institutions in the same bucket.“This is the stuff of democracies giving way to authoritarianism,” Summers said. “Firing statisticians goes with threatening the heads of newspapers.“It goes with launching assaults on universities. It goes with launching assaults on law firms that defend clients that the elected boss finds uncongenial. This is really scary stuff.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS economyTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Officials in nearby Kherson said Russia again bombed a crucial bridge, causing significant damage.In Russia’s Voronezh region, authorities said four people were hurt in a separate Ukrainian drone strike.As Moscow rebuffs repeated calls by the US president, Donald Trump, for a ceasefire, aRussian drone and missile attack on Kyivon Thursday killed 31 people, including five children, and wounded more than 150 in one of the worst single-day tolls in several months.The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, described the assault as “depraved” and posted a picture of the bloc’s flag at half mast.Zelenskyy has been appealing to allies for more air defence systems to rebuff the Russian escalation.On Friday, Germany said it would soon start delivering two more US-made Patriot launchers in addition to three Patriot systems already delivered to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.Trump on Tuesday gave the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, a shorter deadline of 8 August for peace efforts to move forward, as attacks continue unabated. The US leader has threatened new economic sanctions if progress is not made – a measure long demanded by Kyiv and backed by EU powers.Zelenskyy said on Sunday that Ukraine and Russia had agreed to exchange 1,200 prisoners after their latest round of talks in Istanbul in July.“There is an agreement to exchange 1,200 people,” he wrote on X, saying the lists of individuals to be swapped was still being determined to “unblock the return of our civilians”.“Preparations for a new meeting” were also under way, Zelenskyy said.Each of the three rounds of Ukrainian-Russian negotiations this year has resulted in prisoner exchanges but yielded no breakthrough in reaching an end to the fighting.The Russian government did not immediately comment.The Ukrainian air force said on Sunday that Russia had launched 76 drones and seven missiles against Ukraine overnight. It said it destroyed 60 drones and one missile, but 16 others and six missiles hit targets across eight locations.Early in the war, the Mykolaiv region faced frequent Russian artillery strikes and aerial attacks. Even after Russian forces were pushed back in late 2022, drones and missiles have remained a constant danger.The Russian defence ministry said its air units intercepted 93 Ukrainian drones overnight, including one over the Krasnodar region and 60 over the Black Sea.Ukrainian authorities said at the weekend that they had targeted other key sites for Russia’s energy and defence sectors in retaliation for the recent deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities.The week also brought political turbulence for Kyiv, after nationwide protests prompted parliament torestore the independence of Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies.Over the weekend a Ukrainian lawmaker and other officials were arrested after those agencies unearthed an alleged wide-ranging bribery scheme linked to the purchase of drones and other weapons systems.Pledging “zero tolerance” for corruption, Zelenskyy himself announced the arrests on X. The scheme is believed to have hiked prices by up to one-third in state contracts with suppliers.A previous, hotly contested bill that MPs passed in July with support from Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People party, which had made the fight against sleaze its calling card, had stripped powers from the independent national anti-corruption bureau, known as Nabu, and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office, Sapo.The changes would have brought them under the control of Zelenskyy’s handpicked general prosecutor, alarming EU allies and triggering a popular revolt.Activists in Kyiv, who had mounted street protests, on Thursday cheered the passage of a new law essentially annulling the measures, in whatone demonstrator calleda victory for “the values that our soldiers are defending on the frontline”.Ukraine was granted the status of an EU membership candidate in 2022 and the battle against corruption is seen as integral to its bid.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Now, as the UK’s first female and first openly gay archbishop, and the first openly lesbian and partnered bishop to serve as a primate within the Anglican communion, she has well and truly broken the stained glass ceiling.“It happens that I’ve lived in a time that’s meant that I’m a trailblazer, but I’m not a campaigner,” the Leicestershire-born archbishop said during an interview at the Church in Wales’s offices in central Cardiff.“I’m not somebody to be out there all the time but I do seek to be true to what I think God’s asking of me.”Working in the Church in Wales since 2020 has been very different from the many years Vann spent at the Church of England, she said, as clergy are permitted to be in same-sex civil partnerships. In the Anglican church in England, same-sex relationships are technically allowed, but gay clergy are expected to remain celibate.Upon becoming bishop of Monmouth five years ago, Vann publicly disclosed her civil partnership with Wendy Diamond, her partner of 30 years, for the first time.“Other people in England were braver than I was and made their sexuality clear. A lot of them suffered the consequences of that, certainly when going forward for ordination,” Vann said.“For years we kept our relationship secret because I worried about waking up and finding myself outed on the front page of a newspaper. Now, Wendy joins me everywhere, and when I take services, it’s just normal. But in England she had to stay upstairs if I had a meeting in the house.”Being a woman in the church had been difficult enough, she added. “You can hide your sexuality, up to a point, but you can’t hide being a woman. There was a lot of nastiness; the men were angry, they felt they had been betrayed.”Vann said in the 1990s, she and a handful of other female priests began meeting for prayer and conversation with male colleagues opposed to their ordination. “It was awful, it was really difficult for all of us, but we stuck at it,” she said.Over time, the hostility dissipated. “This is what I’m hoping around the sexuality issue too – modelling that we can vehemently disagree about something, but we can still love one another in Christ and recognise one another as children of God.”Vann will be enthroned in red and gold at her home cathedral in Newport this autumn in what many in the church hope will mark a definitive end to a tumultuous period.Andy John, the former archbishop, announced in June he was standing down with immediate effect after an alcohol-fuelled financial, bullying and sexual misconductscandal at Bangor Cathedral.John was not accused of wrongdoing, but calls for his resignation gathered pace after summaries of two reports were published and six “serious incident reports” were sent to the Charity Commission earlier this year.Two members of the cathedral’s college of priests have called for an independent inquiry into the events at Bangor, but Vann downplayed the demands, telling the Guardian that she believed the Wales-wide “cultural audit” announced by the church’s representative body in the wake of John’s resignation would be sufficient to “hold people accountable”.The new archbishop’s top priority is “healing and reconciliation”, she said. “There’s a lot of work already going on in the background, we haven’t been standing still … We must work to build trust with those who have been hurt and angered by what has gone on.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was no formal finding against Pain.Vann is also somewhat of an outsider to Wales, symbolising a clean break with the John era and the Bangor scandal.The archbishop grew up in a religious family in Whetstone in Leicestershire, following in her church organist father’s footsteps by studying at the Royal College of Music and then the Royal Schools of Music, where she trained as a teacher.She entered an Anglican theological college in 1986 to prepare for ordination and then worked in the Manchester diocese, becoming a priest in 1994 and archdeacon of Rochdale in 2008.Gender and sexuality are still highly divisive issues in the Anglican communion. Even in her new role as the first female and first openly gay archbishop in the UK, Vann was cautious on the topic of gay marriage.“I don’t personally feel the need to get married in church; Wendy and I have been together for 30 years, we’ve made our vows, and we are committed to each other.“Gay marriage in church is inevitable, I think: the question is when. There are people who are very opposed, and as leader, I have to honour their position, which is theologically grounded. It isn’t my job to push something through that would alienate a good proportion of clergy.”Vann’s appointment has caused outrage in some circles, with one prominent conservative group calling it “tragic”. In response, the Church in Wales has highlighted the warm welcome the news has received from dozens of other denominations and churches.For her part, Vann said she was not worried about whether her election would be perceived as tokenistic.“It’s a two-thirds majority vote in the electoral college, the bar is high,” she said. “I don’t think any of those people voted for me primarily because I’m a woman or a gay person. They voted for me because they recognise I’ve got the skills to lead the Church in Wales at this particular time.”Explore more on these topicsAnglicanismWalesChristianityLGBTQ+ rightsReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

The federal government has promised no new extinctions and pledged to have30% of land protected by 2030– part of a global “30x30” conservation goal.“On 30 by 30, we have been at pains to say that if that land is not being effectively conserved, then it’s all for naught,” Allard says.“30 by 30 is about protecting areas but increasingly we have to think beyond that. About 54% of Australia is managed for pastoralism. We have to find a way to have sheep and cattle and conservation working together.”The 30x30 target for Australia includes everything listed on a national reserve system and 24% of the land is now protected in areas like reserves and parks managed by local and state governments, the commonwealth and not-for-profit conservation groups like AWC.To reach its lofty goals, Allard says the organisation wants to grow from its $40m-a-year revenue that comes mostly from philanthropy, to a $100m-a-year organisation.The conservancy hopes the new high-profile appointment to its board of the former NSW Liberal treasurer Matt Kean, the chair of the federal government’s Climate Change Authority, will help increase its reach and raise more funds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The goal is to grow that philanthropy. Only about 2% of charitable giving in Australia goes to the environment.“Most of the world’s biodiversity is in the southern hemisphere, but most of the money is in the northern hemisphere. We have to find ways to sell Australia internationally.”Ecosystem engineeringBack at Mount Gibson, the bettongs released last month are being tracked every two days with the help of radio collars on 20 of them.Palmer is getting ready for the arrival of a team of botanists to survey the sanctuary to see if the reintroduction of the small mammals has started to help more native plants grow.A lot of Australia’s smaller mammals are “ecosystem engineers” that help spread seeds and improve soils with their digging.“When you walk through the fenced area, there are these little dig holes everywhere with little seedlings growing in them,” Palmer says.Those benefits might be spilling out of the fenced area.“We’ve started to get records of the bettongs outside the fence,” she says. “It’s six foot high, but they’re good climbers.”Explore more on these topicsEndangered speciesConservationWildlifeWestern AustraliaAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last month there were 13 dual-fuel green tariffs available to consumers out of 57, compared with last summer when there were 24 green tariffs on offer out of 56 dual-fuel energy deals.All the energy deals now advertised as “green” on the uSwitch price comparison website, including dual-fuel and separate gas and electricity tariffs, have made up just 18% of the overall total this year, data from the switching service shows.Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, green energy deals made up 85% of all energy tariffs on offer on the price comparison site, according to uSwitch data.“Consumer choice plays a strong role in what is offered on the market, so cost concerns might see people switching away from more expensive green tariffs. This would therefore reduce the demand for them,” Mann-Belotti said.“Also, there are other ways for people to reduce their carbon footprint, with quite the increase in solar PV installations in recent years.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although there are fewer green tariffs on the market today, the deals available are “greener” than they used to be.Uswitch grades each tariff marketed as green to help customers avoid greenwashed deals. In 2021, fewer than 15% of tariffs received a gold- or silver-standard rating from the switching service, but last year nine of the 10 green tariffs on its site were ranked at this level, leaving a single tariff ranked bronze.The stronger green credentials behind these tariffs reflect a shift away from using renewable energy certificates to guarantee the origin of the electricity – called“greenwashing” by consumer groupsand investigated by the government.Instead, suppliers are opting to buy clean energy directly from renewable energy projects. Others sell energy that is cheaper when there is more renewable energy across the country as an incentive to use more clean power when it is available.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryEnergy billsHousehold billsRenewable energyGreen economyUK cost of living crisisEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Between the years 1980-81 and 2023-24, the discount averaged 43% on the prevailing market price.The report comes as Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, pushes to tackle Britain’s housing crisis by makingsweeping changesto right to buy, including making it harder for tenants in England to buy their council home.Under the planned changes, eligibility for the scheme will be tightened. This will include extending the minimum time a council tenant must live in their home from three to 10 years before they can buy it at a discount.Right to buy was launched by Thatcher as a pitch to older working-class voters to build a “property-owning democracy”. Although it helped millions of families into home ownership, it also dramatically depleted Britain’s affordable housing stock as the homes were not replaced.View image in fullscreenMargaret Thatcher in September 1979 with the new owner of the 1,000th sold-off London council home.Photograph: Keystone Press/AlamyAfter rising for decades, home ownership rates have fallen since 2004, and havecollapsed among young adults. From a peak of more than half of 25- to 34-year-olds owning their own home in 1990, less than a quarter of young adults are now property owners, leading to a boom in private renting and many choosing to live with parents.After decades of sharply rising property prices, Common Wealth said, local authorities have lost the use of housing assets that could have either been sold at higher market values or used for social housing.Chris Hayes, the thinktank’s chief economist, said: “The severe financial straits facing councils should be seen in the context of a decades-long assault on local government, in which right to buy was a central pillar, denying councils discretion over how best to use assets that they had built.“Now those assets are in dire shortage and councils still bear the heightened cost of seeing people through the housing crisis.”Many of the properties are now rented out, often to tenants on housing benefit at a cost to local authorities of more than £20bn year, while councils have lacked funding to replace the homes sold.The leftwing thinktank, which has links to senior Labour cabinet figures, said local government has been in “net disinvestment” in every year but one since 1988-89 – meaning it sells more assets than it builds. A report earlier this year by the Centre for Cities found that returning the number of affordable homes back to 2010 levels would cost the government £50bn.Labour has pledged a “social rent revolution”, allocating£39bn of social and affordable homesover the next 10 years, alongside slashing planning rules to support private sector housebuilding. However, critics have warned that the government could struggle to hit its target to build 1.5m new homes in total.Kwajo Tweneboa, a social housing campaigner, said right to buy had “gutted council housing and transferred public wealth into private hands”.“We’re in a housing emergency. Millions stuck on waiting lists. Tens of thousands living in temporary accommodation that’s unfit and unsafe. All while homes that were once publicly owned are now profit-generating assets for private landlords,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHousingHousing benefitHousing marketRenting propertySocial housingLocal governmentBenefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

She had been stabbed several times.Six years ago, an inquest in Kenya found that Wanjiru, who was mother to a then baby girl, had been killed by one or more British soldiers.In 2021, several soldiers, who at the time were attached to the Duke of Lancaster’s regiment, came forward to name a suspect.One offered startling testimony in which he claimed the suspect, a fellow Duke of Lancaster soldier, had confessed to her murder on the night, and taken him to see Wanjiru’s body in the septic tank.While a British soldier is believed to be the primary suspect in the case, under the UK-Kenya defence cooperation agreement, jurisdiction for investigating the murder lies with the Kenyan authorities.View image in fullscreenJohn Healey pictured with some of the family of Agnes Wanjiru.Photograph: HandoutKenyan police have flown to the UK several times, and are believed to have questioned multiple witnesses. In April, Kenyan police said a file had been passed to the Kenyan director of public prosecutions for a charging decision.Yet almost four years on from a suspect being identified, nobody has been arrested or charged in relation to the murder.Wanjiru’s niece Esther Njoki, 21, was eight years old in 2012, and said her memories of her aunt drove her fight for justice.“The reason why I’m passionate about this case and that I’ve been fighting, it’s what she did in the family,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She used to cook, braid my hair, everything. So that’s why I’m so passionate to fight for her rights.”“She was always jovial, smiling, hard-working. We were always laughing because of her jokes and everything,” she added. “It’s very heartbreaking. She was kind, she was everything, we miss her.”While in opposition, Healey called for more to be done to “pursue justice for Agnes and her family”, but Njoki says they are disappointed that more has not been done in the year since Labour came to power.“I think he just made a promise for his political gain,” Njoki said, “I think he’s taking us for a ride.”“They hide behind investigation,” she added, “because every time we raise any issue, they say ‘investigation, investigation’, we don’t know the status of the investigation.”Njoki, who is studying communications and acts as a spokesperson for the family,is currently raising funds to come to the UK in the autumnin order to meet with campaigners, hold a press conference, and lobby politicians directly.“I want to come and lobby there, so that they can take this matter seriously,” she said, “because they know the family can’t come to UK to seek justice there.”Justice, Njoki said, would mean closure. Her family believed that the government could do more.“They have power, but they have refused, and it’s heartbreaking,” she said. “Agnes was a human being.”“I think if she were around right now, everything would be so perfect,” she added, “but now that she’s not there, we are left to seek justice for her, with our hearts broken, being frustrated, and it’s the worst thing.”Tessa Gregory, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, who is acting on behalf of the family, said: “It is now 13 years since Agnes’ body was found in a septic tank, the Kenyan criminal investigation has been ongoing for years, and while the file was reportedly sent to the [Kenyan] DPP months ago, a charging decision is still awaited. The family are frustrated with both the lack of progress in the criminal proceedings and the lack of engagement from the British government.”She added: “They hope that the secretary of state will do everything within his power to ensure that those held responsible are brought to account swiftly and that the role of theBritish armyin Agnes’ death, including as to why nothing was done for nearly a decade after the murder, is thoroughly and independently examined.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said: “Our thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru, and the defence secretary has long recognised the tragic circumstances of her death.“The jurisdiction for this investigation lies with the Kenyan authorities. The defence secretary welcomed the confirmation that the case file had been handed over to the director of public prosecutions for a charging decision during his visit to Kenya in April 2025.“We will continue to work closely with the Kenyan authorities for the justice the family deserves. In order to protect the integrity of the Kenyan investigation and in the interests of justice for Agnes Wanjiru’s family, we are unable to comment further.”Explore more on these topicsKenyaBritish armyAfricaMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

One demonstration was against the war in Gaza; the other, against the Welsh government’s two-year-old default 20mph speed limit in urban areas.The change from 30mph was brought in by the Welsh Labour government across about 35% of the country’s roads in September 2023, at a cost of £34m. The reduced speed limit applied to any built-up area, defined as roads where lamp-posts were no more than about 180 metres apart.Last week a small study by GoSafe, which monitors road cameras, found the policy had added an average of two minutes to journey times of differing lengths, aggravating an already bitter culture war over legislation designed to save lives.Collisions along roads that have changed from 30mph to 20mph decreased by 19% in 2024 compared with 2023, and 100 fewer people a year have been killed or badly hurt in road traffic accidents, according to Welsh government figures.Yet according to canvassing Senedd members and local councillors, the issue remains deeply unpopular with voters as the country’sembattled Labour administrationgears up for elections next May.The former first minister Mark Drakeford, who spearheaded the policy, has previously said he was surprised at the level of opposition and anger the new limit provoked. The backlash included protests, defacing and knocking down new speed limit signs, and a petition signed by nearly half a million people opposing the policy – the largest in the Senedd’s history.Phil Jones, a chartered engineer and transport planning expert who chaired the Welsh government taskforce on establishing the 20mph default, said the policy was working “exactly as intended”.“There’s nothing preventing local authorities from putting the limit back up. We reviewed practices in other places, journey times, economic impact; none of this should be a surprise,” he said.“Say all the roads go back up and casualties go up again too. What is an acceptable death toll that justifies getting to work two minutes faster? That’s what people who want to get rid of it need to answer.”More than 130,000 drivers – or 34% of people with licences inWales– have been caught breaking the lower limit since it was introduced, while the most recent YouGov polling, from a year ago, found seven in 10 people opposed the 20mph default.The Welsh Conservatives have consistently called for the law to be scrapped over what the party says is the confusion and frustration it causes for drivers.Sam Rowlands, the shadow cabinet secretary for transport, said: “It’s a hard balance to strike but as a country we’ve been doing this risk assessment for decades, and we landed on 30mph. It’s a huge waste of taxpayer money.”Ken Skates, who took over as transport cabinet secretary in March 2024, was quickly forced into a partial climbdown, giving councils £5m to reassess local speed limits over what he described as “consistent” concerns.Last month, Wrexham began changing 52 roads back to 30mph. Newport council has named 14 roads where the speed limit will go up again, while in Blaneau Gwent one road has changed back, and in Ceredigion no changes are planned.Explore more on these topicsWelsh politicsTransport policyWalesTransportRoad transportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Turkish media said police had launched an investigation.Latchman’s body has since been flown to the UK. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British man who died in Turkey and are in contact with the local authorities.”Until last December, Latchman, originally from Bridgend in south Wales, had been the assistant headteacher at Goldington academy in Bedford, where he was also head of computer science, according to hisLinkedIn profile.His online posts suggest he regularly ran and worked out at gyms.Latchman’s family and friends paid tribute to him on social media. Yashley Latchman posted a photograph of him working out with Martyn with the caption “Rest in Peace my brother”. He wrote: “You will forever be my source of inspiration and motivation. Thanks for everything. Will miss u loads.”Alain Latchman commented: “Yes Yashley very sad. Too young.”Dr Cinik’s website claims it has conducted more than 50,000 successful transplants. Its best known clients are international footballers. As well as Ferdinand, other former patients include the Croatian World Cup finalist Ivan Rakitić, the former France and Liverpool striker Djibril Cissé and the Brazilian World Cup winner Rivaldo.In a statement, the clinic said it was “deeply saddened” by Latchman’s death.It said he had a successful hair transplant last summer and had returned this year for a second procedure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The cast included Gary Sandy, Tim Reid, Howard Hesseman, Frank Bonner and Jan Smithers, alongside Anderson as the sexy and smart Jennifer Marlowe.As the station’s receptionist, the blond and high-heeled Jennifer used her sex appeal to deflect unwanted business calls for her boss, Mr Carlson. Her efficiency often kept the station running in the face of others’ incompetence.The role earned Anderson two Emmy award nominations and three Golden Globe nominations.Anderson starred on the big screen alongsideBurt Reynoldsin the 1983 comedy Stroker Ace and the two later married and became tabloid fixtures before divorcing in 1994.Anderson wrote a 1995 autobiography, My Life in High Heels, which she said was about “the growth of a woman, a woman who survives. It’s about my childhood, the death of my parents, my career, my divorces, and my children. Then of course, the trauma of my marriage to Burt.”“I think if you’re going to write about yourself, you have to do it warts and all,” Anderson told the Associated Press. “You may not even tell the nicest things about yourself, because you’re telling the truth.”Anderson is survived by her husband Bob Flick, daughter Deidra and son-in law Charlie Hoffman, son Quinton Anderson Reynolds, grandchildren McKenzie and Megan Hoffman, stepson Adam Flick and his wife Helene, and step-grandchildren Felix and Maximilian.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesCaliforniaTelevisionWest CoastBurt ReynoldsnewsShareReuse this content"

While improved cooperation between the army and air force has aided the fight, analysts say, airstrikes have also killed hundreds of civilians over the years.Bandits, who are primarily motivated by money, have also increased their cooperation with Nigeria’s jihadist groups, who are waging a separate, 16-year armed insurrection in the north-east.The recent emergence of the Lakurawa jihadist group in the north-west has worsened violence in the region.Governments of affected states have been forced to recruit anti-jihadist militias fighting the militants in the north-east to assist in countering the bandits.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They were actually people inNorth Korea.Chapman was participating in the North Korean government’s scheme to deploy thousands of “highly skilled IT workers” by stealing identities to make it look like they were in the US or other countries. They have collected millions of dollars to boost the government’s nuclear weapons development, according to theUS justice departmentand court records.Chapman’s bizarre story – which culminated in an eight-year prison sentence – is a curious mix of geopolitics, international crime and one woman’s tragic tale of isolation and working from home in a gig-dominated economy where increasingly everything happens through a computer screen and it is harder to tell fact from fiction.The secret North Korean workers, according to the federal government and cybersecurity experts, not only help the US’s adversary – a dictatorship which has beenhobbled by international sanctionsover its weapons program – but also harm US citizens by stealing their identities and potentially hurt domestic companies by “enabling malicious cyber intrusions” into their networks.“Once Covid hit and everybody really went virtual, a lot of the tech jobs never went back to the office,” said Benjamin Racenberg, a senior intelligence manager at Nisos, a cybersecurity firm.“Companies quickly realized: I can get good talent from anywhere. North Koreans and other employment fraudsters have realized that they can trick hiring systems to get jobs. I don’t think that we have done enough as a community to prevent this.”To run the schemes, the North Koreans need facilitators in the United States, because the companies “aren’t going to willingly send laptops to North Korea or even China”, said Adam Meyers, head of counter-adversary operations for CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm.“They find somebody that is also looking for a gig-economy job, and they say, ‘Hey, we are happy to get you $200 per laptop that you manage,’” said Meyers, whose team has published reports on the North Korean operation.Chapman grew up in an abusive home and drifted “between low-paying jobs and unstable housing”,according to documentssubmitted by her attorneys. In 2020, she was also taking care of her mother, who had been diagnosed with renal cancer.About six months after the LinkedIn message, Chapman started running what law enforcement officials describe as “laptop farms”.In addition to hosting computers, she helped the North Koreans pose as US citizens by validating stolen identity information; sent some laptops abroad; logged into the computers so that the foreign workers could connect remotely; and received paychecks and transferred the money to the workers, according to court documents.Meanwhile, the North Koreans created fictitious personas and online profiles to match the job requirements for remote IT worker positions. They often got the jobs through staffing agencies.In one case, a “top-five national television network and media company” headquartered in New York hired one of the North Koreans as a video-streaming engineer.The person posing as “Daniel B” asked Chapman to join a Microsoft Teams meeting with the employer so that the co-conspirator could also join. The indictment does not list victims’ full names.“I just typed in the name Daniel,” Chapman told the person in North Korea, according to court records of an online conversation. “If they ask WHY you are using two devices, just say the microphone on your laptop doesn’t work right.”“OK,” the foreign actor responded.“Most IT people are fine with that explanation,” Chapman replied.Chapman was aware that her actions were illegal.“I hope you guys can find other people to do your physical I-9s. These are federal documents. I will SEND them for you, but have someone else do the paperwork. I can go to FEDERAL PRISON for falsifying federal documents,” Chapman wrote to a group of her co-conspirators.Chapman was also active on social media. In a video posted in June 2023, she talked about having breakfast on the go because she was so busy, and her clients were “going crazy!”,Wired reported.Behind Chapman were racks with at least a dozen open laptops with sticky notes. In October 2023, federal investigators raided her home and found 90 laptops. In February this year, she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments.Over the three years that Chapman worked with the North Koreans, some of the employees received hundreds of thousands of dollars from a single company. In total, the scheme generated $17m for Chapman and the North Korean government.The fraudsters also stole the identities of 68 people, who then also had false tax liabilities, according to the justice department.In a letter to the court before her sentencing, Chapman thanked the FBI for arresting her because she had been “trying to get away from the guys that I was working with for awhile [sic] and I wasn’t really sure how to do it”.“The area where we lived didn’t provide for a lot of job opportunities that fit what I needed,” Chapman wrote. “To the people who were harmed, I send my sincerest apologies. I am not someone who seeks to harm anyone, so knowing that I was a part of a company that set out to harm people is devastating to me.”Last week, US district court judge Randolph Moss sentenced Chapman to more than eight years in prison; to forfeit $284,000 that was to be paid to the North Koreans, and to pay a fine of $176,000.Chapman and her co-conspirators were not the only ones conducting such fraud. In January, the federal government also charged two people in North Korea, a Mexican citizen and two US citizens for a scheme that helped North Korean IT workers land jobs with at least 64 US companies and generated at least $866,000 in revenue, according to thejustice department.Racenberg, of Nisos, said he expected cybercriminals to use artificial intelligence to “get better and better” at performing such schemes.Companies should conduct “open-source research” on applicants because oftentimes the fraudsters reuse résumé content, Racenberg said.“If you put the first few lines of the résumé in, you might find two, three other résumés online that are exactly the same with these very similar companies or similar dates,” Racenberg added. “That should raise some flags.”During an interview, if there is background noise that sounds like a call center or if the applicant refuses to remove a fake or blurred background, that could also be cause for concern, Meyers, of CrowdStrike, said.And companies should ask new hires to visit the office to pick up their laptop rather than mail it to them because that allows the company to see if the person who shows up is the same one you interviewed, Racenberg said.Five years after the pandemic, more companies have also started to require employees toreturn to the officeat least part time. If all corporations did that, would it eliminate the threat?“It’s going to prevent all of this from happening, yes,” Racenberg said. “But are we going to go back to that? Probably not.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsCybercrimeNorth KoreaInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Another significant development was his 2020 book revealingthe story of his childhood sexual abuseby his father. In his new show, Think Ahead, Davies addresses that on stage – and demonstrates, with reference to his laboured breathing, that he is experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder while doing so.That can’t be anything other than a compelling stage moment, to see a “people-pleasing comedian” (his words) of 30 years’ standing open up – and so rawly – about a difficult subject unaddressed in his comedy until now. Davies does so with honesty and a lightness of touch. He acknowledges that it’s an awkward topic for mirth, and makes good choices about when to set the jokes aside and when to find the funny. The funny? This was a dad who made colour copies of his child sexual abuse images on the household printer (“How many trips to Rymans?!”) and whose diary, when unearthed by Davies years later, focused exclusively on golf.Davies’s abuse is not the main focus of Think Ahead, far from it, and the remainder delivers one big-laughs set-piece after another. There is material about his youngest son, now nine, and some choice ranting in Alf Garnett-alike character as a man apoplectic about Ulez. There’s also plenty of blue humour, of a type that couldn’t fail to tickle a crowd, but which Davies elevates with his vivid image-making – of the sexual position you should adopt in the event of Viagra-induced heart attack, say, or of his experience delivering a poo sample for cancer screening.Just Ignore Him by Alan Davies review – a life derailed by abuseRead moreHow do these very disparate routines fit together? You could argue that the childhood abuse material is dissonant with the broad sex comedy elsewhere. It also underpins it somehow, offsetting with shade the light of Davies’s default people-pleasing superficiality, making the laughs wilder because they are harder won. The upshot is a striking new show, a cross-section of the 59-year-old’s life now that reveals parts his previous shows couldn’t reach.AtOrchard at Gilded Balloon, Edinburgh, until 10 August.All ourEdinburgh festival reviews.TheNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

They would march and hold up signs, put up billboards, and make buttons and coffee mugs, the paraphernalia all asking the question left unanswered to this day: “Who killed these girls?” This being Austin, local artists even came up with a song: We Will Not Forget.“Americans, the way we deal with grief,” observes Barbara Ayres-Wilson, the mother to two of the victims, “we had to make a marketing opportunity out of everything.”Ayres-Wilson makes those comments in old footage appearing in The Yogurt Shop Murders, somehow seeing the big picture irony from a distance, while still in the throes of her anguish. Margaret Brown’s four-part docuseries largely follows her lead.‘There’s New Orleans before and after’: revisiting Hurricane Katrina in a new docuseriesRead moreThe Yogurt Shop Murders is as intensive and emotionally gutting as the true crime genre gets, especially as it leads with the trauma suffered by the victims, their families and others orbiting too close to the tragedy. But the series also regularly steps back, observing the cultural ironies and phenomena wrapped up in this case, and taking a measure of its broader implications, not just when it comes to the flaws in a justice system that can coerce false confessions – creating a whole other subset of victims – but also the very nature of true crime storytelling that The Yogurt Shop Murders participates in.Brown essentially made a layered and complex true crime masterpiece, largely by approaching the subject with so much resistance to what that genre typically entails – for instance, the voyeurism and near predatory fixation on the upsetting details.“I wasn’t really interested in this because of the true crime-iness of it,” says Brown on a Zoom call with the Guardian, thinking back on her initial response to the project when it was brought to her by executive producers Dave McCary and his Oscar-winning wife,Emma Stone. Brown, the empathetic film-maker who took a “community first” approach to her celebrated documentary about the slave ship Clotilda,Descendant, says she was nevertheless drawn to this story because it literally hits close to home.“It’s part of the fabric of this city,” says the Austin-based film-maker (originally from Mobile, Alabama, where Descendant takes place). The victims – 17-year-olds Eliza Thomas and Jennifer Harbison; the latter’s 15-year-old sister, Sarah, and her 13-year-old friend Amy Ayers – were just a few years younger than Brown at the time of their murder. She has friends who went to school with the girls, knew them, or was on the cheerleading team with them. The tragedy looms large in her circles.She also saw a way into the story when observing the archival footage and observed what she describes as aDavid Lynchvibe. “It was like the same hair from Twin Peaks,” Brown explains. “You could see a version of what the film could be immediately from the counterculture in Austin back then, when [Richard Linklater’s]Slackercame out … I was like: ‘Oh, I could make a David Lynch movie that’s a documentary.’”Lynch has always been obsessed with the darkness lurking beneath pleasant surfaces, and the dividing lines within a locale (whether it’sBlue Velvet’s Lumberton, North Carolina, orMulholland Drive, flanked by Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley). In his films, people living in alternate worlds violently collide.So Lynchian makes a fitting adjective for this case, considering how horror erupts in a frozen yogurt parlor, ripping through the innocence in what was a popular hangout spot for teens; or the way outsiders, specifically goth types and those who would hang out in Austin’s hidden crevices, were rounded up as suspects, exposing the social and class divisions permeating throughout the city; and the general cultural milieu of early-90s Austin, where, as Brown says, the “country guys and the counterculture people” co-exist.“Austin has always been this place where there’s a college town, but it’s also like a cowboy place,” says Brown, lumping both sides together as the Willie Nelson audience. “They all go see Willie.”But Brown’s approach to the material quickly shifted after the first interview with the victims’ families left her feeling gutted.“I felt it so deeply, their pain,” she says. “Sean [Amy Ayers’s older brother] was so worried about his memory of his sister fading. I remember that made such an impact. It was so heartbreaking the way he talked about how he couldn’t feel her anymore because these images were leaving his mind; her voice and everything. You just feel this family. I just was like: ‘OK, well, I cannot fuck this up.’“I knew I couldn’t just make this stylized, slick thing … I got more interested in how people deal with loss. That’s the universal thing that everyone can relate to. Also, the story was so dark. I think to really live in the darkness of it, I needed some kind of redemption to just get me through.”Throughout the conversations in The Yogurt Shop Murders, a complex and fascinating thread around storytelling emerges, exploring both the healing and harmful functions of constructing a narrative when coping with such trauma. It begins with Ayres-Wilson, who on the night of the murders, doesn’t fully process the weight of her emotions until she has to tell loved ones what happened. Over the years, the victims’ families continue speaking to the media and the community as a way to hold on to the girls’ memories, while also pursuing justice.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: HBOEliza Thomas’s younger sister Sonora – who, as Brown explains, went through life feeling isolated because people can be wary about approaching her with the tragedy always looming – even offers an unexpected validation for the very true crime genre the film-maker was resisting. “This strange genre of crimes shows doesn’t just provide fodder for the curious,” Thomas tells Brown on camera. “It also provides an outlet for victims to tell a story that no one else wants to hear.”Brown proposes another rationale for true crime, pointing out that the genre’s audience is largely woman, some perhaps processing their own fears. “For some people,” she says, “it’s like: ‘Can I figure it out?’ But I think, for women, there’s something more primal about it.“You see in the series, there’s all these other ways [storytelling is] exploitative too. I was curious about the wholeness of that. It’s not just one thing.”As yet another dimension to the storytelling around the case, Brown mentions the detectives who were diagnosed with PTSD after fruitlessly attempting to construct the narrative surrounding the crime scene for years; and Claire Huie, a once aspiring film-maker who made a pass at building a documentary around this story over a decade ago, the severity of it making her walk away from both the film and her career aspirations. So much of Huie’s abandoned footage appears in The Yogurt Shop Murders, including interviews with the families, the detectives and Robert Springsteen, one of the men who sat on death row for the crime.‘It became a game to people’: how online sleuths grew obsessed with the Idaho murdersRead moreSpringsteen, who did not take part in Brown’s series, was convicted based on a confession that did not hold up on appeal. When it comes to this case, aggressive interrogator tactics led to multiple false confessions.In The Yogurt Shop Murders, Brown and her editor, Michael Bloch, go full surrealist Lynch when revisiting intense and nightmarish interrogation scenes, where officers constructed narratives for suspects to fill in the gaps. In a series where we see victim families use storytelling to hold onto their memories, these scenes – exposing memory’s elusive, fragile and misleading nature – stand apart in chilling and unsettling contrast.“You can’t make a show like this and not think about how your own memories about things are shifting,” says Brown. “I can have a memory and think: ‘Well, is that real? Did that really happen? Do I want that to be real?’“I always am interested in complexity, how something can be positive in one way, and, another way, it can have a dark edge. Memory is a perfect example. It can be used as a trap and also a salve.”The Yogurt Shop Murders starts on 3 August on HBO and will be available to stream on Max with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryFactual TVTelevisionTexasAustinUS crimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a slower third episode, war hero and surgeon Dorrigo recalls intense feelings of guilt and failure not just about being unable to save the lives of fellow prisoners of war, but also concerning the affair he had with his uncle’s wife.HRFilm choiceThe Room Next Door, 7.35am, 10.10pm, Sky Cinema PremiereView image in fullscreen‘Divisive’ … The Room Next Door on Sky Cinema Premiere.Photograph: O El Deseo/PAPedro Almodóvar’s latest divided the critics at last year’s Venice film festival – though not the jury, who awarded it the Golden Lion. Some felt his first English-language feature awkwardly transplanted his Hispanic melodrama to a Manhattan setting, in which terminally ill war photographer Martha (Tilda Swinton) reaches out to her old friend, bestselling author Ingrid (Juliette Moore). Others reckoned it was just as lush and seductive as ever, a third entry after Pain and Glory and Parallel Mothers in a death-preoccupied run of work.

Recalcitrant lad Michael (voiced by Aaron McGregor) is bugging his parents on their sailing trip – but once washed ashore with his dog, learns his place in the scheme of nature courtesy of the enigmatic Kensuke (Ken Watanabe).

Deemed too violent to be shown on TV as originally planned, its unvarnished mayhem and brisk direction looked ahead to the gritty urban crime epics of the coming decade.PHExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If that sounds too weighty a theme for a night out at the fringe, well, Howlett, who also directs, has planned ahead and built a fluid, ever-shifting production that spins her ideas with a dazzling lightness of touch.This is pure ensemble theatre: you cannot put a match between Sophie Kean, Abby McCann, Anna Marks Pryce and Gemma Barnett as they weave five historical stories as a tight unit, breathing as one.Supported by a residency by theHugo Burge Foundationand written with Summerhall’s Anatomy lecture theatre in mind, Howlett’s production forTheatreGooseexploits the academic setting by turning the audience into students (pens and whiteboards in hand) and the actors into public speakers, using an overhead projector to put them in the spotlight (neat lighting design by Ed Saunders).View image in fullscreenEmbracing existential fear … Aether.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianTwo of the stories are unexpected; not the one about Hypatia, the ancient Egyptian mathematician and astronomer who was murdered by angry Christians; nor the one aboutVera Rubinfinding evidence of dark matter in the 20th century; and not the modern-day tale about Sophie, a PhD student drawing on data from Cern in the hope of breaking new ground, while her obsessiveness drives her girlfriend away.More surprising are those of Adelaide Herrmann, famed for performing the bullet-catch magic trick in her vaudeville show; and of Florence Cook, a 15-year-old medium, hoodwinking a credulous scientific establishment with her messages from beyond. Howlett is intrigued by fiction as well as fact.Juxtaposed and intercutting, these stories form a collage of truth and illusion, one that embraces the existential fear of always having more to learn about an evasive universe. As concerns go, it is on the esoteric side, but Aether is never less than accomplished.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalSummerhallreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Usher Hall organ, Indian harmonium, Tibetan temple horn and percussionists from the Royal Scottish National Orchestra were fellow travellers on that journey, the latter joined by horn, brass and timpani colleagues for the work’s climactic eighth cycle.Those sections recycle the same textual material so that a work that initially seemed fragmentary made compelling, if relentless, sense by the time the audience reached the first 10-minute snack-and-comfort break after a couple of hours.View image in fullscreenDelivering the words of Christ … bass-baritone Florian Störtz.Photograph: © Andrew Perry/Edinburgh International FestivalEach cycle began with a promenading soprano soloist and duduk eastern reed instrument obbligato, the most appealing choral music set The Lord’s Prayer, adding a line or two of text to each succeeding incarnation and most melodically expressed in English, although alternately sung in the work’s other languages, including Greek, Aramaic and Sanskrit.Many of the recitatives, by contrast, were delivered on one note, and it was a testament to the expressive talents of soloists including bass-baritone Florian Störtz, delivering the Gospel words of Christ, and tenor Hugo Hymas, that they made those sections, often 15 minutes long, so powerful.For all the quality of the step-out soloists from the Monteverdi Choir and the Festival Chorus, it was the vocal ensemble, using the three choirs in different combinations, that provided the work’s highlights, and where the National Youth Choir of Scotland especially shone, particularly in the sustained high soprano singing.The first of this festival’s concerts with beanbag seating in the stalls, the staging by Thomas Guthrie – frontman of the 2024 programme’s The Alehouse Sessions in the same space – used the entire building brilliantly for Tavener’s ritual epic.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalFestivalslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

As will you be, if you can nab a ticket. Part of the thrill of this intoxicating slice of occultism, designed for one blindfolded audience member at a time, is your lack of knowledge going into it. No one is allowed to go twice.What takes place is a summoning, a ritual both dark and deeply sentimental. Through gentle, probing conversation, creatorYannick Trapman-O’Briendemands to know what you desire, and what you are willing to sacrifice to get it. As he leaps and twirls around your mind, his dexterous chatter is confronting, charming and sharp as a pinprick.The simple structure, framed around ideas of traditional witchcraft, guides you in a way that responds specifically to your comfort levels and the depths you are willing to dive to. Requested topics can be off limits, but ideally you’ll be OK with blood. The show’s inebriating effect is akin to the intense focus of someone drawing your portrait, or reading your tarot, or giving you therapy. It is a magic trick of sorts, lulling you into openness. With the blindfold disarming my senses and a crackling candle by my ear, a vertigo effect makes the voice I hear simultaneously distant and close enough to touch. My hands start to feel heavy and I hear myself saying things I didn’t plan to share.Paldem review – Industry’s David Jonsson brings the sexual tension in OnlyFans dramaRead moreThe final 10 minutes offer a gift of a different kind, with a glimpse into the thinking of the participants who have gone before. Seeing how others responded to the same prompts is revealing about both parties; there are so many conversations here that I would have liked to press my ear to the wall to catch.With delicious playfulness and an underlying earnestness, Undersigned encourages indulgence and challenges your moral makeup. Through its supernatural proclivities and Trapman-O’Brien’s balletic conversation, the show sends you back out into the world looking at it a little more rosily.

But although he scrapped his own programmatic explanations, the sense of epic trajectory has clung on. Like Beethoven’s Ninth, the symphony’s finale features a chorus and soloists as well as vast orchestral forces in a shattering, cosmic-scale climax.No surprise, then, that the ending ofthe Hallé’s first Proms appearance with their new principal conductor,Kahchun Wong, was utterly gripping: the breathtakingly elemental chords of its opening; offstage horns slicing laser-like through the air; climaxes snatched away to leave tiny, muttering details; the nightmarish outbreak of brass and percussion from the gallery. Conducting without a score, Wong maintained ultraprecise coordination across the cavernous Royal Albert Hall. A full hour into the performance, the nose-to-tail Prommers stood as if transfixed, even before the Hallé Choir and Hallé Youth Choir entered with their first unaccompanied passage – minutely blended and astonishingly quiet. In the symphony’s final minutes, with an organ pedal that vibrated through the floor, catastrophically powerful lower brass and bells pealing from the gallery, Wong ditched his baton and manoeuvred his supersized forces with tremendous, muscular arm sweeps, as if single-handedly hauling an ocean liner into dock. Many sprang to their feet with the final chord still ringing.What made that finale so powerful, however, was Wong’s commitment to the long game. A big baton-flick upwards at the start launched energetic scrubbing from the upper strings – but Mahler’s strange, frantic motif for the cellos and basses was earthy rather than ferocious and Wong returned to a baseline of pianissimo, gossamer tone (polished rather than characterful) at every opportunity. The second movement was a strictly genteel, sugar-coated account of Mahler’s Ländler. Only in the third did something more vivid begin to take hold: sinewy woodwind solos, snarling stopped horns, the big, slow bloom of two gongs. The subsequent orchestral song featuringEmily D’Angelo’s creamy mezzo felt oddly underpowered, as if Wong was pulling back still further with the finale in mind. But the refinement of Wong’s approach also persisted, beguilingly, into the fifth, providing lightness and limpidity for each of Mahler’s deep shadows.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

It captures them at it and she (Natasha Cowley) likes the outcome. “We’re hot,” she says to him (Michael Workeye), watching back the footage. So their pornographic OnlyFans account is born, providing homemade sex videos and an income stream.Written byDavid Jonsson, an actor and Bafta Rising Star who has appeared in Industry andRye Lane, this debut is one of the most anticipated offerings of the fringe.Directed by Zi Alikhan, who has also worked on Industry, it is an adventurous setup but its central sexual drama does not quite come off. Part of the problem is that it is handled too gingerly rather than fully penetrated, as it were. So it is too restrained, its drama and ideas not fully realised.The dialogue is vibrant but unnatural as the couple repartee in witty one-liners. There are growing tensions in their relationship but you do not access its emotional complexity – need, desire, resentment, maybe even love.View image in fullscreenCircles of desire … Paldem.Photograph: Giulia FerrandoThere is not enough context either and too much is left unspoken: Kevin is a photographer but beyond that we learn little about him, and even less about Megan. The OnlyFans storyline in itself has potential but goes nowhere.The set looks like a living room cum photographic studio, with a screen on which videoed images are projected. There is a strange kind of sterility when the sex scenes are enacted. It is maybe an encapsulation of the awkwardness of homemade pornography. Still, we are told that this couple has great sex yet there are few fireworks between them.Undersigned review – put on a blindfold and reveal your desires in intimate one-to-oneRead moreThings become more amusing when another couple joins the fray but this also flips the tone into satire, so it seems. There are a few other illuminating glimmers: Kevin says he enjoys watching Megan watching him enjoying himself on screen (“circles of desire”). It is a good observation.But not enough is carried through. Racial tensions between the couple come flooding in at the end, too late and truncated. There is great potential here nonetheless. If this play could find a better focus, it might just have something.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalTheatreFestivalsSummerhallDavid JonssonComedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

After a long-term disease, I had my inner ear removed, and then lost my job due toincapacity. I have hearing in one ear, am waiting for an implant and wear aids, which help.I feltlost for a few years, but I got fit and slowly regrouped, and ended up doing an apprenticeship.Now it is coming to an end,I am worried about applying for jobs, having to prove myself again against healthy people half my age. SometimesI wake in the night panicking. I want to cry most of the time. I just want someone to say it will beOK and help me. But I’m not sure who to ask. My biggest fear is putting strain on my wife and kids again.I can’t drive due to the illness and operation,so I am already at a loss as to which jobs I can apply for.After being ill for so long I lost a lot of friends, who just didn’t get it. I think the new situation is triggering a lot of that hurt.Facing a long-term disease and loss of hearing is tough. You have already really helped yourself.I went to emergency planner Prof Lucy Easthope, and the RNID, the national charity supporting people who are deaf or have hearing loss or tinnitus (which is one in three adults in the UK).Easthope has written a book you may find helpful calledCome What May: Life-Changing Lessons for Coping with Crisis. The first thing she said was: “Bloody well done. We often need to hear that, but no one says it. You’ve been incredibly brave doing the apprenticeship.”Is there someone you can talk to? I’m sure your wife would welcome you letting her in, but if not, a good friend or a family member?She felt you were using “pessimism as protection, which can actually be really helpful as long as it doesn’t sabotage, because you have to be ready for things to not go entirely right. And there are reasons things might not go right that shouldn’t be linked to your self-esteem.” She gave the example of people after adversity “going for total reinvention and not being realistic, like going for jobs they can’t do and maybe could never do. If the job isn’t right for you, then you probably won’t get it.” She also felt that: “What you are going through is bigger than what happens next; the dreams you have had to give up on.” She suggested “speaking out loud the monsters that keep you awake at night so you can explore them”.Who previously made things OK for you? Is there someone you can talk to? I’m sure your wife would welcome you letting her in, but if not, a good friend or a family member? I’m sorry your friends didn’t get it. Lots of people don’t, but often it’s not ill intent, just ignorance (and laziness to not find out what you need).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It also sounds like you are a bit afraid of letting others in, but talking about things is how we process. No one can say this is going to be 100% OK, but slowly you may realise that there will be OK-ness, joy and hope. You can cry if you need to.The RNID recommended looking for employers who have signed up to theDisability Confident scheme. And added: “Remember that under the Equality Act 2010, employers have a legal duty to support individuals, including those who are deaf or have hearing loss.” The RNID has lots more info, and the charityHearing Link Servicesoffers peer support sessions.Easthope said that you might imagine younger people without your issues wouldn’t be afraid but, trust us, they are.

This results in a call back to discuss investment options. That the interest rate is only slightly better than the market makes the offer appear plausible.The caller guides people to open a real Wise account under the pretence that it is a savings account. To maintain the facade, victims receive correspondence carrying the Wise logo and correct postal address.Martin Richardson at National Fraud Helpline, a law firm that specialises in scam recovery cases, describes it as “one of the most sophisticated and convincing scams we have seen”.He says: “Once they have your details, they will instantly recognise your phone number and ask you to pass security questions. The email address seems very believable, but it’s the English-speaking scammers that add a high level of plausibility.“We think that when the scammers help set up the victim’s genuine Wise account, they put the two-factor authentication and virtual card details into their own phone.” Having used the victim’s details to set up Apple Pay, they then transfer the “savings” account money into Wise accounts under their control.‘Scamazon’ – how fake emails are targeting Prime subscribersRead moreWith the scammers “spending good money on social media adverts”, Richardson says it is highly likely that there are many victims.What the scam looks likeIn this case, the fake ad is offering 5.55% on a one-year easy-access savings account, or 5.85% with no withdrawals in the 12-month period.The advert, and all subsequent communication, use the Wise logo and the correct postal address. However, although Wise customers can put their balance in an interest-earning fund, it does not offer classic savings products such as this.View image in fullscreenA fake Wise advert seen by one consumerWise says: “We’re aware of scams that use branding of financial services providers to deceive people into thinking they are holding, or investing, their money.“Whenever we come across fraudulent attempts to impersonate Wise, including on social media platforms, we take prompt action to get the content removed.”What to doThis is authorised push payment (APP) fraud, which involves tricking someone into voluntarily sending money from their bank account.Providing the money was sent to another UK account, victims should, in theory, be able to claim their money back from their bank, or payment service provider, thanks tomandatory rulesintroduced last year.You should contact Wise either by flagging the transaction or calling up (there areinstructionson its website) andfile a police report. You can also tell theFinancial Conduct Authority.Richardson says his law firm has helped two victims each get more than £20,000 back.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchConsumer affairsSavingsAdvertisingSavings ratesBanks and building societiesFintechfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our resident perfectionist finds out …Felicity CloakeSun 3 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 08.01 EDTShare“How many versions of fresh tomato sauce can there be?” Catherine, the generous winner of a charity auction to help me with the research for this column, asks when I tell her what recipe we’ll be making. On the contrary, I tell her, I’ve had my work cut out to narrow the selection here down to a mere seven, not least because the simpler the dish, the more argument there is over how it should be prepared, especially in a place as passionate about its food as Italy.Happily, I’ll have a lot of assistance, because Catherine has raised yet more money forHospitality Rides(a fundraising initiative for two very worthy industry charities,Only a Pavement Awayandthe Licensed Trade Charity), by selling tickets to get other people to do my job for me, effectively. In an attempt to sweeten the deal, I tell my assembled minions (all hospitality professionals, though none, sadly, Italian chefs) that,according to Emiko Davies, this raw sauce is “quite possibly the best way to enjoy really good, ripe summer tomatoes – as well as making the most of spending as little time in front of a hot stove as possible”. Then I make them chop an awful lot of tomatoes in the service of perfection.The tomatoesView image in fullscreenThe River Cafe’spomodoro crudouses ‘a mixture of plum and cherry tomatoes’. All thumbnail images by Felicity Cloake.Tomatoes are, in fact, a good place to begin, because, as the late, great cook and author Marcella Hazan writes inMarcella Cucina: “The tomato is the thing. There is hardly anything to the making of the sauce, which really consists just of assembling the ingredients and letting them go to work, but the tomatoes have to be ripe and tasty.” Lynne Rossetto Kasper, host of the long-runningSplendid Table podcast, agrees: “Exceptionally good tomatoes and olive oil you want to eat with a spoon are the only requirements for this recipe.”She recommends “a variety of tomatoes, if possible – the punchy little sweet 100s or sungolds, mellow beefsteaks and maybe one or two sweet yellow or orange ones”, a mixture that certainly looks pretty. Rowley Leighcounsels cherry tomatoes(“datterini, if possible”) inA Long and Messy Business, the River Cafe’sClassic Italian Cookbooka mixture of plum and cherry tomatoes, and the late restaurateurAlvaro Maccionisuggests mixing fresh and sun-dried fruit in his book Alvaro’s Mamma Toscana. While a range of colours pleases the eye, I’d advise going instead for whatever pleases the palate most; we have such a short window of really decent tomatoes in the UK that it’s important to select for flavour while you can. My preference is always for plums, if they look good. As I explain to the group while they good-humouredly set about seeding several kilos of fruit, there’s a reason these are the variety most often found in tins: they have a higher ratio of flesh to watery seeds than most, which means that, in practice, you get more for your buck. None of us, it turns out, is a fan of using the sun-dried variety in this dish, which, according to Annica, take away from the “purity of the dish”, but perhaps we’re not quite over the 1990s yet.However, while I hope that Hazan, Del Conte and all the other gods of Italian cookery will forgive me, I’m with Daniel Gritzer when hewrites on Serious Eatsthat “I’ve never eaten somepasta al pomodoro crudo, spat it out and angrily exclaimed: ‘Who, pray tell, left the skins and seeds on these tomatoes?’ The full tomato has never bothered me in apico de gallo, it’s never bothered me in bruschetta and it doesn’t bother me here. Frankly, there’s a lot of flavour in those seeds, and it’d be a shame to waste it.” So, by all means peel and seed, if you like, but personally I wouldn’t bother – ripe tomatoes are a pain to peel, and there’s a fair bit of wastage.(You may also, as in Davies’ alternative to her roughly chopped fruit, smash the tomatoes in a mortar, but I prefer a chunkier sauce here; also, if you go down that road, you will probably need to peel them, too.)The treatmentView image in fullscreenLynne Rossetto Kasper has ‘a trick for making pasta with raw tomato sauces taste lustier’ – read on to find out what.In the interest of keeping things simple, I bypass recipes such as the one in Lucio Galletto’s The Art ofPastathat are “quasi-cotto”, or lightly cooked, in favour of ones that are entirely raw. That said, Del Conte does put her sauce mixture in a moderate oven just while the pasta is boiling, I assume to warm it and perhaps to encourage the juices to run.Marinading rather than cooking is the name of the game here, as Hazan explains: “Although this sauce is completely raw, you might say that it cooks itself. It is a fine demonstration of the dynamic reaction that ingredients can have to each other, if you give them the chance.” Some happily quick and easy versions give them this chance just for the few minutes it takes to cook the pasta. The River Cafe recommends half an hour, Hazan a full hour. and Del Conte “at least two hours”, the latter adding that “it does not matter if you leave the sauce to marinate for longer”.If you don’t have half an hour, be reassured that such culinary authorities as Davies, Leigh and Rossetto Kasper don’t bother with this step at all, though my testers are struck by the richness of the River Cafe recipe: “The tomatoes have almost broken down to make a sauce,” Catherine observes. At least 30 minutes is ideal, though 15 is better than nothing, and two to three hours won’t hurt.It’s also worth bearing in mind a top tip from Rossetto Kasper, which I almost miss because it’s not included in her actual recipe: “I discovered a trick for making pasta with raw tomato sauces taste lustier. Slightly undercook the pasta. Drain it. Spoon the juices that raw sauces always throw off into the empty pasta pot. Set it over medium-low heat, add the pasta and toss until the juices are absorbed, then add the pasta to the sauce.” Very little extra work, and well worth it.The pasta“Only boxed factory-made dry pasta is a good match for this sauce,” Hazan instructs, “and spaghettini, thin spaghetti, is the most strongly recommended shape.” Nevertheless, good old spaghetti is the most common choice in the recipes I try, although the River Cafe’s ravioli is a hit with my testers, even though I choose one with an entirely unsuitable asparagus-based filling. Also popular is Maccioni’s linguine, which Catherine declares has “more about it than the spaghetti”, and the aforementioned spaghettini, which Anna and I enjoy for its springy, almost ramen-like consistency. (Rossetto Kasper’s alternative fusilli does not, according to Olivia, “look quite as classy … it’s a bit of a bully texture-wise, so the tomatoes get lost”.)View image in fullscreenEmiko Davies’s raw tomato sauce is vinegar-free.A common complaint as the dishes go around the table when we’re finally at the tasting stage is that some recipes are a bit mean on the tomato. Maccioni uses a mere four tomatoes for four people in contrast to Rossetto Kasper’s bountiful 1.35kg.Naturally loth to reduce the quantity of pasta, I’ve opted for a similarly generous serving of tomatoes, bearing in mind that this is a pasta dish and not a tomato salad (or, God forbid, apasta salad. Do Italians even eat pasta salad? Please let me know in the comments below).The extrasThis is where things really get interesting around the table. Good olive oil is, of course, a must, but the two best-rated recipes, from Hazan and the River Cafe, also contain red-wine vinegar – something I would invariably sprinkle on a fresh tomato salad. The appreciative noises (“almost restauranty”, someone says proudly) this elicits strongly suggest that it has to be part of my final recipe – though Claire, in particular, is a fan of the fresh simplicity of Davies’ vinegar-free version.View image in fullscreenMarcella Hazan adopts a ‘slightly more complex Ligurian take’ on this classic dish.Salt is also a must; a tomato is nothing without it, and there is a feeling that those in charge of Del Conte’s recipe (I name no names) have perhaps been a little parsimonious on that front: “I only said did it ask for seasoning?” Karina demands, laughing. Lesson learned; be generous with the salt, unless you fancy Hazan’sslightly more complex Ligurian takecomplete with black and green olives, capers and anchovies, in which case a little restraint might be wise. We all love these additions – “a really interesting mix of flavours and textures”, Claire observes – but I’ve left them as optional extras, because I do feel that in a pasta con pomodoro crudo the tomatoes should be the star attraction. (The same goes for Maccioni’s mozzarella, which, delicious as it is, makes some of us feel as if we’re eating an M&S pasta salad on a train.)Herb wise, basil is the most popular choice, and the clear favourite; Leigh’s mint, meanwhile, gets mixed reviews. No one can detect Hazan’s marjoram or parsley, and fennel seeds divide opinion; we all agree we love them in other dishes, but here, as Anna says, they overpower the tomato. Davies’ optional chilli flakes prove more of a crowdpleaser, but, again, they’re very much gilding the lily.Garlic, however, is another must, though the quantity is up to you. It’s not cooked, so I’ve been quite restrained, but you may prefer a punchier, fierier result.The toppingsView image in fullscreenRowley Leigh finishes his dish with a ‘wonderful savoury, crunchy anchovy pangrattato’.“No cheese is necessary with this sauce,” Del Conte says sternly in her brilliant collectionOn Pasta. Rossetto Kasper disagrees, and her salty pecorino gets many compliments – not least because, well, who doesn’t love cheese? That said, Leigh’s wonderful savoury, crunchy anchovy pangrattato, or crisp flavoured breadcrumbs, also have their fans – “these smell really good”, Victoria says happily. Though they’re certainly not foundational, I do like the contrast in texture, as well as the fact that they’re easily veganised (simply omit the anchovy for a fully plant-based dish).ServingThough this isn’t a pasta salad, I’m reliably informed that pasta con pomodoro crudo can be served warm or at room temperature – but “never chilled”, Rossetto Kasper counsels, as if the very idea of cold pasta wasn’t enough to warn you off in itself. This makes it an utterly brilliant dish for a summer evening: make ahead, enjoy yourself, then casually toss into bowls with a sprinkling of basil when it’s time to eat. The Italians know a thing or two about warm weather dining, it turns out.View image in fullscreen‘No cheese is necessary with this sauce,’ Anna Del Conte says sternly.Perfect fresh tomato pastaPrep15 minCook12 minSteep30 minServes4800g ripe but firm tomatoes, preferably, but not necessarily, plum2 tbsp red-wine vinegar¾ tbsp flaky salt, plus extra for cooking the pasta4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus 1 tbsp extra if making pangrattato2-3 plump garlic cloves, peeled4 tbsp dry breadcrumbs(optional)1 tinned anchovy fillet, drained (optional)400g spaghetti, or spaghettini1 small bunch fresh basilOptional extras60golives, black, green or a mixture, stoned and chopped1 tbsp capers(rinsed if packed in salt), chopped4 anchovy fillets(rinsed if packed in salt), chopped½ tsp chilli flakesCut the tomatoes into fairly small dice (this is much easier if you have a sharp knife) and put them and all their juices in a bowl with the vinegar, half the salt and all the oil.View image in fullscreenMash the garlic to a paste with the remaining salt, then stir that into the tomato bowl, too, along with any of the optional extras.View image in fullscreenLeave to sit for at least 30 minutes, though longer won’t hurt (but don’t leave it so long that it requires refrigeration).If making the pangrattato, put a tablespoon of oil in a small frying pan over a medium heat, then mash in the anchovy, if using, until dissolved.View image in fullscreenTurn up the heat, stir in the breadcrumbs and fry until crisp and golden.

It’s a market town with a nearbymodel village, while the “best things to do”sectionon TripAdvisor highlights the cemetery or a trip to the former residence of writer GK Chesterton. If all that fails to thrill, you could just go for lunch at the pub – although be aware thatthe Greyhoundisn’t anything as simple as a plain old gastropub. Heck no, that would be something completely different: more shabbily chic, more carbohydrates on the menu, fewer staff calling you “Madam” while you’re en route to the loo and not even a hint of white peach granita on your burrata starter.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Rather, this is a charming, pale-fronted pub in a grade II 17th-century former coaching inn that also boasts a decidedly fancy and swanky restaurant that steers well away from muddy wellies and sticky toffee pudding, and instead pitches its tent in the land of wood pigeon with white beetroot and lavender, Norfolk chicken pressé with pickled girolles and sweetcorn, andajo blancowith grapes, cantaloupe melon and nasturtium. And, to be fair, it might well not be for everyone. Gourmands, birthday treats and special occasions, perhaps, but picky children and Aunty Pam who just wants toad-in-the-hole might find the semi-formality a bit testing.View image in fullscreenThe Greyhound’s La Latteria burrata comes on a ‘green nasturtium pesto and topped with a sweet, peachy granita’.Over atthe Ritzin London, I note that they call this style of dining “an epicurean journey”, which is, I feel, modern shorthand forsmallyet significant portions of largely French-influenced gastronomy heaving with finesse, technique and accomplishment. Whether or not epicurean journeys are delicious is a moot point, however, because we are here to gasp spellbound at the chef’s imagination and to nod sagely as a surprise amuse-bouche of fresh peas and lovage is delivered in a teeny ramekin with an equally ickle spoon. That’s followed by an equally precise and inoffensive minuscule tartlet of fresh sweetcorn and whipped cream cheese.Decor-wise, and despite itsL’Enclumevibes, the Greyhound hasn’t gone fully stripped back with stone floors and crofter’s cottage chic, as so many other highfalutin country pubs have done, and prefers instead to complement its olde-worlde low beams and wooden floors with warm, cinnamon-coloured leather horseshoe banquettes, patterned wallpaper, bottle-green velour cocktail chairs and modern art on every wall. This may be an oligarch’s saloon bar teetering on the edge of chintz, but it’s still hugely cosy and welcoming. Daytrippers lured this way by the model village could not help but be seduced by its sheer quaintness.View image in fullscreenThe Greyhound’s ‘gorgeously crisp-skinned’ sea bass with ‘a silky spin on beurre blanc’.We ordered from the à la carte, rather than the six-plus course, £110-a-head tasting menu, and began with a pleasant bowl ofLa Latteria burratain a green nasturtium pesto and topped with a sweet, peachy granita. Hereford rump cap tartare looked like something out of a fairytale, and was served very roughly chopped and arranged like a bird’s nest around a miso confit egg, pickled shimeji mushrooms and some capers. A main of roast sea bass had a gorgeously crisp skin and came with a silky spin on beurre blanc and some rather al dente braised baby fennel. Another main of wood pigeon erred on the side of well done and was submerged in a rich cherry jus that resembled nothing so much as a crime scene.There’s some clever, cogent cooking going on at the Greyhound, with some hits, some misses, but an overall sense that, in a bid to be the best restaurant for miles around, they might just be missing the chance to be simply delicious. Still, diners all around us, celebrating birthdays and anniversaries, were having a lovely time of it, and the restaurant was ticking over very nicely, thank you, especially for a Tuesday evening.View image in fullscreen‘Now we’re talking’: the Greyhound’s blackcurrant tart topped with blackcurrant sorbet.It was only in the dessert list where a mood of pure decadence was allowed to let rip and flourish, because here we hadîlesflottanteswith limoncello custard and raspberry souffle with sarsaparilla sorbet. Beforehand, we had foxtrotted neatly and nimbly around the world of fine dining, but thank God we were now in the sugary and comparatively silly ante-room. We opted for the heavenly sounding blackcurrant tart, which turned out to be a fat, chunky, individual tart with a crisp, buttery casing loaded with berries and clotted cream, all infused with the sharp kick of lemon verbena to break through all the lactose richness; best of all, it was topped by a glorious blackcurrant sorbet. Now we were talking.On the tasting menu, I noticed that they serve Yoredale Wensleydale with homebaked fig loaf and chutneys, which sounds equally rustic and exquisite.

The earliest known holiday postcard, however, dates back to Roman times. The text, in full, reads: “Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres.Utinam hic esses.”EddieChorepostPeople certainly went on holiday during the Roman empire – actually travelling, not just nipping off to your villa on the coast for the summer, as many rich people did – because we’ve found the souvenirs. There are at least two“A present from Hadrian’s Wall” cups, decorated with names of major forts.SpoilheapSurferWell, the first to have a holiday was God – according to Genesis, that is. (Not sure which album, though.) If organised holidays are meant, for “hoi polloi”, not the grand tour aristos, then Thomas Cook arranged everything on 5 July 1841 for a group of temperance campaigners to travel the vast distance between Leicester and Loughborough to attend a rally. Apparently, refreshments were included: cakes, but no ale. For cakesandale, it was necessary to wait until Cook had changed his mind and started taking the great unwashed to Spain; things really started to take off in the 1960s.bricklayersoptionThe grand tour of European sites, as enjoyed by men of the upper classes as part of the general education, was popular between the 17th and 19th centuries. And I suppose there were pilgrimages and trips to spas before that.nina1414Pilgrimages were possibly the first holidays available to the middling classes. They were ostensibly journeys to venerate saints, but Chaucer gives a good idea of the jollity involved. Souvenir stamped metal badges have been found in the river in York, thrown into the water as an offering to Saint William.DoraMarrIt started with holy days. But there is also the idea of mix and match, for exampleDía de los Muertos(Day of the Dead) in Mexico.

I didn’t know anyone who did, so it never crossed my mind that I could.View image in fullscreen“Our ethos is to make sailing accessible to everyone,” explained Suzy Strowger, the company’s office manager. “Sailing has been perceived elitist, and has been largely male dominated. Our women’s weekends are about making sailing affordable and accessible to a demographic that’s under-represented at the moment.”Sailing is more than moving a boat, Suzy added: “It’s a wellbeing activity that can particularly benefit women.” She sees women with full-time caring roles or high-pressure jobs come along, looking to support their health and manage stress.Sailing has been perceived elitist, and has been largely male dominated. Our women’s weekends are about making sailing accessible to an under-represented demographicSuzy StrowgerThe weekend certainly got off to a stress-free start, as we met each other over prosecco and cake in the boatyard. There were 15 of us: some solos, some in pairs, mostly 45-plus, ranging in ability from competent to rusty to total beginner, and here for different reasons.For Katharine, it was about “having a new experience and getting away from life in general”. Jo was on her third Eastwood Whelpton trip: “I just enjoy the peace of getting out on the water.” Helen was drawn to the idea “because too often men take the helm – and there’s something special about adventuring with other women, isn’t there?”View image in fullscreenThe writer learning the ropes: ‘I took a turn at the helm, concentrating on not steering into the banks, boathouses or other yachts.’Photograph: Sarah BaxterThere clearly is. Women-only travel – particularly active travel – is on the rise, and companies are cottoning on. According to the Adventure Travel Trade Association’s 2024 Industry Outlook report, of the companies taking steps to diversify their target markets, 38% are targeting women; “women over 50 travelling solo” was flagged as a specific trend. Also, more larger tour operators are now offering women-only departures while specialist companies are seeing increased demand: for example, when WalkingWomen launched in 2021, it offered 31 female-only small-group hiking holidays; this year its programme features more than 70.An all-female environment tends to encourage women to push their limits, especially when the guides are women too. On this Norfolk weekend, our group was split across a flotilla of five boats, each one helmed by a female skipper – which is far more unusual than it should be in 2025. The skippers seemed as excited about that as we were.Jo and I were buddied up and allocated to Windsong, a traditional, 30ft (nine-metre) gaff-rigged yacht, crafted in the 1980s by a Norfolk boat builder, and an absolute beaut. It has sleek wooden insides, an ingenious pop-top and numerous drawers and cubbyholes (which Suzy had stuffed full of food). One of the first conversations Jo and I had was about who was most likely to pee in the night (she took the bed squeezed into the bow, next to the hand-pump loo; I slept in the main saloon). You have to bond quickly when living in close quarters.Els, our skipper, was commander-in-chief of the whole fleet. Before we hauled anchor, she unrolled a map and explained the plan for the weekend. First we’d motor the short distance to Thurne and moor up for the night; we’d spend Saturday sailing to Horsey, where a windpump (a windmill used to pump water) rises from coastal marshland once known as Devil’s Country; we’d sail back on Sunday. Mixed in would be boat breakfasts, picnic lunches and pub dinners, plus a few leisurely walks, some morning yoga, and an optional sea swim.Some women come on wellbeing weekends to refresh their skills, others to read books and drink ginI liked boat life immediately. We drifted down mazy channels, looked across the vastness of reeds, spotted herons, marsh harriers on the hunt, even an osprey – one of the pair thatarrived at nearby Ranworth Broadthis spring. It was a bit of a moving meditation, too. The speed limit never exceeds 6mph; sometimes it’s just 3mph. “Life today is so go, go, go,” Els reflected, steering us towards Thurne’s restored windmill. “We need to slow down sometimes.”Watching Els at work was part of the joy: she was calm, intuitive, in total symbiosis with the boat. It was tempting to let her get on with it, but she was keen for us to try, but only if we wanted to.I took a turn at the helm, concentrating on not steering into the banks, the boathouses, the other yachts or the regalblack-sailed Norfolk wherrythat glided by. I helped hoist the sails, lower the sails and hoist them again, learned about reefing and rudimentary knots, and assisted with bringing down the mast so we could just about scrape under Potter Heigham’s medieval bridge.Eastwood Whelpton runs official Royal Yachting Association sailing courses, but the wellbeing weekends are quite different. According to Suzy, some women come to refresh their skills, others to read books and drink gin.View image in fullscreenA grey heron above the reed beds of the Norfolk broads.Photograph: Geoff du Feu/AlamySpeaking of which, after a day on the water, cheeks ruddied by sun and wind, we moored at Horsey for “anchor drams” (cocktails), then took a walk over the marsh to the dunes. Some 3,245 grey seal pups were born here last winter. On the beach itself, a lone seal popped up from the grey-green surf to say hello.Three of us stripped to our swimmers to join it. It was chilly, choppy and frustratingly shallow, but made me realise that I never regret a sea dip. The biggest challenge was getting changed afterwards: the north wind blew away my towel and my dignity. But did it matter? We were, after all, all girls together here.We ended up in the Nelson Head, a proper old pub; a sign inside read “We don’t have wifi – talk to each other”. Which we did, sharing stories about how life has changed (or not) for women over recent years. The ladies spoke of having mothers who thought marriage and babies were all they could achieve, and of how their own daughters think they’re boring but don’t see the barriers they’ve broken down. Johanna threw in her graduation story: she came top of her (mostly male) class at London Business School but “when the chairman gave me my certificate and shook my hand, said, ‘I love to see a smiling blonde!’”That night, as the night before, I slept in dozes, lullabied by Windsong’s gurgles, slurps, creaks and groans. I woke early, and crept out into a chorus of blackbirds, redstarts, warblers and cuckoos. At 7.30am there would be a yoga session under a tree, but I wasn’t sure how much more relaxed it could make me. I hadn’t become a skilled sailor, but I had thoroughly enjoyed this maidens’ voyage.The trip was provided byEastwood Whelpton.

Meet the talented and ludicrously patient people putting hours into the internet’s most joyful (and pointless) clipsRichard GodwinSun 3 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 03.26 EDTShareFor much of the month of June 2023, David and Daniel Hulett sat in their parents’ basement in Virginia throwing five-cent coins in the air. First David would flip his nickel. Then Daniel would flip his nickel. They were trying to get the coins to land on their edge, an occurrence they knew was vanishingly improbable, but not impossible. This was their work.After three or four days, doubts began to set in. “When you’ve been doing it for so long, you’re like: the next onehasto be it!” says Daniel, 26, the elder and generally chirpier of the two. “You get really optimistic. And then it doesn’t happen and you feel like the world is ending. It’s almost physically painful. You get messed up.”The pair altered their grip. They tried different spins. They concluded perhaps a table tennis table wasn’t the best landing surface – too bouncy – so they tried wood, a bathroom tile, two types of granite. For David, 24, the repeated failures hit particularly hard. “I couldn’t sleep,” he says. “I would have dreams about flipping the nickel. You end up feeling like you’re in a simulation. Like, what is real any more? What even am I?”What David and Daniel are is professional trickshooters – better known to their 12.5 million followers acrossTikTok,Instagram,YouTubeandFacebookas theHulett Brothers. They are among the most successful purveyors of an art that has long since transcended its pool hall origins to become wildly popular on short-form video platforms. Trickshots consist of people pulling off amazing, improbable, pointless feats in the disputed borderlands between luck and skill. Or, as Daniel says, “We make up stupid games and try to beat them.”There are certain common trickshot tropes – ping-pong ball golfshots, full court basketballthrows, sliding iPhones across tabletops so they nestle perfectlyinto chargers– but the most successful performers have their own special niches. Mike Shields, AKAThat’ll Work, recent winner of the inauguralTrick Shot Championship, is a master of theWii toss, throwing discs directly into the thin mouth of a Nintendo Wii. Turkish trickshooter Gamze May, 32, AKA @gmzmy,has a nice line in oud tricks. In one she plays a little riff on the lower strings of the instrument, then launches a cigarette into her mouth from the upper strings. Very cool.Amanda Badertscher on America’s Got TalentThen there’s Amanda Badertscher, a PE teacher from smalltown Georgia, who was recently invited on toAmerica’s Got Talentafter a producer spotted her Instagram channel, @thetrickshotqueen, which mostly consists of her whacking basketballs into a net with a baseball bat from the other end of the court. And whatisher singular talent, I ask her? “If I had to narrow it down to one? I would say hitting crazy equipment with a baseball bat,” she tells me.The Hulett Brothers are the quintessentialall-rounders. They have kicked soccer balls into bins from 50 metres away; they have dropped pieces of paper from stepladders into the teeth of waitingshredders; they have thrown a plunger so it lands suction cup-down on a ping-pong table, then tossed a kitchen roll so it lands aboutthe plunger’s handle; and they are perhaps the best people in the world at throwing a red plastic cup so it stacks within another red plasticcup. What is consistent is their signature celebration: maniacal jumping, wild abandon and simultaneous cries of “LET’S GO!”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

Daniel made the winning toss. The coin flipped a couple of times, bounced, spun around and settled on its side on a piece of paper the brothers were now using as a landing surface. There is a split second of disbelief. Then scenes of primal, almost simian celebration as it dawns on them that they have finally done it. David looks like a man released from a cosmic burden.Trickshots have become a huge business. In the algorithmically segmented world of short-form video, these brief and #oddlysatisfyingclips of ordinary people accomplishing extraordinary things are one the closest things we have to a shared culture. The best of them transcend language, religion, culture, politics. They work as both sport and absurdist commentary on the futility of all human endeavour. Their appeal lies somewhere in the ratio between the laborious hours of toil that the trickshooters put in and the instant gratification they provide the viewer. They have wasted time, and now doth time waste us, to paraphrase Shakespeare’s Richard II.Dude Perfect, making it look easyThe unquestioned masters of the art areDude Perfect, five frat house roommates from Texas A&M University. Theirfirst viral videofrom 2009 consisted of one of their number, Tyler “The Beard” Toney, scoring a series of nonchalant no-look basketball shots in his back yard and, crucially,notreacting – as if it were just a thing that happened every time he attempted it. Indeed, in the best of their videos, nonchalance is the salient feature, as these genial friends toss sliders on to feet, bread into toasters, keys on to hooks, as if life really were that satisfying. It’s all in the editing. The troupe has now accumulated 17bn views, 60 million subscribers and enough cash to take their trickshots to insane extremes, including scoring a basket from the top of an 856-foot towerin Las Vegas. Earlier this year they announced they had received a $100m investment to createDude Perfect World, a “family friendly” entertainment resort complete with 330-foot trickshot tower.Their most serious rivals – the Buster Keatons to their Charlie Chaplins – are Australian troupeHow Ridiculous(14bn views, 23 million subscribers). The Perth-based trio have managed a mere540-foot basketball throw,albeit blindfolded, backwards, from the top of the Luzzone dam in Switzerland. Like Dude Perfect, they are evangelical Christians and regularly thank Jesus for their success. Theirwebsitequotes Psalm 115:1: “Not to us, LORD, not to us but to your name be the glory, because of your love and faithfulness.” Clearly, you need a lot of faith even to attempt to score a basket from the top of a dam – and nothing says thank you, Jesus, like dropping a bowling ball into somehelicopterblades.How Ridiculous’s Swiss basketball throwAs budgets increase, accusations of AI fakery and green-screen shenanigans are never too far away – indeed,trickshot debunking videosare almost a genre in themselves. Still, in the case of Dude Perfect, no credible evidence has ever emerged that the videos are faked, despite 15 years’ worth ofinternet sleuthing. Dude Perfect and How Ridiculous take pains to emphasise just how many failed attempts they make in their numerous behind-the-scenes videos; and in any case, is it really less effort to, say, render a convincing 3D digital model of a basketball flying across a court than it is to spend an afternoon patiently tossing one?Still, the more high-budget the trickshots become, the farther they move from their back-yard roots. I find I prefer the shorter, less professional videos, the ones that retain the palpable sense of idle tomfoolery, of happenstance glory. Once when we were at uni, my friend Martin abruptly flicked a spliff at me from five metres across a room and I somehow caught it in the corner of my mouth and began smoking it in one smooth motion. Everyone immediately applauded and pronounced me king. Alas, it was not caught on camera, or I may have ended up in a different career. But we all hopefully experience one such moment in our lives.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

People see me in the back yard and they figure, oh, I could do that in my yard!”This, it seems to me, is the basic stuff of the trickshot, the childhood instinct to play, to fiddle, to fool. “I started doing this kind of thing when I was really young,” says Jacob Grégoire, a 25-year-old from Quebec, who counts 1.8 million followers on Instagram as @jacob_acrobat. “Even when I was a small kid, I would do stuff like balancing my toothbrush on my nose. Maybe it’s ADHD or something. If I have something in my hand, I’ll throw it and catch it.”Then there is the flash of sporting inspiration, when you notice a particular move that is pleasing to do, and ask: can I make a game out of this?In my favourite children’s picture book – Russell Hoban’sHow Tom Beat Captain Najork and His Hired Sportsmen– the young hero Tom discovers the fooling around that so irritates his Aunt Fidget Wonkham-Strong in fact endows him with the precise range of skills required to triumph over his intended punishers. “Maybe that will teach you not to fool around with a boy who knows how to fool around,” Tom taunts the stricken Captain after defeating him at the made-up sports of womble, muck and sneedball. Many trickshooters have revelled in similar triumphs as they reveal to sceptical parents that their bottle-flipping and card-tossing actually brings in a decent income.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen‘Trickshots are like meditation’: Gamze May. Photographs: Kerem Uzel/The GuardianGamze May demonstrates her knife throwingTurkish trickshooter Gamze May says she got right on her parents’ nerves when she first started making trickshots during the Covid lockdowns, marooned at her family apartment in Istanbul. “I was bouncing ping-pong balls on pans and it was making an annoying sound. My mum and dad would get angry. But it was entertainment for me.” They are fully on board now – her two hours of trickshot work a day supplement her income as a digital marketer. But their initial scepticism reminded her of the sort of disdain she experienced as a girl who always wanted to play with the boys. “I was always running or playing football, basketball, every sport. I was playing console games. I still play console games. I would drive remote-control cars. My mum would be angry. Why are you playing with the boys?”Her answer then and now is simple: “It makes me happy. When I’m playing sport, I feel I am out of this world. It’s like meditation. I have no stress. I don’t think about problems. Maybe some people don’t understand me, but I don’t care when I’m making trickshot videos.”There is always the odd dissenter underneath the videos: a commenter calling out the trickshooter as a fraud or a fluke.Anyone could manage this if they did this forfive hours and 29 minutes.As is so often the case, the commenters miss the point.Mick Shields takes on 10 ordinary peopleFor one, the trickshooters hardly lack skill. Mike “That’ll Work” Shields recently challenged 10 people with “ordinary jobs” to best him ata series of trickshots, and prevailed in every single contest. Badertscher played college softball. May was the captain of the women’s football teamBakırköysporuntil she retired in January. “Sports people can learn these things a bit easier,” she says. “I spend lots of time practising and then I improve.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Over the hours of practice, you do become incrementally better at, say, tossing ping-pong balls so they play a tune on aseries of carefully arranged pans, or dropping paper from a stepladder into ashredder. It was David who had the crucial insight that a small crease across the paper will attenuate the curve of the parabola on its descent, resulting in a greater probability of it sailing into the waiting shredder. Just as Dick Fosbury’s flop at the 1968 Olympics changed the entire discipline of high-jumping, so a trickshooter can alter the history of their sport in a single afternoon.But the real skill is the sisyphean determination, the patience, the faith that in the end, it will happen. Because it will happen. As long as you don’t give up. “We were always super competitive,” David Hulett says. “Dan and I wanted to win whatever we were doing.” The trickshooter knows that they can make the sheer brute force of numbers crush the momentary fluctuations of skill. I am terrible at darts. But were I to throw tens of thousands of darts in the general direction of a dartboard, eventually, tearful with rage, starving, my entire family having abandoned me, I would score 180. All I would need to do is capture that one time on camera – then discard the 89,362 takes when I didn’t do it. In this way, anyone can be Lionel Messi for 15 seconds. The cameraphone has democratised sport.I believe I will do this, then it happens and I feel amazing. It’s like therapyStill, as every child knows, the thing that takes the time is not the playing – it is the tidying up. It’s a simple thing to sit there, throwing playing cards at a target. It’s a total pain picking up thousands of cards. And then there are the tech fails. Once, after three or four hours, Gamze May managed to throw a card across the room so that it curled into the hairline crack between two dice. Beautiful. Only when she went to retrieve the footage, she realised her phone storage was full and the video had stopped recording. This is the bane of her life, in fact. “My phone always has storage problems. It’s still full. I always need to clear it.”But these frustrations must be offset against the regular cadence of success that trickshooting provides. “When I’m making videos – how can I describe the situation? It’s like someone is whispering in my ear: you will do this. And I believe it and then it happens. I feel amazing. I feel like a bird. I’m flying. Maybe it seems silly to some people but it is like therapy for me.”Trickshot culture has started to infiltrate other forms of performance, too. Grégoire started out his career as aprofessional acrobat, performing with troupes includingCirque du Soleilbefore a series of injuries made him question whether there was really much future in it. “I have a herniated disc and a really bad knee. Acrobats have short careers.”So Grégoire has taken his performances to social media, which offers him more autonomy and a more reliable revenue stream. He isn’t sure what to call the hybrid form he purveys here. “I started out throwing a knife into an apple. I’m now throwing a knife into an onion that’s flying in the air and landing on a knife in mymouth. I’ve pushed it so far, I don’t even know what it is any more,” he says. But although he exhibits amazing physical prowess, he still considers his videos trickshots. “It’s a combination of skill and luck. I have to do them many times.”Former acrobat Jacob GrégoireHe sees this as a creative avenue opened up by social media; you couldn’t attemptthissort of thing on stage as it would take too many tries to get right and the audience would boo. On the other hand, the minuscule attention spans of TikTok and Instagram Reels force him to be more inventive than he’d have to be on stage. “People always wantmoreon social media. On stage, you can build up a story. People are patient. On social media it needs to be good right away. People get bored so easily. Everyone is just scrolling, scrolling, so it really pushes me to find the most attractive, best thingimmediately.”It is a double-win, algorithmically, if you can not only snare someone’s attention, but then get them to watch your 15-second video again. “I think that’s my strong point,” Grégoire says. “The tricks are sometimes so complicated, people rewatch them three or four times to understand them.”Indeed, some of the greatest trickshooters embrace the form’s inherent dadaist absurdity. Videos of ping-pong golf jostle for attention with images of death and devastation in Gaza and Ukraine, and maybe offer some mordant commentary on them – just as the artists of the originalCabaret Voltaireembraced surrealism, chaos and non-meaning at the height of the annihilation of the first world war.View image in fullscreen‘Sometimes my videos are so fantastical, people assume it’s AI’: Michael Rayner. Photographs: Maggie Shannon/The Guardian“You know, when I open my Instagram now, it’s like crimes against humanity … trickshots … crimes against humanity … trickshots!” says Michael Rayner, 62, AKA @brokenjuggler, who makes delightfully weird trickshot videos in his Los Angeles front yard. “I’m sort of here for all of it,” he says, arguing that what you see on short-form media is in some senses a truer reflection of reality than what you see on TV. “America is a very violent country right now. I perform in a lot of immigrant communities and everyone is terrified of being snatched away by Ice. My videos are my own therapy but I also hope they give people some diversion in a harsh world.”A professional entertainer, Rayner took to Instagram after all of his regular comedy club gigs were cancelled during the pandemic. These included routines that he has spent the best part of five decades honing: one involves him keeping atennis racketaloft by batting it between two sticks; another involves him spinninga cheeseburgeraround a parasol. But he combines these with improbable trickshots. His signature move is throwing his daughter’sNicolas Cagecushion behind his head into a basketball net.The fact that he performs all this deadpan, looking very much like some “schlubby dad on his driveway”, causes a large degree of cognitive dissonance in the comments section. “Sometimes my videos are so fantastical that people assume it is fake. They think it’s AI or green screen. That’s the sad thing about reality now. Reality itself is thought of as fake.”Michael Rayner’s tennis racket trickHe’s recently added voiceovers to his videos, framing his trickshots as a sort of religious rite. “I was summoned by the oracle,” he intones onone. “And to complete my mission, I had to make a Nicolas Cage basket while on a unicycle … ” Inanotherhe expresses gratitude for the fact that he gets to do this stuff for a living. “Can you imagine? Some people have to have jobs where they sit behind a table and write on pieces of paper and hand those pieces of paper to someone else. But I am lucky. I am grateful. I am in charge.”The Hulett brothers are certainly grateful. If they were not performing trickshots, they would be working in finance. “That’s what our majors were in college, so we’ve both gone in the opposite direction,” David says. Their father is a banker, their elder brother an accountant and their sister a financial analyst. “I never thought I’d be in a creative job,” Daniel says. “And I never thought I’d get to spend so much time with my brother.”Still, this is a respectable career now. When they announced to their father that they intended to do this full-time, far from being disappointed, he asked for a business plan. “Once we gave him the business plan and executed on it, he’s always been very supportive. ‘You’re making money. You’re happy. This is great.’”A successful video can bring in thousands of dollars a month but it’s no sure thing. The nickel video, for example, bombed so badly that the brothers removed it from TikTok. This is why it’s important to re-edit videos so they also work across Facebook,Instagramand YouTube – the better to hedge against algorithmic disruption – and to pursue branding deals, which they say account for 80% of their income. Their medium-term goal is to move into more lucrative longer-form YouTube content, but even now money is good enough that they can hire a warehouse and employ business managers and editors, meaning they can spend each afternoon doing what they do best: trickshooting.On a normal day they will spend five or six hours tossing a Mentos mint into a Diet Coke bottle revolving on abicycle wheel, or rolling soccer balls across ping-pong tableobstacle courses– which makes it start to seem like a respectable time investment. Can any of us really say that we spend our working lives doing something more important?Michael Rayner certainly sees it as time well spent. “You know, I get a lot of private messages from people saying they were really sad today but then my videos did snap them out of it for a moment,” he says. “I don’t want to be grandiose but if I can bring a little bit of happiness to people suffering from mental illness, I’m happy with that.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleSocial mediaYouTubeTikTokInstagramDigital mediaMetafeaturesShareReuse this content"

While improved cooperation between the army and air force has aided the fight, analysts say, airstrikes have also killed hundreds of civilians over the years.Bandits, who are primarily motivated by money, have also increased their cooperation with Nigeria’s jihadist groups, who are waging a separate, 16-year armed insurrection in the north-east.The recent emergence of the Lakurawa jihadist group in the north-west has worsened violence in the region.Governments of affected states have been forced to recruit anti-jihadist militias fighting the militants in the north-east to assist in countering the bandits.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She had been stabbed several times.Six years ago, an inquest in Kenya found that Wanjiru, who was mother to a then baby girl, had been killed by one or more British soldiers.In 2021, several soldiers, who at the time were attached to the Duke of Lancaster’s regiment, came forward to name a suspect.One offered startling testimony in which he claimed the suspect, a fellow Duke of Lancaster soldier, had confessed to her murder on the night, and taken him to see Wanjiru’s body in the septic tank.While a British soldier is believed to be the primary suspect in the case, under the UK-Kenya defence cooperation agreement, jurisdiction for investigating the murder lies with the Kenyan authorities.View image in fullscreenJohn Healey pictured with some of the family of Agnes Wanjiru.Photograph: HandoutKenyan police have flown to the UK several times, and are believed to have questioned multiple witnesses. In April, Kenyan police said a file had been passed to the Kenyan director of public prosecutions for a charging decision.Yet almost four years on from a suspect being identified, nobody has been arrested or charged in relation to the murder.Wanjiru’s niece Esther Njoki, 21, was eight years old in 2012, and said her memories of her aunt drove her fight for justice.“The reason why I’m passionate about this case and that I’ve been fighting, it’s what she did in the family,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She used to cook, braid my hair, everything. So that’s why I’m so passionate to fight for her rights.”“She was always jovial, smiling, hard-working. We were always laughing because of her jokes and everything,” she added. “It’s very heartbreaking. She was kind, she was everything, we miss her.”While in opposition, Healey called for more to be done to “pursue justice for Agnes and her family”, but Njoki says they are disappointed that more has not been done in the year since Labour came to power.“I think he just made a promise for his political gain,” Njoki said, “I think he’s taking us for a ride.”“They hide behind investigation,” she added, “because every time we raise any issue, they say ‘investigation, investigation’, we don’t know the status of the investigation.”Njoki, who is studying communications and acts as a spokesperson for the family,is currently raising funds to come to the UK in the autumnin order to meet with campaigners, hold a press conference, and lobby politicians directly.“I want to come and lobby there, so that they can take this matter seriously,” she said, “because they know the family can’t come to UK to seek justice there.”Justice, Njoki said, would mean closure. Her family believed that the government could do more.“They have power, but they have refused, and it’s heartbreaking,” she said. “Agnes was a human being.”“I think if she were around right now, everything would be so perfect,” she added, “but now that she’s not there, we are left to seek justice for her, with our hearts broken, being frustrated, and it’s the worst thing.”Tessa Gregory, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, who is acting on behalf of the family, said: “It is now 13 years since Agnes’ body was found in a septic tank, the Kenyan criminal investigation has been ongoing for years, and while the file was reportedly sent to the [Kenyan] DPP months ago, a charging decision is still awaited. The family are frustrated with both the lack of progress in the criminal proceedings and the lack of engagement from the British government.”She added: “They hope that the secretary of state will do everything within his power to ensure that those held responsible are brought to account swiftly and that the role of theBritish armyin Agnes’ death, including as to why nothing was done for nearly a decade after the murder, is thoroughly and independently examined.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said: “Our thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru, and the defence secretary has long recognised the tragic circumstances of her death.“The jurisdiction for this investigation lies with the Kenyan authorities. The defence secretary welcomed the confirmation that the case file had been handed over to the director of public prosecutions for a charging decision during his visit to Kenya in April 2025.“We will continue to work closely with the Kenyan authorities for the justice the family deserves.

The rescue team is trying to drill through 90 metres of rock to reach the miners.Mining companies are pumping seawater into the driest place on Earth. But has the damage been done?Read more“As part of the search operation, human remains were found and have yet to be identified by the authorities,” Codelco said in a statement.El Teniente’s general manager Andres Music said the discovery of the miner’s remains “deeply saddens us, but it also tells us that we are in the right place” to find the other missing workers.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of the El Teniente copper mine, operated by Codelco.Photograph: Esteban Félix/APChile’s president, Gabriel Boric, visited miners’ relatives on Saturday and vowed to “complete the search”.“Codelco has all the resources, experience and technology to carry out” the search, he said.The body of another miner – not one of the five trapped – identified as Paulo Marin Tapia was found on Friday, shortly after the mine’s partial collapse.Work has been suspended at El Teniente, which began operating in the early 1900s and boasts more than 4,500km of underground tunnels.Last year, the site produced 356,000 metric tonnes of copper – nearly 7% of the total for Chile.Chile is the world’s largest copper producer, responsible for nearly a quarter of global supply with about 5.3m metric tonnes in 2024.The metal is critical for wiring, motors and renewable energy technology.With Associated PressExplore more on these topicsChileMiningAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The US comedy actor Melissa McCarthy called her “one of the funniest humans, one of the smartest humans”.Szubanski was unable to attend the ceremony but gave an emotional pre-taped speech. “Let’s just get this out of the way – I am not being awarded this honour because I have got the cancer. I am getting this because of 40 years of hard work – lobbying, bribing, threatening, whatever it took. Finally it has all paid off.”She thanked the public for their messages of support. “The love and support I have felt, like a tsunami, from the Australian public has been overwhelming and I have to tell you, it really helps … when I go online and I look at those messages, every time my heart lifts and I feel that much stronger to deal with the cancer.”Streaming platforms dominated the best drama nominees but failed to win on the night. Netflix won just one award: best miniseries forApple Cider Vinegar, its drama about the Australian fraudster Belle Gibson.Though Apple Cider Vinegar and Netflix’s Territory dominated the drama categories, neither won.

That program is for members of a foreign military who can address critical ADF skill shortages.Keogh also said the government’s work to deliver the recommendations of theroyal commission into defence and veterans’ suicideswas a factor in trying to attract people to the ADF.“Delivering on the recommendations of the royal commission … is really important for improving people’s perceptions of, and therefore also their willingness to join the Australian defence force,” he said.“We’re … conscious that we have more work to do in this area as well.”The royal commission handed down its report to the government in September, with 122 recommendations, including the establishment of a body to help defence personnel transition to civilian life and access support.The government agreed in principle to 104 recommendations and has established a taskforce to implement them.Explore more on these topicsAustralian militaryAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Officials in nearby Kherson said Russia again bombed a crucial bridge, causing significant damage.In Russia’s Voronezh region, authorities said four people were hurt in a separate Ukrainian drone strike.As Moscow rebuffs repeated calls by the US president, Donald Trump, for a ceasefire, aRussian drone and missile attack on Kyivon Thursday killed 31 people, including five children, and wounded more than 150 in one of the worst single-day tolls in several months.The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, described the assault as “depraved” and posted a picture of the bloc’s flag at half mast.Zelenskyy has been appealing to allies for more air defence systems to rebuff the Russian escalation.On Friday, Germany said it would soon start delivering two more US-made Patriot launchers in addition to three Patriot systems already delivered to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.Trump on Tuesday gave the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, a shorter deadline of 8 August for peace efforts to move forward, as attacks continue unabated. The US leader has threatened new economic sanctions if progress is not made – a measure long demanded by Kyiv and backed by EU powers.Zelenskyy said on Sunday that Ukraine and Russia had agreed to exchange 1,200 prisoners after their latest round of talks in Istanbul in July.“There is an agreement to exchange 1,200 people,” he wrote on X, saying the lists of individuals to be swapped was still being determined to “unblock the return of our civilians”.“Preparations for a new meeting” were also under way, Zelenskyy said.Each of the three rounds of Ukrainian-Russian negotiations this year has resulted in prisoner exchanges but yielded no breakthrough in reaching an end to the fighting.The Russian government did not immediately comment.The Ukrainian air force said on Sunday that Russia had launched 76 drones and seven missiles against Ukraine overnight. It said it destroyed 60 drones and one missile, but 16 others and six missiles hit targets across eight locations.Early in the war, the Mykolaiv region faced frequent Russian artillery strikes and aerial attacks. Even after Russian forces were pushed back in late 2022, drones and missiles have remained a constant danger.The Russian defence ministry said its air units intercepted 93 Ukrainian drones overnight, including one over the Krasnodar region and 60 over the Black Sea.Ukrainian authorities said at the weekend that they had targeted other key sites for Russia’s energy and defence sectors in retaliation for the recent deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities.The week also brought political turbulence for Kyiv, after nationwide protests prompted parliament torestore the independence of Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies.Over the weekend a Ukrainian lawmaker and other officials were arrested after those agencies unearthed an alleged wide-ranging bribery scheme linked to the purchase of drones and other weapons systems.Pledging “zero tolerance” for corruption, Zelenskyy himself announced the arrests on X. The scheme is believed to have hiked prices by up to one-third in state contracts with suppliers.A previous, hotly contested bill that MPs passed in July with support from Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People party, which had made the fight against sleaze its calling card, had stripped powers from the independent national anti-corruption bureau, known as Nabu, and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office, Sapo.The changes would have brought them under the control of Zelenskyy’s handpicked general prosecutor, alarming EU allies and triggering a popular revolt.Activists in Kyiv, who had mounted street protests, on Thursday cheered the passage of a new law essentially annulling the measures, in whatone demonstrator calleda victory for “the values that our soldiers are defending on the frontline”.Ukraine was granted the status of an EU membership candidate in 2022 and the battle against corruption is seen as integral to its bid.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Do not settle for less,” the pope told the crowd.The week-long Jubilee of Youth, a highlight of the jubilee holy year, was an enormous undertaking for the Vatican, with a half a million young pilgrims in Rome for most of the week.Before a twilight vigil led by the pope on Saturday night, organisers said there had been 800,000 people in the vast open-air space on Rome’s eastern outskirts. The Vatican said on Sunday that number had grown to a million.Pope condemns Gaza war’s ‘barbarity’ as 93 reported killed by Israeli fire while waiting for foodRead moreMost of them spent the night in tents, in sleeping bags or on mats in anticipation of Sunday’s mass.Among them was New Yorker Christofer Delano, who said he had been “so happy to see Pope Leo” but was stunned by the crowds.“I didn’t expect to see all these people. I knew there was going to be a lot of people, I didn’t know it was going to be this many,” he said.In his homily, the former missionary and first US pope encouraged the gathered youth to “spread your enthusiasm and the witness of your faith to everyone you meet”.The Vatican has sought to highlight the fact that pilgrims travelled to Rome from war-torn regions, and Leo said in his Angelus prayer: “We are closer than ever to young people who suffer the most serious evils which are caused by other human beings.”“We are with the young people of Gaza. We are with the young people of Ukraine, with those of every land bloodied by war,” the pontiff said.“My young brothers and sisters, you are the sign that a different world is possible, a world of fraternity and friendship where conflicts are not resolved with weapons but with dialogue.”View image in fullscreenPope Leo XIV arrives by helicopter to the Jubilee of Youth prayer vigil.Photograph: Vatican Pool/Getty ImagesThe colourful event was accompanied by music from a choir and about 450 bishops and 700 priests all dressed in green robes. A towering cross dominated the golden arch covering the stage where the pope led mass.Tommaso Benedetti, an Italian pilgrim, said the pope had passed his first test in the eyes of young people during the youth jubilee.“We feel quite satisfied. There were many references to peace, which is a theme that is very close to our hearts as young people,” he said.The young pilgrims – from 146 different countries, according to the Vatican – have filled Rome’s streets since Monday, chanting, singing and waving their countries’ flags.The festive atmosphere reached a peak on Saturday before the vigil presided over by Leo. The Italian broadcaster Rai called it a Catholic Woodstock.1:40Almost a million young people welcome Pope Leo at event near Rome – videoHundreds of thousands camped out at the dusty venue, strumming guitars or singing, as music blasted from the stage where a series of religious bands entertained the crowds.Leo was greeted with deafening screams and applause after his arrival by helicopter and as he toured the grounds in his popemobile, with many people running to catch a better glimpse of the new pope.Roads leading to the Tor Vergata venue, a 40-minute drive from the centre of Rome, were packed, making Leo’s choice of helicopter transport more efficient.At more than 500,000 sq metres (125 acres), the grounds were the size of about 70 football pitches.Andy Hewellyn, a British student, sat in front of a huge video screen – a prime spot because he was unable to see the stage in the distance.“I’m so happy to be here, even if I’m a bit far from the pope. I knew what to expect,” he said. “The main thing is that we’re all together.”The youth pilgrimage came about three months after the start of Leo’s papacy and 25 years after John Paul II organised the last such gathering in Rome.It was announced by Pope Francis on World Youth Day in Lisbon in 2023.The church planned a series of events for the young pilgrims over the course of the week, including turning the Circus Maximus – where chariot races were held in ancient Rome – into an open-air confessional.Explore more on these topicsPope Leo XIVThe papacyCatholicismChristianityReligionItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Turkish media said police had launched an investigation.Latchman’s body has since been flown to the UK. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British man who died in Turkey and are in contact with the local authorities.”Until last December, Latchman, originally from Bridgend in south Wales, had been the assistant headteacher at Goldington academy in Bedford, where he was also head of computer science, according to hisLinkedIn profile.His online posts suggest he regularly ran and worked out at gyms.Latchman’s family and friends paid tribute to him on social media. Yashley Latchman posted a photograph of him working out with Martyn with the caption “Rest in Peace my brother”. He wrote: “You will forever be my source of inspiration and motivation. Thanks for everything. Will miss u loads.”Alain Latchman commented: “Yes Yashley very sad. Too young.”Dr Cinik’s website claims it has conducted more than 50,000 successful transplants. Its best known clients are international footballers. As well as Ferdinand, other former patients include the Croatian World Cup finalist Ivan Rakitić, the former France and Liverpool striker Djibril Cissé and the Brazilian World Cup winner Rivaldo.In a statement, the clinic said it was “deeply saddened” by Latchman’s death.It said he had a successful hair transplant last summer and had returned this year for a second procedure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At least 1,400 people have been killed while seeking aid since 27 May, most of whom were killed near GHF sites, while others were killed along the routes of aid convoys, the UN said on Friday. The GHF says it only uses pepper spray or fires warning shots to control crowds.In total, 119 people were killed in Gaza by Israeli shootings and strikes over the last 24 hours, including those seeking aid, the Gaza health ministry said.The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military targeted its headquarters in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, on Sunday, killing one staffer and wounding three more. Video taken by an employee showed the headquarters in flames after the strike, which had destroyed much of the building.A separate Israeli strike hit a school in Khan Younis that displaced people had been using as shelter, killing at least two people.Gaza’s population is growing increasingly desperate as the territory sinks further into famine, which experts say is a product of Israel’s continued blockade of aid. Israel has vehemently denied there is a starvation crisis in Gaza and announced expanded aid measures last week, but humanitarians say Israel is still severely restricting the entry of aid.Chart of deaths while seeking aidSix people have died of starvation or malnutrition in the past 24 hours, health officials said, bringing the total number who have died from hunger to 175, 93 of whom were children. The pace of starvation deaths surged in July with more people dying from hunger than in the previous 20 months combined.Humanitarians say a far greater amount of aid needs to enter Gaza to help stabilise the starvation emergency.“We need the sustainable entry of humanitarian aid to flood Gaza with aid for a relatively long period of time. Patients and hospitals need more food than usual to contribute to their recovery,” said Hisham Mhanna, a spokesperson for the ICRC in Gaza.He said the emergency compounded Gaza’s existing crises, which include a devastated healthcare system and the spread of disease. Faced with starvation and lack of humanitarian supplies, aid groups are struggling to help the population of Gaza.In total, at least 60,839 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel’s current military operations, launched after the Hamas-led attack in Israel on 7 October 2023 which killed about 1,200 people.While Israeli strikes continued in Gaza, Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, led prayers at al-Aqsa mosque in occupied East Jerusalem, provoking outrage among regional powers. Ben-Gvir was among a group of about 1,250 people who prayed at the compound on Sunday under the protection of the Israeli military.The compound, which Jews call the Temple Mount, is a highly revered site – the holiest in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam. The site is under Jordanian custodianship; under a decades-old agreement, Jews are allowed to visit but not pray there.Al-Aqsa compound mapJordan condemned the visit, which it described as “an unacceptable provocation”. Its foreign ministry said it “affirmed the kingdom’s absolute rejection and strong condemnation of the continued unacceptable incursions by the extremist minister Ben-Gvir”.Ben-Gvir’s visit was in honour of Tisha B’Av, when Jews mourn the destruction of two Jewish temples, and was the first time that an Israeli minister had publicly prayed at the site.The compound has been the scene of clashes in the past, with Israeli police raiding the mosque in 2023 after Palestinians occupied it in response to reports that Jews were planning a religious ceremony there.Ben-Gvir called for the annexation of Gaza and for Palestinians to leave the territory while at al-Aqsa on Sunday. He said in a post on X: “A message must be sent: to ensure that we conquer all of the Gaza Strip, declare sovereignty …. This is the only way that we will return the hostages and win the war.”Benjamin Netanyahu put out a statement after the visit saying the policy governing the compound “has not changed and will not change”.The controversy came as the Israeli public was reeling from therelease of two videosover the weekend showing emaciated hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza, which triggered protests on Saturday.Netanyahu on Sunday requested the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide food and medical aid to the hostages in Gaza.Hamas responded that it was ready to provide Red Cross aid to the hostages if Israel halted “all forms of air traffic” during the delivery of packages.The occupiedWest Bankwas also gripped by demonstrations on Sunday, with thousands protesting against the war in Gaza and the detention of Palestinians in Israeli prisons. Protesters carried photos of Palestinians killed or detained by Israel, as well as photos of starving children in Gaza.More than 10,800 Palestinians are held in Israeli prisoners. Rights groups have documented widespread torture of Palestinians by Israeli prison guards and soldiers, including sexual abuse, food deprivation and physical abuse.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelWest BankPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I haven’t eaten for a few days in a row,” David says in a weak, slurred voice. He walks away from the camera, revealing his emaciated body.“Time is running out. You are the only ones who can end this,” he says, in what appear to be comments directed at Israel’s leadership.Hamas captured David at the Nova music festival in southern Israel on 7 October 2023, the day Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and captured approximately 250 hostages. He is one of 49 hostages still held byHamas, 22 of whom are thought to still be alive.The family of David released a statement responding to the video, accusing Hamas of starving David for propaganda.“We are forced to witness our dear son and brother Evyatar being deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas’s tunnels inGaza– a living skeleton buried alive. Our son has only a few days left to live in his current condition,” the family said.They called for humanitarian aid that enters Gaza to be allowed to reach David and urged the US and Israeli governments to do everything possible to secure his release.Gaza is in the throes of famine, with mass starvation on the rise. Israeli officials have said Hamas is deliberately starving its captives.Netanyahu said on Sunday that he had spoken with the regional head of the International Red Cross, Julien Lerisson, and asked the organisation to help provide food and medical aid to hostages in Gaza.Hamas responded that it was ready to provide Red Cross aid to the hostages if Israel halted “all forms of air traffic” during the delivery of packages and opened permanent humanitarian corridors.The video was released as the US envoy Steve Witkoff visited Israel to discuss a ceasefire in Gaza. He met the families of some hostages on Saturday, and told them Washington was pushing for a comprehensive end to the war that would include the release of all hostages.“We now need to bring all of them home. We are very close to ending the war,” he said, according to a statement released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.Netanyahu’s office said on Saturday that he had spoken to the families of David and another hostage, Rom Braslavski, who was pictured in a video released on Friday.Thousands of people rallied in Tel Aviv on Saturday night to call for the release of the hostages. Relatives of some of the hostages erected a protest camp surrounded by razor wire and displayed pictures of those still held captive.View image in fullscreenRelatives of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza protest in Tel Aviv.Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPAThey sat in the middle of the encampment, which they said symbolised the imprisonment of their loved ones. They called for an end to the war in Gaza, with some accusing Netanyahu of prolonging the war to save his governing coalition.“This is the time for a comprehensive deal and an end to the war. No more delays. No more leaving them behind. Stop this nightmare and bring them out of the tunnels and home,” the families said in their statement.Ceasefire negotiations collapsed two weeks ago, when the US and Israel accused Hamas of not negotiating in good faith. Hamas has denied the accusation and countered that Israel was stalling.Pressure on Israel to agree to a ceasefire is mounting, as the international communityreacts in horrorat the growing famine in Gaza, which has killed 175 people, including 93 children. The aid community blames Israel’s blockade on aid into Gaza for their starvation, a claim Israel has denied.In response to the stalling ceasefire efforts, Netanyahu had suggested alternatives to his cabinet, including a renewed offensive on Gaza in a redoubled effort to defeat Hamas.Witkoff denied there was any plan for a further offensive, telling the families of hostages on Saturday that Hamas said that it was ready to disarm. In a statement, Hamas later vowed not to demilitarise “as long as the occupation exists”.About 60,500 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel’s military campaign there over the last 21 months, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Three children were brought to the UK this year through a private scheme by the charity Project Pure Hope.A government spokesperson said: “We are taking forward plans to evacuate more children from Gaza who require urgent medical care, including bringing them to the UK for specialist treatment where that is the best option for their care.“We are working at pace to do so as quickly as possible, with further details to be set out in due course.”More than 50,000 children have been killed or injured in Gaza since the outbreak of the war between Hamas and Israel in October 2023, according to Unicef data. Keir Starmer said last week that the UK was “urgently accelerating” efforts to bring children over for treatment.The government scheme will operate in parallel to the initiative by Project Pure Hope, which was set up to bring sick and injured children from Gaza to the UK privately for treatment.Through the charity’s initiative, Majd al-Shagnobi, a 15-year-old from Gaza, became the first Palestinian child to be flown to the UK for treatment for war injuries. He required complex facial reconstructive surgery after an Israeli tank shell destroyed his jaw when he was trying to access aid in February last year.His treatment at Great Ormond Street hospital in London is being privately funded by Project Pure Hope and is being carried out by a medical team who will all work for free.Earlier this year, the charity secured visas for two girls from Gaza – 13-year-old Rama and five-year-old Ghena – to have privately funded operations in the UK for lifelong medical conditions.News of the government’s plans comes after domestic political pressure. More than 100 MPs signed a letter coordinated by Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, calling on ministers to evacuate 30 severely ill children to the UK for treatment.A foreign affairs select committee report at the end of July said ministers had “declined to support a medical evacuation of critically injured children to the UK, involving coordinating travel permits, medical visas and safe transport to the UK, where the children can receive specialised care unavailable to them in Gaza”.The Guardianreported last monththat the government was facing legal action from a law firm acting on behalf of three critically ill children in Gaza.Other countries have been faster to act. Italy has evacuated dozens of Palestinian children and families for medical treatment, with the first group arriving in January 2024.The Sunday Times, whichfirst reported the story, cited a senior Whitehall source who said up to 300 children could be brought to the UK from Gaza under the government’s scheme. They will be accompanied by a parent or guardian and their siblings if necessary, and the Home Office will carry out biometric checks before travel, according to the newspaper.Project Pure Hope welcomed the government’s announcement and said it would be sharing its expertise from nearly two years of successful evacuations.“Our blueprint can help ensure the UK acts quickly and effectively so that every child who needs urgent care has the best chance of survival and recovery,” a spokesperson said.The charity has been urging the government to create a scheme similar to the oneestablished for Ukrainian refugeessince November 2023.The UK has been working with the Jordanian government to airdrop humanitarian aid into Gaza in response to thewidespread starvationcaused by Israel’s blockade.Starmer has announced plans for the UK torecognise a Palestinian statein September before the UN general assembly unless Israel agrees to a ceasefire, allows more aid into Gaza, stops annexing land in the West Bank and commits to a peace process leading to a two-state solution.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In it, David is skeletally thin and is shown digging a hole, which, he says in the video, is for his own grave.Israeli restrictions on the entry of goods and aid into Gaza have led to severe shortages of food and other essentials, stoking international demands for a ceasefire. UN-backed food security experts said this week that the “worst-case scenario of famine” is now playing out in Gaza.1:57Protests in Israel after Hamas releases video showing emaciated hostage – videoHamas has included this issue in their hostage videos, warning that the hostages are going hungry alongside their captors and that time is running out for a ceasefire.In a statement, the family of David demanded that the aid that is now getting into Gaza thanks to renewed UN convoys and foreign airdrops must also reach their son.“They are on the absolute brink of death,” his brother Ilay said at a rally in support of the hostages in Tel Aviv, where thousands gathered holding posters of those in captivity and chanted for their immediate release.Of the 251 hostages taken during the Hamas attack, 49 are still being held in Gaza, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead.Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy on Saturday told families of hostages that he was working with the Israeli government on a plan that would effectively end the war in Gaza.View image in fullscreenPeople, holding banners and Israeli flags, stage a protest for an end to the war in Gaza and the return of Israeli hostages in Tel Aviv.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesSteve Witkoff, who arrived in Israel as Benjamin Netanyahu’s government faced global outcry over the devastation in Gaza andthe starvation growing among its 2.2 million people, met the prime minister on Thursday. On Friday hevisited an aid distribution siterun by the Israel and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).Global outrage has grown over Israel’s restrictions on aid and the deadly unrest surrounding the GHF sites, with daily reports of shootings at all four locations since the group took over aid distribution at the end of May. The UN says 859 Palestinians have been killed during that time in the vicinity of these sites, and more than 500 have been killed along the routes of food convoys.Hospitals in Gaza sayIsraeli fire killed more than a dozen peopleon Saturday, eight of them while trying to get food.‘We are dying slowly, save us’: starvation takes hold in Gaza after a week of appalling milestonesRead moreIsrael blames Hamas for the suffering in Gaza and says it is taking steps for more aid to reach its population, including pausing fighting for part of the day in some areas, airdrops and announcing protected routes for aid convoys. UN agencies have said that airdrops of food are insufficient and that Israel must let in far more aid by land and quickly ease the access to it.Seven Palestinians died of malnutrition-related causes over the past 24 hours, including a child, the territory’s health ministry said on Saturday. This brings the total deaths among children from causes related to malnutrition in Gaza to 93 since the war began.The German government, traditionally a staunch ally of Israel, joined calls for Israel to deliver more aid on Saturday, saying that the current amount remains “very insufficient”.France’s foreign minister also called for humanitarian aid to be supplied to the people of Gaza in massive quantities, while also denouncing as “despicable” videos of Israeli hostages held in Gaza posted by Hamas’s armed wing.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsGazaHamasMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It will include habitat mapping, contacting boroughs across the capital to gauge their interest and surveying the public about the birds.The White Stork Project in Sussex has sought to create new colonies of rehabilitated injured birds at Knepp and Wadhurst Park since 2016. These can act as a “magnet” for wild birds that visit from the continent, and the project’s first breeding success was in 2020.In the four decades before the start of the project there were just 27 records of white storks across Greater London, but there were 472 sightings between 2016 and 2023, with the numbers increasing year on year, conservationists said.Elliot Newton, a co-founder of Citizen Zoo and its director of rewilding, said: “If you look across European landscapes, this is a bird that can actually thrive in urban landscapes. What we want to see is how we can make London a more white stork-friendly environment, and embrace it for its ability to inspire people about the nature we can and should have close to where we live.”The survey is being led by Dr Rachel White, of the University of Brighton, with two phases that mirror a national survey she conducted as part of the White Stork Project in Sussex.The first phase has involved surveying a representative sample of 1,000 Londoners, and the second phase is asking residents and frequent visitors to give their views on white storks and their place in the capital.TheLondon surveywill feed into Citizen Zoo’s wider assessment of the political and public enthusiasm and habitat availability for storks, and potential next steps such as creating more habitat to encourage natural colonisation or even a release similar to that in Sussex.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The traditional banks’ market share in deposits dropped from 84% in 2019 to 80% in 2024, it added.Meanwhile the banking sector collectively suffered a £3.7bn combined drop in total pre-tax profits last year, marking the first major downturn since the rebound in the wake of the pandemic.The sector’s average return on equity, a key performance measure, is expected to fall by more than a third, from a peak of 13% in 2023 to 8% by 2027. That is equivalent to an £11bn drop in annual profits.KPMG warned that banks were under pressure to adapt to major changes in the sector, including increased competition and rising costs.The flight of customers from high street lenders follows a period in which banks wereaccused of “profiteering” from rising interest ratesby offering paltry returns for savers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Similar policies were introduced in the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Spain, but UK politicians have so far refused to follow suit.Peter Westlake, a partner in KPMG UK’s banking strategy team, said: “Banks are facing a lower-growth, higher-cost environment that demands transformation at pace. While we can expect profitability to broadly remain sound this year, the entire sector needs to show how they are preparing for challenges ahead.”Bank costs rose by 6% in 2024, which – together with falling productivity among workers – could put bank profits under further pressure, according to KPMG’s report.Westlake suggested that banks could turn to less conventional methods to boost profits, including by embracing artificial intelligence. “The winners will be those that move beyond tactical cost-cutting and proactively address oncoming market headwinds through business model transformation,” he said.Explore more on these topicsBankingBanks and building societiesSavingsSavings ratesKPMGUK cost of living crisisTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

Figures released last week showedmore than 25,000 people had arrived in the UK via small boats in 2025so far, a record for this point in the year.Graph of small boat arrivalsProtests outside hotels housing asylum seekersspread this weekend. Nine people were arrested on Saturday in Islington, north London, after brief clashes between protesters and counter-protesters outside the Thistle City Barbican hotel.On Sunday afternoon, more than 100 people, many of them women wearing pink T-shirts, gathered outside the Britannia International hotel in Canary Wharf after reports that asylum seekers had been bussed in under the cover of darkness. Grainy footage on social media appeared to show men getting off a coach and being escorted into the hotel in the early hours.A group of men wearing face masks were also seen outside the Britannia hotel later in the afternoon. Chants of “send them home” broke out.Protesters jeered at people going in and out of the hotel, and officers were forced to step in after flares were let off in the crowd, the Metropolitan police said.A group of people were “harassing occupants and staff” and trying to prevent deliveries being made, the force added. They were also trying to “breach the fencing and access the hotel”.One man had been arrested in Canary Wharf “on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker” after an officer was pushed, police said.Fresh protests had erupted on Thursday outside a hotel in Epping, Essex – the latest in a series of demonstrations after an Ethiopian asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault against a local girl.The “one in, one out” deal agreed with France last month means the government will for the first time be able to send people back there in exchange for asylum seekers with links to Britain.The scheme is uncertain in scale and timing – critics have claimed it will not be a deterrent because it will only result in the exchange of up to 50 people each week.In a statement, Cooper said the additional funding would “turbo-charge the ability of our law enforcement agencies to track the gangs and bring them down, working with our partners overseas, and using state-of-the-art technology and equipment.“Alongside our new agreements with France, this will help us drive forward ourplan for changecommitments to protect the UK’s border security and restore order to our immigration system.”In a separate development, academics at the University of Oxford have concluded that £20bn has been spent on “migrant-welcoming schemes”, including asylum accommodation, over 10 years, but with little focus on integration and community cohesion.A team from the Centre onMigration, Policy and Society (Compas) said the money from 26 different spending streams over the decade to April 2024 included a £10bn overspend on asylum accommodation, while only “small amounts of money” had been spent on long-term goals such as community consent.Jacqueline Broadhead, a senior researcher at Compas, said the government had an opportunity to redress the balance.“While there have been very high levels of overspend on asylum hotels, there has not been equivalent investment on cohesion and integration, which could help mitigate some of the pressures on local communities,” she said.On Saturday, the government released plans to introduce anew offence for advertising irregular small boat crossingsunder the border security, asylum and immigration bill going through parliament.Assisting illegal immigration to the UK is already a crime. Officials believe the offence would give police and other agencies more power to disrupt criminal gangs.And in yet another announcement on Saturday, Cooper said she planned to introduce a fast-track scheme to tackle the asylum backlog, with the aim of turning around decisions within weeks.There are tens of thousands of refugees who have been waiting for longer than a year for an initial decision on their applications for asylum. More than seven in 10 are eventually granted permission to stay in the UK.The Conservatives criticised Cooper’s funding announcement as a “desperate grab for headlines, which will make no real difference”.Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition, told Trevor Phillips on Sky News that Labour should revive Boris Johnson’sditched £700m plan to send people to Rwanda, and should close the hotel in Epping.“What we need is a third-country deterrent so that people can be processed elsewhere,” she said.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeYvette CooperMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The compensation bill is likely to surge above £10bn. Industry must learn that honesty matters and adjust their practices going forward accordingly,” he said.The FCA said it was unlikely that the price tag of its redress scheme – which will include administration costs – would be materially lower than £9bn and it could be “materially higher”. It added that while some scenarios put the total cost as high as £18bn, it considered estimates in the mid-point of this range “more plausible”.The regulator will start consulting on the scheme by October, and plans to include motorists who were harmed by discretionary commission arrangements. In most cases, the scheme would be likely to pay out less than £950 in compensation for each claim, it added.These discretionary commissions, which were banned in 2021, inflated the cost of car financing by allowing car dealers to claim higher commissions if they put customers on loans that earned higher interest rates for the lender. About 14.6m contracts included that arrangement between 2007 and 2020.The watchdog will also consult on broader motor financing issues where motorists may have been harmed by egregious or unfair commission arrangements. That would encompass a larger group of borrowers, and likely cover agreements between 2007 and 2024, the FCA said.On Friday the supreme court largelysided with finance companiesby overturning an earlier ruling that the commissions were illegal. Judges upheld a single case that was deemed “unfair”, due in part to the size of the commission paid to the car dealer and how it was disclosed.Before the ruling, the Guardian revealed that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was so concerned about the anticipated impact of the supreme court ruling on lenders thatshe had considered attempting to overrule it.Nikhil Rathi, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “It is clear that some firms have broken the law and our rules. It’s fair for their customers to be compensated. We also want to ensure that the market, relied on by millions each year, can continue to work well and consumers can get a fair deal.“Our aim is a compensation scheme that’s fair and easy to participate in, so there’s no need to use a claims management company or law firm. If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.“It will take time to establish a scheme but we hope to start getting people any money they are owed next year.”The supreme court case was brought by two specialist lenders, Close Brothers and South Africa’s FirstRand, in an attempt to challenge the three consumers who collectivelywon a court of appeal case in October.Justices were asked to review the court of appeal ruling, which suggested nearly all commission arrangements – unless plainly disclosed and issued under full consent of the consumer – were unlawful.If upheld, it would also have meant millions of people who bought a car with finance could be owed compensation at an estimated cost of up to £44bn to lenders including Santander UK, Close Brothers, Barclays and Lloyds.The sum wouldhave almost rivalledthePPI saga, which cost banks about £50bn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The FCA said it needed to “ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles”.The car finance industry has claimed that a steep compensation bill would break some lenders, while others would be forced to offer fewer or more expensive loans to claw back their losses.The FCA also tried to manage expectations of large individual payouts, saying borrowers were unlikely to get back much more than the amount of commission originally paid to the car dealer. While interest would also be applied, that sum was likely to total about 3% a year.Any scheme that went beyond discretionary commissions would also consider a range of factors, including how financially literate the borrower was when they signed the contract, and how much information was provided.Martin Lewis, a consumer champion and the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said car lenders may still resist the financial watchdog’s redress plans.“The industry could fight this and it could fight it hard. What we need now is … consistency, we need transparency, and we need speed: both for the industry and for individuals to get through this. So I would hope that the industry doesn’t try to throw more legal wobblers to slow the whole thing down,” he said.Alex Neill, the co-founder of Consumer Voice, said: “This is a vital opportunity to restore trust and put right wrongdoing by dealers and lenders. But as ever, the devil will be in the details – the big test is whether the scheme will deliver a fair level of compensation at scale.“There will be big hurdles for the regulator to overcome including being able to engage all affected drivers and convincing consumers to trust a scheme run by the wrong-doers.”The FCA said it would ensure lenders assessed claims “consistently, efficiently and fairly”, adding that it would “monitor if firms are following the rules and act if they’re not.”The City regulator added that anyone concerned about their car finance agreement should contact their lender directlyMotorists who have already filed a complaint with their lender do not have to do anything, it said. Complaints will not be reviewed until at least December, after they were put on pause by the regulator.Explore more on these topicsFinancial Conduct AuthorityFinancial sectorRegulatorsBankingUK supreme courtMotoringConsumer rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was sadly pronounced dead at the scene,” the spokesperson said. “The stadium was busy, and we believe it is likely a number of people witnessed the incident, or may knowingly or unknowingly have caught it on mobile phone video footage.”The Met has asked anyone who has information that could help to confirm what happened to contact the force.Oasis said in a statement: “We are shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic death of a fan at the show last night. Oasis would like to extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the person involved.”The band dedicated the track Live Forever to “all the people who can’t be here tonight” during their Wembley Stadium gig on Sunday night. Liam Gallagher said: “This one’s for all the people who can’t be here tonight, but who are here if you know what I mean, and aren’t they looking lovely. Live Forever.”One fan, who was sitting in a lower tier, said on social media that she had witnessed paramedics trying to revive the man. “I was directly underneath in section 211. At first glance I thought it was a coat falling from the above tier but then I looked and saw the bloke on the concrete. It was horrific to see,” she wrote.A Wembley Stadium spokesperson said: “Last night, Wembley Stadium medics, theLondonambulance service and the police attended to a concertgoer who was found with injuries consistent with a fall.“Despite their efforts, the fan very sadly died. Our thoughts go out to his family, who have been informed and are being supported by specially trained police officers.”The Oasis reunion tour, with Liam and Noel Gallagher at the band’s helm again for the first time in 16 years, includes seven shows at Wembley and five in the Gallaghers’ home town of Manchester. They will then tour the US, Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Australia, before ending in South America in November.Explore more on these topicsOasisWembley stadiumLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Members of the Texas Democrats face a $500-a-day fine and possible arrest, a measure that was introduced in 2023, two years after Democratsleft the statefor three weeks to block election legislation that included several restrictions on voting access.Ultimately, that bill passed but not beforeDemocratswere able to claim something of a moral victory after stripping the measure of some of its provisions.The latest plan to leave the leave the state came after a House committee approved new congressional maps on Saturday.“This map was politically based, and that’s totally legal, totally allowed and totally fair,” Cody Vasut, a Republican state representative and committee member,told NBC News.Vasut pointed to disparities in other states,including California, New York and Illinois, where the weighting of seats to votes is strongly in Democrats favor.“Texas is underperforming in that. And so it’s totally prudent, totally right, for Texas to be able to respond and improve the political performance of its map,” he said.Texas Republicans unveil congressional map that could gift them five seatsRead moreThe political backdrop to the Texas redistricting fight colors Pritzker into the picture of a national fight. Pritzker, a billionaire member of the family that owns the Hyatt hotel chain, is seen aslooking toward a bidfor the 2028 Democrat presidential nomination.In June, he addressed Democrats in Oklahoma where he met privately in a “robust” meeting to discuss about Texas redistricting, according to NBC News. He later met with Texas Democrats, where offered assurances he would find them hotels, meeting spaces and other logistical assistance.The absence of the Democrats on Monday threatens to derail other issues Abbott is tabling, including disaster relief after to the deadly central Texas floods last month.“Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately,” Texas’s attorney general, Ken Paxton,said in a post on X. “We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law.”Texas house speaker Dustin Burrowssaidthat if, at 3pm on Monday, “a quorum is not present then, to borrow the recent talking points from some of my Democrat colleagues, all options will be on the table”.Explore more on these topicsTexasUS politicsDemocratsIllinoisRepublicansHouse of RepresentativesDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The cast included Gary Sandy, Tim Reid, Howard Hesseman, Frank Bonner and Jan Smithers, alongside Anderson as the sexy and smart Jennifer Marlowe.As the station’s receptionist, the blond and high-heeled Jennifer used her sex appeal to deflect unwanted business calls for her boss, Mr Carlson. Her efficiency often kept the station running in the face of others’ incompetence.The role earned Anderson two Emmy award nominations and three Golden Globe nominations.Anderson starred on the big screen alongsideBurt Reynoldsin the 1983 comedy Stroker Ace and the two later married and became tabloid fixtures before divorcing in 1994.Anderson wrote a 1995 autobiography, My Life in High Heels, which she said was about “the growth of a woman, a woman who survives. It’s about my childhood, the death of my parents, my career, my divorces, and my children. Then of course, the trauma of my marriage to Burt.”“I think if you’re going to write about yourself, you have to do it warts and all,” Anderson told the Associated Press. “You may not even tell the nicest things about yourself, because you’re telling the truth.”Anderson is survived by her husband Bob Flick, daughter Deidra and son-in law Charlie Hoffman, son Quinton Anderson Reynolds, grandchildren McKenzie and Megan Hoffman, stepson Adam Flick and his wife Helene, and step-grandchildren Felix and Maximilian.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesCaliforniaTelevisionWest CoastBurt ReynoldsnewsShareReuse this content"

All four were residents of Anaconda, Montana, where the quadruple murder took place, a statement from the Montana attorney general, Austin Knudsen,said.Former US army soldier Michael Paul Brown, 45,is suspectedof having killed Ballie, Kelly, Leach and Palm at The Owl Bar in Anaconda. Kelly was a bartender, and the others were patrons, Knudsen said at a news conference Sunday.Brown remained at large as of Sunday, with officials warning that he may be armed as well as getting around in a stolen car containing clothes and camping gear.Knudsen alleged that Brown carried out Friday morning’s mass murder with a rifle that law enforcement believes was his personal weapon.The attorney general warned residents in the town of just more than 9,000 people that Brown, who lived next door to the bar where he was a regular, could come back to the area.Police continue to search for Montana gunman who killed four people in a barRead moreAnaconda is about 75 miles (120km) south-east of Missoula in a valley hemmed in by mountains.“This is an unstable individual who walked in and murdered four people in cold blood for no reason whatsoever,” Knudsen remarked on Sunday. “So there absolutely is concern for the public.”Numerous local public events were canceled over the weekend as the search for Brown entered its third day, according to Facebook pages in the area.Robert Wyatt, 70, told the Associated Press that he was neighbors with Leach.The two men lived next door to each other in a public housing complex for elderly people and people with disabilities.“Everybody is nervous” since Friday, Wyatt said. Leach was deaf and kept mostly to himself, Wyatt said – and he only recalls Leach having a family visit once almost a year ago. But Leach was always happy to help his neighbors with chores like moving furniture.“If you needed help, Dave would help,” Wyatt said to the AP. “He was a good neighbor.”Among the areas that investigators have searched for Brown are woods where he hunted and camped while he was a child.Brown served in the Army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005 and deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005, said Lt Col Ruth Castro, an army spokesperson. Brown was in theMontananational guard from 2006 to March 2009, Castro said, and left military service at the rank of sergeant.View image in fullscreenPolice and other emergency personnel are seen after a reported shooting in Anaconda, Montana, on Friday.Photograph: Joseph Scheller/APBrown’s niece, Clare Boyle, told the AP that her uncle had spent years struggling with mental illness. Boyle said she and other family members repeatedly sought help.“This isn’t just a drunk/high man going wild,” she said in a Facebook message. “It’s a sick man who doesn’t know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn’t know where or when he is either.”Knudsen said on Sunday that local law enforcement was familiar with Brown prior to the mass murder. It was widely believed that he knew at least some of the victims, given how close he lived to the bar.Authorities circulated a photograph of Brown from surveillance footage taken shortly after the fatal shootings. He appeared to be barefoot and in minimal clothing.But law enforcement now believes Brown ditched the vehicle he escaped in and stole a different one that had camping gear, shoes and clothes in it – leaving open the possibility that Brown is now clothed.Four killed in Montana bar shooting that is US’s ninth mass murder of 2025Read moreThe last time that law enforcement saw Brown was on Friday afternoon, but there was “some confusion” because there were multiple white vehicles involved, Knudsen said.There is a $7,500 reward for any information that leads to Brown’s capture.“This is still Montana,” Knudsen said. “Montanans know how to take care of themselves. But please, if you have any sightings, call 911.”Elsewhere in the US on Sunday, authorities in Tennessee were searching for a man wanted in the murders of the parents, grandmother and uncle of an infant found alone and alive in a discarded car seat.Austin Robert Drummond, 28, was named as the suspect in that quadruple murder. Two other men had been arrested on allegations that they assisted Drummond, according to investigators.The victims in that case were found dead in Tiptonville, Tennessee, about 40 miles from where the baby was left, officials have said. They were identified as James M Wilson, 21; Adrianna Williams, 20; Cortney Rose, 38; and Braydon Williams, 15.Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS crimeMontanaGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

On Friday,an appeals court upheld that order.Politicoreported that during a hearing earlier this week in the case, the justice department lawyers were pressed on the reports regarding the alleged arrest quota, and a judge reportedly asked whether it was a “policy of the administration at this time to deport 3,000 persons per day?”.An attorney for the justice department, Yaakov Roth, reportedly responded “Not to my knowledge, your honor” per Politico.And inthe government’s filingon Friday, the attorneys for the government said that the allegations of that the “government maintains a policy mandating 3,000 arrests per day appears to originate from media reports quoting a White House advisor who described that figure as a ‘goal’ that the Administration was ‘looking to set’”.“That quotation may have been accurate, but no such goal has been set as a matter of policy and no such directive has been issued to or by DHS or ICE” the attorneys added.The discrepancy was first reported bythe Los Angeles Daily NewsandPolitico.When asked about the discrepancy, Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant press secretary, said in a statement to the Guardian: “Under Secretary Noem, we are delivering on President Trump’s and the American people’s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make American safe.”“Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst and carry out the largest deportation operation of criminal aliens in American history,” McLaughlin added.Judge rules against Trump and extends deportation protections for 60,000 immigrantsRead moreIn a statement toPolitico, a White House spokesperson alsodid not directly address thequestions about the discrepancy, but said that “the Trump Administration is committed to carrying out the largest mass deportation operation in history by enforcing federal immigration law and removing the countless violent, criminal illegal aliens that Joe Biden let flood into American communities.”A justice department spokesperson told the outlet that there is no disconnect between the DoJ’s court filings and the White House’s public statements.The spokesperson added that “the entireTrump administrationis united in fully enforcing our nation’s immigration laws and the DoJ continues to play an important role in vigorously defending the president’s deportation agenda in court.”At various points during his 2024 election campaign, Trump claimed thathe would targetbetween15 and 20 millionpeople who are undocumented in the US for deportation.As of 2022, there were 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US.Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The offer also kept current overtime policies, which Boeing had proposed modifying in the last contract offer.The union had rejected the previous offer, saying that the offer was insufficient.Boeing has said that if the contract offer had been approved, the average annual wage would have risen to $102,600 – up from $75,000.Boeing fighter jet workers poised to strike after rejecting contract offerRead moreDan Gillian, Boeing Air Dominance’s vice-president and general manager and a senior St Louis site executive,told the St Louis Business Journal: “We’re disappointed our employees rejected an offer that featured 40% average wage growth and resolved their primary issue on alternative work schedules.

The offer also kept current overtime policies, which Boeing had proposed modifying in the last contract offer.The union had rejected the previous offer, saying that the offer was insufficient.Boeing has said that if the contract offer had been approved, the average annual wage would have risen to $102,600 – up from $75,000.Boeing fighter jet workers poised to strike after rejecting contract offerRead moreDan Gillian, Boeing Air Dominance’s vice-president and general manager and a senior St Louis site executive,told the St Louis Business Journal: “We’re disappointed our employees rejected an offer that featured 40% average wage growth and resolved their primary issue on alternative work schedules. We are prepared for a strike and have fully implemented our contingency plan to ensure our non-striking workforce can continue supporting our customers.”The workers assemble Boeing’s fighter jets and the MQ-25, an aerial refueling drone being developed for the US navy.This would be the first strike that Boeing has faced at its St Louis defense hub since 1996.Boeing’s defense division is expanding manufacturing facilities in the St Louis area for the new US Air Force fighter, the F-47, after it won the contract this year.Boeing’s CEO, Kelly Ortberg, said last week that the planned strike would be much smaller than that of the 30,000-worker strike last ​year, when the company took a $661m charge on its KC-46 tanker development contract with the US air force.“We’ll manage through this,” Ortberg said during an earnings call. “I wouldn’t worry too much about the implications of the strike.”Boeing currently holds contracts for several major Defense Department programs,according to Defense News, including the air force’s F-47 and F-15EX fighters, T-7 training jet and the Air Force One recapitalization effort.Explore more on these topicsUS newsBoeingMissouriUS unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Job growth numbers were revised down by 285,000 for the two previous months as well.On CBS News’s Face the Nation, GreerdefendedTrump’s decision to fire McEntarfer, a respected statistician, saying: “You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.”He added: “The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch.”Senate confirms Trump ally Jeanine Pirro as top federal prosecutor for DCRead moreBut William Beach, who served as Trump’s commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in his first presidency, warned that McEntarfer’s dismissal would undermine confidence in the quality of US economic data.The BLS gave no reason for the revised data but noted that “monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors”.“This is damaging,” Beach said on Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union. “I don’t know that there’s any grounds at all for this firing.“And it really hurts the statistical system. It undermines credibility in BLS.”McEntarfer on Friday published a statement on social media reacting to her dismissal, calling it the “honor my life” to have served as BLS commissioner.She said the BLS employs “many dedicated civil servants tasked with measuring a vast and dynamic economy”.“It is vital and important work, and I thank them for their service to this nation,” McEntarfer’s statement on the Bluesky platform said.Uproarover McEntarfer’s firing has come as a series of newtariff ratesare due to come into effect this month. While the president has predicted a golden age for the US economy, many economists warn that higher import tariffs could ultimately weaken American economic activity.On CBS, Greer said that Trump’s tariff rates are “pretty much set” and unlikely to be re-negotiated before they come into effect.The first six months of Trump’s second terms have been characterized by a seesawing of tariff rate announcements that earned the president the moniker on Wall Street ofTaco– “Trump always chickens out”. But last week heissuedanexecutive orderoutlining tariff modifications for dozens of countries after he had twice delayed implementation.Yet Greer also said many of the tariff rates announced “are set rates pursuant to deals”.“Some of these deals are announced, some are not, others depend on the level of the trade deficit or surplus we may have with the country,” he said.On NBC’s Meet the Press, the national economic council (NEC) director, Kevin Hassett, said modified US tariff rates were now “more or less locked in, although there will have to be some dancing around the edges about exactly what we mean when we do this or that”.Asked if tariff rates could change again, he said, “I would rule it out because these are the final deals.”On Fox News Sunday, Hassett said he also supported McEntarfer’s dismissal. “I think what we need is a fresh set of eyes at the BLS, somebody who can clean this thing up,” he remarked.But former treasury secretary Larry Summers told ABC’s This Week that McEntarfer’s firing was “way beyond anything that Richard Nixon ever did”, alluding to the late former president who resigned in 1974 over the Watergate scandal.Trump news at a glance: inquiry launched into Trump prosecutor as backlash grows over firing of statistics chiefRead moreSummers said Trump’s claim that the poor job numbers were “phony” and designed to make him look bad “is a preposterous charge”.“These numbers are put together by teams of literally hundreds of people following detailed procedures that are in manuals,” Summers said. “There’s no conceivable way that the head of the BLS could have manipulated this number. The numbers are in line with what we’re seeing from all kinds of private sector sources.”Summers placed McEntarfer’s firing, Trump’spressureon Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, to lower interest rates, and the strong-arm tactics that the administration has aimed at universities, law firms and media institutions in the same bucket.“This is the stuff of democracies giving way to authoritarianism,” Summers said. “Firing statisticians goes with threatening the heads of newspapers.“It goes with launching assaults on universities. It goes with launching assaults on law firms that defend clients that the elected boss finds uncongenial. This is really scary stuff.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS economyTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

But for how long?Richard PartingtonThanks to stockpiling, neither the markets nor consumers have been as badly affected by the trade wars as feared. But signs of trouble are loomingSun 3 Aug 2025 05.51 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 09.35 EDTShareChaotic and unpredictable, keeping up with Donald Trump’s volatile trade war – never mind his presidency – can be tough.Back in April after his “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, the talk was of the president crashing the global economy. Then, after aWall Street backlash, the world learned the acronym “Taco”, which stands for “Trump Always Chickens Out”. Now, things are heating up again.The president’s decision to hit US trading partners – including Canada, Brazil, India and Taiwan – with new tariffs after his self-imposed 1 August deadline certainly reignites a threat to the world economy. Dozens of countries have been left reeling, and US consumers are expected to pay a heavy price.US adds just 73,000 jobs in July amid pressure from Trump’s trade warRead moreHowever, there is a sense that things could have been worse. Nowhere more clearly is this reflected than on Wall Street: despite the chaos of the president’s trade war, the stock market remains close to record levels.After the latest escalation on Friday, and some worrying US jobs numbers, share prices took a hit, sliding by about 1%. But this is a setback rather than a rout.A further slide could be ignited by this capricious president. Trump’s decision tofire the official in charge of labour market dataand his war on the independence of the US Federal Reserve will make matters worse.But despite the warnings of untold economic damage from the US tariff war earlier this year, the American economy has proven surprisingly resilient in recent months.Last week, the president seized on US growth figures showing the economy had expanded at an annualised rate of 3% in the second quarter, far in excess of the 2.4% rate predicted on Wall Street. Could the “fake news” media have it wrong? Are tariff wars “good, and easy to win,” as Trump claims?While inflation has ticked up, from 2.4% in May to 2.7%in June, it is well below the peak that followed the height of the pandemic disruption and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and is far from hitting the levels feared.Back in April, in a country wrought with division, Democratic voters reckoned inflation was on track to hit 7.9% within a year, while Republicans said it would collapse to 0.9%.Butthere is good reason why theUS economyhas so far defied the prophecies of Armageddon. For starters, the hot-cold nature of Trump’s tariff war means investors still anticipate further deals will be done to avoid the worst threats from ever materialising. The toughest tariffs introduced on Friday are only just arriving, too, meaning any impact has yet to emerge.Most countries have not hit back with retaliatory measures, which would have dramatically worsened things by putting international trade into a deeper tailspin.Meanwhile, knowing full well the dangers of this erratic president, businesses have been planning for months to avoid the worst-case scenarios.US companies rushed to stockpile goods before the trade war, helping them to keep prices down for now. Some firms have taken a hit to profits, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank, reckoning this is better than testing struggling American consumers – worn out by years of high inflation – with further price increases.The tariff costs are also being spread by multinationals, by increasing prices across the markets they operate in. In one high-profile example, Sony hasput up the price of its PlayStation 5by as much as 25% in some markets, including the UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. But not in the US.Still, there are signs that consequences are coming. When US businesses exhaust their pre-tariff stockpiles, it is likely that prices will creep higher. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of an erratic president is hitting jobs and investment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tariffs are weighing on business confidence and steadily creeping into consumer prices.GDP growth of 3% might appear robust on the face of things, but this figure was heavily influenced by the 0.5% fall in output in the first quarter, when the surge in US firms rushing to beat Trump’s tariffs distorted activity. Growth in the first half averaged 1.25%, markedly slower than the 2.8% rate for 2024 as a whole.Part of the reason Wall Street remains sanguine about this is the continued belief that things could have turned out worse. Deals are still expected, with the pause in tariffs for key US trade partners Mexico and China suggesting this most clearly.The investor view is that rather than tariffs the president would prefer a string of box-office moments in front of the TV cameras with trade partners paying tribute to the court of Trump.However, it would be wrong to underestimate the self-described “tariff man’s” love of border taxes. And even though his most extreme threats will be negotiated down, the final destination will still be much worse than before. An economic hurricane might be avoided but a storm is still the last thing businesses and consumers need.Britain’s US trade deal is a case in point. A 10% US tariff on British goods has been welcomed as a big victory for Keir Starmer given the alternative, but it is still far worse than before.British cars will face a tariff rate four times higher than previously, costing jobs and growth in Britain while hitting American consumers in the pocket.For the US consumer, the average tariff had been close to 2% before Trump’s return to the White House. After his 1 August escalation, that figure leaps to about 15% – the highest level since the 1930s.Almost a century ago a similar wrong-headed protectionist approach in Washington made the Great Depression far worse: theSmoot-Hawley tariffshit the US and triggered a domino effect among the main industrialised nations, ultimately leading to the second world war.In the unpredictability of Trump’s trade war, hope remains that similar mistakes can be avoided. But significant damage is still being done.Explore more on these topicsTariffsEconomics viewpointTrump tariffsTrump administrationUS politicsUS economyGlobal economyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

The Americans swam a time of 3 minutes, 49.34 seconds, breaking their own old record mark of 3:49.63.The Americans battled a case of “acute gastroenteritis” picked up at a training camp in Thailand. The malady clearly affected the team’s up-and-down performances in the eight days in Singapore. The Americans had only five gold medals through six days, but won four in the last two as team health seemed to improve.Backstroke queen Kaylee McKeown pulls off another golden doubleRead more“This is the best way to end the meet,” Gretchen Walsh said. “And I feel like we have such a good opportunity when you have this stacked group of women closing it out on a relay like this.“We’re going to put it all in the pool and we’re going to leave Singapore with a smile on our faces,” she added.Regan Smith, Kate Douglass and Walsh swam the first three legs with Torri Huske taking the anchor.Marchand, dubbed the “French Phelps”, nearly missed the 400 IM final after a slow heat in the morning but was back to his best in the evening, clocking 4:04.73 to finish well clear of Japan’s Tomoyuki Matsushita, the Paris Olympics runner-up behind Marchand.It was a stripped-back program from Paris where Marchand won four individual titles but he made it count with the 200 IM world record on the way to the title earlier in the week.Two years after Tunisia’s Ahmed Hafnaoui won the 800 and 1,500 freestyle at the Fukuoka championships, compatriot Ahmed Jaouadi completed the double by winning the 1,500 in 14:34.41 ahead of German Sven Schwarz and American Olympic champion Bobby Finke.China’s Yu Zidi, 12, wins relay bronze at world swimming championshipsRead moreJaouadi shaved nearly nine seconds off his personal best and said it was a struggle.“I wasn’t the only one. My body was in a lot of pain,” he added. “But through my mind is that I want this medal and I want to win it.“The big names may dominate the headlines but Australian relay stalwart Meg Harris grabbed the spotlight for herself as she won 50 freestyle gold in 24.02 ahead of Chinese duo Wu Qingfeng (24.26) and Cheng Yujie (24.28).The 23-year-old Harris clinched her first individual title on the global stage after sharing two Olympic and five world relay golds in the last four years.No Russian athletes competed at last year’s world championships in Doha but the nation’s swimmers have racked up medals in Singapore under a neutral flag.Russians were allowed to compete on condition they have not publicly supported the invasion of Ukraine and have no affiliation to the Russian military.Russian Kliment Kolesnikov stormed to the men’s 50 backstroke title in 23.68, just 0.13 off his world record, while compatriot Pavel Samusenko took a silver along with South African Pieter Coetze, each finishing in 24.17.Russian swimmers then combined to win a shock gold in the men’s 4x100 medley, giving the world record (3:26.78) a huge shake with a time of 3:26.93, a second clear of France.Explore more on these topicsSwimmingUS sportsOlympic GamesnewsShareReuse this content"

He gave monosyllabic answers to questions and when asked why, said: “I have got nothing else to say.”He leaves the paddock on tenterhooks with the summer break beginning and the next round not until the Dutch GP on 31 August, about which he was similarly cryptic. He was “very much” looking forward to the break, but when asked if he would be driving at the next round, was less equivocal: “I look forward to coming back … Hopefully I will be back, yeah.”His Ferrari team principal, Fred Vasseur, maintained that his driver was just disheartened by a tough weekend. “I don’t need to motivate him, honestly, he’s frustrated, but not demotivated,” he said. “I can perfectly understand the situation. He’s demanding. But that’s why he’s a seven-time world champion.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton is watched by spectators on his way to 12th place at the Hungarian Grand Prix.Photograph: Zoltán Balogh/EPA“He’s demanding with the team, with the car, with the engineers, with the mechanics, with myself but first of all, he’s very demanding with himself. I can understand the frustration from Lewis. This is normal. He will come back.”Hamilton’s former team principal at Mercedes, Toto Wolff, also felt he would bounce back. “Lewis is wearing his heart on his sleeve. It was very raw what he said [on Saturday], he was hard on himself,” Wolff said. “We have seen it before when he felt he had not met his own expectations. He’s been that emotionally transparent since he was a young adult.“Lewis has unfinished business inFormula One. You ask me if he still has it?

Rodman had not played since 12 April because of a nagging back issue.Flopped launch and new squad building: Boston and Denver’s journey to the NWSL | Moving the GoalpostsRead moreRodman, who won a gold medal with the United States at the Olympics last summer, buried her head in her hands and sobbed after the goal, her first for the Spirit since 15 September last year.“That was the hardest thing I’ve had to go through, with the injury and everything. So being back, especially at the home stadium with the crowd behind me, scoring a goal like that, you saw I buried it, was not going to miss it,” she said afterward. “I’m just really happy to be back. I missed the team, I missed doing what I love, so just joy.”The Spirit (8-4-2) moved into second place in the standings with the victory as the team returned from the league’s six-week summer break. The Orlando Pride hosted the Utah Royals in Sunday’s late match.The Thorns (6-4-4) had won their last two matches before the break.Gift Monday put the Spirit in front in the 17th minute, taking a well-placed cross from Rosemonde Kouassi and easily putting it past Thorns goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold.

And so that’s where I put that,” Jones said after practice Saturday, one day after Parsonsposted on social media to request a trade.No stranger to public and prolonged disputes with standout players, Jones insisted the standoff with Parsons is no different than past situations ranging from alternating approaches by quarterback Dak Prescott and wide receiver CeeDee Lamb last year to the 1993 in-season holdout by running back Emmitt Smith.With Joe Burrow and a too-familiar cast, the Bengals’ Super Bowl window is closing fastRead more“Well, it’s just that you’ve seen it so often, and you’ve seen it with other clubs. You go through the process. It’s a highly sensitive time when you’re guaranteeing somebody almost $200m, that’s sensitive stuff,” Jones said.Parsons remains at training camp, where he has yet to practice because of a back injury. He did not speak to reporters, leaving the field at the same time as Jones was fielding questions for more than 15 minutes.Parsons is going into the final season of his five-year rookie contract and is seeking a new deal that would almost certainly make him the highest-paid defender inNFLhistory. He could be franchise tagged in 2026 without a contract extension.A first-round draft pick in 2021, Parsons has at least 12 sacks in each of his four seasons with the Cowboys and 52 1/2 for his career.The crux of the disagreement between Parsons and the Cowboys seems to be over the specific nature of talks with Jones during the spring that Parsons did not consider formal negotiations. Jones disagrees, believing they had come together on a deal.“The key is that we’ve got an agreement,” Jones said. “Let’s really do understand that we’ve got an agreement now.”Commanders wideout Terry McLaurin requests trade after contract talks stallRead moreParsons wrote in his statement that the Cowboys have refused to engage his agent David Mulugheta in the process, which along with remarks by Jones during a 21 July press conference, contributed to his decision to publicly request a trade.Asked if what was discussed in March was still on the table, Jones said, “Micah took it off. He took it off.”Jones said that he expects Parsons to work off the framework established during the disputed spring talks.“Now, if we’re going to adjust an agreement, then he’s a must and I’m a must,” Jones said of Parsons’ involvement in future negotiations.Multiple Cowboys players have posted their support for Parsons on social media, with Lamb writing, “Just pay the man.” Fans shouted their support for Parsons when Jones walked on the field midway through practice, and there was a sustained chant of “Let’s pay Micah!” at the end of Saturday’s workout.Jones did not answer directly when asked if he expects Parsons will be on the Cowboys for their season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles on 4 September. He later expressed his belief that the current hostility with Parsons will be resolved in a satisfactory manner for all involved.“I enjoy Micah, but as always, in any relationship, there’s different moods at different times of your relationship,” Jones said. “That’s what it is. Don’t lose any sleep over it. That’s the one thing I would say to our fans, don’t lose any sleep over it.”Explore more on these topicsUS sportsNFLDallas CowboysnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesMikel Arteta enters a pivotal season after finally buying a centre-forward and reinforcing his midfield and defenceByEd AaronsSun 3 Aug 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 19.54 EDTShareGuardian writers’ predicted position:2nd (NB: this is not necessarily Ed Aarons’ prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Last season’s position:2ndArsenal kitsProspectsMikel Arteta vowed this would be a “big summer” after finishing as runners-up in the Premier League for a third season in succession and the new sporting director, Andrea Berta, has delivered on a number of signings in his first transfer window. The question now forArsenalsupporters is whether Martin Zubimendi, Christian Nørgaard, Noni Madueke, Viktor Gyökeres, Cristhian Mosquera and Kepa Arrizabalaga can help them take that elusive final step to becoming champions for the first time since the Invincibles in 2004.The arrival of Gyökereswill certainly quieten the clamour for a new No 9 that has rumbled on for several years, although the pressure will immediately be on the Sweden striker to hit the ground running. Longstanding target Zubimendi should provide metronomic accuracy at the base of a new-look midfield that Arteta will hope can continue to get the best out of Declan Rice and rejuvenate the captain Martin Ødegaard, while Madueke will surely provide much better back-up for their talisman Bukayo Saka than Raheem Sterling managed last season and could also push Gabriel Martinelli for a starting place on the left flank.But even with theteenage sensations Myles Lewis-Skellyand Ethan Nwaneri having committed their futures to the club after enjoying outstanding breakthrough seasons, there remain concerns about a lack of creativity in the squad. A move for Crystal Palace’s FA Cup hero Eberechi Eze could depend on players departing before the end of August to balance the books.Yet while Arsenal may end up paying more than £200m for the additions to their squad so far, seeing champions Liverpoolcomfortably outspend themafter finishing 10 points ahead last season has left many fans wondering if they have gone far enough. The squad definitely looks stronger than this time last year but with other rivals also closing in, it could be make or break for Arteta.Past five seasonsThe managerEnding yet another campaign without silverware was a bitter pill to swallow for Arteta, who celebrated his fifth anniversary in charge just before Christmas. A solitary FA Cup a few months later is not a fair reflection on the progress Arsenal have made since then – especiallygiven the run to the Champions League semi-finalslast season – but Arteta knows he will be ultimately judged on delivering titles. He made no secret of his frustration over the lack of cover in Arsenal’s squad as the injuries mounted up last year. With plenty of reinforcements now added, Arteta must seize his opportunity.Off-field pictureThesurprise departure of EduGaspar in November disrupted plans for the January transfer window but Berta has provided some fresh perspective since joining in March. Arsenal’s American owners, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, were rated as the most valuable sports ownership group on the planet in July at an estimated $21.3bn (£16.1bn) thanks to a portfolio that also includes the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams, the NHL’s Colorado Avalanche and the NBA’s Denver Nuggets. So funding another summer spending spree wasn’t an issue after keeping their powder relatively dry last year. They – like Arsenal’s supporters, who pay for one of the most expensive season tickets in the country – however, will want a return for their investment at some point.Last seasonStar signingNo Arsenal player managed 10 goals in the Premier League last season so the onus is on Gyökeres – who scored a staggering 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting – to fill the void. The only issue is that the 27-year-old never played in English football’s top flight despite being on Brighton’s books and then excelling in the Championship for Coventry. He will be expecting to get plenty of opportunities in a side that usually dominates their opponents in midfield but struggled to break teams down last season, drawing 14 times in the league. Having eventually opted for Gyökeres rather than RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko or Alexander Isak of Newcastle, Arsenal must now find a way to utilise his obvious strengths.View image in fullscreenArsenal fans replicate the trademark goal celebration of new signing Viktor Gyökeres before the pre-season friendly against Newcastle in July.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesStepping upIt is highly probable that only Premier League regulations prevented Max Dowman from taking Nwaneri’s record as the competition’s youngest ever player last season. The attacking midfielder has been training with Arsenal’s first team squad since celebrating his 15th birthday at the turn of the year and was described as “special” by Arteta after coming off the bench to win a penalty in their pre-season win against Newcastle in Singapore. “What he’s done against this team in the time that he had on the pitch is something certainly not common to witness for a 15-year-old,” he said. Dowman is expected to be handed an opportunity sooner rather than later and it will be intriguing to see what impact he can have.A big season for …Martin Ødegaard was the first to admit that his performances last season lacked their usual sparkle, with a return of three league goals his lowest since moving to north London permanently in 2021. The 26-year-old captain was also substituted on 12 occasions after missing part of the season due to an ankle injury as he struggled to find his best form. The Norwegian must rekindle his relationship with Saka that has proved so effective down the years, while Arteta will be hoping that Gyökeres can finish off some of the chances Ødegaard will inevitably create given the lack of other options besides the inexperienced Nwaneri and Dowman.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26ArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just look at all those stadiums and parks the Gallaghers are filling. Football from the late 20th century has a similar cachet. No video assistant referees, no sportswashing; just good, hard, honest, simple fare, when men were men and pressing was what you did to your Burton suit. If the past is a foreign country then a recent BBC Archive release is a primary source of a time when the continental import remained exotic and not the dominant division of labour.“Is English Football In Crisis?” asks an edition of On The Line in October 1993, broadcast the night before Graham Taylor’s England played a key World Cup qualifier in Rotterdam. You know the match: Brian Moore correctly reading Ronald Koeman’s free-kick – “he’s gonna flick one” – and the pathos of Taylor’s hectoring of the linesman as England’s hopes of qualifying for USA ’94 sink into the briny.Euro 2025: our writers hand out their awards from the tournamentRead moreSuch is the soap opera of the English game – its warring factions, its unrelenting thirst for cash – that a crisis is often close, though now further down the food chain than the England team and the Premier League. A televised meeting of 2025’s key actors is near unimaginable considering the secrecy many owners maintain, the global span from whence they come and many battles already being in camera through lawyers. The number of talking heads and influencers willing to step into the gaps is almost too grotesque to countenance. Snapshot to 1993 however, 14 months into the life of the Premier League, an entity barely mentioned over 40 minutes, and a room of football men are vehemently defending their corners. Just one woman is visible; the future sports minister Kate Hoey, and just one black face; that of Brendon Batson, deputy chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association. He remains wordless.A raven-haired John Inverdale operates as a Robert Kilroy-Silk/Jerry Springer figure as various blokes in baggy suits – “some of the most influential and thoughtful people in football” is Inverdale’s billing – fight their corners. Here is a time before gym-buff execs, when male-pattern baldness is still legally allowed in boardrooms and exec boxes, when a moustache is anything but ironic.“The whole game is directed towards winning rather than learning,” complains John Cartwright, recently resigned coach at the Lilleshall national academy, a less than gentle loosener. England’s Football Association is swiftly under attack from Hoey over being “out of touch”. Enter Jimmy Hill, a Zelig of football as player, manager, chair, the revolutionary behind the 1961 removal of the maximum wage, major figure – on and off screen – behind football’s growth as a television sport. Few have filled the role of English football man so completely and his responses to Hoey are dismissive, truculent. “You can only attack one question at a time and I find the attacks are so ignorant,” he rails, defending English coaching. Hill’s stance has not travelled well. Within three years, Arsène Wenger, among others, would be upending the sanctity of English coaching exceptionalism.A short film from the ever gloomy Graham Kelly follows. The then-Football Association chief executive dolefully advertises his body’s youth development plan before David Pleat’s description of English youngsters as merely “reasonable” rather blows Kelly’s cover. Former Manchester City manager Malcolm Allison, by 1993 a long-lost 1960s revolutionary, declares England’s kids were behind Ajax’s as early as the late-1950s. “Big Mal”, demeanour far more On The Buses than On The Line, cuts the dash of ageing rebel, an Arthur Seaton still restless in his dotage, cast to the fringes as Cassandra.Jimmy Hill was a major figure behind football’s growth as a television sportNext the programme’s wild card;Eamon Dunphy, footballer turned bestselling writer. The irascible face of Irish punditry for many decades seizes the stage with typical barbed lyricism, hunting down the stuffed shirts who run the game, fullj’accusemode adopted from his opening words. “English football has historically drawn its talent from the streets but unfortunately it has left its inspiration in the gutter,” he begins his own short film. Dunphy then lashes the “merchant class” that “have always wielded power”, kicks against the “subservient”, celebrating football’s “free spirited” outsiders.“Football’s greatest men have usually been its saddest – ignored, betrayed or patronised,” says Dunphy, soon enough labelling English football media coverage as “banal”. “Where is football’s Neville Cardus?” he asks, referencing the Guardian’s legendary cricket writer, setting a slew of fellow journalists, including the late David Lacey, also of this parish, on defensive footings.Cast in 1993 as rabble-rousing agent of chaos from across the water, Dunphy would declare himself an Anglophile in his 2013 autobiography, appreciative of the freedom found in 1960s Manchester compared to the illiberal Ireland he came from. Here he despairs for what made English football once so magical, bemoaning Allison’s estrangement and that Hill’s experience was also confined to the sidelines.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It proves a tinderbox moment. Hill and Professional Footballers’ Association chair Gordon Taylor soon fly at each other. “Get yer facts right, Jim,” hisses Taylor as the subject of player wages ignites a bonfire fanned further by agent Eric Hall’s “monster monster” smirks.Inverdale calls for order and concludes with a round-robin from which Pleat’s “you need an impossible man, a democratic dictator right at the top of football” sounds positively frightening. Somewhere in Pleat’s logic may lie the UK government’s imminentimposition of an independent football regulator, a process that led today’s power brokers into a sustained, bloody battle against such interference.Fast-forward 32 years, through Premier League and Champions League dominance, international failures and successes, foreign talent and investment, profit and sustainability, splintering media landscapes, women’s football embodying national pride, much has changedand yet self-interestremains the darkest heart of English football.Explore more on these topicsFootballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The England international was carried off on a stretcher and appeared to be in obvious pain after going down unchallenged late in the game.Maddison, 28, missed the closing stages of last season, including theEuropa League final, with a knee problem and his latest injury affects the same joint. The Spurs head coach, Thomas Frank, said: “I think sometimes in life and football things can be both beautiful and brutal – that’s what we got today. It looks like with Madders a bad injury, and then on the other side unbelievable scenes for Son from his teammates and the respect from the Newcastle players.”Tottenham need to find a way to capitalise on legacy of trailblazer Son | John DuerdenRead moreThe friendly, which ended 1-1, was otherwise notable for the emotional reception thedeparting Son Heung-minreceived from fans in his home city. Son, 33, confirmed this week that he is to leave Spurs this summer after a decade at the club. The South Korea international, who wore the captain’s armband, was given a standing ovation and a guard of honour from players of both teams when he was substituted in the 64th minute.Son, who scored 173 goals in 454 competitive appearances for the club, said the occasion was an emotional one. The forward also thanked Frank for his understanding having told him he wishes to seek a fresh challenge. Son told the club’s website: “It was a perfect moment. Sharing these beautiful moments are something that I will never forget and I will always appreciate it – from the fans, the players and the gaffer.“He understood my situation and was always on my side. He always listened to me and asked what I wanted to do. I have a huge respect and am very grateful.” Reflecting on his time in north London, he said: “I wish them all the best. There are five competitions ahead and I hope they win all the five competitions. That’s my wish.“Spurs will always be in my heart and the boys will always be in my history books. It was incredible. They’ve gone so fast, the 10 years. I can only think about the beautiful moments, amazing moments.”Tottenham later announced the signing of thePortugal midfielder João Palhinhaon loan from Bayern Munich. The 30-year-old’s move is subject to international clearance and obtaining a work permit, with Spurs holding an option to make it a permanent transfer next summer.Palhinha returns to the Premier League having spent two seasons at Fulham before joining Bayern in July 2024, going on to win the Bundesliga title last season and then helping Portugal to Nations League success.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now they must kick on without himJohn DuerdenSun 3 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 13.35 EDTShareJust as opposing fans in the Premier League have experienced feelings of dread over the past decade when Son Heung-min picked up the ball on the edge of their area, there had been a summer of worry among his millions of followers in Asia that his time in England was coming to an end.As the South Korean’s legs slowed last season, reports of a move elsewhere gathered pace. His 10 years at Tottenham may have ended with a trophy, the Europa League in May, but the legacy had been in place for some time. The 33-year-old has changed the way Asian players are perceived around the world and much more besides.“It was the most difficult decision I have made in my career,” an emotional Son said at a Seoul press conference on Saturday before Sunday’s pre-season exhibition against Newcastle. “Such amazing memories. It was so hard to make the decision. I need a new environment to push myself. I need a little bit of change – 10 years is a long time. I came to north London as a kid, 23 years old, such a young age. I leave this club as a grown man, a very proud man.”Son has been the pride of Asian football for years, the first player from the continent to become a genuine Premier League star, a legend at his club. There had been compatriot Park Ji-sung who won titles and respect during seven years at Manchester United, but he was never an automatic starter and, unfairly for a technically excellent and intelligent player, old Three Lungs was praised more for his running, work-rate and stamina.View image in fullscreenSon Heung-min said he moved to north London as a kid and leaves as a grown man, after helping the club to Europa League glory last season.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APShinji Kagawa looked as if he may reach the next level at Old Trafford but was soon back in Germany. So it was Son,signed from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015, who went on to appear on billboards in north London, Seoul and a lot of cities in between as one of the best-known faces of the world’s best-known league.There were 173 goals in 454 competitive games, including the 2020 Puskás Award forthatstrike against Burnley. In the 2021-2022 season, he scored 23 in the league, sharing the golden boot with Mohamed Salah, another milestone for Asian football.When Harry Kane leftSpurs for Bayern Munich, Son stayed and was made captain, and while last season was a relative struggle, for team and player, it ended on a high. Some thought he may stay for one more crack at the Champions League, after doing so much to help Spurs to the final in 2019, but it was not to be.In 2022, I went to Tottenham’s sparkling training ground on the northern outskirts of the capital to present the Chuncheon-born native with the Best Footballer in Asia award, a trophy handed out by Titan Sports in China, a country that is not known for its love of Korean football but one that has the utmost respect for Elder Brother Son.He had received the prize in all but three of the 12 years since it became a thing. We discussed our favourite food from his homeland while he tried not to laugh at the Korean language attempts of Hugo Lloris in the next room as the goalkeeper recorded a video message to fans in the Land of the Morning Calm before the club’s visit a few weeks later.Tottenham are there once more. “It’s very clear that Sonny will start and lead the team out as captain,” the new Tottenham head coach, Thomas Frank, said. “If that is the last game for Sonny, what a place to do it here in front of his home fans. It could be a beautiful ending.”And an emotional one. His Premier League performances will be missed in Korea, not least by those bars that hang huge televisions in their windows, showing Tottenham games with a tiny image of his smiling face in the top corner of the screen to show their idol is on the field.Playing time is a big thing for Korean fans after most of Son’s predecessors struggled. Park Chu-young joined Arsenal in 2011 but managed just seven league minutes in the red and white corner of north London, inactivity that caused some resentment back home. Son’s experience was the opposite. Playing regularly, becoming a star for so long and then captain at a major club also helped grow Tottenham’s global fanbase.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For now, though, they just have to find a way to live without Son on the pitch. And fans of the player on the world’s biggest continent will also have to get used to Premier League action without the forward.A Chinese journalist once said that Son showed the world that Asia can produce a player as exciting as any from Africa or South America.

Amid euphoric scenes, Ferrand-Prévot, gold medallist at theParis Olympics last year, followed up her lone win on the Col de la Madeleine on Saturday with another solo exploit in the Tour’s final stage.Ferrand-Prévot is the first French rider to win theTour de France Femmes, 36 years after her compatriot Jeannie Longo won the Tour de France Féminin, although that race did not compare with the scale, difficulty and global renown of the latest incarnation. Suddenly, after waiting 40 years for a successor to Bernard Hinault in the men’s Tour, all France is now enamoured by women’s cycling and with the 33-year-old from Reims, who was called within minutes of confirming her victory by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.Ferrand-Prévot’s achievement, of winning the Tour de France andParis-Roubaix in the same year, and both within 12 months of winning an Olympic gold medal for mountain biking, confirms her versatility and ambition. With the Olympic rings tattooed on her arm, she had reverted to road racing from mountain biking and stated that it was her ambition to win the Tour within three years. She did it in one.“I think I put the bar really high this year in terms of preparing for this race,” she said. “There have been a lot of sacrifices. Now I just want to enjoy the moment, because it might only happen once.”The writing was on the wall even on stage one, when she jumped clear of the peloton on the final climb of the Côte de Cadoudal in Plumelec, with a sharp acceleration. But she bided her time and has remained calm and contained throughout, even during the mid-race public spat between her team manager, Jos van Emden, and Demi Vollering’s team manager, Stephen Delcourt.View image in fullscreenFrench rider Pauline Ferrand-Prévot had double cause to celebrate, claiming stage nine and the overall title.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPAFor seven of the nine stages she remained discreet, but when her moment came she was ready. If her first stage win, on the Madeleine on Saturday, confirmed the earlier impressions of her speed in Plumelec, her win in Châtel emphasised her dominance.“I’d said to the sports directors this morning that if I could win in yellow then I’d try to,” she said. “It all came down to how I felt on the last climb. I attacked but I didn’t think I’d be able to keep going like that and win.”As the final stage began there were, initially, some nerves and Ferrand-Prévot was put under pressure almost immediately as she lost ground with the main peloton on the long descent from the start to Sallanches.“I made a mistake on the first descent,” she said. “I think I was just a bit scared with the pressure of the jersey, so afterwards I stayed close to the front and made an effort to stay there.”However, the race leader rejoined the main group on the approach to the first climb, the Cote d’Arâches-la-Frasse. Even before top of the first category climb a selection had been made with the favourites all moving ahead of the splintering bunch, in pursuit of the lone breakaway, Anna van der Breggen.The Dutch rider, 12th overall as the stage began, built up a near two-minute lead on the approach to the hardest climb of the stage, the Col de Joux‑Plane. Behind her the main peloton dwindled further after Cédrine Kerbaol, then fifth overall, crashed at the foot of the climb and was distanced quickly.The Joux-Plane’s gradients reduced the lead group to just seven riders, including Ferrand‑Prévot, second-placed Sarah Gigante, the 2023 winner, Vollering, and the defending champion, Kasia Niewiadoma.Five kilometres from the top, Gigante accelerated, taking her rivals with her, but as on Saturday’s climb, to the top of the Madeleine, the Australian was not able to open a gap. Instead, it was Vollering and Niewiadoma who combined on the fast descent to distance Gigante, in the hope of pushing her out of the Tour’s top three. By the foot of the descent they had succeeded and she was never able to recover.Vollering, second overall, and Niewiadoma, who finished third, have shown remarkable consistency. They have appeared on the podium in every edition of the Tour de France Femmes since its inauguration in 2022. But this past week was all about the rebirth of French cycling. With the yellow jersey plus four stage wins out of nine days of racing, two for Ferrand-Prévot and two for the irrepressible Maëva Squiban, the hosts have dominated. There is, at long last, life after Hinault.Explore more on these topicsTour de France FemmesCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

It may be of little consolation to the English golfer as her wait for a maiden major win goes on but Hull’s surge was the only thing that ever looked like halting Miyu Yamashita’s Porthcawl procession. What an afternoon of stirring drama this quickly became on the stunning links, which should be rewarded with more high-profile events before too long. To Hull, plenty of plaudits for such a swashbuckling display.Yamashita eventually prevailed, by two, at 11 under par. The Women’s Open was denied a British winner for the first time since Georgia Hall lifted the trophy at Royal Lytham & St Anne’s in 2018. Still, Hull must feel she is closer than ever to winning one of her sport’s biggest prizes. She now has four second places in majors.The Women’s Open 2025: Miyū Yamashita wins at Porthcawl – as it happenedRead more“Coming into this week I didn’t think I was going to make the cut,” Hull admitted. “That’s the truth of it. I wasn’t hitting it very well. I couldn’t prepare as well as I wanted to because I was poorly. I obviously collapsed three timesin the round at the Evianand then I still wasn’t feeling well until Sunday last week. So I think I did pretty well and considering my mindset coming into it. I’m pretty proud of myself.“At the end of the day, it’s just a game. That’s what I think about and I enjoyed it out there. I just love that adrenaline feeling. It’s so good, it’s like a massive hit.”Minami Katsu tied Hull’s aggregate but was never a threat to the winner. Hull sat 11 adrift after 36 holes of this major. With three front-nine birdies in round four, Hull closed to within one of the leaderboard’s summit. What happened next turned the Women’s Open back in Yamashita’s favour. As she delivered birdies at the 8th and 9th, Hull could only par the 9th and 10th. The leader’s advantage was three.Hull displayed typical tenacity over the closing stretch. She had promised to play like a kid, to attack every hole and stayed true to her word. Her iron into the par three 12th was laser-like, setting up a birdie. The 29-year-old picked up another shot at the 14th, outstandingly so after finding thick grass from the tee. Was Yamashita now feeling the heat? A drive into the bunker at the par-five 13th, followed by a tame greenside chip, suggested so. Yamashita steadied herself and jabbed back at Hull with a wonderful, converted par putt from long range.The final, key moments were still to arrive. Hull hit into sand from the 16th tee. She could barely advance the ball far from there before overshooting the putting surface with her third. Hull bravely rescued a bogey, just as Yamashita slammed home an 8ft par putt two holes behind. Yamashita was two clear with four to play. Another Hull dropped shot at the penultimate hole meant Yamashita doing likewise made no material difference.View image in fullscreenCharley Hull lines up a putt on her way to second place in the Women’s Open.Photograph: Nigel French/PAYamashita is the third player from Japan to win this tournament but the second since it was afforded major status. Her swing is so stable one wonders how she can ever miss. A putting wobble towards the end of round three proved the exception to Yamashita’s 2025 Women’s Open rule. That she withstood everything Hull threw at her on a gusty afternoon says so much for the new champion’s mentality. “To win such a historic tournament in front of all these amazing fans is such an incredible feeling,” said Yamashita. Victory came the day after her 24th birthday.South Korea’s Kim A-lim and Japan’s Rio Takeda shared fourth at seven under. Lottie Woad’s tournament closed with a 71 and four-under total for a top-10 finish. Woad will have learned a lot in Wales, including what it is like to play under such a burden of expectation. Victory at last weekend’s Scottish Open on her first professional start meant she was in uncharted territory here. She will relish settling into the United States and the LPGA Tour over the coming weeks.“I don’t think it affected my golf but there was definitely a lot more attention, a lot more eyes on me,” Woad said. “I feel like I handled it pretty well overall and was just sticking to my game, just trying to focus on the preparation really and not let it distract me too much. It was a pretty good week overall, it was pretty solid.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's OpenGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

Clearly he’s in a huge amount of pain, but it means a huge amount to him and it just shows the ­character and the person that he is, that he’s ready to put his body on the line for England. Hopefully he doesn’t have to.”Root’s 39th Test century, and his 195-run partnership with his fellow centurion Harry Brook carried England to the verge of victory only for India to swing momentum back in their direction with three quick ­wickets before rain fell to bring the day to an early end. But the manner and timing of his dismissal meant it was a day he looked back on with frustration rather than satisfaction.“I was bitterly disappointed not to still be there and get us home,” Root said. “As an experienced batter in that situation, you’ve got to be able to absorb pressure and understand that they’re allowed to bowl well for periods of time, and then when you get your opportunities to counter that, you take them. I just misexecuted on that occasion. When you’re 100 not out you don’t expect that from yourself.”England had reached 301 for three shortly before tea, pursuing a target of 374, when Brook was dismissed, with Root and Jacob Bethell ­following soon after the interval as India found fresh impetus. “You can’t really afford to throw in the towel in a very important Test match,” India’s bowling coach, Morne Morkel, said. “We’ve seen it so many times before where if you get one you can easily get two or three and create a bit of pressure. There were no hard words or big talk [at tea], it was just to stay calm and work hard.”On completing his century Root took off his helmet and put on one of the charity headbands that have been sold around the ground this week in tribute to the former England batter, and Root’s former coach, Graham Thorpe. “This week it’s been amazing thatSurrey and the ECB have ­recognised everythinghe did for ­English cricket as a player, as a coach, as a mentor and as a friend to the dressing room, to the game of cricket,” Root said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aki is yet to meet his fifth child, Aine, and said reuniting with his family is his top priority after helping the Lions to wrap up the series.Aki was a second-half replacement in the first Test, coming off the bench after 57 minutes and all the while ­coping with the drama unfolding in Auckland. Aine is Aki’s fifth child – all five have names beginning with A – and Aki’s remarkable revelation details the sacrifices made by the touring side, who first got together for a training camp in Portugal in early June.Tupou weeps golden tears as Wallabies win back respect in bittersweet victory | Angus FontaineRead more“I want to enjoy my break, my family time,” Aki said. “I haven’t seen my family for eight weeks. I have a newborn child who I haven’t met yet. She was born when we were playing in Brisbane, so I haven’t met her. Her name is Aine, so I’m looking forward to going and meeting my newborn child and we’ll go from there.“Credit to my wife [Kayla]. She’s a powerful woman, a strong woman. I have to say it to her. If you only knew the story of what happened, it’s a funny story in itself. It was a good day. I was in the hotel. I knew we were overdue. The missus calls me and she’s like: ‘Water hasn’t broke but I’m going to the hospital, I’m feeling contractions.’ I go: ‘Yeah, fair enough.’ She goes to the hospital, we’re getting ready for the team meeting pre-match, and then she calls me and says she’s on the way to the hospital, so I said: ‘Fine, be safe.’“Five minutes later, she sends a photo, her water broke. I was like: ‘Cool, OK, are you almost there?’ This is like 30 or 40 minutes away from the hospital, so I said: ‘You’ll be all right, Mum is there.’ Ten minutes later, she video-calls me and I was like: ‘Shit, what’s going on?’ I saw a baby on the video call, so she had it in the car on the way to the hospital. They’re both strong and healthy, so happy days. I knew it was good juju so I knew we were going to have a good day.”Aki went on to start the second and third Tests,struggling in ­appalling conditionson Saturday night in Sydney. After being part of the side that lost against South Africa four years ago, however, the 35-year-old was happy to settle for series success even if the targeted whitewash slipped by. “We’ll take the positive out of it,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s so much more on offer in one place than other streaming services or broadcast channels. Also, some streaming channels can be difficult to navigate to find what you want. At the moment, I’m really enjoying reaction videos. One of my favourites is Regeneration Nation TV where an American duo react to music, comedians and TV shows like Fawlty Towers. They’re fun to watch and you feel involved. I also think it’s helpful for those who feel lonely – it’s almost like the people in these videos are with you. I used to work as a volunteer for the Samaritans so I can understand loneliness. I feel YouTube fills a need that other services don’t. It’s very personal and is a place where you can find anything, and often find what you’re looking for.Lloyd, 62, disabled and unemployed,Kent‘Terrestrial TV just feels old-fashioned’YouTube offers so much content that aligns with my interests and hobbies including music, photography, science and movie reviews. Not to mention it’s all on demand and much of it is available in bite-size form (15 to 20 minutes). For dramas and films, I use streaming services. Now in my late 50s, I also really value YouTube’s treasure trove of live music performances – there’s always something new or nostalgic to discover. There is just nothing on traditional TV that comes anywhere close to the choice and niche subjects that I can find on YouTube, like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop tutorials. While I occasionally miss watching live events (women’s football, or Ozzy Osbourne’s funeral), I don’t feel I’m missing out.Steve, 50s, customer services manager, Gloucestershire‘I like how short content is on YouTube’I like how short content is on YouTube, making it easy to watch something while you’re eating in the kitchen. I prefer it to other streaming services for the wide choice of things to watch. My favourite shows are when people are making something out of nothing, whether it’s the Great Pottery Throwdown or Rust Valley where they do up old cars. I had a TV licence because I didn’t want to have a problem with the authorities thinking I watch the television, even though I didn’t. I rescinded it recently, though, as I don’t think the BBC makes very good programmes any more. I’m not interested in their output and it feels very samey and boring. I’m also on a state pension and it was difficult to justify the fee.Andrea, 67, retired care worker, Bedfordshire‘You can watch anything from deep space to quantum theory’Watching broadcast TV is madness – having to see something at a specific time makes no sense. I stopped about 20 years ago when Tivo came out, and over time not watching TV got easier once broadband improved and there were more streaming services. YouTube is so much better than others as you can watch anything from deep space to quantum theory. I like watching really detailed scientific videos that are overwhelmingly technical. One channel is PBS Eons, which is about the history of life on Earth. I find that TV is too long-winded and the episode recaps make me feel like I have a memory of a goldfish – it drives me up the wall. Out of politeness, I still have a TV licence. I’ve heard stories of people not being able to prove they’re not watching TV and being taken to court. It’s more for my peace of mind.Stu Smith, 54, IT consultant, Ipswich‘I just got fed up with terrestrial TV’I watch YouTube because I can never find anything entertaining on terrestrial television. I really like to watch travel shows where I can sit at home and feel I can do things like climb in the Himalayas, trek in New Zealand or go to amazing restaurants in different countries. Even though I occasionally watched sport, I gave up my TV licence two years ago. I couldn’t abide so-called celebrities or look-at-me types who interrupted the programme so you get to look at their faces all the time. I don’t mean to be presenter-bashing, but when you get old you need to be a bit more calm in your life, and presenters tend to jump out the TV at you. I just got fed up with it.Gillian, 73, retired secretary, Stratford-upon-Avon‘Whether you’re learning or relaxing, YouTube is much more precise than TV’I’ve played in a few bands and do a lot of recording at home and in 2018 I started watching help videos for recording with Logic Pro X on YouTube. Then I found a lot of guitar tutors as I was studying for my grade 5 classical, then moved on to using the platform for science and history documentaries. Suddenly I could access a lot of information. I also like watching it on the TV as it’s more comfortable than sitting at a desk or using a laptop. I find the ability to scroll through a multitude of topics to find something that fits my mood much better than the offerings on TV. YouTube seems to offer the ability to immerse and satisfy, whether learning or relaxing, in a much more precise way than TV or other streaming services.Gerry McCart, 60, works in financial services, EdinburghExplore more on these topicsYouTubeTelevision industryTV streamingOlder peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

As a country that was once colonized by the British, I am wary of the ways that inequalities between the global north and global south risk being perpetuated in the digital age.When we consider the lack of inclusion of the global south in discussions aboutartificial intelligence(AI), I think about how this translates to an eventual lack of economic leverage and geopolitical engagement in this technology that has captivated academics within the industrialised country I reside, the United States.As a scientist, I experienced an early rite of passage into the world of Silicon Valley, the land of techno-utopianism, and the promise of AI as anet positive for all. But, as an academic attending my first academic AI conference in 2019, I began to notice inconsistencies in the audience to whom the promise of AI was directed. AI researchers can often identify consistent choices for locations where such conferences are hosted, and where they are not. NeurIPS, one of the top AI conferences, has highlightedannual issues for obtaining visas for academic attendees and citizens from the African continent. Attending such a prestigious conference in the field grants one the opportunity to gain access to peers in the field, new collaborations and feedback on one’s work.I often hear the word “democratisation” within the AI community, an implication of equity in access, opportunity and merit for contribution regardless of one’s country of origin. Associate professor of economics Fadhel Kaboubtalksabout how “a lack of vision for oneself results in being a part of someone else’s vision”, reflecting on how systematically lacking an access to infrastructure results in local trade deficits in economies.As in the time of Nafta’s promise of “free trade”, promises of “AI democratisation” today stillexistandbenefitmainly countries with access to tech hubs not located in the global south. While the United States and other industrialized countries dominate in access to computational power and research activity, much of the low-paid manual labour involved in labelling data and the global underclass in artificial intelligence still exists in the global south.Much like coffee, cocoa, bauxite and sugar cane are produced in the global south, exported cheaply and sold at a premium in more industrialized countries, over the past few years we have seen influence in AI inextricably tied to energy consumption. Countries that can afford to consume more energy have more leverage in reinforcing power to shape the future direction of AI and what is considered valuable within the AI academic community.What would an AI community inspired by the Brics organisation look like for the global south?In 2019, Mary L Gray and Siddharth Suri published Ghost Work, which exposed the invisible labour of technology today, and at the beginning of my tenure at graduate school, the heavily cited paper Decolonial AI: Decolonial Theory as Sociotechnical Foresight in Artificial Intelligence waspublished. It has been five years since these seminal works. What would an AI community inspired by the Brics organisation, which united major emerging economies to advocate for themselves in a system dominated by western countries, look like for the global south?I often ask myself how AI has contributed to our legacy, and whose stories it won’t tell. Has AI mitigated issues of mistrust and corruption in less-resourced countries? Has it benefited our civic communities or narrowed educational gaps between less-resourced regions? How will it make society better, andwhosesociety will it make better? Who will be included in that future?A historical mistrust can impede adoption by developing countries. Furthermore, many developing countries have weak institutional infrastructures, poor or nonexistent laws and regulatory frameworks for data projection and cybersecurity. Therefore, even with an improved information infrastructure, they are likely to function at a disadvantage in the global information marketplace.A currency is only as good as its perceivedglobaltrust. When thinking about the democratization in AI and a vision of what itcould bein years to come, AI’s survival requires including more perspectives from regions such as the global south. Countries from the global south should work together to build their own markets and have a model of sovereignty fortheirdata and data labour.Economic models often consider a definition of development that includes a measure of improvement in the quality of life of themost marginalizedof its people.

He’s also accused in many civil suits of sexual abuse of adults and minors. It seems like everyone promptly forgot about Combs when the facts about the financier Jeffrey Epstein’s decades of horrific sexual abuse of at least a 100 girls and women, with the help of his extensive staff, deep pockets, banks, and elite connections became the next front-page ruckus.In June, the movie producer Harvey Weinstein wasfound guiltyin a New York retrial for some of his decades of horrific sexual abuse of women, with the help of his extensive staff, top lawyers, the film industry, some ex-Mossad agents and of course his deep pockets. In February afederal appeals court upheldthe convictions and 30-year prison sentence of the singer R Kelly for racketeering and sex trafficking; last year hisother20-year sentencewas also upheld, for producing child abuse images and enticement of children for sex. Of course his deep pockets and extensive assistance had also been factors in how he too was able to abuse girls for so long.Why the US is burning $10m worth of birth control | Moira DoneganRead moreOne of the reasons the epidemic of violence against women is so unacknowledged is because cases like these are talked about individually, and often treated as though they are shocking aberrations rather than part of a pervasive pattern that operates at all levels of society. Another is that it is in the most literal sense not news – there are tides of hatred and violence against other groups that ebb and flow, but violence against women is global and enduring, a constant rather than an event. Another is that law enforcement and the legal system have often been more interested in protecting perpetrators and society has often normalized and even celebrated violence against women.Imagine that we had no word for cancer and no recognition of the varieties of ways it manifests, so that we just had occasional lurid news stories about strange and sometimes fatal growths in various parts of various people, not connecting the versions in brains to the versions in prostates and breasts. If we didn’t recognize the common denominators, we couldn’t develop diagnoses and treatments or address root causes. Feminism has in fact offered a diagnosis, steadily, for decades and centuries: that the cause is misogyny and the violence is intended to perpetrate the inequality, exploitation and subordination of women. But the one-case stories avoid this recognition by treating something ubiquitous as exceptional and isolated.The only thing exceptional about Epstein’s crimes was their scale and maybe the complexity of the international financial, transportation and other systems he used to traffic, control, abuse and silence victims. The nature of the crimes was ordinary and common. In the US, there’s arape every 68 seconds, a woman is beaten by an intimate partnerevery nine seconds, and while more men are murdered annually than women, “over half of female homicide victims are killed by a current or former male intimate partner”,according to the CDC. Globally a woman or girl ismurdered by her partner or family memberevery 10 minutes. A high percentage of human trafficking worldwide is of women and girls for sexual exploitation.Instead of focusing on high-profile cases in my opening paragraphs, I could have found examples from the hundreds of cases of sexual abuse of women, girls and boys by ministers of the Southern Baptist church. NPR reported in 2022 that, “the Southern Baptist Convention’s Executive Committee mishandled allegations of sex abuse, stonewalled numerous survivors and prioritized protecting the SBC from liability”. Or thegrotesqueriesof Andrew Cuomo’s allegedsexual harassment and gropingwhile he was governor of New York, followed by his persecution of those who spoke up. I could have brought up that both US and Canadian residential schools for Indigenous children are being exposed as former students who were sexually abused in them find the space to speak out.The pretense that we will find out whether or not Donald Trump is a sexual predator if the Epstein files are released is itself a kind of cover-up, since we already know he is – though I’m all for finding out exactly what it is he’s so frantic to hide. He wasfound liablefor sexually assaulting E Jean Carroll in a 2023 civil trial and has been credibly accused of groping, grabbing, and assault by numerous women. His worse-than-creepy behavior around the teenage girls in beauty pageants he managed iswell-documented, as is his closeness to Epstein.Now, like all the men mentioned in the first paragraphs of this essay, Trump has a protection machine at work – one without precedent. Our own federal government, funded by our taxes, is apparently striving to protect Trump from whatever’s in those files. Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, hasadjourned Congress to protect Trumpfrom Democratic measures meant to force Republicans to vote on releasing the Epstein files. Many high-level officials are serving not We the People, but Trump the Frantic.As the Hillreports, Senator Dick Durbin of the judiciary committee “says he has received information that Attorney General Pam Bondi ‘pressured’ about 1,000 FBI personnel to comb through tens of thousands of pages of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and flag any mention of President Trump”. A thousand workers pulled off their official jobs – this extraordinary effort only makes Trump look like he has a lot to hide.But in another sense the whole society is hiding something: that this violence is everywhere and it deeply shapes – or misshapes – our society. The statistics I cited above address the victims of specific crimes. But all girls and women are impacted by the reality that so many men want to harm us and these crimes could happen to any one of us. This violence affects the choices we make about where to go and when, what jobs to take, when to speak up, what to wear. The threat of violence and actual violence by some men against some women and girls establishes female vulnerability and fear and disempowerment far more broadly. Society has largely required us to alter our lives to avoid this, rather than society being altered to make us free and equal. This violence is an engine of inequality that benefits all men, insofar as being “more equal than others” in this respect is a benefit.The piecemeal stories – “here is this one bad man we need to do something about” – don’t address the reality that the problem is systemic and the solution isn’t police and prison. It’s social change, and societies will have changed enough when violence against women ceases to be a pandemic that stretches across continents and centuries. Systemic problems require systemic responses, and while I’m all for releasing the Epstein files, I want a broader conversation and deeper change.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Now is the time to stand upKica MatosTrump’s budget bill is turbocharging an already brutal enforcement operation. We must meet the momentSun 3 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 14.32 EDTShareOn the Fourth of July, President Trump signed his sweeping signature domestic policy bill into law. He called it “beautiful”. I would call it a grave and existential threat to our already precarious democracy.Perhaps the biggest headline to emerge from this bill is that it tears giant holes into our social safety net to ensure our nation’s wealthiest could benefit from additional tax breaks. But for those of us on the frontlines of the fight to protect immigrants’ rights, it signaled the further entrenchment of an authoritarian regime being created on the backs of immigrants. Irrespective of our immigration status or views on immigration, we should all be concerned because we will all be affected: the sheer quantity of resources set aside for immigration enforcement will turbocharge the militarization of our country.History has taught us that social justice movements can play a significant role in protecting democracies when they are at risk from authoritarian regimes. This bill should be a wakeup call for us all to step up in defense of our democracy before it is too late. Here is what we should anticipate.The law hands over a staggering $170bn to the Department of Homeland Security to ramp up this administration’s brutal immigration enforcement agenda. Among the direct beneficiaries of this largesse is Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).Even without these resources, Ice has already been responsible for outrageous and unconstitutional acts that are hacking away at our democracy. It is Ice agents in masks who are kidnapping our neighbors, snatching them off the streets, at courthouses or their workplaces, shoving them into SUVs, and taking them to detention centers. Many have been deported without even being given the right to go before a judge.Ice agents are using unimaginably harsh tactics. They are violentlysmashing car windows, rippingparents away from their kids, andtargeting children at school. The audacity of their lawlessness and cruelty – often on public display – is unprecedented.The Trump administration has shown a willingness to crack down violently on those who speak out against its immigration policies. Even public officials have been caught in this dragnet, includingCalifornia senator Alex Padilla, New Jerseycongresswoman LaMonica McIver,Newark mayor Ras Baraka, andNew York City mayoral candidate Brad Lander. Every one of these violent encounters has been caught on film.With this new and massive infusion of resources now being handed over to the DHS and Ice, we will soon see many more abductions on our streets, more family separations, and more brutal crackdowns on dissenters. We are also likely to see the widespread militarization of our communities, consistent with what has already transpired in parts of California: heavily armed military officers in battle fatigues carrying out violent raids with the use of tear gas and rubber bullets; the storming of public venues such as MacArthur Park in Los Angeles for no reason other than to instill fear and intimidation; and government-sanctioned attempts to silence and intimidate public officials and activists through arrests, violence, criminal sanctions and prosecutions.As scenes previewed by militarized Los Angeles become commonplace in cities across the country – in blue states, to make an example, and in red states eager to collude – many more Americans will perhaps come to realize the full impact of this bill and recognize that the same system that cages immigrants closes rural hospitals. The same ideology that justifies family separation does not flinch when taking away food from the hungry. A government that disappears immigrants to foreign torture prisons without a day in court cannot be trusted to uphold your rights either. The machine of state violence, once built, expands.So, what are we to do? How do we move forward?It is incumbent on all of us to double down and meet the moment with the urgency it demands. That means committing to doing what we can to protect the most vulnerable amongst us and hold public officials accountable. We must be loud in our opposition to the attacks on our democracy and actively exercise our freedoms to protect it. We must contact our members of Congress to demand that they uphold the rule of law and take on those actively working to undermine our system of checks and balances. We must join the protests and the growing movement of people from all walks of life who are actively fighting authoritarianism. We must do everything we can to support our immigrant friends, neighbors and community members whose lives are being torn apart by this administration.Finally, we must also vigorously reject the paralyzing lure of fatalism – that the future will merely be an extension of our present rather than something we can build together. If our government can pour boundless resources into hurting people, there is nothing radical or unrealistic in insisting that those same resources could be used to better all of our lives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

They include courageous immigrants who refuse to be silenced or dehumanized; retirees who are spending time being of service to impacted immigrants, engaging elected officials and/or attending rallies and town halls; courageous young people who refuse to accept the status quo and are putting their bodies on the line; and entire communities who are speaking out and doing everything possible to protect their neighbors.All of us have a role in upholding justice and preserving our democracy.

But for how long?Richard PartingtonThanks to stockpiling, neither the markets nor consumers have been as badly affected by the trade wars as feared. But signs of trouble are loomingSun 3 Aug 2025 05.51 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 09.35 EDTShareChaotic and unpredictable, keeping up with Donald Trump’s volatile trade war – never mind his presidency – can be tough.Back in April after his “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, the talk was of the president crashing the global economy. Then, after aWall Street backlash, the world learned the acronym “Taco”, which stands for “Trump Always Chickens Out”. Now, things are heating up again.The president’s decision to hit US trading partners – including Canada, Brazil, India and Taiwan – with new tariffs after his self-imposed 1 August deadline certainly reignites a threat to the world economy. Dozens of countries have been left reeling, and US consumers are expected to pay a heavy price.US adds just 73,000 jobs in July amid pressure from Trump’s trade warRead moreHowever, there is a sense that things could have been worse. Nowhere more clearly is this reflected than on Wall Street: despite the chaos of the president’s trade war, the stock market remains close to record levels.After the latest escalation on Friday, and some worrying US jobs numbers, share prices took a hit, sliding by about 1%. But this is a setback rather than a rout.A further slide could be ignited by this capricious president. Trump’s decision tofire the official in charge of labour market dataand his war on the independence of the US Federal Reserve will make matters worse.But despite the warnings of untold economic damage from the US tariff war earlier this year, the American economy has proven surprisingly resilient in recent months.Last week, the president seized on US growth figures showing the economy had expanded at an annualised rate of 3% in the second quarter, far in excess of the 2.4% rate predicted on Wall Street. Could the “fake news” media have it wrong? Are tariff wars “good, and easy to win,” as Trump claims?While inflation has ticked up, from 2.4% in May to 2.7%in June, it is well below the peak that followed the height of the pandemic disruption and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and is far from hitting the levels feared.Back in April, in a country wrought with division, Democratic voters reckoned inflation was on track to hit 7.9% within a year, while Republicans said it would collapse to 0.9%.Butthere is good reason why theUS economyhas so far defied the prophecies of Armageddon. For starters, the hot-cold nature of Trump’s tariff war means investors still anticipate further deals will be done to avoid the worst threats from ever materialising. The toughest tariffs introduced on Friday are only just arriving, too, meaning any impact has yet to emerge.Most countries have not hit back with retaliatory measures, which would have dramatically worsened things by putting international trade into a deeper tailspin.Meanwhile, knowing full well the dangers of this erratic president, businesses have been planning for months to avoid the worst-case scenarios.US companies rushed to stockpile goods before the trade war, helping them to keep prices down for now. Some firms have taken a hit to profits, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank, reckoning this is better than testing struggling American consumers – worn out by years of high inflation – with further price increases.The tariff costs are also being spread by multinationals, by increasing prices across the markets they operate in. In one high-profile example, Sony hasput up the price of its PlayStation 5by as much as 25% in some markets, including the UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. But not in the US.Still, there are signs that consequences are coming. When US businesses exhaust their pre-tariff stockpiles, it is likely that prices will creep higher. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of an erratic president is hitting jobs and investment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tariffs are weighing on business confidence and steadily creeping into consumer prices.GDP growth of 3% might appear robust on the face of things, but this figure was heavily influenced by the 0.5% fall in output in the first quarter, when the surge in US firms rushing to beat Trump’s tariffs distorted activity. Growth in the first half averaged 1.25%, markedly slower than the 2.8% rate for 2024 as a whole.Part of the reason Wall Street remains sanguine about this is the continued belief that things could have turned out worse. Deals are still expected, with the pause in tariffs for key US trade partners Mexico and China suggesting this most clearly.The investor view is that rather than tariffs the president would prefer a string of box-office moments in front of the TV cameras with trade partners paying tribute to the court of Trump.However, it would be wrong to underestimate the self-described “tariff man’s” love of border taxes. And even though his most extreme threats will be negotiated down, the final destination will still be much worse than before. An economic hurricane might be avoided but a storm is still the last thing businesses and consumers need.Britain’s US trade deal is a case in point. A 10% US tariff on British goods has been welcomed as a big victory for Keir Starmer given the alternative, but it is still far worse than before.British cars will face a tariff rate four times higher than previously, costing jobs and growth in Britain while hitting American consumers in the pocket.For the US consumer, the average tariff had been close to 2% before Trump’s return to the White House. After his 1 August escalation, that figure leaps to about 15% – the highest level since the 1930s.Almost a century ago a similar wrong-headed protectionist approach in Washington made the Great Depression far worse: theSmoot-Hawley tariffshit the US and triggered a domino effect among the main industrialised nations, ultimately leading to the second world war.In the unpredictability of Trump’s trade war, hope remains that similar mistakes can be avoided. But significant damage is still being done.Explore more on these topicsTariffsEconomics viewpointTrump tariffsTrump administrationUS politicsUS economyGlobal economyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

The west must pursue a different strategySun 3 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 03.06 EDTShareHanging is the preferredmethod of executionin Iran, although stoning and crucifixion offer alternative options for an ever-vengeful theocracy. Death by hanging is not necessarily quick. Strangulation and suffocation can take several minutes. The UN saysmore than 600 peoplehave been judicially murdered so far this year. Iran has more executions per capita than any country in the world. Since June’s US and Israeli attacks, growing numbers of victims arepolitical dissidents.Fifty days on, nothing remotely positive has resulted from the illegal bombing raids and missile strikes mounted by the US president, Donald Trump, and Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, despite their boasts of world-changing success. Iran’s nuclear facilities were not obliterated, as Trump claimed. Tehran has not abandoned uranium enrichment. The regime did not fall, despite Netanyahu’s call for an uprising. If anything, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ismore defiant. He has since launched anew crackdown on opponents, hence the executions.Deploring last weekend’s hanging of political prisoners Behrouz Ehsani and Mehdi Hassani, Amnesty International linked their fate to the US-Israeli attacks. Arrested in 2022, the two men were charged with rebellion and “enmity against God”. They were tortured, forced to sign confessions and sentenced last year after a five-minute trial. The decision to execute them now “highlights the authorities’ ruthless use of the death penalty as a tool of political repression in times of national crisis to crush dissent and spread fear”,Amnesty said.Hundreds have been arrested since June in a regime drive to unmask spies and collaborators, real or imagined. Glaring intelligence failures that, for example, allowed Israel to locate and bomb a national security council meeting,injuring Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, are officially blamed not on gross incompetence but supposed fifth columnists. Iran’s parliament wants to expand use of capital punishment.Up to 60 political prisoners face execution.This typically harsh reaction by clerical hardliners around Khamenei, and within the judiciary and Revolutionary Guards, comes despite a surge in patriotic sentiment after the attacks, which reportedly killed at least 935 people, mostly civilians, and injured more than 5,000. Byintensifying repression, the regime squandered a chance to harness public anger, not least against Britain and European governments thatturned a blind eye.US-Israeli actions have had other far-reaching, negative consequences. The attacks breached the UN charter and international law, as theBrics group of “global south” countries noted. They led Tehran to suspend UN nuclear inspections. They exacerbated US-Europe divisions. And, ironically, theyincreased the likelihoodof Iran building a bomb for self-defence.1:22Khamenei says Iran will strike back if US hits again, in first remarks since ceasefire – videoIran insists it does not possess and does not want nuclear weapons. For all Israel’s vaunted intelligence capabilities, neither Netanyahu nor anyone else has definitively proved otherwise. The decision to attack was based on a guess, driven by fear and hatred. It caused serious physical damage, but did notchange mindsets. Iran is adamant it willcontinue to enrich uraniumfor civilian purposes. The bombing was a bust. Trump’s angry threat tostrike againis confirmation of failure.What this reckless act of aggressiondiddo is encourage rogue states such as Russia to believe they, too, may attack other countries with impunity. It reinforces the belief in Iranian ruling circles, and not only among rejectionist factions, that the west cannot be trusted and acloser alliance with Chinais necessary. It strengthens the hand of hardliners whose fondness for regional proxy warfare, and recently documentedcovert operationsagainst Britain, has entrenched Iran’s pariah status.Historically speaking, Iran was and is an avoidable tragedy – one of the west’s worst-ever geostrategic own goals. Unthinking support for the shah helped spur the 1979 revolution. The subsequent, far from inevitable ascendancy of conservative clerics plus abiding, irrational US animosity, feeding off memories of thehumiliating Tehran embassy siege, rendered the rift permanent. Europe tried and failed to chart a middle path. In 2018, Trump reneged on the US-, UN- and EU-ratified nuclear deal with Tehran andreimposed sanctions. This last of many disastrous policy mistakes led directly to today’s impasse. With wiser heads, it could have been very different.In this time of rancour, fear and war, peaceful nuclear cooperation in the Middle East is still possible | Javad ZarifRead moreAll parties to this conflict should study the French Enlightenment philosopherCharles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu, a foe to tyranny in all its forms. Writing in his 1721 bestsellerPersian Lettersmore than 300 years ago, he issues an impressively prescient warning about what were then imaginary weapons of mass destruction. “You say that you are afraid of the discovery of some method of destruction that is crueller than those which are used now,” his fictitious Persian traveller Usbek writes to a friend. “If such a fateful invention came to be discovered, it would soon be banned by international law. By the unanimous consent of every country the discovery would be buried.”In the sense that nuclear weapons are outlawed, Usbek’s optimistic prediction was correct. Butnot “every country” complies. If the US and Israel are sincere about preventing Iran acquiring the bomb, they should set an example and reduce, and ultimately eliminate, their nuclear arsenals. They should stop threatening renewed attacks. And they should back talks on a regional nuclear pact, as proposed by Iran’s former foreign ministerMohammad Javad Zarif.Only then, perhaps, will Tehran come in from the cold. Only then, perhaps, will its paranoid leaders stop hanging innocent people.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But users must be wary of the many risks involvedThe modern mindis a column where experts discuss mental health issues they are seeing in their workSun 3 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 19.04 EDTShareTran* sat across from me, phone in hand, scrolling. “I just wanted to make sure I didn’t say the wrong thing,” he explained, referring to a disagreement with his partner. “So I askedChatGPTwhat I should say.”He read the chatbot-generated message aloud. It was articulate, logical and composed – too composed. It didn’t sound like Tran. And it definitely didn’t sound like someone in the middle of a complex emotional conversation about the future of a long-term relationship. It also did not mention anywhere some of Tran’s contributing behaviours to the relationship strain that Tran and I had been discussing.Like many others I’ve seen in therapy, Tran had turned to AI in a moment of crisis. Under immense pressure at work and facing uncertainty in his relationship, he’d downloaded ChatGPT on his phone “just to try it out”. What began as a curiosity soon became a daily habit, asking questions, drafting texts and even seeking reassurance about his own feelings. The more Tran used it, the more he began to second-guess himself in social situations, turning to the model for guidance before responding to colleagues or loved ones. He felt strangely comforted, like “no one knew me better”.His partner, on the other hand, began to feel as though she was talking to someone else entirely.ChatGPT and other generative AI models present a tempting accessory, or even alternative, to traditional therapy. They’re often free, available 24/7 and can offer customised, detailed responses in real time. When you’re overwhelmed, sleepless and desperate to make sense of a messy situation, typing a few sentences into a chatbot and getting back what feels like sage advice can be very appealing.But as a psychologist, I’m growing increasingly concerned about what I’m seeing in the clinic; a silent shift in how people are processing distress and a growing reliance on artificial intelligence in place of human connection and therapeutic support.AI might feel like a lifeline when services are overstretched – and make no mistake, services are overstretched. Globally, in 2019one in eight people were living with a mental illnessand we face a dire shortage of trained mental health professionals. In Australia, there has been a growing mental health workforce shortage that is limiting access to trained professionals.Clinician time is one of the scarcest resources in healthcare. It’s understandable (even expected) that people are looking for alternatives. But turning to a chatbot for emotional support isn’t without risk, especially when the lines between advice, reassurance and emotional dependence become blurred.Many psychologists, myself included, now encourage clients to build boundaries around their use of ChatGPT and similar tools. Its seductive “always-on” availability and friendly tone can unintentionally reinforce unhelpful behaviours, especially for people with anxiety, OCD or trauma-related issues. Reassurance-seeking, for example, is a key feature in OCD and ChatGPT, by design, provides reassurance in abundance. It never asks why you’re asking again. It never challenges avoidance. It never says, “Let’s sit with this feeling for a moment, and practise the skills we have been working on.”From corner office to crossroads: navigating purpose and identity after retirement |  Gaynor Parkin and Dave WinsboroughRead moreTran often reworded prompts until the model gave him an answer that “felt right”. But this constant tailoring meant he wasn’t just seeking clarity; he was outsourcing emotional processing. Instead of learning to tolerate distress or explore nuance, he sought AI-generated certainty. Over time that made it harder for him to trust his own instincts.Beyond psychological concerns, there are real ethical issues. Information shared with ChatGPT isn’t protected by the same confidentiality standards as registeredAhpra professionals. Although OpenAI states that data from users is not used to train its models unless permission is given, the sheer volume of fine print in user agreements often goes unread. Users may not realise how their inputs can be stored, analysed and potentially reused.There’s also the risk of harmful or false information. These large language models are autoregressive; they predict the next word based on previous patterns. This probabilistic process can lead to “hallucinations”, confident, polished answers that are completely untrue.AI also reflects the biases embedded in its training data. Research shows that generative models can perpetuate and even amplify gender, racial and disability-based stereotypes – not intentionally, but unavoidably. Human therapists also possess clinical skills; we notice when a client’s voice trembles, or when their silence might say more than words.This isn’t to say AI can’t have a place. Like many technological advancements before it, generative AI is here to stay. It may offer useful summaries, psycho-educational content or even support in regions where access to mental health professionals is severely limited. But it must be used carefully, and never as a replacement for relational, regulated care.Tran wasn’t wrong to seek help. His instincts to make sense of distress and to communicate more thoughtfully were logical. But leaning so heavily on to AI meant that his skill development suffered. His partner began noticing a strange detachment in his messages. “It just didn’t sound like you,” she later told him. It turned out it wasn’t.She also became frustrated about the lack of accountability in his correspondence to her and this caused more relational friction and communication issues between them.As Tran and I worked together in therapy, we explored what led him to seek certainty in a chatbot. We unpacked his fears of disappointing others, his discomfort with emotional conflict and his belief that perfect words might prevent pain. Over time, he began writing his own responses, sometimes messy, sometimes unsure, but authentically his.Good therapy is relational. It thrives on imperfection, nuance and slow discovery. It involves pattern recognition, accountability and the kind of discomfort that leads to lasting change. A therapist doesn’t just answer; they ask and they challenge. They hold space, offer reflection and walk with you, while also offering up an uncomfortable mirror.For Tran, the shift wasn’t just about limiting his use of ChatGPT; it was about reclaiming his own voice. In the end he didn’t need a perfect response. He needed to believe that he could navigate life’s messiness with curiosity, courage and care – not perfect scripts.*Name and identifying details changed to protect client confidentialityCarly Dober is a psychologist living and working in Naarm/MelbourneIn Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, and atMensLineon 1300 789 978.

Starmer should be honest about this, and get on with the hard work it will requireSimon McDonald was the British ambassador to Israel from 2003 to 2006Sun 3 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 09.18 EDTShareThe idea that if you really, really believe something you can make it happen seems to be the best explanation for Britain and France’s recent statements that they willrecognise a Palestinianstate. No matter how fervent Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are, their fervour will not make an impossible thing happen. There is no Palestinian state, and there certainly won’t be one by September.For mostly domestic political reasons, they have decided to set aside that fact. Recognition is an understandable gesture, but it will do nothing to solvethe current famine, and is doomed in the short term because there is no real state to recognise. But there’s also a clear reason why some sort of action – even if it’s purely symbolic – is needed. The situation in Gaza is appalling. If Starmer and Macron proceed with recognition, how can we manage the short-term disappointment of recognising a state that does not exist, while moving towards a two-state solution in the long term?In 1933, the Montevideo convention, a treaty signed in the Uruguayan capital by 19 states, all from the Americas, set out criteria that had to be fulfilled when recognising a new state. The criteria were agreed at the international conference of American states but are applied by the whole international community. Although not formal legal requirements, they provide a useful framework when considering whether or not to recognise a state. The three most important are “people”, “territory” and “governance”. Is there a permanent population? Does that population occupy a defined territory whose borders it controls? And does it have a single recognised government?The international community has recognised the distinctiveness of the Palestinian people since the 1970s. That’s the main reason why 78 countries recognised the state of Palestine within months of the Palestine National Council’s declaration of independence in November 1988. But the Palestinians have never controlled their territory. The Oslo accords in 1993 gave full security control to the Palestinians in 18% of the West Bank. Over time, that area was supposed to enlarge. That never happened.And in 2007, Hamas took control ofGaza. The Palestinian Authority (PA), under the control of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), remained in charge in the West Bank, while Hamas controlled Gaza. Two rival Palestinian administrations remain in place.Widespread international recognition of Palestine has made no difference to the lives of ordinary Palestinians. So far, 147 UN member states have recognised Palestine, including China and Russia. When Ireland, Norway and Spain recognised Palestinian statehood last year, all four governments claimed that recognition sent a signal that couldn’t be ignored. But it hasn’t helped the Palestinian people one jot.Israel(and the US) barely noticed, beyond saying disobliging things about rewarding a “death cult”. They didn’t change their policy.UK and French action will probably be treated with the same contempt in Jerusalem and Washington. But, despite Israeli denigration of their action, London and Paris won’t be able to agree effective measures to penalise Israel, such as sanctions. Both governments still believe in Israel and its right to defend itself. Both still abhor what happened on 7 October 2023, and still see manifest shortcomings in the way the PA is run. Both the UK andFranceas part of the EU proscribe Hamas as a terrorist organisation.In fact, British and French recognition may make matters worse. Hamas may see advantages in sweeping away the corrupt gerontocracy in Ramallah; it is more popular than the PA in the West Bank these days. Benjamin Netanyahu, who doesn’t subscribe to a two-state solution, may step up operations in both Gaza and the West Bank to underline who’s in charge, and send a rather more effective message to Britain and France than they send to him.A two-state solution remains the only way to achieve long-term peace, but right now conditions for one could not be more hostile. For that reason, Britain and France recognising Palestine is an empty gesture. But the recognition boat seems to have sailed. Both Britain and France have made forward-leaning statements; governments find it hard to ignore incessant public demands.And public opinion is responding to what Israel is doing in Gaza. Collective punishment is unlawful. What Israel is doing to the population of Gaza because Hamas refuses to hand over 50 hostages (about 20 living and 30 dead) and dismantle its leadership amounts to collective punishment. Israel is not doing nearly enough to prevent starvation.By September, Israel won’t have fulfilled the conditions that Starmer has set out to avert recognition. And Israel (and its supporters) will say that’s no fault of Israel’s. The British government will still have freedom of manoeuvre either to recognise the state of Palestine or postpone recognition. But at that point failing to recognise would look just as weak as I believe recognising looks right now. What to do?The government could recognise Palestine while acknowledging the weakness of doing so. Ministers should go easy on rhetoric claiming it’s a historic moment, and focus instead on basic principles and the future. The only way for two peoples to live side by side in peace is for each to have its own state. Israel did not fulfil the criteria for statehood when it was first created. But Israel’s friends overlooked its shortcomings, while its foes (such as Stalin) argued that the Jews were not even a people.The unique complexity of Israel/Palestine’s history and geography will mean that the state of Palestine, when it’s real, is likely to look different from any of the other 193 members of the UN. It might not have an army. It might not have exclusive control over its borders. But it will still be worth it. The Palestinian people deserve better than the fate they have suffered for decades, a fate which has deteriorated horribly since theceasefire broke down in March this year. We must not forget them.Perhaps the best option in September would be for Britain to embrace the fact that it’s making a gesture, and not pretend that gesture had immediate, far-reaching consequences. It would make the gesture recognising that time, hard work and imagination were still needed to reach the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but that, at this desperate time, such a gesture was the last best hope to keep that solution alive. In diplomacy, it is vital not to mistake activity for effective action. But sometimes activity is all we have to offer.Lord McDonald of Salford was the British ambassador to Israel from 2003 to 2006, and permanent secretary at the Foreign Office from 2015 to 2020.

More than a year after the international court of justice (ICJ)ordered Israelto “take all measures within its power” to prevent acts of genocide – and despite all our warnings – we are still witnessing starvation, insufficient access to water, a sanitation crisis and a crumbling health system against a backdrop of ongoing violence that is resulting in scores of Palestinians being killed daily, including children.Powerless to change this, we humanitarians have resorted to using our voices – alongside those of Palestinian journalists who risk everything – to describe the appalling, inhuman conditions inGaza. Speaking out, as I’m doing now, in the face of deliberate, preventable suffering is part of our role to promote respect for international law.But doing so comes at a price. After I held a press briefing in Gaza on 22 June in which I described how starving civilians were being shot while trying to reach food – what I called “conditions created to kill” – the Israeli minister of foreign affairs announced in apost on Xthat my visa would not been renewed. The Israeli permanent representative to the UN followed up at the security council announcing that I would be expected to leave by 29 July.This silencing is part of a broader pattern. International NGOs face increasingly restrictive registration requirements, including clauses that prohibit certain criticism of Israel. Palestinian NGOs that, against the odds, continue to save lives daily are cut off from the resources they need to operate. UN agencies are increasingly being issued only six, three or one-month visas based on whether they are considered “good, bad or ugly”. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (Unwra) has been targeted through legislation, its international staff barred from entry and its operations slowly suffocated.These reprisals cannot erase the reality we’ve witnessed – day in, day out – not just in Gaza but in the West Bank too. What I have observed there looks different from what is unfolding in Gaza, but there is a unified purpose: severing territorial continuity and forcing Palestinians into ever-shrinking enclaves. Palestinians in the West Bank are daily being coerced and contained: coerced by settler violence and demolitions out of areas where settlements are expanding and contained by a network of movement restrictions into disconnected built-up areas where there are increasing military operations.Gaza is also being fragmented. Its 2.1 million people are now being crammed into just12% of the land area of the Strip. I remember receiving the chilling call on 13 October 2023 announcing the forced displacement of the entirety of northern Gaza. Since that brutal opening act, almost all of Gaza has been forcibly displaced – not once but repeatedly – without sufficient shelter, food or safety. I have seen first-hand what appears to be the systematic dismantling of the means to sustain Palestinian life. As part of our role to coordinate humanitarian operations, my colleagues and I have helped carry patients out of dark, cat-infested ICU wards in destroyed hospitals overtaken by Israeli forces where the dead were being buried in the courtyard by the last remaining sleep-deprived staff who had witnessed their colleagues being marched away.We helped uncover mass graves in other hospital courtyards where families searched through scattered clothes trying to identify loved ones who had been stripped before being killed or disappeared. We have argued with soldiers who were trying to forcibly remove a screaming spinal cord injury patient from an ambulance while being evacuated from a hospital. We have repatriated the bodies of humanitarian workers killed by drone strikes and tank fire while trying to deliver aid, and collected the bodies of family members of NGO workers who were killed in sites acknowledged by Israeli forces as “humanitarian” locations.We have seen medics in their uniforms killed and buried under ambulances crushed by Israeli forces. Overcrowded shelters for displaced people bombed, with parents clutching their injured or dead children. Countless bodies in the streets being eaten by dogs. People calling from beneath rubble, with help from first responders denied until no one was left breathing. Children wasting away from malnutrition while aid navigates an insurmountable obstacle course of obstructionism.Israeli authorities accuse us of being the problem. They say we are failing to collect goods from the crossings. We aren’t failing, we are being obstructed. Just last week I was on a convoy headed to Kerem Shalom crossing from inside Gaza. We escorted empty trucks through a densely crowded area, an unnecessarily complicated route provided by Israeli forces. When the trucks were lined up at a holding point and the green light to move to the crossing finally came from Israeli forces, thousands of desperate people moved with us, hoping the trucks would return with food. As we crawled forward, people clung to the vehicles until we saw the first dead body on the side of the road, shot in the back from the direction of Israeli forces. At the crossing, the gate was shut. We waited around two hours for a soldier to open it.That convoy took 15 hours to complete. With other convoys, Israeli forces have delayed returning trucks while crowds gather and killed desperate people who were waiting for the trucks to arrive. Some of our goods have been looted by armed gangs operating under the watch of Israeli forces.During the ceasefire, we ran multiple convoys a day. Now chaos, killing and obstruction are again the norm. Aid is vital, but it will never be a cure for engineered scarcity.The ICJ has been clear. In its binding provisional measures, it not only ordered Israel to prevent acts prohibited under thegenocide convention, it also ordered Israel to enable urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance, including by increasing aid crossings. In a separate advisory opinion, the ICJ left no room for doubt: Israel’s ongoing occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is unlawful under international law. Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, are different parts of the same picture.What is unfolding is not complicated. It is not inevitable. It is the result of deliberate political choices by those who create these conditions and those who enable them. The end of the occupation is long overdue. The credibility of the multilateral system is being weakened by double standards and impunity. International law cannot be a tool of convenience for some if it is to be a viable tool of protection for all.Gaza is already drowning beneath bombs, starvation and the relentless grip of the blockade on essentials for survival. Every delay in enforcing the most basic rules meant to protect human life is another hand pressing Gaza down as it struggles for breath.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I was supposed to have a break for a few weeks while those pieces ran, but I found I couldn’t: I was making notes before I left the hospital.Looking back, I can see that there are a few things I got wrong in those few years. I never pretended to be an expert, and tried to be upfront about the fact that I was very much learning on the job. So here is a potted list of things I regret: I was wrong to be so dismissive ofbaby-led weaning. I had anxiety from a difficult birth and my son being hospitalised, and I was neurotic about choking. My son was preterm and wasn’t ready to be handling big bits of food at six months, but I didn’t realise that at the time (still, I maintain that people are weird and culty about it). Also, I was wrong to make a joke about “tummy time” not mattering: tummy time matters, especially for kids with certain disabilities. And I was wrong, possibly, or at least inconsiderate, to write about how having a baby had madeChristmas feel so special. A woman who had just had a miscarriage sent me a message saying it had made her cry, and I think, were I to write that column again, I would try to better acknowledge the pain of those with infertility and baby loss – the subject ofmy columnthe following Christmas.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Pia BramleyStill, there is a lot I stand by. I still think two weeks ofstatutory paternity leaveis pathetic and embarrassing. I still don’t think dads can have it all, either. I still don’t think there is a quick fix tobaby sleep. I still thinkbreastfeeding promotion policyin this country is a disaster, which sidelines maternal mental health anddoesn’t even workin the process. And I still passionately hateBill Thompson, from Postman Pat – the snarky little sod with an attitude problem whose voice continues to grate on me even as my son giggles with delight at his antics (although his favourite character is Michael).If there’s one lesson I’ve learned in the last three years of being a mother – and of writing about it – it’s that all of my readers were right: those first days, weeks and months really do pass so quickly, and though they can be hard, a part of you will long for them. Had I not written it down, I am sure there is so much I would have forgotten. In that sense, it’s been a gift. I’ll never get to hold my son as a baby again, or to hear the little truffle pig grunts as he sought me out for milk, but the writing of an experience helps to hold it in time, can even transport you back. Readers, too: I have been so moved by how many of you said you were in the trenches with me, or those, older, who said my writing helped conjure that time for them.It’s a funny thing, being a columnist. I picture my readers all the time, mainly because I hear from so many of you (your messages, emails and comments below the line have been the best part of this job), but it didn’t occur to me that you might picture me. The reality three-and-a-half years ago wasn’t pretty: I was newly postpartum, reeling, sleep-deprived. Often I wrote while “the bairn” screamed in the other room, cared for by my husband, or my mother – both of them are the hidden labour behind this column. For some reason, I had been arrogant enough to think writing with a newborn would be easy.Of all the things I have got wrong as a writer, that was probably the main one. There was this look I used to get in the run-up, when I told friends and family who were already parents that I was planning to document it all, in real time, and report on others’ experiences, too. It was a kind of wordless, smiling nod, the sort you also often get when you say that you want a water birth with no pain relief, or that you and your partner are solid and that a baby won’t change that. It’s often followed by a hesitant sentence before the person trails off.Just you wait,the knackered goblin in their head is hissing, but they’re too nice to say anything, and so they don’t.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Pia BramleySo that was my first error. In a way, I’m glad I made it, because otherwise I would not have written, and despite the fact that any time a female writer produces anything at all about motherhood she’s accused of thinking she’s the first woman in the world to have ever had a baby, when you look at the history of humanity we are still very much in the early days of women writing about this. We forget that for many centuries we weren’t even taught to write. Our knowledge was passed between us, and passed down, through the words that we spoke to one another, and to our daughters. I started this column because very little of the writing that existed then – brilliant as it is – seemed to speak to parents of my generation and younger, who face unique challenges. Now, there is far more, and it feels as though with every year that passes our voices are being taken more seriously.Choosing columns from this series to stitch together into a book was an emotional process. The thread that runs through them all is the feeling that, when it comes to parenting, having a feeling of community and solidarity are paramount. So it’s my story,but you have all been a part of it, too, from the many, many readers who have sent encouragement and advice, to the grandfather who said that he dances with his baby granddaughter now because he won’t live to see her wedding. Even the dad who said you don’t need to do anything with your kids until their teens, whereupon you can simply take them white-water rafting, taught me something. So many of you have been a part of this journey.

People who later repaid the investment in their intellectual curiosity by making contributions that helped make the society healthier, more informed and inclusive, richer and more agile.But now it often feels like stepping on to a battlefield where the other side has the numbers, the KPIs and the money. Success is judged by the metrics, completion time, articles published, grants received – not the contribution to knowledge that was the purpose to the study.Tim Winton among 100 high-profile Australians calling for university fees that don’t ‘punish’ arts studentsRead moreAcademics in the humanitieshave been on the frontline of the huge job cuts, students have for more than a decade been taught by often underpaid casual staff who scoot from one gig campus to another to make an almost living wage, research funds have dwindled and the success rate for humanities applications fallen so low it is a lottery.And thanks to another of the poisonous legacies of the ill-fated, yet damaging, Morrison government, the fees to undertake a basic arts degree in the low-cost humanities have skyrocketed to $50,000. It’s not surprising that in 2024 there wereabout 12,000 fewerstudents enrolled in culture and society programs than a decade earlier, and the number of students in creative arts degrees have dropped by a third over that decade.The neoliberal economists were right – self-interest, especially when considering taking on a massive debt, can win.Those least able to countenance such indebtedness are the distant relatives of those who in previous generations were able to transform their lives by taking the opportunities presented by commonwealth and teacher’s scholarships, free and low-cost university study.AsJacqui Lambie saidin her scathing attack on the Job Ready Graduates scheme when it was introduced by the Morrison government: “I’ll be damned if I’ll vote to tell those kids in rural and regional areas of Tasmania that they deserve to have their opportunities suffocated … no matter how gifted, no matter how determined.”Australia’s long-term success and global influence isdue more to its educated peoplethan the resources beneath the soil.Attacks on the humanities are not new but they are now more lethal as the routines of corporate logic have been instrumentalised by university managements keen to squeeze the last penny out of challenged operational budgets, while capital budgets continue to be deployed to rebuild campuses as five-star resorts.Young Australians have much higher student debt than generations before them, data showsRead moreThere are huge paradoxes at the centre of the attack on the universities here and around the world.The US administration advocates freedom of speech but academics there are often too afraid to send emails to colleagues that might be discovered and interpreted as criticism of the government; research that might challenge is cancelled; visiting international fellows are advised not to leave the US for conferences for fear they may not be allowed to return.The chill is at odds with the purpose of education – to expand the mind, increase opportunities, build better civilisations.We are living with an epidemic of moral injury as we watch the devastation in Gaza and the obsequious responses of world leaders to the US president. We need the guidance of moral philosophers more than ever.The study of religion, philosophy, history, literature and music were key foundation stones of the ancient universities and their replicas in colonial Australia. It is in these places that scholars and students have for centuries mastered and created knowledge.It is this huge legacy of thought and analysis, art and story-telling, that is nowbeing usedto train the large language models of generative artificial intelligence.AI may yet be as transformative as its boosters suggest, but it would not be possible without the humanities and social sciences. These are the disciplines that have built the knowledge the bots are now mining. Yet when talking about the future, the dominant discourse is about business and science, not the content that essentially derives from the humanities and social sciences.The Jobs Ready Graduates scheme was one of the ways the Morrison government punished the universities,forcing them to make decisionsthat suited its poorly considered priorities. It also refused jobkeeper support to the sector despite its economic importance.At the time Labor opposed the policy and committed to revoke it on election. The higher education review commissioned by the Albanese government reinforced the assessment that this was poor policy. But it endures, even in a caucus where nearly half the members have an arts degree. Too hard, too expensive, not my responsibility are the mealy mouthed responses.Governments have allowed, and some would say encouraged, the corporate model of the university with its purposeless adoption of corporate strategies, to predominate. Intervening to change this is now hard, as parliamentary inquiries have shown.But if the pandemic taught us nothing else, it is that when the need is great, money can be found. Abolishing the punishing fees for arts degrees must be within reach if Australia seriously wants to actively participate in the information age and give this generation the opportunities we all need them to have.Julianne Schultz is emeritus professor media and culture at Griffith University and author of The Idea of Australia.

Recently, I’ve found myself waking early, with dawn on the horizon. I think it might be beautiful to catch the sunrise, and in those quiet moments, I am reminded of the bustle of the city, or a lover’s hand in mine, or the words that I couldn’t quite say, and, looking back towards the sky, find the sun already risen. I rue that I’ve missed it; I’m surprised it arrived so quickly. But for a moment, the light shines bright; and briefly, the parts of myself I don’t always get to are illuminated. In these moments, I’m reminded of our aliveness.Much of my writing practice is concerned with closing the gap between emotion and expression. The sense of loss in this chasm is inevitable; it’s impossible to translate the excitement of seeing a loved one across the room, or the bodily jolt that arrives when you pass a friend on the street and realise you have become strangers. But still, I try to write, asVirginia Woolfdid, not so much concerned with knowledge, but withfeeling.And since language won’t always get you there, I employ music, rhythm.Woolf does this masterfully in Mrs Dalloway. She was not just concerned with the notes of an instrument, but moments when a pianist’s hands might hover over the keys, or the break before a trumpeter blows; and even before that, what route did the pianist take to work today? What did the trumpeter say to his wife before they slept the night before, and what did she say back? And even further back: what might the musician have witnessed, at 18, which has shaped their life? How did Sally Seton kissing Clarissa Dalloway – a moment Woolf describes as a revelation, a religious experience – shape both their lives? The question that pulses through this novel: how do we come to be? They may not be musical notes but these questions and their answers are all music of some kind.Woolf also writes with a painterly touch. The images she conjures remind me of work by my favourite painter,Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, in which the interior preoccupations are externalised in the strokes on the canvas, both tender and sure; in the ways characters fill the frame with their bodies, their personhoods; in the ways the backgrounds speak as much to the narrative as the foremost subject does.London is not just a backdrop but an essential character – it is a living, breathing organismIn Woolf’s work, there are rarely any direct gazes. Everyone looks away, unable to wrangle with the feeling of being seen, or they glance away when caught. And you understand. It can be scary to be seen. All these emotions and feelings, preoccupations and fears, all out in the open, with nowhere to hide. And yet, if we don’t show ourselves, Woolf suggests, it’s impossible to truly live.Speaking of backgrounds, allow me a couple of indulgences here: the first, the city. Specifically, the city of London, which I’ve always known as home, have always known and loved, for all its ways. In Mrs Dalloway, London is not just a backdrop but an essential character. It is a living, breathing organism, to be held, touched, traversed, poked and prodded. To be, in some way, loved. Woolf writes in relation to our love of London, foolish as it may be. And yet, I cannot resist the allure of the city, because it’s home to me. The way the streets speak; the frenetic pace of its workers; the all-knowing boom of Big Ben, followed by St Margaret’s; “the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands”;the way quiet breaks open on entering St James’s Park accented only by the slow steps of others, or the flap of ducks swimming in the pond; the way the symphony starts back up as soon as you break out of the park, on to the streets, a distinct hum being heard all round, rising up from the ground. The city hums.View image in fullscreenCaleb Azumah Nelson photographed in Peckham in April 2023.Photograph: Ejatu Shaw/The ObserverBut the hum isn’t coming from the pavement. Home, whether it is a city, or town, or village, can only really be its people. The London of Mrs Dalloway, the London I know, is filled with parents and children, lovers and enemies, strangers and familiar faces; filled with love and envy, ambition and grief; filled with an immense beauty, a beauty she, I, might witness “in people’s eyes”. And if we look closely, as strangers and lovers pass us, we might see this beauty as further evidence of our aliveness.And, if you’ll allow me, I’d like to speak briefly on love. When I mention the ecstatic or this notion of aliveness, I’m speaking to the moments that are at the height and depths of the human experience. Love encompasses all of these categories. Early on in the novel, Woolf broaches Clarissa’s relationship with Sally Seton: “had not that, after all, been love?”It makes me wonder, is love a question, or does it make us question? Does it make us ask “who is that?”when confronted with our pull towards another? Does it make us reframe this pull as something that cannot be resisted,as if desire is something to be resisted, as if it is weakness and not virtue?There are no answers, only more questions. But I’d like to point to ecstasy, to one person’s lips meeting with another: “the radiance burnt through, the revelation, the religious feeling”.Is this not how it feels to be closest to oneself? To feel the most alive? There are no answers, only more questions. But I think, this is what love does. It expands our lives and the ways we express ourselves by making space for our truest, deepest desires, even if we’re only glimpsing these needs for a moment. It questions how we came to be, and what we need to go on; it finds us in the space between who we have been and who we are trying to become. And right there, in the midst of it all, love holds up a mirror to see ourselves, our full selves.Grief, I think, is both love’s opposite and companion. The grief of a life you might have lived. The grief of a person you might have been. And grief arrives not as loss but its inarticulacies. Clarissa is able to say what happened to her sister, Sylvia, felled by a tree, but she struggles to say how it made herfeel.She’s able to understand that if she had married Peter, “this gaiety would have been mine all day!”but she struggles with the emotional heft of this possibility. Some people never find the language to express their grief, or else it tumbles down the chasm between emotion and expression; but we try. “It is a thousand pities never to say what one feels”,but we try. Sometimes, the moonlight briefly vanishes as night does; the sun doesn’t blaze but a new dawn breaks; and with that first light, that early sunshine before any clouds appear, the grief eases. And, doused in sunlight, once more, we are reminded, we are alive.Extracted from a talk commissioned by Charleston festival 2025.Explore more on these topicsFictionVirginia WoolffeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’re having breakfast in Manhattan on a sunny Saturday in early July, a few weeks after her new film, Materialists, has opened in New York City. She’s wearing a charmingly ironic outfit: a T-shirt that says “HOWDY” and a baseball cap that says “Big” (she’s petite, 5ft 4in, for the record) – but she speaks with almost disarming earnestness.She’s frustrated, she tells me, that people have described one of the characters in her film, a private equity manager with a $12m apartment, as a “billionaire”. “If you’re a billionaire, your big apartment is not $12m!” she exclaims. “The average income of an American adult is $35,000. What that means is half of America makes less than $35,000. Three times that is $100,000. Ten of that is $1m. And a billion dollars is not a hundred of that. No, it’s a thousand of that.”She’s offended because a billionaire would never be a likable character in her movie. “I think because of how visible billionaires are, we think that’s what wealth is. And I’m like: no, that’s justcrime.”View image in fullscreenStoop to conquer … Celine Song (left) with Dakota Johnson and Chris Evans on the set of Materialists.Photograph: Atsushi Nishijima/APIt’s a bit unusual to be talking about financial literacy in the context of a romcom, the genre that Materialists defiantly embraces with its story of a high-end matchmaker (Dakota Johnson) torn between an old flame with no money (Chris Evans) and a suave, moneyed suitor, the “not-billionaire” in question (Pedro Pascal). Romantic comedies, particularly those set in New York City, tend to be escapist fantasies: you’re not supposed to wonder how the heroine can afford to live in a swanky one-bedroom in Manhattan or wear Louboutins; you’re certainly not supposed to ponder the moral implications of the hero’s wealth.But in Materialists, every detail is spelled out. Early in the film, Lucy (Johnson) announces to Harry (Pascal) that she makes “$80,000 a year before taxes” – something the private equity partner should keep in mind before pursuing her. The characters’ apartments, Song says, were carefully researched and designed based on their economic situations. There’s Harry’s $12m penthouse in the expensive Manhattan neighbourhood Tribeca. Lucy lives in an aspirational studio in the posh neighbourhood of Brooklyn Heights that she rented right before the Covid-19 pandemic (Song looked on US real estate website Zillow to estimate the rent); Evans’s character John lives with three roommates in south-west Brooklyn’s Sunset Park. (It was supposed to be in Williamsburg, before the film’s construction crew said that he’d never be able to afford that.)The American dream is not achievable. One of the few ways you can jump class is marriageIt’s not that Song is a mercenary realist. The only subject that makes her eyes light up as much as money is love, which she describes as “being hit by lightning”. Song’s first feature film, Past Lives, which nabbed two Oscar nominations in 2024, spins a beautiful time-crossing and bicultural saga around a happily married Korean immigrant in the US – a stand-in for Song – who re-encounters a childhood sweetheart and confronts the life that could have been. The characters talk about inyeon, a Buddhist belief in relationships as something fated and cosmic, cutting across life cycles.There’s no such wistful dreaming in Materialists. Harry’s romantic overture to Lucy is to tell her that he’s interested in her “intangible assets”; he wants to date the broker, the person who decides who is and isn’t valuable. “I feel like as we grow into this efficiency-focused, productivity-focused way of thinking about the world, everything we do is so that we can be better, faster, stronger,” Song says of our culture of relentless optimisation. “Where is the place where you’re just like an animal who’s trying to live?”View image in fullscreenLove nor money … Dakota Johnson and Pedro Pascal in Materialists.Photograph: Atsushi NishijimaSong, 36, was born in Seoul to artist parents. She says her father, a film-maker, named her after the impish stage magician played by Juliet Berto in Jacques Rivette’s French new wave classic Céline and Julie Go Boating. When Song was 12, the family emigrated to Ontario, Canada, where she lived throughout her college years, before moving to New York to pursue a master of fine arts degree in playwriting at Columbia University. By the time she started making movies, she had achieved considerable success in theatre for deeply personal, yet daringly experimental plays, including 2019’s Endlings, which weaves together the stories of three female Korean divers and a Korean-Canadian writer in New York, and a live production of The Seagull on the Sims 4, staged during lockdown in 2020.Song never really suffered the indignities of modern dating. As portrayed in Past Lives, she met her husband, the screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes – who recently wrote Luca Guadagnino’s tennis film Challengers – at a writing residency in Montauk in Long Island when she was 24. But in her early years in New York, she got a pretty acrid taste of dating culture when she worked as a matchmaker for six months, after hearing about the gig from a friend in the industry. It seemed like an “HR job” with a more “involved client-facing element” – and Song had studied psychology in her undergraduate years.But she knew she couldn’t make lightning strike for her clients, and they knew it, too. “I was basically given instructions on who to say no to,” she says of the job. “They were saying: ‘I’m not even available to get hit by lightning by certain people who don’t meet my criteria.’” The worst of them, sampled in the film, were brazen with their bigotry. “People would rank what races they wanted. They would literally say: ‘No Asians’. They wouldn’t admit that even to their therapist.”She had wanted to make a film about the experience for years, but the script had never quite worked. Then she realised why. “I thought the focus was on the clients. But the problem is that the clients are not that interesting, because they all want the same thing. If I asked 10 clients what kind of guy they wanted, they would all say: over 6ft tall, makes more money than me, great body, strong hairline.”View image in fullscreenMatch point … Dakota Johnson in Materialists.Photograph: Atsushi NishijimaThings clicked when one day, years ago, she ran into an old friend from graduate school at a fancy gala dinner for theatre donors. She was there as one of the rising playwrights that wealthy patrons could rub shoulders with; he, once a very promising acting student, was there as a server. When she went over to greet and hug her friend, she sensed that they were both embarrassed. It was as if they were breaking an invisible barrier – like Rose going below deck to fraternise with Jack in Titanic.“How Victorian is that?” she says. “But it’s 2017!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Early in Materialists, when Lucy meets Harry at a fancy wedding she’s helped facilitate, John interrupts them – he’s there as a waiter. It’s our first indication that Lucy is an impostor in the world of wealth that she’s insinuated herself into so elegantly and seamlessly. The cold calculus with which she surveys people as dating prospects hits something of an iceberg whenever she’s with John: love, as always, gets in the way of logic.Lucy eventually undergoes a reckoning in Materialists, but Song doesn’t judge her protagonist too harshly. She has deep empathy for women like her, who trust in logic to rescue them. She brings up the “tradwife” trend taking over social media, where women embrace traditional gender roles and domesticity, as a symptom of a crisis beneath the surface. “I think it has so much to do with how deeply broken our economic systems are, especially in the US. As we have learned, the American dream is not achievable. You cannot jump your class. But what’s one of the few ways that you can still jump your class? Well, marriage.”View image in fullscreenFateful encounter … Teo Yoo and Greta Lee in Past Lives.Photograph: Jon PackIf there is an element of escapist fantasy to the film, it’s that the protagonists, all deeply insecure in their own ways about their desirability, are played by three of the most beautiful people in the world. To havePedro Pascaland Chris Evans vying for your hand is an embarrassment of riches, and Song admits that even casting Dakota Johnson as Lucy – a woman who believes there’s nothing special about her – was a bit of a “fantasy trick”. “But the thing is, it wasn’t a stretch for my actors to play these roles; they got it better than me. Who feels more like merchandise than the guy who plays the Mandalorian or Captain America?”For all its hard-nosed cynicism, Materialists is even more sentimental of a romance than Past Lives; its declarations about romance are all the sweeter for the superficial, number-crunching conventions they resist. Even so, making a star-studded romantic comedy after the critical success of Past Lives is a bold move.The genre is more or less dead today, or relegated to Christmas specials on streaming services. Even A24, which distributed the movie in the US, seemed to be self-conscious about releasing a romcom: the company published a “syllabus” for Materialists, a list of Song’s reference films, replete with highbrow names such as Thomas Vinterberg and Mike Leigh, as well as Merchant Ivory productions and Martin Scorsese’s The Age of Innocence. But Song herself is unselfconscious about her love for romances.“I still remember showing Past Lives at this festival in Ireland,” she says. “This one really burly Irish guy was asking me a question during the Q&A. And he started crying, telling me the story of his own childhood sweetheart. And I remember thinking: it’s funny that when it comes to the matters of love, we relegate it to the girlies. But the truth is that everybody’s just actually starved of love and affection. I knew, when I was making Materialists, that there is a very real market for it.”She embraces the idea that Materialists might spark more conversations about love and romance. “It is so romantic that I get to invite the audience to the movie theatre for two hours to do nothing but talk about love and dating and relationships and marriage.” But then again, there’s always the matter of money. “We get to be so real! I get to say things like $12m [apartment]! You know, the most reliable, audible response in every screening I’ve been in is the moment when Harry says ‘$12m’.”Materialists is inUKcinemas from 13 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsRomance filmsPedro PascalChris EvansDakota JohnsonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But although he scrapped his own programmatic explanations, the sense of epic trajectory has clung on. Like Beethoven’s Ninth, the symphony’s finale features a chorus and soloists as well as vast orchestral forces in a shattering, cosmic-scale climax.No surprise, then, that the ending ofthe Hallé’s first Proms appearance with their new principal conductor,Kahchun Wong, was utterly gripping: the breathtakingly elemental chords of its opening; offstage horns slicing laser-like through the air; climaxes snatched away to leave tiny, muttering details; the nightmarish outbreak of brass and percussion from the gallery. Conducting without a score, Wong maintained ultraprecise coordination across the cavernous Royal Albert Hall. A full hour into the performance, the nose-to-tail Prommers stood as if transfixed, even before the Hallé Choir and Hallé Youth Choir entered with their first unaccompanied passage – minutely blended and astonishingly quiet. In the symphony’s final minutes, with an organ pedal that vibrated through the floor, catastrophically powerful lower brass and bells pealing from the gallery, Wong ditched his baton and manoeuvred his supersized forces with tremendous, muscular arm sweeps, as if single-handedly hauling an ocean liner into dock. Many sprang to their feet with the final chord still ringing.What made that finale so powerful, however, was Wong’s commitment to the long game. A big baton-flick upwards at the start launched energetic scrubbing from the upper strings – but Mahler’s strange, frantic motif for the cellos and basses was earthy rather than ferocious and Wong returned to a baseline of pianissimo, gossamer tone (polished rather than characterful) at every opportunity. The second movement was a strictly genteel, sugar-coated account of Mahler’s Ländler. Only in the third did something more vivid begin to take hold: sinewy woodwind solos, snarling stopped horns, the big, slow bloom of two gongs. The subsequent orchestral song featuringEmily D’Angelo’s creamy mezzo felt oddly underpowered, as if Wong was pulling back still further with the finale in mind. But the refinement of Wong’s approach also persisted, beguilingly, into the fifth, providing lightness and limpidity for each of Mahler’s deep shadows.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

No one is allowed to go twice.What takes place is a summoning, a ritual both dark and deeply sentimental. Through gentle, probing conversation, creatorYannick Trapman-O’Briendemands to know what you desire, and what you are willing to sacrifice to get it. As he leaps and twirls around your mind, his dexterous chatter is confronting, charming and sharp as a pinprick.The simple structure, framed around ideas of traditional witchcraft, guides you in a way that responds specifically to your comfort levels and the depths you are willing to dive to. Requested topics can be off limits, but ideally you’ll be OK with blood. The show’s inebriating effect is akin to the intense focus of someone drawing your portrait, or reading your tarot, or giving you therapy. It is a magic trick of sorts, lulling you into openness.

They would march and hold up signs, put up billboards, and make buttons and coffee mugs, the paraphernalia all asking the question left unanswered to this day: “Who killed these girls?” This being Austin, local artists even came up with a song: We Will Not Forget.“Americans, the way we deal with grief,” observes Barbara Ayres-Wilson, the mother to two of the victims, “we had to make a marketing opportunity out of everything.”Ayres-Wilson makes those comments in old footage appearing in The Yogurt Shop Murders, somehow seeing the big picture irony from a distance, while still in the throes of her anguish. Margaret Brown’s four-part docuseries largely follows her lead.‘There’s New Orleans before and after’: revisiting Hurricane Katrina in a new docuseriesRead moreThe Yogurt Shop Murders is as intensive and emotionally gutting as the true crime genre gets, especially as it leads with the trauma suffered by the victims, their families and others orbiting too close to the tragedy. But the series also regularly steps back, observing the cultural ironies and phenomena wrapped up in this case, and taking a measure of its broader implications, not just when it comes to the flaws in a justice system that can coerce false confessions – creating a whole other subset of victims – but also the very nature of true crime storytelling that The Yogurt Shop Murders participates in.Brown essentially made a layered and complex true crime masterpiece, largely by approaching the subject with so much resistance to what that genre typically entails – for instance, the voyeurism and near predatory fixation on the upsetting details.“I wasn’t really interested in this because of the true crime-iness of it,” says Brown on a Zoom call with the Guardian, thinking back on her initial response to the project when it was brought to her by executive producers Dave McCary and his Oscar-winning wife,Emma Stone. Brown, the empathetic film-maker who took a “community first” approach to her celebrated documentary about the slave ship Clotilda,Descendant, says she was nevertheless drawn to this story because it literally hits close to home.“It’s part of the fabric of this city,” says the Austin-based film-maker (originally from Mobile, Alabama, where Descendant takes place). The victims – 17-year-olds Eliza Thomas and Jennifer Harbison; the latter’s 15-year-old sister, Sarah, and her 13-year-old friend Amy Ayers – were just a few years younger than Brown at the time of their murder. She has friends who went to school with the girls, knew them, or was on the cheerleading team with them. The tragedy looms large in her circles.She also saw a way into the story when observing the archival footage and observed what she describes as aDavid Lynchvibe. “It was like the same hair from Twin Peaks,” Brown explains. “You could see a version of what the film could be immediately from the counterculture in Austin back then, when [Richard Linklater’s]Slackercame out … I was like: ‘Oh, I could make a David Lynch movie that’s a documentary.’”Lynch has always been obsessed with the darkness lurking beneath pleasant surfaces, and the dividing lines within a locale (whether it’sBlue Velvet’s Lumberton, North Carolina, orMulholland Drive, flanked by Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley). In his films, people living in alternate worlds violently collide.So Lynchian makes a fitting adjective for this case, considering how horror erupts in a frozen yogurt parlor, ripping through the innocence in what was a popular hangout spot for teens; or the way outsiders, specifically goth types and those who would hang out in Austin’s hidden crevices, were rounded up as suspects, exposing the social and class divisions permeating throughout the city; and the general cultural milieu of early-90s Austin, where, as Brown says, the “country guys and the counterculture people” co-exist.“Austin has always been this place where there’s a college town, but it’s also like a cowboy place,” says Brown, lumping both sides together as the Willie Nelson audience. “They all go see Willie.”But Brown’s approach to the material quickly shifted after the first interview with the victims’ families left her feeling gutted.“I felt it so deeply, their pain,” she says. “Sean [Amy Ayers’s older brother] was so worried about his memory of his sister fading. I remember that made such an impact. It was so heartbreaking the way he talked about how he couldn’t feel her anymore because these images were leaving his mind; her voice and everything. You just feel this family. I just was like: ‘OK, well, I cannot fuck this up.’“I knew I couldn’t just make this stylized, slick thing … I got more interested in how people deal with loss. That’s the universal thing that everyone can relate to. Also, the story was so dark. I think to really live in the darkness of it, I needed some kind of redemption to just get me through.”Throughout the conversations in The Yogurt Shop Murders, a complex and fascinating thread around storytelling emerges, exploring both the healing and harmful functions of constructing a narrative when coping with such trauma. It begins with Ayres-Wilson, who on the night of the murders, doesn’t fully process the weight of her emotions until she has to tell loved ones what happened. Over the years, the victims’ families continue speaking to the media and the community as a way to hold on to the girls’ memories, while also pursuing justice.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: HBOEliza Thomas’s younger sister Sonora – who, as Brown explains, went through life feeling isolated because people can be wary about approaching her with the tragedy always looming – even offers an unexpected validation for the very true crime genre the film-maker was resisting. “This strange genre of crimes shows doesn’t just provide fodder for the curious,” Thomas tells Brown on camera. “It also provides an outlet for victims to tell a story that no one else wants to hear.”Brown proposes another rationale for true crime, pointing out that the genre’s audience is largely woman, some perhaps processing their own fears. “For some people,” she says, “it’s like: ‘Can I figure it out?’ But I think, for women, there’s something more primal about it.“You see in the series, there’s all these other ways [storytelling is] exploitative too. I was curious about the wholeness of that. It’s not just one thing.”As yet another dimension to the storytelling around the case, Brown mentions the detectives who were diagnosed with PTSD after fruitlessly attempting to construct the narrative surrounding the crime scene for years; and Claire Huie, a once aspiring film-maker who made a pass at building a documentary around this story over a decade ago, the severity of it making her walk away from both the film and her career aspirations. So much of Huie’s abandoned footage appears in The Yogurt Shop Murders, including interviews with the families, the detectives and Robert Springsteen, one of the men who sat on death row for the crime.‘It became a game to people’: how online sleuths grew obsessed with the Idaho murdersRead moreSpringsteen, who did not take part in Brown’s series, was convicted based on a confession that did not hold up on appeal. When it comes to this case, aggressive interrogator tactics led to multiple false confessions.In The Yogurt Shop Murders, Brown and her editor, Michael Bloch, go full surrealist Lynch when revisiting intense and nightmarish interrogation scenes, where officers constructed narratives for suspects to fill in the gaps. In a series where we see victim families use storytelling to hold onto their memories, these scenes – exposing memory’s elusive, fragile and misleading nature – stand apart in chilling and unsettling contrast.“You can’t make a show like this and not think about how your own memories about things are shifting,” says Brown. “I can have a memory and think: ‘Well, is that real? Did that really happen? Do I want that to be real?’“I always am interested in complexity, how something can be positive in one way, and, another way, it can have a dark edge. Memory is a perfect example. It can be used as a trap and also a salve.”The Yogurt Shop Murders starts on 3 August on HBO and will be available to stream on Max with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryFactual TVTelevisionTexasAustinUS crimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In his new show, Think Ahead, Davies addresses that on stage – and demonstrates, with reference to his laboured breathing, that he is experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder while doing so.That can’t be anything other than a compelling stage moment, to see a “people-pleasing comedian” (his words) of 30 years’ standing open up – and so rawly – about a difficult subject unaddressed in his comedy until now. Davies does so with honesty and a lightness of touch. He acknowledges that it’s an awkward topic for mirth, and makes good choices about when to set the jokes aside and when to find the funny. The funny? This was a dad who made colour copies of his child sexual abuse images on the household printer (“How many trips to Rymans?!”) and whose diary, when unearthed by Davies years later, focused exclusively on golf.Davies’s abuse is not the main focus of Think Ahead, far from it, and the remainder delivers one big-laughs set-piece after another. There is material about his youngest son, now nine, and some choice ranting in Alf Garnett-alike character as a man apoplectic about Ulez. There’s also plenty of blue humour, of a type that couldn’t fail to tickle a crowd, but which Davies elevates with his vivid image-making – of the sexual position you should adopt in the event of Viagra-induced heart attack, say, or of his experience delivering a poo sample for cancer screening.Just Ignore Him by Alan Davies review – a life derailed by abuseRead moreHow do these very disparate routines fit together? You could argue that the childhood abuse material is dissonant with the broad sex comedy elsewhere. It also underpins it somehow, offsetting with shade the light of Davies’s default people-pleasing superficiality, making the laughs wilder because they are harder won. The upshot is a striking new show, a cross-section of the 59-year-old’s life now that reveals parts his previous shows couldn’t reach.AtOrchard at Gilded Balloon, Edinburgh, until 10 August.All ourEdinburgh festival reviews.TheNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

If that sounds too weighty a theme for a night out at the fringe, well, Howlett, who also directs, has planned ahead and built a fluid, ever-shifting production that spins her ideas with a dazzling lightness of touch.This is pure ensemble theatre: you cannot put a match between Sophie Kean, Abby McCann, Anna Marks Pryce and Gemma Barnett as they weave five historical stories as a tight unit, breathing as one.Supported by a residency by theHugo Burge Foundationand written with Summerhall’s Anatomy lecture theatre in mind, Howlett’s production forTheatreGooseexploits the academic setting by turning the audience into students (pens and whiteboards in hand) and the actors into public speakers, using an overhead projector to put them in the spotlight (neat lighting design by Ed Saunders).View image in fullscreenEmbracing existential fear … Aether.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianTwo of the stories are unexpected; not the one about Hypatia, the ancient Egyptian mathematician and astronomer who was murdered by angry Christians; nor the one aboutVera Rubinfinding evidence of dark matter in the 20th century; and not the modern-day tale about Sophie, a PhD student drawing on data from Cern in the hope of breaking new ground, while her obsessiveness drives her girlfriend away.More surprising are those of Adelaide Herrmann, famed for performing the bullet-catch magic trick in her vaudeville show; and of Florence Cook, a 15-year-old medium, hoodwinking a credulous scientific establishment with her messages from beyond. Howlett is intrigued by fiction as well as fact.Juxtaposed and intercutting, these stories form a collage of truth and illusion, one that embraces the existential fear of always having more to learn about an evasive universe.

We would always encourage people to speak to us if they have concerns. It would not be appropriate for us to comment further.”The newspaper said the BBC had appointed a law firm to lead the investigation. It is understood that the corporation often appoints external law firms to help lead investigations and report back to an internal team.Evans, who was a celebrity dancer in last year’s series, was dropped by the BBC for using “inappropriate language” during the launch of the Strictly tour.He apologised for language that he called “inappropriate and unacceptable” after the Mail on Sunday reported that he was heard making a remark to a woman in a video filmed during the Strictly launch event.The singer announced in May that he was leaving his BBC Radio Wales show after the BBC decided not to renew his contract.This latest investigation comes after the BBC launched a review of Strictly in 2024 that looked into allegations of bullying and harassment against the former professional dancer Giovanni Pernice, made by his former dance partner Amanda Abbington.The corporation upheld some, but not all, of the complaints made. In June last year, the BBC confirmed Pernice’s departure from the show.Another Strictly professional dancer, Graziano Di Prima,also left the showlast year after allegations about his conduct with a past participant.The BBC announced a series of new measures in July 2024 aimed at improving welfare on the show. These include the introduction of chaperones who are present at all times during training room rehearsals, two new welfare producers, and providing additional training for the professional dancers, production team and crew.In June, the EastEnders star Jamie Borthwick wassuspended by the BBCafter a video emerged of the actor using an ableist slur during Strictly rehearsals in November.Borthwick apologised and a BBC spokesperson said at the time: “This language is entirely unacceptable and in no way reflects the values or standards we hold and expect at the BBC.

Welcome to David Attenborough’s wonderful new series about animal parenthood – witnessing the highs, the lows and the grisly (a mother needs to feed her kids!). The opener also takes us into the ocean to meet a gutsy “super mum” boxer crab about to hatch eggs while fighting off predators. And inside a tangled nest of webs, dying African social spiders are hunting food for thousands of spiderlings – but will they make the ultimate yummy mummy sacrifice? Fascinating stuff, if slightly skin-crawling.Hollie RichardsonLucy Letby: Beyond Reasonable Doubt?10.20pm, ITV1Neonatal nurse Lucy Letby was jailed for life in August 2023 after being found guilty of murdering babies in her care.

Some felt his first English-language feature awkwardly transplanted his Hispanic melodrama to a Manhattan setting, in which terminally ill war photographer Martha (Tilda Swinton) reaches out to her old friend, bestselling author Ingrid (Juliette Moore). Others reckoned it was just as lush and seductive as ever, a third entry after Pain and Glory and Parallel Mothers in a death-preoccupied run of work. What can’t be disputed is how it rages against the dying of the light, both on a personal and planetary level, led by a cadaverous Swinton orchestrating her own exit.Phil HoadKensuke’s Kingdom, 3.35pm, BBC OneA stirring, classy adaptation, scripted by Frank Cottrell-Boyce, of the Michael Morpurgo novel about a shipwrecked child who encounters a Japanese war veteran on a remote island. Recalcitrant lad Michael (voiced by Aaron McGregor) is bugging his parents on their sailing trip – but once washed ashore with his dog, learns his place in the scheme of nature courtesy of the enigmatic Kensuke (Ken Watanabe).

Our resident perfectionist finds out …Felicity CloakeSun 3 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 3 Aug 2025 08.01 EDTShare“How many versions of fresh tomato sauce can there be?” Catherine, the generous winner of a charity auction to help me with the research for this column, asks when I tell her what recipe we’ll be making. On the contrary, I tell her, I’ve had my work cut out to narrow the selection here down to a mere seven, not least because the simpler the dish, the more argument there is over how it should be prepared, especially in a place as passionate about its food as Italy.Happily, I’ll have a lot of assistance, because Catherine has raised yet more money forHospitality Rides(a fundraising initiative for two very worthy industry charities,Only a Pavement Awayandthe Licensed Trade Charity), by selling tickets to get other people to do my job for me, effectively. In an attempt to sweeten the deal, I tell my assembled minions (all hospitality professionals, though none, sadly, Italian chefs) that,according to Emiko Davies, this raw sauce is “quite possibly the best way to enjoy really good, ripe summer tomatoes – as well as making the most of spending as little time in front of a hot stove as possible”. Then I make them chop an awful lot of tomatoes in the service of perfection.The tomatoesView image in fullscreenThe River Cafe’spomodoro crudouses ‘a mixture of plum and cherry tomatoes’. All thumbnail images by Felicity Cloake.Tomatoes are, in fact, a good place to begin, because, as the late, great cook and author Marcella Hazan writes inMarcella Cucina: “The tomato is the thing. There is hardly anything to the making of the sauce, which really consists just of assembling the ingredients and letting them go to work, but the tomatoes have to be ripe and tasty.” Lynne Rossetto Kasper, host of the long-runningSplendid Table podcast, agrees: “Exceptionally good tomatoes and olive oil you want to eat with a spoon are the only requirements for this recipe.”She recommends “a variety of tomatoes, if possible – the punchy little sweet 100s or sungolds, mellow beefsteaks and maybe one or two sweet yellow or orange ones”, a mixture that certainly looks pretty. Rowley Leighcounsels cherry tomatoes(“datterini, if possible”) inA Long and Messy Business, the River Cafe’sClassic Italian Cookbooka mixture of plum and cherry tomatoes, and the late restaurateurAlvaro Maccionisuggests mixing fresh and sun-dried fruit in his book Alvaro’s Mamma Toscana. While a range of colours pleases the eye, I’d advise going instead for whatever pleases the palate most; we have such a short window of really decent tomatoes in the UK that it’s important to select for flavour while you can. My preference is always for plums, if they look good. As I explain to the group while they good-humouredly set about seeding several kilos of fruit, there’s a reason these are the variety most often found in tins: they have a higher ratio of flesh to watery seeds than most, which means that, in practice, you get more for your buck. None of us, it turns out, is a fan of using the sun-dried variety in this dish, which, according to Annica, take away from the “purity of the dish”, but perhaps we’re not quite over the 1990s yet.However, while I hope that Hazan, Del Conte and all the other gods of Italian cookery will forgive me, I’m with Daniel Gritzer when hewrites on Serious Eatsthat “I’ve never eaten somepasta al pomodoro crudo, spat it out and angrily exclaimed: ‘Who, pray tell, left the skins and seeds on these tomatoes?’ The full tomato has never bothered me in apico de gallo, it’s never bothered me in bruschetta and it doesn’t bother me here. Frankly, there’s a lot of flavour in those seeds, and it’d be a shame to waste it.” So, by all means peel and seed, if you like, but personally I wouldn’t bother – ripe tomatoes are a pain to peel, and there’s a fair bit of wastage.(You may also, as in Davies’ alternative to her roughly chopped fruit, smash the tomatoes in a mortar, but I prefer a chunkier sauce here; also, if you go down that road, you will probably need to peel them, too.)The treatmentView image in fullscreenLynne Rossetto Kasper has ‘a trick for making pasta with raw tomato sauces taste lustier’ – read on to find out what.In the interest of keeping things simple, I bypass recipes such as the one in Lucio Galletto’s The Art ofPastathat are “quasi-cotto”, or lightly cooked, in favour of ones that are entirely raw. That said, Del Conte does put her sauce mixture in a moderate oven just while the pasta is boiling, I assume to warm it and perhaps to encourage the juices to run.Marinading rather than cooking is the name of the game here, as Hazan explains: “Although this sauce is completely raw, you might say that it cooks itself. It is a fine demonstration of the dynamic reaction that ingredients can have to each other, if you give them the chance.” Some happily quick and easy versions give them this chance just for the few minutes it takes to cook the pasta. The River Cafe recommends half an hour, Hazan a full hour. and Del Conte “at least two hours”, the latter adding that “it does not matter if you leave the sauce to marinate for longer”.If you don’t have half an hour, be reassured that such culinary authorities as Davies, Leigh and Rossetto Kasper don’t bother with this step at all, though my testers are struck by the richness of the River Cafe recipe: “The tomatoes have almost broken down to make a sauce,” Catherine observes. At least 30 minutes is ideal, though 15 is better than nothing, and two to three hours won’t hurt.It’s also worth bearing in mind a top tip from Rossetto Kasper, which I almost miss because it’s not included in her actual recipe: “I discovered a trick for making pasta with raw tomato sauces taste lustier. Slightly undercook the pasta. Drain it. Spoon the juices that raw sauces always throw off into the empty pasta pot. Set it over medium-low heat, add the pasta and toss until the juices are absorbed, then add the pasta to the sauce.” Very little extra work, and well worth it.The pasta“Only boxed factory-made dry pasta is a good match for this sauce,” Hazan instructs, “and spaghettini, thin spaghetti, is the most strongly recommended shape.” Nevertheless, good old spaghetti is the most common choice in the recipes I try, although the River Cafe’s ravioli is a hit with my testers, even though I choose one with an entirely unsuitable asparagus-based filling. Also popular is Maccioni’s linguine, which Catherine declares has “more about it than the spaghetti”, and the aforementioned spaghettini, which Anna and I enjoy for its springy, almost ramen-like consistency. (Rossetto Kasper’s alternative fusilli does not, according to Olivia, “look quite as classy … it’s a bit of a bully texture-wise, so the tomatoes get lost”.)View image in fullscreenEmiko Davies’s raw tomato sauce is vinegar-free.A common complaint as the dishes go around the table when we’re finally at the tasting stage is that some recipes are a bit mean on the tomato. Maccioni uses a mere four tomatoes for four people in contrast to Rossetto Kasper’s bountiful 1.35kg.Naturally loth to reduce the quantity of pasta, I’ve opted for a similarly generous serving of tomatoes, bearing in mind that this is a pasta dish and not a tomato salad (or, God forbid, apasta salad. Do Italians even eat pasta salad? Please let me know in the comments below).The extrasThis is where things really get interesting around the table. Good olive oil is, of course, a must, but the two best-rated recipes, from Hazan and the River Cafe, also contain red-wine vinegar – something I would invariably sprinkle on a fresh tomato salad. The appreciative noises (“almost restauranty”, someone says proudly) this elicits strongly suggest that it has to be part of my final recipe – though Claire, in particular, is a fan of the fresh simplicity of Davies’ vinegar-free version.View image in fullscreenMarcella Hazan adopts a ‘slightly more complex Ligurian take’ on this classic dish.Salt is also a must; a tomato is nothing without it, and there is a feeling that those in charge of Del Conte’s recipe (I name no names) have perhaps been a little parsimonious on that front: “I only said did it ask for seasoning?” Karina demands, laughing. Lesson learned; be generous with the salt, unless you fancy Hazan’sslightly more complex Ligurian takecomplete with black and green olives, capers and anchovies, in which case a little restraint might be wise. We all love these additions – “a really interesting mix of flavours and textures”, Claire observes – but I’ve left them as optional extras, because I do feel that in a pasta con pomodoro crudo the tomatoes should be the star attraction. (The same goes for Maccioni’s mozzarella, which, delicious as it is, makes some of us feel as if we’re eating an M&S pasta salad on a train.)Herb wise, basil is the most popular choice, and the clear favourite; Leigh’s mint, meanwhile, gets mixed reviews. No one can detect Hazan’s marjoram or parsley, and fennel seeds divide opinion; we all agree we love them in other dishes, but here, as Anna says, they overpower the tomato. Davies’ optional chilli flakes prove more of a crowdpleaser, but, again, they’re very much gilding the lily.Garlic, however, is another must, though the quantity is up to you. It’s not cooked, so I’ve been quite restrained, but you may prefer a punchier, fierier result.The toppingsView image in fullscreenRowley Leigh finishes his dish with a ‘wonderful savoury, crunchy anchovy pangrattato’.“No cheese is necessary with this sauce,” Del Conte says sternly in her brilliant collectionOn Pasta. Rossetto Kasper disagrees, and her salty pecorino gets many compliments – not least because, well, who doesn’t love cheese? That said, Leigh’s wonderful savoury, crunchy anchovy pangrattato, or crisp flavoured breadcrumbs, also have their fans – “these smell really good”, Victoria says happily. Though they’re certainly not foundational, I do like the contrast in texture, as well as the fact that they’re easily veganised (simply omit the anchovy for a fully plant-based dish).ServingThough this isn’t a pasta salad, I’m reliably informed that pasta con pomodoro crudo can be served warm or at room temperature – but “never chilled”, Rossetto Kasper counsels, as if the very idea of cold pasta wasn’t enough to warn you off in itself. This makes it an utterly brilliant dish for a summer evening: make ahead, enjoy yourself, then casually toss into bowls with a sprinkling of basil when it’s time to eat. The Italians know a thing or two about warm weather dining, it turns out.View image in fullscreen‘No cheese is necessary with this sauce,’ Anna Del Conte says sternly.Perfect fresh tomato pastaPrep15 minCook12 minSteep30 minServes4800g ripe but firm tomatoes, preferably, but not necessarily, plum2 tbsp red-wine vinegar¾ tbsp flaky salt, plus extra for cooking the pasta4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus 1 tbsp extra if making pangrattato2-3 plump garlic cloves, peeled4 tbsp dry breadcrumbs(optional)1 tinned anchovy fillet, drained (optional)400g spaghetti, or spaghettini1 small bunch fresh basilOptional extras60golives, black, green or a mixture, stoned and chopped1 tbsp capers(rinsed if packed in salt), chopped4 anchovy fillets(rinsed if packed in salt), chopped½ tsp chilli flakesCut the tomatoes into fairly small dice (this is much easier if you have a sharp knife) and put them and all their juices in a bowl with the vinegar, half the salt and all the oil.View image in fullscreenMash the garlic to a paste with the remaining salt, then stir that into the tomato bowl, too, along with any of the optional extras.View image in fullscreenLeave to sit for at least 30 minutes, though longer won’t hurt (but don’t leave it so long that it requires refrigeration).If making the pangrattato, put a tablespoon of oil in a small frying pan over a medium heat, then mash in the anchovy, if using, until dissolved.View image in fullscreenTurn up the heat, stir in the breadcrumbs and fry until crisp and golden.

It’s a market town with a nearbymodel village, while the “best things to do”sectionon TripAdvisor highlights the cemetery or a trip to the former residence of writer GK Chesterton. If all that fails to thrill, you could just go for lunch at the pub – although be aware thatthe Greyhoundisn’t anything as simple as a plain old gastropub. Heck no, that would be something completely different: more shabbily chic, more carbohydrates on the menu, fewer staff calling you “Madam” while you’re en route to the loo and not even a hint of white peach granita on your burrata starter.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

And, to be fair, it might well not be for everyone. Gourmands, birthday treats and special occasions, perhaps, but picky children and Aunty Pam who just wants toad-in-the-hole might find the semi-formality a bit testing.View image in fullscreenThe Greyhound’s La Latteria burrata comes on a ‘green nasturtium pesto and topped with a sweet, peachy granita’.Over atthe Ritzin London, I note that they call this style of dining “an epicurean journey”, which is, I feel, modern shorthand forsmallyet significant portions of largely French-influenced gastronomy heaving with finesse, technique and accomplishment. Whether or not epicurean journeys are delicious is a moot point, however, because we are here to gasp spellbound at the chef’s imagination and to nod sagely as a surprise amuse-bouche of fresh peas and lovage is delivered in a teeny ramekin with an equally ickle spoon. That’s followed by an equally precise and inoffensive minuscule tartlet of fresh sweetcorn and whipped cream cheese.Decor-wise, and despite itsL’Enclumevibes, the Greyhound hasn’t gone fully stripped back with stone floors and crofter’s cottage chic, as so many other highfalutin country pubs have done, and prefers instead to complement its olde-worlde low beams and wooden floors with warm, cinnamon-coloured leather horseshoe banquettes, patterned wallpaper, bottle-green velour cocktail chairs and modern art on every wall. This may be an oligarch’s saloon bar teetering on the edge of chintz, but it’s still hugely cosy and welcoming. Daytrippers lured this way by the model village could not help but be seduced by its sheer quaintness.View image in fullscreenThe Greyhound’s ‘gorgeously crisp-skinned’ sea bass with ‘a silky spin on beurre blanc’.We ordered from the à la carte, rather than the six-plus course, £110-a-head tasting menu, and began with a pleasant bowl ofLa Latteria burratain a green nasturtium pesto and topped with a sweet, peachy granita. Hereford rump cap tartare looked like something out of a fairytale, and was served very roughly chopped and arranged like a bird’s nest around a miso confit egg, pickled shimeji mushrooms and some capers. A main of roast sea bass had a gorgeously crisp skin and came with a silky spin on beurre blanc and some rather al dente braised baby fennel. Another main of wood pigeon erred on the side of well done and was submerged in a rich cherry jus that resembled nothing so much as a crime scene.There’s some clever, cogent cooking going on at the Greyhound, with some hits, some misses, but an overall sense that, in a bid to be the best restaurant for miles around, they might just be missing the chance to be simply delicious. Still, diners all around us, celebrating birthdays and anniversaries, were having a lovely time of it, and the restaurant was ticking over very nicely, thank you, especially for a Tuesday evening.View image in fullscreen‘Now we’re talking’: the Greyhound’s blackcurrant tart topped with blackcurrant sorbet.It was only in the dessert list where a mood of pure decadence was allowed to let rip and flourish, because here we hadîlesflottanteswith limoncello custard and raspberry souffle with sarsaparilla sorbet. Beforehand, we had foxtrotted neatly and nimbly around the world of fine dining, but thank God we were now in the sugary and comparatively silly ante-room. We opted for the heavenly sounding blackcurrant tart, which turned out to be a fat, chunky, individual tart with a crisp, buttery casing loaded with berries and clotted cream, all infused with the sharp kick of lemon verbena to break through all the lactose richness; best of all, it was topped by a glorious blackcurrant sorbet. Now we were talking.On the tasting menu, I noticed that they serve Yoredale Wensleydale with homebaked fig loaf and chutneys, which sounds equally rustic and exquisite. If only the Greyhound did more fig loaf and less forlock-tugging, I might well be back for more.The Greyhound33 Windsor End, Beaconsfield Buckinghamshire, 01494 671315.
