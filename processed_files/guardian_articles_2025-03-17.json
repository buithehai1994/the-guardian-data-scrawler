They fearlessly flew over enemy territory to protect the UK and its allies, risking their lives.“He never considered himself a hero and often referred to himself as the ‘lucky Irishman’, a man simply doing his job, like so many others of his generation. Despite his sacrifice, he would tell stories of the joyous memories he made and moments he shared with his peers, many of whom never returned home.“Their sense of duty and service secured our freedom, and we shall never forget them.”Group captain Hemingway DFC retired from the RAF in 1974.The defence secretary, John Healey, said Hemingway’s generation “understood the importance of freedom and sacrificed so much to achieve it”.Air chief marshal Sir Rich Knighton, the chief of the air staff, said the flyer was “an amazing character whose life story embodies all that was and remains great about the Royal Air Force”.Hemingway was the last surviving member of the Few after the death of Terry Clark in May 2020 aged 101.Clark, who died in a care home from natural causes, had served as a radar operator on Bristol Beaufighters during the second world war.Explore more on these topicsUK newsRoyal Air ForceSecond world warMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

People who do the forecasts understand the uncertainty.”He told an event of the Resolution Foundation thinktank: “I think we want to get away from this idea that we continually have to be neurotically changing taxes and spending to try to control this OBR forecast so that it’s hitting our target.”Bean also warned that approaching welfare reform with a savings target was the wrong way around, and the government should instead be thinking about how to help those on disability benefits who were able to work back into employment.Reeves defended her approach on Monday. “When we’re spending £100bn a year on servicing government debt, I don’t think anyone could seriously argue that we don’t need to get a grip on government borrowing and government debt,” she said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “It is important that there is headroom against the shocks we face.”While ministers have acknowledged deep anxiety among welfare recipients, the disability minister, Stephen Timms, refused to guarantee, when pressed by MPs, that the most disabled in society, who would never be able to work, would not see their support cut.The Labour veteran Diane Abbottsaid cutting benefits for disabled people was “not a Labour thing to do”, warning that, over time, many voters would look at policies such as cuts to benefits “and think: is this myLabourparty?”Andy Burnham, theLabourmayor of Greater Manchester, has also warned against tightening the eligibility criteria for benefit payments or reducing the amounts, saying this would “trap too many people in poverty”.A number of experts have also privately raised alarm at figures the government has been using to justify the cuts. Government sources have routinely briefed that the growing benefits bill must be tackled because of the rise in numbers of people signed off sick with mental illness.But new analysis from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) found those on the highest benefit for disabled people signed off from work had a physical disability in the vast majority of cases.The anti-poverty charity’s data, obtained from the Department for Work and Pensions under freedom of information, found that five in every six people receiving the benefit with a mental health condition had at least one physical condition as well.The JRF found that 90% of the forecast spending growth on personal independence payments (Pip) between now and 2030 will be for those who get both components – meaning they are people with significant difficulties with mobility and conducting daily tasks such as washing and cooking.The charity said its research found that 70% of those families with someone with a disability were already going without essentials such as food, heating and hot showers. The figure was particularly high for those with a learning disability or mental health condition.Ofsted ex-chief says schools bill ‘very likely’ to make education in England worseRead moreThere was also considerable concern from campaigners about some of the ways the statistics had been portrayed in order to justify the forthcoming cut, in particular a government press release that claimed the number of people “considered too sick to work” had “quadrupled” since the pandemic, referring to a 383% rise.The rise was attributable to the move on to universal credit, according to the JRF’s senior policy adviser, Iain Porter, who said although there was concern it had risen, the real rise was more like 40%.Peter Matejic, the JRF’s chief analyst, said: “This analysis shows there is no way to achieve the suggested £5bn cut without taking money from people who both need help with everyday tasks, such as preparing food or using the toilet, and help getting around.“A government that came to office pledging to end the moral scar of food bank use clearly should not be taking steps that could leave disabled people at greater risk of needing to use one.”Explore more on these topicsBenefitsDisabilityWelfareLabourMental healthHealthKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

The only way that we can regain it is to tell the unvarnished truth – net zero by 2050 is impossible.”She will add: “The current policies the UK is implementing are largely failing to do this, whilst, at the same time, driving up the cost of energy. We’re falling between two stools – too high costs and too little progress.”News of the announcement triggered anger among environmentalists in her own party, however.Sam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, said: “It is a mistake for Kemi Badenoch to have jumped the gun on her own policy review and decided net zero isn’t possible by 2050.“This undermines the significant environmental legacy of successive Conservative governments, which provided the outline of a credible plan for tackling climate change. The important question now is how to build out this plan in a way that supports growth, strengthens security, and follows conservative, free market principles.”View image in fullscreenA Climate Resistance activist interrupts Kemi Badenoch’s speech at the Centre for Policy Studies conference in London on Monday.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PABadenoch’s speech marks the beginning of what she says will be a multi-year policy review, with each member of the shadow cabinet asked to review their party’s policy platform from scratch.The Conservative leader has insisted she does not want to set out a full political programme until much later in the parliament, once the review is concluded. However, early policies she has announced have indicated she wants to push her party to the right on a range of issues, including immigration, the climate and tax.Badenoch has promised toreverse Labour’s tax rises on private school feesand oninheritance tax on farmland, as well as tomake it harder for migrants to apply for citizenship.Her advisers say she has time to think carefully about the future direction of her party while voters are mainly paying attention to what the government is doing.But the lengthy policy review has causedangst among many Tory MPs, who believe Badenoch is ceding the political impetus to Labour at the crucial early stages of her leadership. One recently told the Guardian: “She was running to be leader of the opposition, but she thought she was running to head up a right-of-centre thinktank.”On Monday she received support from Iain Duncan Smith, who led the Conservatives for just over two years from September 2001, before being ousted by his colleagues.Duncan Smith told the BBC’s Politics Live: “The Conservatives are very good at fighting a battle with the leader they select.“I’d give a little bit of advice to some of my colleagues: the target’s in front of you, not all around you. If you spend your whole time trying to figure out whether a messiah is going to emerge in the middle of you, a messiah doesn’t come in politics.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

With green industries growing three times faster than the rest of the UK economy, it also means giving up on the economic opportunity of the century.“A strong majority of people in this country are concerned about the climate crisis and want to see government action. Now is not the time to step back.”The 2050 target was first signed into law in 2019 by Chris Skidmore, who was then the Conservative energy minister. At the time, he said: “We’re leading the world yet again in becoming the first major economy to pass new laws to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050 while remaining committed to growing the economy – putting clean growth at the heart of our modern industrial strategy.”On Monday, Badenoch told a conference in London she was seeking to recapture the mantle of Margaret Thatcher, while also embracing the rhetoric of the US president, Donald Trump.“Margaret Thatcher didn’t fight to make Britain comfortable with decline,” she told an event organised by the Centre for Policy Studies. “She fought to make it great again.”Two protesters interrupted her speech. The first held up a banner that said “Abolish Billionaires” and shouted, before being ejected from the hall. Then another began to call out about the cost-of-living crisis.Badenoch said Thatcher could “hardly” be blamed for the rising cost of living.Outside, the first protester disagreed, telling the PA news agency the Conservative party had “allowed extreme wealth to be amassed by a tiny minority, fuelling climate crisis and poverty”.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisGreen politicsConservativesKemi BadenochnewsShareReuse this content"

Dore said: “I categorically did not tell Gina to keep her mouth shut.”Dore told the court that Clarke had been “very protective” of Powell, treating her like “a little sister” because she was a woman working in the film industry, he knew one of her family and “wanted her to be treated with respect”.It has emerged that at least five of the 15 people who were supposed to give oral evidence in support of Clarke’s claim will no longer be doing so.They include the former EastEnders actor, Nabil Elouahabi, who was due to be cross-examined on Monday. The court heard he would no longer be appearing before it.So far, nine witnesses have given oral evidence for Clarke, including Clarke himself. A summons to appear in court has been sent to a 10th witness Arnold Oceng, who appeared in Clarke’s films Brotherhood and Adulthood, but Millar said he was not living at his given address, nor had he responded to a WhatsApp message. The reasons for witnesses not appearing have not been disclosed in court.GNM’s witnesses, of whom there are 32 in total, will begin giving oral evidence on Tuesday. An application for GNM to add another witness, Anita (not her real name), was rejected by the judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, on Monday after Clarke’s legal team opposed it.Millar said Anita had come forward in response to media coverage of the trial.The court heard that her proposed evidence included that Clarke put pressure on her to allow him to take an explicit photograph of her in a public place in Soho House, central London.Steyn said that while Anita’s evidence was “of some importance”, it was not critical given the other evidence available and could delay the trial.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Only officials for whom it is absolutely essential should have a card.”Officials use GPCs to buy relatively small items such as flights, office furniture or drinks for official functions.They were introduced by the last Labour government in 1997 as a way to reduce the bureaucracy required to run Whitehall departments. Spending on them has more than quadrupled over the last five years to £676m, with Labour sources pointing to spending on items such as shoes and DJ equipment as potentially wasteful.While in opposition, Labourconducted an investigationinto all spending on GPCs, which found examples of high spending by senior officials and ministers. In 2021, for instance, the then prime minister Boris Johnson used a government card to pay for a £4,445 dinner in New York for himself and 24 of his staff.Later that year Liz Truss, as foreign secretary, spent nearly £1,500 on lunch and dinner during a visit to Indonesia in two of Jakarta’s most exclusive restaurants.Also in 2021, the Treasury under Rishi Sunak spent more than £3,000 buying 13 photographs from the Tate to hang in its Whitehall building, despite already having access to the government art collection.The Foreign Office is one of the heaviest users of GPCs, in part because officials have to organise regular functions to entertain foreign dignitaries. But as well as spending on items such as flights and catering, officials also spent nearly £2,500 at a shoe shop called Shoe Crush in Barbados.Under new guidelines being rolled out by McFadden, the maximum spend for hospitality will be cut from £2,500 to £500, with any spending over £500 requiring approval from a director general.Civil servants will be banned from using cards to buy things such as travel or office supplies, which could be bought more cheaply in bulk at a departmental or cross-departmental level.Most of the 20,000 cards that have been issued will now be frozen, with exemptions for a small number of cases such as diplomatic staff in unstable locations. Cardholders will then be forced to reapply for their cards, and if unsuccessful will lose access to them by the end of the month.McFadden has also asked departments to identify any items of spending that breach government guidelines and discipline the individuals in question.Keir Starmer is spearheading a wider shake-up of Whitehall. As well as cuts to quasi-non-governmental organisations, the prime minister is urging departments to make greater use of technology such as artificial intelligence tools to reduce spending and streamline decision-making.Some experts have warned that rather than making government more efficient, the changes to how Whitehall works could make it harder for civil servants to deliver the government’s main priorities such as cutting NHS waiting lists.Explore more on these topicsCivil servicenewsShareReuse this content"

Normally we just find isolated bones of a particular species,” McCurry said. “We can’t often see the whole animal, and we rarely see things like soft tissues preserved.”View image in fullscreenA fossil of stomach contents of the species calledFerruaspis brocksishows that it fed predominantly on phantom midge.Photograph: Salty Dingo/Australian MuseumThe find,published in Vertebrate Palaeontology, has provided the first detailed evidence in Australia for a group of fish called the Osmeriformes, which today include graylings and smelts, McCurry said.Unusually, the fossils retained remnants of colour cells, called melanophores, including the tiny melanin-containing granules inside called melanosomes (measuring just over a thousandth of a millimetre).More than 60 dinosaur footprints found on boulder that sat at Queensland school for 20 yearsRead moreCo-author Dr Michael Frese, an associate professor and virologist adept at microscopy and based at the University of Canberra, said this level of detail “pushed the boundaries” of what could be preserved.From these microscopic details, the authors determined the fish were “counter shaded” – darker at the top and lighter at the belly – with two stripes along their sides.Also preserved were the animals’ stomach contents, and in some cases the intestinal tract.Frese said when viewed under a high-powered microscope, the fish bellies were full of the antennae of phantom midge larvae (a type of insect), bits and pieces of half-digested wings, and even a small mussel or bivalve.These minute details offered a glimpse into the life of the fish in its final days, he said.The fossils were buried at the bottom of a lake like a billabong that was separated from nearby rivers, he said. Yet a second tiny bivalve, attached to a fish fin, suggested the animals came from a nearby river.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThat river might have flooded or otherwise spilled over into the lake, where the fish probably gorged themselves on phantom midge larvae. “They died with a full stomach,” Frese said.View image in fullscreenIllustration of species calledFerruaspis brocksi.Photograph: Alex BoersmaThe evolutionary biologist and palaeontologist Dr Alice Clement, who was not involved in the paper, said analysing melanophores to reconstruct colour patterns was a “big advancement in the study of fossil fishes”.Colours and patterns were important in the animal world – used for attracting mates, warning off predators and for camouflage. Yet the study of these characteristics in fossils was still in its infancy, she said.The species is named after Prof Jochen J Brocks, from the Australian National University, who has discovered several fossilised species at the McGraths Flat site.As well as detailed insights into the species itself, the fossils provided an “unprecedented opportunity” to understand Australia’s ancient ecosystems and the evolution of fish during the Miocene, McCurry said.Map showing McGraths Flat fossil site in central NSW, AustraliaThe palaeontologist Prof John Long, an expert in ancient fishes at Flinders University who was not involved in the study, said fish fossils from the Miocene provided a “rare window” into ecosystems at a time ofdramatic environmental change, when deserts expanded and forests declined.“It helps us appreciate the diversity of Australia’s unique fauna and how it evolved to cope with changing climatic conditions.”Frese said uncovering fossils at McGraths Flat was like flipping individual pieces of an upside-down mosaic.View image in fullscreenThe fossils provide an ‘unprecedented opportunity’ to understand Australia’s ancient ecosystems, Dr Matt McCurry says.Photograph: Salty Dingo/Australian MuseumThe more you flipped, the more it revealed about the environment around the lake, he said. Over time, an even bigger picture emerged about how species evolved, and how continents and landscapes transformed at a critical point in history.“At the time these fish died and were preserved, that was a transitional period for Australia,” he said. “Basically it’s a history lesson, or a geological lesson, of what happens if the climate changes fundamentally.”Explore more on these topicsFossilsAustralian climate and environment in focusNew South WalesFishBiologynewsShareReuse this content"

There is anew steely resolve in Brusselsbut the temptation persists to push decisions back.A leading German politician described the incoming government in Berlin as “democracy’s last bullet” but some worry they will shoot themselves in the foot. Austrians cling to their traditional neutrality as if that alone will keep them safe. InPoland, there is, perhaps, the greatest clarity as to what they think must be done. Yet its polarised political class, traditionally Atlanticist in outlook and discombobulated by the turn in Washington, argues about how to find the money to do it as public opinion wavers over the presence of 1 million Ukrainian refugees. As the Marxist thinker Antonio Gramsci was quoted as saying in 1929: “The old world is dying and the new world struggles to be born; now is the time of monsters.”London, UK: ‘Still trying to be a bridge’There was a sense of quiet satisfaction in the Ministry of Defence’s main building on Whitehall when, during one of his unpredictable press huddles in the Oval Office last week, Donald Trump said he was pleased thatNato was “stepping up”. It is a phrase that the British defence secretary, John Healey, had been pushing as part of Britain’s effort to keep Washington engaged. Now it was being echoed in the White House.MapThe first person Healey called after the announcement that the UK would increase its spending on defence to 2.5% of GDP by April 2027 was his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth. In the six weeks the American has been in office, Healey has spoken to him four times, twice in person. Meanwhile, at 6pm every Tuesday evening, Britain’s defence secretary rings his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov. “It’s very clear that a precondition for the US taking European security seriously isEuropeshowing we are taking our own security seriously,” a Whitehall source said.Few would dispute that Keir Starmer and Healey have been pulling all the diplomatic levers at their disposal. Richard Shirreff, formerly a British general and previously Nato’s European deputy supreme allied commander, believes “the prime minister is still trying to be a bridge between Trump and Nato” and if the US is up for that “then fantastic”.Can Europe secure peace in Ukraine without the US?Read more“But from a purely security perspective, I think we have to accept that Europe and Canada have got to stand on their own without America,” he says. “We’ve got to get real. America has not just drifted away. It’s cut itself off. Anybody who thinks that America is still committed to Nato is … I don’t know what they’re smoking.“You have to assume that the American security guarantee for Europe has gone. We are in a new world. The French have been absolutely right about strategic autonomy, and the British line that America ‘will always be the leader of Nato’ has been proved completely wrong.”He adds: “The only way that we are going to avoid catastrophe in Europe is through effective deterrence and to deter effectively means you have to be ready for the worst case.“The worst case is war withRussia, and this means that we have to look to not just increasing the size and capability of our armed forces, we have to build societal resilience.“We have to look at home defence. We have to look at civil defence, and we have to look to the mobilisation of industries, building up a war economy – the whole nine yards.”View image in fullscreenApproaching Kraków’s central station.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianBrussels, Belgium: ‘War councils’The timetable for the Eurostar services from London St Pancras to Brussels once defined the parameters of the working day for Georg Riekeles, as an EU official dealing with British Brexit negotiators.Riekeles, a Norwegian, has worked in the Brussels institutions for about 15 years, most recently as a diplomatic adviser to Michel Barnier. Today, nursing a small Vedett beer in Le Coin du Diable bar in the shadow of the European Commission’s towering headquarters, he is taking a break from his work for the European Policy Centre thinktank. “It’s no overstatement to say that European countries are facing the most dire situation they have faced since the end of the second world war,” he says.View image in fullscreenA thousand miles of rail track links London St Pancras to the city of Lviv in western Ukraine.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianSome of the barricades that fortified the EU quarter during a summit of leaders are yet to be removed but the circus has moved on. EU leaders agreed to “become more sovereign [and] more responsible for its own defence”. They endorsed a decision to open up €150bn (£125bn) in loans for European defence spending, and to relax the rules on spending and debt rules to allow Europe to potentially raise a further €650bn over the next four years for arms.After years of France vainly banging the drum for strategic autonomy from the US, European leaders’ hands have been forced by Trump’ssuspension of military aid and intelligence support to Ukraine, now reinstated, the start ofbilateral peace talkswith Vladimir Putin and the imminent attack on European businesses through import tariffs.View image in fullscreenGeorg Riekeles says it will take a while for Europeans to respond to the ‘new world’.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianThe summit should be seen as the first of a series of European “war councils”, Riekeles says. He predicts that financial and military support forUkrainewill ratchet up as forms of hard security arrangements less dependent on the US are being worked out. But “this is not a system where you can just push a button”.Out of Putin’s war and Trump’s treachery, a new Europe is being born | Nathalie TocciRead moreIt is in the “European DNA” to “want to think that the world is globalising, that a more open world and interdependence is a condition for security, rather than dependencies or interdependencies being at risk of creating a security risk”, says Riekeles.The reality is that it will take a little time to respond to the “new world”, he says. “Think ofGermany, I mean, they decided to rely on Russia for their energy, for China for trade and the US for security,” says Riekeles. “All three of them are gone.”Frankfurt, Germany: ‘A dysfunctional country’As the high-speed train from Brussels Midi to Frankfurt enters Aachen station, on the Belgian-German border, two officers in the black uniform of thepolizeispot something and start to run along the platform. They board the train and zero in on a black man halfway down coach 23. “Where is your ID card?” they demand of the man in English, after he fails to understand their German. He duly offers his passport. His papers are in order. They move on. “Always the same,” says Dr Oliver Gnad, who runs the Bureau of Current Affairs thinktank in Frankfurt. “It feels super uncomfortable. It starts to become a racist system.”View image in fullscreenPolitical thinker Dr Oliver Gnad says there is a risk the AfD may become the biggest party in the next elections.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianIn 2022, the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights found that more people of sub-Saharan African heritage were stopped by police in Germany (33%) than in any other European country apart from Austria (40%) in the previous five-year period.Immigrants and asylum seekers have become a target for politicians seeking to assuage the anger of those at the rough end of Germany’sailing economyand failing infrastructure, as epitomised by a much-maligned rail network.After the most recent election, Germany’s chancellor in waiting, Friedrich Merz, the leader of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union, announced a plan to make constitutional amendments to unleash up to €1tn in defence and infrastructure spending.“Germany is back,” he said.Merz has a small window to push the plan through before the new Bundestag is convened on 25 March with its blocking group of the far-right, pro-Kremlin Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and the Left party.Prof Matthias Moosdorf, a cellist by profession with a hairstyle worthy of the pop star Leo Sayer in his pomp, is the AfD’s foreign policy spokesperson in the Bundestag.The MP says he joined the party after being ostracised for his belief that Germany had a problem of “other cultures not related to our culture”. “My colleagues from the music world said, ‘OK, you are now engaged with this Nazi party, and we don’t allow you to give any concert any more’,” he says.Moosdorf believes Vladimir Putin does not pose a threat to Germany and that the rush to change the constitution to increase spending was “anti-democratic”.“We are a dysfunctional country,” he says. “We have all the migration problems. We have all the problems with deindustrialisation. It doesn’t make any sense for the biggest country like Russia to risk a war against Nato, against Germany. This is completely nonsense.”The AfD became Germany’s second largest party after winning 20.8% of the vote in the election, and is by far the dominant force in east Germany.View image in fullscreenEn route to Vienna.Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian“If they [the government] don’t deliver on my cost of living, if they don’t deliver on ‘I feel threatened by mass immigration and we don’t integrate them’, then I think the AfD is going to rise to probably the biggest party in the next elections,” says Gnad, who was forced to work from home today because of a transport strike.One of his friends is Ben Hodges, who was the commanding general of the United States army Europe until his retirement in 2018. He lives in Frankfurt with his German-American wife.“This is anything but a peace plan, it is a surrender,” says Hodges, 66, of Trump’s recent intervention.“I think it’s pathetic that Europe has taken so long to get its act together and combine its economies to challenge Russia,” he adds. “You could shut down Russia economically, if you were serious about it. But I’m afraid there’s too many countries in Europe are still benefiting from Russian crime.”Vienna, Austria:Trying to float above world eventsThe distinctive gondolas of the Wiener Riesenrad, the grand ferris wheel in Vienna’s Prater park, appear unchanged since they featured in the film noir classic The Third Man. The film’s director, Carol Reed, and author, Graham Greene, explored the moral ambiguity of postwar Vienna and the immanent good and evil of mankind.There is no shortage of ambiguity in Austria’s approach to Ukraine.Agreement on a new centrist coalition governmentwas reached a few weeks ago, and while Austria has been a neutral state since the second world war, it has affirmed its support for Ukrainian sovereignty. Yet Austria was within a whisker of having its first far-right-led government since 1945, and one that is openly pro-Kremlin. The Freedom party (FPÖ) won the largest share of the vote in the recent election with 28.85% of votes cast.Coalition talks fell by the waysideover the party’s demands for control over the interior ministry, among other issues.Austria would have probably joined Hungary and Slovakia as potential blocks on EU efforts to support Ukraine. The FPÖ’s leader, and the country’s prospective chancellor, Herbert Kickl, has spoken of the“long history of provocations, including by the US and Nato”.View image in fullscreenMarcus How, a political consultant, riding the Wiener Riesenrad ferris wheel in Vienna, famously seen in the film The Third Man.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianIt offers a worrying portent of what could happen in Germany, suggests Marcus How, the head analyst at VE Insight, an investment risk adviser. “Politically, it’s always been a bit of a kind of canary in the coalmine,” he says.Sipping on a glass of apple juice in Cafe Landtmann, a favourite of Sigmund Freud, Thomas Hofer, a former journalist who reported on the FPÖ and now runs a political consultancy, says there is a tendency, exhibited in varying degrees by a lot of Europeans, for Austrians to believe they can float above world events. “Don’t you feel all right? Isn’t it nice? Isn’t it comfortable?” he says.View image in fullscreenThomas Hofer, pictured in Vienna, says Austrians can tend to think they can remain detached from world events.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianKraków, Poland:Distressing time for pro-Atlantic generationIt has been a tense few weeks at the Polonia wax museum (“So bad, it’s good” was a recent review) a short walk from Kraków’s central station. They were not sure whether to save their money for a new pope, when the sculptures cost up to €12,000 each. Followingreassuring newsabout the health of the pope from the Vatican, the owner, Marian Dreszer, opted to update his models of Trump, Volodymr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader has been on display in the basement in a jail cell due to incidences of him being spat upon and punched by visitors. The three men will be put around a negotiating table, says Dreszer. “But maybe Trump will be spat at too now,” says his son Maciej.View image in fullscreenMarian Dreszer, owner of the Polonia Wax Museum in Kraków, says a model of Vladimir Putin had to be moved after being spat at and punched.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianIt has been a particularly distressing time for Poles of a certain age as the Trump administration reveals its seeming indifference to European security, says Dr Natasza Styczyńska, an associate professor at Kraków’s Jagiellonian University.“It’s a huge disappointment especially for the traditionally pro-Atlantic generation, people who still remember communism, for whom America was always the embodiment of democracy, freedom, minority rights, you know, all of these things we didn’t have,” she says. “For this generation this is a shock.”There is, however, near unanimity that part of the response must be to ramp up defence spending.View image in fullscreenDr Natasza Styczyńska says Trump’s indifference to European security has been a ‘huge disappointment’ for many Poles.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianPoland will spend an expected 4.7% of GDP on defence this year, the highest among the Europeans in Nato. The prime minister, Donald Tusk, has spoken of the potential for Poland to acquire a nuclear deterrent. He has further proposed more than doubling Poland’s army to 500,000 troops and establishing compulsory military training for all adult men by the end of the year.But all this has a cost. And in Kraków’s city hall, Aleksander Miszalski, a mayor with ambitions to revitalise the transport system and open new parks, says money is tight. A debate is raging about how to find cash at all levels of government. “Inflation and rising cost of salaries and energy are big problems,” he says.View image in fullscreenKraków’s mayor, Aleksander Miszalski, is discussing plans to build bunkers to ‘hide’ 1 million people.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianNext month Miszalski, 44, who is a political ally of Tusk’s and regional chair of his Civic Platform party, will travel to Warsaw for a meeting about civil defence – and building bunkers. “We’ve got like 5% of what we need,” he says. “We have a lot of them but very small. In hotels, old bunkers, small bunkers. We need to hide 1 million people in case of something … You have to change what you have been thinking about for the last decades.”Przemyśl, Poland: “It’s unpredictable because of the blond-hair guy”The grand, white-stone railway station at Przemyśl, close to the Polish-Ukrainian border, has been a first port of call for hundreds of thousands of refugees from the war in Ukraine. What was a deluge is now a trickle but the numbers being taken in at the Hope Foundation refugee centre, a place for short-term stays, tend to swell when Russian strikes are at their heaviest.View image in fullscreenJacek Wiarski, left, and Don Seehafer, who run the Hope Foundation helping Ukrainian refugees in Przemyśl.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianThey are looking after just 15 people at the moment – and that is just as well. Their funders’ promise of a new furnace was killed off by Trump’s decision to end USAid support in Ukraine. The online psychological support provided by a Greek NGO was also terminated as a result of the White House decision. “The impact was immediate,” says a local volunteer, Jacek Wiarski. “It’s unpredictable because of the blond-hair guy.”Maryna Drasbaieva, 21, who has been in the centre for nearly a year after escaping Kherson, the partially occupied region of south Ukraine, was a trainee baker at home and delights the other residents with her pancakes. She shakes her head, and looks away when asked whether Trump could bring peace. “I hate politics,” she says. “There was too much dying at home. My mum needs an operation. We want to go to Germany.”View image in fullscreenDon Seehafer at the Hope Foundation.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianIt has not been easy to keep the centre going, with some local resentment bubbling up in the last two years at the 1 million Ukrainian refugees in the country. A recent posting on social media asking for donations received a depressing response, says Wiarski. “They write, ‘Why do you want to support them?’” he says. “‘Why are they getting our money from the social security?’”Lviv, Ukraine: ‘You’re either with Ukraine or you’re with Russia’It is the start of spring in western Europe but as the train passes through Medyka, the border crossing between Poland and Ukraine, the sky is sleet-grey and there is heavy snow.View image in fullscreenPassengers arrive in Lviv, Ukraine.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianIn the train’s second carriage, Anastasia Krapyva is returning to Kyiv to see her family.

It scares her a bit.“It’s no good,” she says. “What Donald Trump is doing is not good for Ukraine. It might be good for Russia but not Ukraine.”During a visit to the Unbroken national rehabilitation centre in Lviv, Serhiy Kiral, the city’s deputy mayor, who also has a responsibility for international cooperation and visited Washington in that capacity shortly before the presidential inauguration, is no less despairing of the American approach.He quotes Henry Kissinger: “To be an enemy of America can be dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal.”“What will the Americans decide?” asks Kiral. “Are they going to side with Putin again? I think at some point, if that continues, we’ll probably have to say ‘enough is enough.

More than 220,000 people havedied in the UK, out of7 million worldwide. Many more have been left with adevastating post-viral illness.But how did it change the way we think? Did it alter how we see ourselves, and our relationships with others and the rest of the world?Amid the fear, social isolation and politicisation of the pandemic, conspiracy theories were born and polarisation appeared to grow. Yet experts trying to piece together the lasting impact that Covid has had on our social norms believe it may have merely accelerated worrying but existing trends of distrust and disillusionment, while some of the potentially unifying forces that the virus spawned have proved more fleeting.While the evidence for how Covid has shaped social attitudes requires careful interpretation, research data can offer some insights.Take the question of trust in politics. Comparing attitudes of political confidence in the five-year period from 2019 to 2024 – before the pandemic and after it – the British Social Attitudes surveypublished last yearfound levels of trust in government in the UK were as low as they had ever been. A record 45% told the survey they would “almost never” trust a government of any party to place the country above their party.And 58% would “almost never” trust any politician to tell the truth when they are in a tight corner. More than two-thirds – 69% – agreed or agreed strongly with the assertion: “I don’t think the government cares much what people like me think.” In 2014 that figure was 53%.Almost half of Britons did not trust the government to place country before party in 2023People who have less trust in their government are more open to considering different ways of doing things, as perhaps has been reflected in some of the political turbulence of recent years. Nearly 80% believed the present way of governing Britain could be improved “quite a lot” or “a great deal”, the BSA found. A record 53% supported changing the electoral system to be more representative of minority parties.In the longer term, there is evidence of a decrease in confidence in democracy itself.Asked in 2023how well they thought democracy worked in Britain, 33% said poorly and 43% said well; 10 years earlier, just 15% said poorly and 57% thought it worked well.But Covid was not the only shock of a tumultuous period in the UK that also witnessed a tortuous Brexit, a cost of living crisis and two prime ministers being ousted from office. Nor did the pandemic invent social atomisation, scepticism of authority or division. Covid is certainly not the only factor shaping attitudes in recent years, say experts. Some believe it may not even be the most significant.“At the time I felt the pandemic was absolutely one of those disruptions that was going to shape our future,” says Bobby Duffy, a professor of public policy and director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London. “But looking at it now, [what we see] is that it has reinforced and accelerated existing trends that we’ve been seeing for a long, long time.”There has long been evidence, for example, of disillusionment and increased social atomisation, Duffy says. On the question of whether older generations believe their children will have a better life than they did, the financial crisis of 2008-09 was potentially a more significant event than Covid, he says, with research showing this was a point when optimism in the future dramatically slumped.Jennie Bristow, a reader in sociology at Canterbury Christ Church University who has written widely about the impact of the pandemic onyoung people, agrees that it “brought to a head many of the trends that were already happening. Covid didn’t create adolescent mental ill health, for instance. It didn’t suddenly bring about major mistrust in institutions.”But unlike Duffy, her view is that the pandemic had an unprecedented impact on our thinking, not least because of the hugely restrictive responses it provoked. Bristow argues that while lockdowns were imposed with the aim of saving lives, one net effect was to formalise and embed social isolation – with all its negative consequences.This has led to distrust of other people, particularly young people, as “germs on legs”, she says. The intense focus on obeying the rules also bred a more general mutual suspicion, she argues. “Everyone had their own version of the rules they were following, and they were [criticising] people who they thought were breaking them if they were doing something different. So there was that distrust of each other in society.”That deepening distrust arguably had other consequences.From the earliest days of the pandemic, conspiracy theories spread among a small butcommitted minority, warning of the purported danger of 5G phone masts and claiming a future vaccine would involve microchips being implanted in people at the behest of Bill Gates.Though easily debunked, these conspiracy theories have endured, mutated and spawned others. Conspiratorial thoughts around vaccines have proved remarkably enduring: in January 2021, as the vaccine rollout began in Britain, 75% of UK adultstold YouGovit was definitely or probably false that vaccines had harmful effects that were not being disclosed. In August 2024 that figure had fallen to 56%, and those who thought it was definitely or probably true had soared from 14% to 34%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2021, the percentage of children in England who were fully vaccinated by their fifth birthdayfell belowthe WHO target of 95% for the first time, NHS figures show; it now stands at 92.6% – though this too has been alonger-term trend, according to child health experts.“I don’t think this is necessarily a unique phenomenon,” says Karen Douglas, a professor of social psychology at the University of Kent, whose work focuses on the appeal and consequences of conspiracy theories. “We know that during any time of crisis whenever there is social unrest, people are worried and scared, and we tend to see conspiracy theories. It’s a perfectly natural reaction.”People felt unsafe and were being drip-fed information, obliged to comply with unprecedented state controls and isolated from their normal social networks – it was, she says, a “perfect storm” to foster conspiracy theories. “Most people aren’t talking much about the Covid 19 crisis any more, but I think that at least for some people these doubts and feelings of mistrust that are associated with conspiracy theories have remained.”Did anything positive emerge from the pandemic? Some evidence, during the crisis, certainly suggested so: three times as many peopletold an ICM surveyin late 2020 that the disease had brought society together (41%) as said they felt it was more divided (13%).‘We warned everyone: do not go near Tom Cruise!’ How Covid sent British TV haywire, five years onRead moreEven then, though, the sense of unity was slipping. In May 2020, 60% of people said that overall, the public’s response to Covid showed it was united; seven months later that number was down to 50%. Despiteanecdotalandpollingevidence during the lockdowns of new local connections being forged, more recent data suggests we may have reverted to where we started. In 2023-24, 61% said they felt strongly or very strongly connected to their local neighbourhood, according togovernment statistics; that is about the same as 2021-22 (63%), and every other year back to 2015 (60-63%).“There definitely was a sense of coming together,” says Duffy. “There was a sense of: could this be a revival period for civil society? But it’s not dissimilar to lots of the other infrastructures we put in around Covid [that have since been dismantled]. As soon as a crisis is gone, we do slip back to the usual way of working … I suspect it was always a bit of wishful thinking.”More time will need to pass before the legacy of Covid can be accurately assessed. But, suggests Duffy, history may come to judge its impact – relative to pre-existing trends in society – as having been less consequential than it seemed at the time.“Covid definitely will be seen as part of the [forces] defining now and into the future, but only a part,” he says. “Not to the extent that you would think a global pandemic that upended our life for two years would.”Explore more on these topicsCoronavirusHow Covid changed usInfectious diseasesHealth policyHealthCommunitiesSocial exclusionLong CovidnewsShareReuse this content"

Customers can see the horrors of a dreadful situation they’re paying the price forLucy ManganMon 17 Mar 2025 18.00 EDTShareIt is not really the place of a critic to offer advice. But sometimes the urge is overwhelming, so here goes. If you are the director of communications for a huge, hated utilities company seen by the public to be responsible forendless discharges of sewageinto major watercourses whenever its plants are overwhelmed, do not invite a documentary team in until you have your house in order. If you do, do not say: “The impression given is that the Thames is dirtier than five, 10, 15 years ago. I don’t believe that’s true! But I don’t have the evidence.”Thames Water: Inside the Crisis is a two-part documentary by Barnaby Peel. He was granted access for six – let’s call them tricky – months, with the company facing an ever-shortening “liquidity runway”, as the CEO, Chris Weston, insists on calling it. This means that, with an operating profit of about £140m a year and debts of £15bn, largely accrued during the happy days of 2006-17, when£2.7bn was paid out in dividendswhile debt tripled, the company will run out of cash by June 2025 unless a quick way is found to turn all that red black. We follow Weston and his team as they try to persuade the regulatory body, Ofwat, that the best means of doing this is to raise customer bills by up to 53%.I suppose, if pressed, I would have another piece of advice. If you are the CEO of a huge company trying to pass onthe effects of epic historical mismanagementto customers and Ofwat refuses to let you, do not complain about “how invasive and influential” it is, nor add “especially around dividends”. Do not then say of your company’s dreadful situation: “I want to fix it. I don’t know how it got this way.” It will make you look thick at best and disingenuous at worst.While the senior management wail about unfair media stories and the need to “change the narrative”, the frontline staff try to keep sewage out of rivers. There is 26-year-old Josh, the new manager of the struggling Mogden sewage works, one of the largest in the country and known by its handlers as “the Beast”. (They call Josh “Harry Potter”, but admire his skills and willingness to help with everything that needs to be done.) The old hands there include Marcus, Bob and Dave, who have decades of experience among them. They remember better times, when everyone took pride in the job and the place was spick and span. “But we need more people,” says Bob. “They just cut back and cut back on everything.” Josh notes – before he leaves for another, less hopeless job – that the company is running in part on the remaining goodwill and diligence of the old guard. “The team is doing absolutely everything it can and it’s still not enough,” he says at his exit interview. “All we’ve needed is the cavalry and they haven’t come over the hill.”Points of light in the darkness are the new wastewater and bioresources director, Tessa Fayers, and the new chief operating officer, Esther Sharples (“Thames Water has categorically underinvested … We’re at the stage now where assets don’t wobble – they fail”). They have the confidence to admit to and take responsibility for the problems they have inherited and the competence to tackle them – at least, as best they can in the absence of much support or any money.When (in the second episode) the “liquidity runway” is extended bya short-term loan of £3bnfrom creditors, Fayers and Sharples all but roll their eyes in disbelief. If pressed again, I would advise handing over the company to them and watch shit get done, instead of pumped into waterways.Inside the Crisis provides a lucid explanation of the historical and present situation and a phenomenal portrait of the kinds of people that comprise a business (and how they are distributed across the hierarchy). Directors of communications should certainly study it. The public should watch, too. Hopefully, they will divert their ire from the employees they see on the flooded streets, or picking dead fish out of stinking streams, to the unseen powers who deserve it (including Margaret Thatcher’s government, which privatised water services in England and Wales in the first place, and Ofwat; both get an easy ride here).The possibility of the company being temporarily taken back into public ownership via special administration is touched on, but it would have been good to hear more about it – mostly so the public knows that this is a weapon in the arsenal if and when other privatised companies begin to fall apart. There is always more mess coming down the pipes.Thames Water: Inside the Crisis airs on BBC Two and is available on BBC iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionThames WaterDocumentaryFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

In Brooklyn, New York, about 50 people gathered outside a Tesla showroom on Saturday afternoon to loudly make their displeasure clear, the fourth such protest in the last four weeks.Other anti-Tesla actions have seen bullets fired through a dealership window and molotov cocktailsthrown at a charging station. But this was a rather more genteel protest, as evidenced by the signs on show. “Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,” read one, channeling a poem by the American poet James Russell Lowell.Elon Musk faces week of harsh setbacks amid Tesla selloff and Doge backlashRead moreOne banner said: “Musk is too brusque,” another: “Very uncool.” One sign, however, offered a more prosaic example of the anger on display, riffing on aDead Kennedys song: “Nazi trucks fuck off.”As protesters chanted: “Hands off our data,” and “ArrestElon Musk,” there certainly seemed to be plenty of support from passersby. People in cars and trucks repeatedly blasted their horns – including, at one point, a man driving a Tesla.“This is probably the most consequential moment in US history since, I don’t know, the civil war. I don’t know what to liken it to, but we’re on a precipice, and so I can’t actually concentrate on anything right now except protesting,” said Kirsten Hassenfeld, a 53-year-old artist and editor who lives inBrooklyn.“I think there are people that haven’t woken up to this yet, but I think that we’re sliding into a full-on authoritarian state. I’m terrified,” she said.Musk has witnesseda mass sell-offof Teslas in recent weeks, in protest against his unprecedented intrusion into the US government through the so-called “department of government efficiency”. Sales of new vehicles have declined around the world, with February sales in Australiadown about 72%compared with the same month in 2024; in Germany sales weredown 76%for the same period, while Tesla’s stock price has lost almost half its valuesince December.As protests have grown, the White House has rallied round Musk. Last week Donald Trump claimed the boycott was “illegal”, while Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said on Friday she would launch an investigation into vandalism againstTeslavehicles and showrooms.“If you’re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we’re coming after you. And if you’re funding this, we’re coming after you. We’re going to find out who you are,” Bondi told Fox Business.In Brooklyn, people were apparently undeterred by the threat. Teslas driving past the protest were treated to a volley of boos, and lusty chants of “Sell your Tesla”. The demonstration certainly appeared to have restricted the number of people entering the dealership: the Guardian counted three customers in the space of an hour and a half.Donna C, who asked not to give her last name, said it was her fourth time protesting at that dealership.“It’s important for me because Elon Musk has carte blanche to destroy our country, destroy our democracy, destroy the institutions that millions of New Yorkers and millions of Americans rely on. Donald Trump has allowed him to buy his way into the government with hundreds of millions of dollars of contributions,” Donna said.“I think what these protests are doing is opening the eyes of Americans in their millions across the US to what is actually going on,” she said. “My parents grew up in fascism in Italy under Mussolini. I’ve seen what can happen. We know the history, the same steps are being taken.”Nearly 20 Tesla showrooms and charging stations have seen deliberate fires set over the past few weeks, while dozens of owners have had their cars variously egged, used as receptacles for dog feces, or coated withKraft cheese singles. The protests on Saturday seem to have largely remained calm, however, despite the anger of those attending.“I’ve been pissed off and furious for a while, and a friend of mine told me, ‘If you want to come and scream and shout at Tesla, then show up on Saturday,’” said Yedon Thonden, 57.“Tesla is a good target. You know, their stock prices are sinking. Their leadership is cashing out their investments. And I think Elon is obviously worried about his company,” she said.“I think that this administration is going to realize pretty quickly that the economy is tanking. So the more we can highlight that, the better.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsProtestTeslaNew YorkElon MuskBrooklynfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Reform send out an invitation to attend a press conference with the promise of a “special announcement”. The media attend with high expectations only to be rewarded with a crushing sense of anticlimax. One special announcement turned out to be a 30-minute whinge fromNigel Farageabout some local elections being cancelled. Another was the news that Andrea Jenkyns would be standing for mayor in Greater Lincolnshire. Not even Andrea’s friends give much of a toss about that.Fair to say, then, that expectations were not high for Monday’s latest special announcement. But we travelled to the Royal Horseguards hotel in Westminster in hope. Maybe this time … a fatwa on Rupert Lowe. That would be news. Perhaps the hapless ex-Conservative MP Jonathan Gullis had been let in out of the cold. Only a few weeks ago he was saying how hard it was for someone who had gone out of his way to make enemies to get a job. Could it be that Nige had taken pity on him and offered him the chance to return to parliament at the Runcorn byelection?Sadly not. On entering the Gladstone library we were greeted by the sight of 29 empty seats on a raised stage. Reality cut in. We were going to be offered a handful of councillors who hadswitched allegiance to Reform. Something that would struggle to make a story in a local paper. There was also a fair chance that some of them regarded Reform as their best hope of retaining their seats at the local elections in May. The Tories are heading for meltdown.Lee Anderson, Richard Tice and James McMurdock shuffled into the front row seats as the theme tune from the darts played in the background. They are all very much beta males now. Acolytes who are only tolerated so long as they keep quiet. Relegated to a walk-on role. Dicky is only useful as a man to meet and greet people wearing union jack ties. As chief whip, Lee’s entire job is to make sure that McMurdock doesn’t misbehave.Reform is now very much the Nigel and Zia Yusuf show. After a brief video in which Nige and Zia repeated “Britain is broken” again and again, the party chairman came out to open proceedings. Reform was the greatest party of all time, he lied. No party had grown as fast as Reform, he lied. The announcement was going to be very special, he lied.“Now, I give you the member of parliament for Clacton,” he said. There was an awkward pause. Nige’s constituents aren’t the only ones to forget he is their MP. But eventually Farage clocked that this was his moment and he walked to the lectern. His safe place. His happy place. Nige only knows that he’s alive when he is the centre of attention. Lights. Camera. Action. Mouth creased into his fake crocodile smile. The very essence of uncontained narcissism. The good temper only skin deep.Nige began with a few words of self-congratulation. Who better to praise than himself? It was entirely down to the Brexit freedoms he had won that Keir Starmer had been a success on the global stage. It was nonsense, but no one was quibbling. He then started on the economy. Terrible. Oddly, he didn’t attribute that to our Brexit freedoms. The Tories? They were a complete waste of space. They had no purpose. On this he had a point.Next a brief mention of Rupert Lowe. Or rather, “one MP”. Farage couldn’t bring himself to mention Lowe by name. The hate that dare not speak. Though we did get his own, peculiar take on the fallout. One that had nothing to do with Rupert having lurched even further to the right than Farage and getting glowing endorsements from Elon Musk. There’s only room for one prima donna in Reform and it wasn’t going to be Lowe. Besides, Nigel likes to keep his racism under wraps. Rupert wears his on his sleeve with his support for Tommy Robinson.It was like this. One MP had been doing things that demanded the suspension of the whip and an investigation by a KC. A report would be published in due course. Nige was also horrified by the fact that Zia had been the target of online Islamophobia. Why was it that the media weren’t reporting that many members of Reform were openly racist? It was an unusual request from a party leader. But OK.All the while, Lee just nodded. Seriously. His amnesia is complete. As is Farage’s. Anderson only joined Reform after he found his remarks about Sadiq Khan, which the mayor described as Islamophobic, were found to be too much for the Tories. Then maybe being racist about Khan is just normal politics. Being racist about your own party chairman, not so much. There was a line. And it had been crossedThen to the reveal. It had all been desperately underwhelming so far. Just Nige reprising his favourite moans into a microphone. It was about to get even more underwhelming as he finally got round to introducing his latest acquisitions to a seriously unimpressed audience. Even Nigel looked bored. In the front row, only Dicky could manage a perma-smile. Inside he must be dying a little more.

People who could fall out with their reflections. One by one they took the stage to ever-diminishing applause. Like contestants for the Generation Game. Only without the lure of a cuddly toy for a prize. Even their own families would struggle to have cared. All will soon be forgotten. Cast out and discarded like all of Nige’s other toys. There shalt be no God but Nige.This also turned out to be a press conference without any questions. We were now down to damage limitation. Instead, Nige opted for a pool clip with GB News and a brief huddle. It didn’t go to plan. What did he think of Elon Musk’s remarks about Rupert Lowe. “GOOD, GOOD, GOOD,” he shouted over the female journalist as he tried to escape. Someone else asked about Rupert. “YAWN. BORING. I’M BORED. UGH,” he responded. His passive aggression had just morphed into active aggression.The famous champion of free speech had just decided he had had enough of other people’s free speech. Nige pushed his way to safety. Chased out of his own presser. The not-so-special one.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchReform UKNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

The great pop-pioneer looks back on an extraordinary career, from getting thrown out of art school to covering Kate Moss in fibreglassZoe WilliamsMon 17 Mar 2025 11.01 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 12.22 EDTShareAllen Jones, painter, sculptor and print-maker – he calls himself a painter who sculpts – is arguably the first, debatably the most famous British pop artist. I meet him in the studio he built 20 years ago, when he moved out of London to the Cotswolds, the kind of chocolate-box surroundings where they’ll only let you build something if it looks like a barn. “But a barn is designed specifically to keep light out!” he says in amused frustration, and huh, yes, sounds obvious when you say it. An architect found his way round that, and the place is swimming in light.Against one wall of the studio are five of the fibreglass female figures he made as an ongoing series between the early 80s and 2015. At 5ft 2in, they are slightly smaller than lifesize mannequins. The critic Mark Hudson has described them as having “a faintly unnerving quality, with something of the doll, something of the surrealist totem and the automaton, like Coppélia”. In the facing corner is Hatstand, part of the fetish furniture series that inflamed the feminists of the second wave. Steps – comprising Hatstand, Chair and Table – have the distinction of having been controversial in pretty much every decade since the creation of the first, in 1969.I filtered it all through my interest in pop culture and fetish magazines – and also memories of going to Madame TussaudsYou’d recognise these sculptures immediately – Hatstand is a woman in thigh-high maroon leather lace-up boots. The model-maker’s “first question,” Jones recalls, “was, ‘What’s she doing?’ and I said, ‘Well, she’s standing. In this ancient gesture of “Here I am”.’ I’m drawn to that hieratic figure, the ultimate notion of the figure.”Table is a woman with her breasts exposed, wearing long black gloves and a waspie corset – that old-school porn effect of clothes that accentuate nakedness – on all fours, with a pane of glass on her back. Chair is a woman lying on her back with a cushion on the backs of her thighs, so that you could sit on her. For 50 years now, critics and thinkers have been arguing about whether these represented a critique of the patriarchy, or were, themselves, patriarchal oppression. “I think it hampered my career,” he says quietly. “I’ve never said that to anybody.”View image in fullscreenImmediately recognisable … Green Table, 1972.Photograph: The artistThere are layers to this, the topsoil being discursive: for sure, and for years, the Step figures were all anyone wanted to talk about. When Jones was interviewed in Hamburg in 2016, that was the first time a journalist had ever not brought up Hatstand, “and then she rang up, later in the evening, and said, ‘My editor said, yeah, but what about the women?’”Beneath that, there’s that sharp disappointment of feeling that you’ve been misconstrued. “Militant feminism was a reaction to the same society I was living in. If they’d asked me to illustrate their manifesto, you’d think that was the perfect image: a woman on all fours, being made into an object.” And beneaththatwas his true intention, which has got entirely lost in the sound and fury, and while the intellectual in him gets that even “when people look at a Turner, they’re bringing their experience and perception to it. They’re not interested in why that was painted like that”, the artist in him was trying to have a different conversation altogether.View image in fullscreen‘Objectification rendered as object’ … Hatstand, 1969.Photograph: The artist“During the 60s,” he says, “the figurative artists in New York, who were working in sculpture, [George] Segal for example, there were echoes of surrealism, so it might be a real bicycle, but the figure was always in plaster. There was always this signal – it might look weird, but it’s art. And I thought, ‘How do you do it so that you remove that safety valve?’ And then I filtered that through my interest in pop culture, in fetish magazines, and memories as a child of going to Madame Tussauds.”He removed the safety valve, all right. Then it blew up. Turns out those things are there for a reason. “Depending on your point of view, this sounds like an excuse or an apology,” he says. I actually never thought the Step sculptures were misogynistic, I always saw them more as a gauntlet, and fascinating – objectification rendered as object. But then, I’m just one feminist, and like so many of us, I disagree with half the others.Allen Jones was born in 1937 and grew up in Ealing, London with a dad who loved to paint at weekends but was miles from any contemporary art scene, and who worked in a canning factory. Jones remembers seeing the Hoover building, “of course, in those days, it stood out like the Taj Mahal”. He remembers visits to Southampton, after the war, when the Queen Mary or Queen Elizabeth were in dock, “this illuminated ship, towering above the town”. His parents loved spectacle, the Lord Mayor’s Show, trooping the colour, “that thing, getting on the underground at Ealing Broadway, and 20 minutes later, arriving at Marble Arch, the beginning of the city. That idea of the glamour of the city stuck with me.”He went to the Royal College ofArt, and as a result of some incredibly 60s clash over who controlled the academy – the tutors or the students – he got kicked out, a random choice by all accounts,pour encourager les autres. He had expected the education to be more discursive and open to challenge than it was. “They’d say, ‘You can experiment in your third year. For now, look at nature.’ And you’d sit there thinking, ‘Is this a joke?’ We were working our arses off. I was in the life room pretty well every day, so was Hockney, so was Derek Boshier.”Jones, exiled, did a teacher training course, but the Royal College accidentally crowned him winner of their young contemporaries mural competition the same year he got kicked out, and this launched him. The teaching qualification, meanwhile, came in useful when he got a teaching gig in the late 60s in America.He went to New York in his mid-20s, newly married, moved in to the Chelsea Hotel, which was rammed with other artists and people giving cello recitals, naked. “It wasn’t group sex or anything, with us. We lived a very correct existence, and my wife [Janet, his first] became pregnant, as it happened, with twins.” (One daughter now works in arts administration, the other at law firm Clifford Chance).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I thought that I was inviting the viewer to go into the space. But by the end of the 60s, after I’d done about four or five of these paintings, I realised that actually I was inviting the figure to come out.”View image in fullscreenCritical confusion … Body Armour (Kate Moss).Photograph: The artistThat spurred him towards sculpture, and – skipping a number of years, here – another hot-button piece, Kate Moss in her sculpted fibreglass, leather and stainless steel suit, Body Armour, in 2013. It wasn’t controversial, as such. It generated more of a kind of critical confusion. Was this high brow or low, or no-brow, or what the hell?“Over the years, I’d occasionally been invited to do a portrait. And I’ve never quite squared the circle of a commissioned portrait, where I feel that the obligation is to record the person, as opposed to the person as an artist’s model, giving themselves to the artist. The one that I liked is when Picasso painted Gertrude Stein, who then said, ‘It doesn’t look anything like me’, and he said, ‘Give it time.’”I asked him which period of his life he felt most centre-stage – in the late 70s, when there were retrospectives at the ICA and the Serpentine, or maybe a decade ago,when the Royal Academy had one. Or perhaps in the mid-60s, when he went to America and doors swung open for him, as both visionary and interlocutor, cross-pollinating European upheavals in contemporary art and American iconoclasm.“I’ll be very pleased if I think I’ve had my foot on the stage,” he says, modestly. “I don’t take any of that for granted at all. I think I’m sufficiently a realist to know …” he says tentatively, then starts again. “It might turn out that you put more on the stage than your foot. I do feel that I was part of the contemporary dialogue.” This is literally as well as creatively true: he has a searching openness that feels much closer to the beginning of a career than the end, not just about his own work, but about everything he’s ever seen.Allen Jones Moves by Mark Hudson is published by Unicorn, £45Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtSculpturePaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

All the players were up for it … they had fire in their bellies.”Wearmouth was soaking up the atmosphere outside the stadium where a stream of fans posed for photographs at statues of Alan Shearer and Sir Bobby Robson, Newcastle legends who, nevertheless, did not win a major trophy.View image in fullscreenNewcastle fans celebrate outside the St James’ Park ground.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianOne of them was travel agency owner David Carruthers, 63, a lifelong supporter who had travelled up from York to watch the match in a Newcastle pub with his wife Diane.“It’s not easy being a Newcastle fan,” he said. “It’s challenging. It’s easy being a fan of teams like Liverpool but you always support your team – and then you get days like this. We had an amazing, unbelievable night watching it and it is good for the city as well.”All clubs say they have the most passionate, committed fans but some would say Newcastle fans have that little bit more. The celebrations in both London and Newcastle were, to say the least, wild.LiveNewcastle United win Carabao Cup to end 70-year trophy drought – videoOn BBC Radio Newcastle, wall-to-wall football chat on Monday, one listener got in touch to say he was changing the name of his dog to Eddie Howe. “Let us know,” a hoarse-voiced breakfast host Matt Bailey asked listeners. “Are you renaming your pet?

A-listers likeretinolandhyaluronic acidmonopolize attention and media coverage. But what about the unsung heroes – like reliable, hardworking urea?“It’s a really underrated ingredient,” says Dr Mark Strom, a dermatologist in New York City.Strom describes urea as a “workhorse”, saying: “It does a lot of beneficial things for the skin, but it’s not sexy.” Why not? Well, some people associate it with urine.Here’s what you need to know about urea.What is urea?Urea is a nitrogen molecule, anda chemical byproductof the body’s metabolic breakdown of proteins. In mammals, it is found most abundantly in urine, as well as blood, sweat and milk.More than 90% of globalurea productiongoes into agriculture; it is a popular fertilizer ingredient and has beendescribedas “the food of food”.When it comes to skincare, urea is most often used in creams, but it can also be a component of gels, lotions and ointments. It serves as a humectant – meaning, it retains moisture in the top layer of the skin. This fortifies the skin barrier and results in “a more moisturized and plumped feeling to the skin”, says Strom.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’It is sold in a range of concentrations, up to 40%. At concentrations above 10%, it also serves as a keratolytic, an exfoliant that helps the body shed the top layer of skin. If not exfoliated, dead skin cells build up and can result in dry, cracked skin, “like on the heels of the feet”, Strom says.Is urea pee?No.Although urea is one of the most abundant components of urine, commercial urea is a synthetic produced in laboratories. You can see some very complicated diagrams about how it’s producedhere, none of which mention toilets.Which conditions can a urea cream treat?Urea is commonly used to treat skin that is “really dry and rough”, says Dr Naeha Gupta, a board certified dermatologist.These rough patches are often the result of conditions like eczema, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis andkeratosis pilaris, a common and harmless condition that causes small red bumps to appear on the upper arms, legs and buttocks. These conditions all can result in the buildup of dead skin cells, and “something like urea can be really helpful for breaking down the skin and letting it discharge”, says Strom.High concentrations of urea can break down the thick-skin buildup in calluses, says Dr Rajani Katta, clinical professor of dermatology at the McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Houston.Urea can also be used to “soften and remove damaged or diseased nails”, according to theCleveland Clinic.How do you use urea cream?Low concentrations of urea – below 10% – are gentle and can safely be used on the body once or twice a day, Gupta says. She recommends applying a cream after a shower, when skin has been patted dry but there’s still some water on its surface. “The cream can really help retain that moisture,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Body moisturizers tend to include higher concentrations of urea, which can irritate the face.For feet and calluses, Gupta suggests applying a higher-concentration urea product before bed, then slipping on socks. “That way, you make sure it’s not rubbing off and you’re really getting it into those thick areas,” she says.I did this last week, and can confirm my dry, cracked feet were slightly less dry and cracked the next morning.What are the risks of urea cream?“Overall, [urea] is probably one of the safer ingredients in skincare,” says Strom.Ditch the soap! Dermatologists on 20 simple ways to love and protect your skinRead moreStill, there are some precautions to take. While products with low concentrations of urea can be safely used by most people, Katta suggests that products with high concentrations of urea – 30% or above – be used under the supervision of a physician.“Since it can break down thick skin, it can also break down normal skin, so high concentrations are used in only specific areas and very carefully,” Katta says.According to theCleveland Clinic, you should consult a physician if urea causes a rash, redness or irritation that doesn’t go away, or continued stinging or irritation.If you are pregnant, trying to get pregnant or breastfeeding, you should alsotalk to a doctorbefore using urea. This also applies if you have an infection; broken, inflamed or burnt skin; or allergic reactions to food, dyes, medicines or preservatives.Do people use pee for skincare purposes?Unfortunately, it’snot unheard of. But as one dermatologist toldthe Independentin 2016, putting urine on your face isn’t a good idea because it can cause reactions and isn’t particularly effective.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallySkincareBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Does every toy movie need to be an Oscar-worthy social commentary?Stuart HeritageMon 17 Mar 2025 12.01 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 12.17 EDTShareThis Easter, a new movie based on Sylvanian Families will be released into cinemas. If you’ve been keeping up with films based on toys for the last decade or so, then you’ll be forgiven for feeling a modicum of dread upon hearing this news. Because ever sinceBarbietook a billion dollars and found itself nominated for a bunch of Oscars, a toy movie isn’t allowed to be a toy movie any more. It has to be an auteur-driven toy movie; one that also functions as a commentary about the capitalist machinations that drive the toy industry.It’s everywhere. In 2022, Emily V Gordon and Jon M Chu announced that they were making a Play-Doh movie that would be about “creativity, imagination, and the purpose of art”. JJ Abrams is making a film based on Hot Wheels that he describes as “emotional and grounded and gritty”. A24 is making a Barney the Dinosaur film said to be heavily influenced by the work of Charlie Kaufman. These are all real things that are actually happening.And so, given all this, your stomach probably lurched at the prospect of something similar happening to Sylvanian Families. After all, very few things are quite as pure as Sylvanian Families. For the uninitiated, these are small toys made out of flocked plastic. Each toy is of a different woodland creature, prim and conservatively dressed. They are dainty and timeless and easy to love. When the UK’s only dedicated Sylvanian Families shop closed down in 2023, it felt like nothing but the death of innocence itself.The last thing that any of us needed was a film about Sylvanian Families that offered viewers a meta-critique of the Sylvanian Families brand. No edgy jokes about their lack of genitals. No social commentary about the toys being shaken out of their pristine comfort by class war or looming environmental disaster or the rise of rightwing populism. The only thing that anyone really wants from a Sylvanian Families movie is a lot of scenes of the Sylvanian Families acting like the Sylvanian Families.Reader, they understood the assignment. “Will Freya find a lovely birthday gift for her mummy?” asks the recently released trailer, “And will she succeed in choosing the tree of the year?” And that’s it. That’s the entire film. A little girl has to buy a birthday present for her mother, and then adequately judge a tree competition. Read that again. Doesn’t it feel nice?True, there are moments in the Sylvanian Families trailer that flirt with the kind of subversion we’ve grown used to. In one scene a young rabbit is about to bring a hammer down on a nail she’s holding in her other hand. In any other toy film, you could put money on her smashing her fingers up. But not here. Also, there’s a sequence where a character plays the saxophone, an instrument that brings dangerous connotations of jazz and sex. And yet she plays it, and it sounds nice, and nothing bad happens.View image in fullscreenNothing dangerous is about to happen … Sylvanian Families: the MovieIn fact, aside from a relatively loud noise that plays 28 seconds in, the trailer is as peaceful and charming as the toy itself. It’s so faithful to the source material, in fact, that at times it seems like the entire film was made by people just moving some Sylvanian Families toys around with their hands, as a child might. Honestly, given everything happening in the world, the trailer feels like a warm 70-second bath for your brain.Then again, perhaps it’s easy to overstate the influence of auteur toy films on the wide market. The sincere Sylvanian Families-style films are still out there, just not usually on theatrical release.For example, Netflix has put out a new non-Gerwig Barbie film at a rate of one or two every year since the start of the decade. Since Barbie was released, in fact, we’ve had Barbie: Skipper and the Big Babysitting Adventure (Barbie’s little sister successfully starts her own company), Barbie and Stacie to the Rescue (Barbie and her friend make new friends at a hot air balloon festival) and Barbie and Teresa: Recipe for Friendship (Barbie and her friends make food for a restaurant). Similarly, Netflix has an array of My Little Pony shows and films, none of which attempt to do anything but tell stories about My Little Ponies. The same goes for Thomas the Tank Engine.None of these have made a billion dollars. You don’t have to be a financial expert to assume that the Sylvanian Families film won’t either. But that isn’t the point. The point is that Freya needs to find a lovely birthday present for her mummy. Really, isn’t that enough?Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmBarbieToysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last week, it was signalling a plan to slash disability benefits. Jo White, the MP for Bassetlaw, was bemoaning the fact that people’s “aspirations are so low”. By the weekend, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, was blaming the numbers of disabled people on anoverdiagnosis of mental health conditions. Keir Starmer, however, was rumoured to be considering a U-turn on the cuts – apparently he hadn’t been expecting so much opposition from the cabinet and backbenchers. Why not, one might ask? They are, after all, members of the Labour party. Surely they would be uncomfortable with a plan that sounded exactly, to the letter, as if it had come from the Conservatives?Fine, it doesn’t look like the most expert job of managing the optics. But it has also left as many as 10 million people sleepless with worry, because the world this government describes bears no relation to the reality they are living in. As of last October, there were 3.6 million personal independence payment (Pip) claimants. Eligibility is stringent. The idea – last floated by Tony Blair, whose transformation into know-nothing golf-club pontificator is still startling after all this time – that we are “medicalising the ups and downs of life”, handing out diagnoses and sickness benefits to people who just feel a bit sad, is fanciful. According to the 2021 census, there are5.8 million unpaid carersin the UK, 1.2 million of those living in poverty, 400,000 in deep poverty. A report by the Social Metrics Commission found that, of the 14.9 million people living in poverty in the UK in 2021-22, 8.6 million were in families that included a disabled person.In any one of those families, there will probably be a carer who would love to work, but can’t get the support. They can’t find a job that will work around medical appointments, or school holidays, or the shambolic special educational needs and disabilities provision of many local authorities, or they can’t get a place at a day centre, or get respite, or there simply aren’t enough hours in the day.Carers UK estimated last year that if every unpaid carer in the country decided to cease caring tomorrow and joined the “productive” economy instead, that would cost the state £184bn a year. In other words, the cost of disability is already being shouldered mainly by disabled people and their loved ones. The state owes these families an enormous debt of gratitude as a baseline. On top of that, it owes them better services, so that those who want to work can do so; it owes them better services anyway, if it wants to count itself modern and humane; and it owes them the basic decency of recognition.What the government delivers instead is a narrative that sounds bland, but is actually gaslighting on a large scale. It describes a country in which poverty is caused by low aspiration and disability is a choice, by people who simply aren’t robust enough to be well. This country doesn’t exist. It describes a world that can’t afford for people to be chronically ill or disabled, when the opposite is true: we cannot wish away those things.In offering patchy, unsympathetic, parsimonious support, the state only traps more people in poverty, deprivation which it then performatively ignores. If you are reliant on Pip, it is truly terrifying to witness, but it should terrify all of us, because a government that can front out this kind of denial is one that is not listening, not curious, not realistic and not humane.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Dutch are asking the questionMark SmithIn our rainbow family, there are two dads and a mum – but the law in the Netherlands only recognises two of usMon 17 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 09.23 EDTShareOur daughter is very much on board with the idea that, unlike her, many other five-year-olds don’t have two fathers and a mum. “Only has one dad,” she’ll remark in a confidential tone of a newly made friend at the trampoline park or the swimming pool.My husband and I live in Amsterdam, a short cycle from our daughter’s mum, who is a longstanding mutual friend. Our daughter’s time is split between the two households. We are just one of many rainbow families in theNetherlands, where parents (often, a gay male couple and a single woman, or a lesbian couple) choose to have and raise children in constellations of more than two adults. The Dutch have a proud history of championing gay rights – it was back in 2001 that Amsterdam’s then-mayor presided over the world’s first same-sex marriages – and families such as ours have long been embraced here. And yet, from a legal point of view, we are unseen and, consequently, disadvantaged.Before my daughter’s conception, the three of us drew up a co-parenting agreement in the presence of a notary, planning for her arrival in (I dare say) more detail than most parents-in-waiting, affirming our shared desire for a three-way split in terms of responsibilities, and noting our collective attitudes to topics of consequence, from education to vaccination.But this kind of document is not legally binding because the Netherlands, in common with – well – everywhere, has no national legal provision for families such as ours. Most egregiously, the rights and responsibilities of the “non-biological” parent are unrecognised: only two names can be registered on a birth certificate.This disparity is a situation that Dutch lawmakers have been promising to rectify since 2016, when a government commission – with the support of gay rights organisations and the rainbow parenting foundation Meer dan Gewenst – firstadvised the governmentto recalibrate the definition of parenthood to reflect and recognise the way that children are increasingly being raised in a country that has long prided itself on progressiveness, pragmatism and tolerance.New researchcarried out by Ipsoson behalf of the independent research institute WODC suggests that between 1,700 and 9,200 “intentional multiparent families” exist in the Netherlands today – in a small country of 18 million inhabitants, that’s a whopping margin of error. But – paradox klaxon – how do you accurately quantify an invisible cohort?In our case, this political sloth affects the non-biological father most. While it might not affect us day-to-day, he is forbidden, for example, from making medical decisions on our daughter’s behalf, or travelling with her internationally without written permission from “the other two”. Our daughter may not discriminate between us as fathers, but the law certainly does. As a fellow gay dad told the Economist in 2019: “Legally I’m nothing to [my daughter]; emotionally I’m everything to her …”On 12 March, Teun Struycken, the state secretary for legal protection, attended a parliamentary debate to defend his decision to torpedo the latest attempt at “recalibrating the family” on budgetary grounds. While Struycken (who, ironically, is an appointee of the New Social Contract party) was at pains to signal that some of his best friends were in rainbow families, he said he wouldn’t be granting them legitimacy in law because the cost of implementing the proposed change, with its associated adjustments to the Netherlands’ tax and welfare systems, would be unjustifiably high.Struycken is part of the most rightwing Dutch government in years, a fact that led critics such as Michiel van Nispen of the Socialist party to ponder whether his decision was a lack of political will dressed up as parsimony – that other famed Dutch characteristic.It’s a shame. Even if you regard the scenario with extreme cynicism, the lowest estimate for activation (€11m) seems like a small price to pay for some very eye-catching pinkwashing, restoring the Netherlands back to its halcyon days, when it was regarded as the progressive capital ofEurope.Our hard-won rights are being erased one letter at a time | Eva WisemanRead moreA matchmaking service for “queer platonic coparenting” in the UK recently advertised a guest seminar by the Dutch author Sara Coster, whose speed-meeting events for prospective co-parents attract hundreds. She has even developed a set of discussion-provoking flash cards to that end (sample question: “Your child is ill and it’s changeover day. Will you bring your child to the other household, or let them recover first?”).

What does she want?Nils PratleyIs the chancellor just tweaking, or is she rewriting the definition of ‘anti-competitive’ under consumer’s noses?Mon 17 Mar 2025 13.52 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 14.26 EDTShareAnother day, another trip to Downing Street for the nation’s regulatory chiefs as the chancellor attempts (again) to “kickstart” growth and chop back red tape. A novelty this time was the suggestion that theCompetition and Markets Authoritywould be told to restrict the number, or at least the type, of deals it investigates. There could be changes to the “share of supply” and “material influence” tests that determine whether the watchdog barks.What does that mean in practice? Is it merely a tweak that removes a few administrative blurs in the current setup? Or is the definition of “anticompetitive” being quietly rewritten under consumers’ noses? There is a very big difference between the two visions. Unfortunately, no one seems keen to offer clarity.In her public statements, Sarah Cardell, the CMA’s chief executive,tends to emphasisethe uncontentious parts of her chancellor-pleasing mission, such as making decisions more quickly. No one objects to that. Then there’s the strong hint that the CMA will be inclined to stay away from deals between foreign companies, such as theMicrosoft/Activision proposalthat caused a lot of fuss a couple of years ago. That is slightly more controversial but still not groundbreaking stuff.What UK consumers – and UK businesses for that matter – want to know is if there has been a deeper philosophical shift. For instance, are there significant UK-only deals that would have been blocked in the past but could now be cleared?Take a controversial deal from the recent past that was stopped –the proposed merger of Sainsbury’s and Asda in 2019. Would that still be a non-runner on the grounds that it would lead to increased prices and reduced quality and choice of products, which is what the CMA said at the time? Or would the regulator now be slightly more open to the idea (however unpersuasive it still seems) that the two supermarkets in combination would have the muscle to reduce prices on popular foods by 10%?We’ll probably never find out because the CMA can’t opine on “what if?” scenarios and there is no suggestion the supermarket duo are planning to resuscitate their merger idea. The best guess here is that the deal would still be blocked. In current wounded form, Asda has justknocked 10% of Tesco’s share priceby threatening a price war, which suggests the stock market still thinks the private equity-owned business hasn’t been completely hobbled as a competitive force by its excessive borrowings.The point, though, is that the new political ambition to turn regulators into “pro-growth” vehicles is simply confusing. One can understand the desire to clear out bureaucratic clutter that can cause CMA investigations to take ages, but is the government also suggesting that the competition policy dial is currently set in the wrong place?On one hand, we have the CMA emphasising that it will continue to take an “effective and proportionate” approach to deals, which makes the agenda sound entirely in line with the traditional understanding that a strong competition policy is good for growth. On the other hand, we haveRachel Reevesand her motorcycle metaphors that seem to imagine regulators can kick the economy into life by doing something differently.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Time for a dose of realismMon 17 Mar 2025 11.53 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 14.03 EDTShareWhat’s in a name? With T-levels, quite a lot. By choosing a title that sounded a lot like A-levels – with T for technical – the reformers behind England’s latest post-16 qualification sent a message that the days of vocational education’s second-class status were over. The two-year courses, launched in 2020 (and not adopted in the rest of the UK), were supposed to boost applied learning and the prospects of the more than 50% of young people whodon’t study for A-levelsfollowed by a degree.There are more than 20T-level options, ranging from early years education to engineering, with each student choosing only one. But nearly five years on, the courses haven’t caught on.Fewer than 3%of 16-year-olds enrol for a T-level, with the vast majority preferring either A-levels, older “applied general” qualifications (which include BTecs), or some combination.Last year, about7,000 students gained a T-level. The dropout rate is higher than for other 16-18 courses, with almost a third of those enrolled in 2022 giving up. The figures for a T-level foundation course, intended as a stepping stone, are even worse. In 2021-22, only8% progressed as intended. The picture is incomplete partly because ministers decided, in January,to postpone adding T-level datato performance tables.Behind the scenes, a row is raging over what happens next. The original plan was to scrap other vocational qualifications once T-levels were up and running. Further education and sixth-form colleges soon realised this was a terrible idea. In 2021, aProtect Student Choicecampaign was launched with a warning that if BTecs were axed, 155,000 teenagers would be leftwithout any options at all.You would think rising concern about young people not in education or work, and particularly the growing number of teenagers and young adults on disability benefits, would make post-16 education a priority. Last week, Keir Starmer spoke of a“wasted generation”. But Labour’s policy in opposition, which was to “pause and review” the situation, was ditched after the election. Instead the skills minister, Jacqui Smith, postponed the defunding of older qualifications and relaxed the rules around the T-level’s compulsory45-day work placement.But the central problem remains: T-levels are narrower and harder than the courses they are meant to replace, making them unsuitable for students without a specific job in mind, and also for those who passed GCSEs with grade 4s or 5s rather than 6s or higher. College leaders have repeatedly challenged ministers over which courses they think such students should take. They are waiting for an answer.It is not an accident that faith in T-levels transcends party loyalties. The commission that came up with them was appointed by a Conservative, Philip Hammond. But its leading figure, David Sainsbury, is an influential Labour donor (and the chancellor of Cambridge University). A non-partisan approach to curriculum reform is, generally, a good thing. The danger otherwise is that each new government rips up the efforts of the one before.But in this case the problem appears to be the reverse: groupthink. Even the education select committee failed to break the spell. Its chair, Robin Walker MP,accused Rishi Sunak’s governmentof “prioritising saving face over … the interests of young people” after a report highlighted evidence that T-levels do not balance “rigour and accessibility” and noted that more than £1bn had been spent. Another review, from the charitableEducation Policy Institute, proposed breaking down T-levels into smaller components. It also pointed out that economically disadvantaged pupils, and the growing number with special needs and disabilities, would be disproportionately affected by the removal of more accessible alternatives.T-levels will be examined by MPs again as part of a new inquiry into further education, and also inProf Becky Francis’s curriculum review. The danger is that the issue doesn’t gain the kind of traction that would force a proper rethink. That’s because aside from A-levels, sixth-form studies are seen as a niche subject. Arguably, this attitude is the most elitist thing about education in England – more than the role of private and grammar schools, more than the dominance of a handful of highly selective universities.It also helps explain why the reforms haven’t worked. The experts commissioned to reshape the curriculum were clever people with good intentions. But in a democratic society, where a high premium is placed upon personal choice, more attention should have been paid to what teenagers want and are capable of. Because in the end, that is the test: no one can force them.What happens now will depend partly on campaigners. Sainsbury continues to be active on the pro-T-level side. A charity he founded, theGatsby Foundation, told MPs that rival qualifications must be defunded to ensure T-levels’ success. Last year, Gordon Brown wasenlisted in support. But the Protect Student Choice campaign has backers too, including hundreds of college principals, MPs with colleges in their constituencies, and peers who care about further education.To put things right, it will be necessary to admit what went wrong. Far from sorting out vocational education, the T-level saga has turned into the latest illustration of a longstanding problem, namely the poor treatment of colleges by the educational powers that be. Anyone seeking further proof only needs to consider the decision not to give college teachers in England the same5.5% pay rise as school teacherslast year – a disgraceful choice by a Labour government that ought to be trying to narrow the school-college gap.As one college principal told me, it is as if the highly able people in charge of education don’t fully grasp that the 155,000 pupils that the sector is most concerned about really exist – or think that if they and their teachers only tried harder, their grades could be nudged up. The reality, it is worth remembering, is that fewer than a quarter of GCSEs in England are gradedhigher than a 6.Of course ambition is vital, but any teacher will tell you that realism matters too: students who lose confidence in their ability quickly lose interest. All young people need courses, pitched at a level they can manage, to provide them with knowledge and interests to support and enrich their lives – as well as helping them find jobs later on. It’s time to tell the truth: T-levels don’t fit the bill.Susanna Rustin is a Guardian journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The letter lays out new conditions for institutions to receive federal funding, including in the form of student loans or scientific and medical research.Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in federally assisted programs or activities. The education department’s “Dear Colleagues” letter redefines the central targets of Title VI to centrally include supposed discrimination against whites. The letter was followed, on 28 February, witha set of guidelinesfor its interpretation. The novel understanding of anti-white discrimination in these documents is a chilling manifestation of educational authoritarianism.The novel understanding of anti-white discrimination in these documents is a chilling manifestation of educational authoritarianismIn the letter, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, Craig Trainor, writes:Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices. Proponents of these discriminatory practices have attempted to further justify them – particularly during the last four years – under the banner of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (‘DEI’), smuggling racial stereotypes and explicit race-consciousness into everyday training, programming, and discipline.However,the United States pretty clearly is built upon systematic and structural racism.US history shows that slavery was acentral factorin US wealth. The US was built on Indigenous genocide and colonialism, asseizing Indigenous landwas one of the reasons for seeking independence from England and is, in any case, foundational to the country’s formation. Structural racism also persists; for example, cities are segregated because of structural injustice in housing and mortgage law.The ways in which the US was built on racism, against Black Americans and Indigenous Americans, is central both to the study of its history and its present structure. If Americans do not have an understanding of this topic, they will not be well informed.The guidelines for what would count as a Title VI violation are vague. From the guidelines:a racially-oriented vision of social justice, or similar goals will be probative in OCR’s analysis of the facts and circumstances of an individual case.The most straightforward way to read the letter and the guidelines is as defining “school-on-student harassment” as including Black history. The letter treats teaching large swaths of Black and Indigenous history as akin to a white professor consistently referring to all of their Black students with a terrible racial slur.The “more extreme practices at a university” that “could create a hostile environment under Title VI” include “pressuring them to participate in protests or take certain positions on racially charged issues”. But reason, rationality and morality are sources of “pressure”. How does one distinguish the pressure placed on people by moral arguments for racially charged issues from other kinds of pressure?The guidelines create a culture of fear and intimidation around history. If one discusses Black history, one immediately risks endorsing the view that the United States “is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’”. The guidelines invite students to report their teachers and their school administrators for not adhering to a state-imposed ideology about history, as well as state-imposed ideology about gender, which threatens to make teaching critically about gender identity, or including trans perspectives, into school-on-student harassment. Failure to adhere to state ideologies about history and gender fits this new definition of “school-on-student harassment”. Billions in federal funding is at stake.View image in fullscreen‘By executive order, Trump is trying to dismantle the Department of Education.’Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/APThe guidelines are not just vague, they areintentionallyvague, in a way that would make it difficult for even a diligent administrator to interpret. They therefore allow maximum latitude for abuse. As the influential pro-Trump intellectual Jonathan Keepermanexplainedin the New York Times, referring to theTrump administration’swar on language:The things they’re attacking in these executive orders are sort of loose concepts. By focusing on these key terms that the left has grabbed on to, you can, without knowing much else about what you’re doing, at the scale of the entirety of the federal budget, basically remove a lot of the rot.The state of Florida has been a model of this strategy, leading to books being removed from school libraries because they normalize LGBTQ+ relationships, for example, and an unprecedented level of widespread fear among Florida’sprofessorsandteachers. But it has spread to other states. The state of Tennessee has an online“divisive concepts reporting tracker”form for students who wish to report professors whose teachingcan be seen as“promoting division between, or resentment of, a race, sex, religion, creed, nonviolent political affiliation, social class, or class of people”.The Dear Colleague letter and its attendant guidelines are easily read as banning teaching the idea that many Americans have racist attitudes. But understanding that many Americans have racist attitudes is central to understandingUS politics.For example,the Republican Southern Strategyinvolved exploiting racist attitudes against government programs they ideologically opposed, by using the term “welfare” as a dog whistle for these attitudes. We have strong evidence from social science to explain the mechanisms here. There isa large group of white Americanswho agree with racist stereotypes. Among these Americans, calling a program “welfare” decreases its support dramatically.The letter also appeals to another racist dogwhistle, “DEI”, which is employed in a similar way to justify banning classroom discussion of a range of concepts (including, it appears, discussion of the use of dog whistles in American politics).The guidelines are easily read as banning teaching the idea that many Americans have racist attitudesBy executive order,Donald Trumpis trying to dismantle the Department of Education. Following Project 2025’s recommendation, he appears also to be seeking to eliminate funding for Title 1, which provides crucial federal support for students in under-resourced schools in urban and rural areas, special education for disabled students and a range of other educational programs. The abolition of the education department would mean no federal oversight of drastically widening educational inequalities facing millions of students (and threatens to undermine tracking of data on racial disparities in educational resources, which could be used to substantiate the official state ideology that there are no structural disparities).Linda McMahon, the new education secretary,issued a statemententitled “Our Department’s Final Mission” on 3 March. In it, she wrote about the motivation for this final mission:After President Trump’s inauguration last month, he steadily signed a slate of executive orders to keep his promises: combatting critical race theory, DEI, gender ideology, discrimination in admissions, promoting school choice for every child, and restoring patriotic education and civics. He has also been focused on eliminating waste, red tape, and harmful programs in the federal government. The Department of Education’s role in this new era of accountability is to restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington.From now on, the education department’s main function appears to be targeting “critical race theory”, DEI and “gender ideology”. The final mission of the education department also includes the imposition of “patriotic education”, as if the United States were trying to imitate North Korea.Since McMahon’s announcement, the education department has launched a broad investigation into “antisemitism” at the nation’s colleges and universities. The first target was Columbia University, whose student body is over 20% Jewish; as well aspressuring Columbiato fire a distinguished law professor for pro-Palestinian statements andarresting one of the university’s studentsfor constitutionally protected speech, on 7 March, the education departmentcut $400m dollars in funding for Columbiafor allowing “harassment of Jewish students”. On 10 March, the civil rights office of the education departmentannouncedit was sending letters warning of potential enforcement actions to 60 universities under investigation for antisemitic discrimination and harassment, who will presumably face similar jaw-dropping cuts, under the guise of protecting Jewish students and faculty.Universities are among the most Jewish institutions in American life, in fact and in their resonance. As the historian Tim Snyder drylynoted:History teaches clear lessons about breakdowns in the rule of law and about campaigns against cities and universities. These are very often associated with antisemitism. It is very hard, for me at least, to think of historical examples of campaigns against universities and freedom of expression that were intended to benefit Jews.As the US watchesvideosof the regime’s police handcuffing and arresting student protesters in front of their families, as well as the destruction of the world’s greatest system of higher education, all supposedly in the service of “protecting” Jewish Americans, it is past time to note: this can’t be good for the Jews.As I have long warned, the media have been useful dupes for fascism. After years and years ofvilifyingacademia, first byraisinghysteriaabout “wokeness” andtoolittlefree speech(about eg race), and then by raising hysteria abouttoomuchfree speech (about Israel), the mainstream media has smoothly paved the path for educational authoritarianism. No one should be surprised by its arrival.Jason Stanley is Jacob Urowsky professor of philosophy at Yale University.

We’re citizens too: we all want improvementMon 17 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 12.57 EDTShareVery uncertain times for the nation’s civil servants. Last week, we werepublicly fat-shamedby the prime minister ahead of hislandmark speechat healthcare company Reckitt Benckiser’scampus in Kingston upon Hull. No, I’d never heard of it either, but it turns out to be a UK manufacturer of a number of brands responsible for just about holding austerity Britain together: Durex, Nurofen and Dettol.The thrusting symbolism of this choice of venue takes some beating. After all, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden – employing the regretful tones of an obstetrics consultant who’s seen it all – had on 9 March foreshadowed Keir Starmer’sfree-verse soliloquyby explaining how the civil servicewould be shaftedto get “more bang for our buck”.This cleared the way for state sex therapist Starmer to explain to acreepily enthusiasticHull audience exactly why we should all lie back and just let “project chainsaw” do its thing. Don’t worry, madam, with some painkillers and a bit of disinfectant, this won’t take long. Just askNHS England.If you think I’m overdoing the symbolism, you’re probably right. But this is, increasingly, the world we now live in, and when it comes to establishing his own personal brand, Starmer seems to be, at least at first glance, a master of metaphor. From theditching of his tiein the run-up to last year’s election, to thelocation of his first speechas PM, to thechoreographed theatricalityof his recent meeting with Trump, it should be no surprise that Starmer’s current vision for the British state is a reflection of how he sees himself. Check out his interview with theNews Agents podcastlast week, where he said: “I believe in the state. I think it should be active. I think it should be sleeves rolled up. It should be on the pitch, making a difference.”L’État, c’est moi.Problem is, this approach to communicating about this stuff is so last season. Most civil servants with a front-row seat at the recent jamboree of political messaging don’t disagree with the principles being proposed by Starmer, McFadden and Wes “I don’t feel the need to come inand make my mark with a top-down reorganisation of the NHS” Streeting. Why would we? As civil service union boss Dave Penman wrote in his gentle butnot entirely undeserved slapdownof my piece aboutStarmer’s aid cutsthe other week, it’s not really for civil servants to publicly question ministerial policy.Memo to Keir Starmer and co: we are civil servants – not the enemy | The civil servantRead moreBut in this case, it isn’t the message. It’s the delivery. Starmer has fallen into a bad habit of attempting to channel the Orange One when trying to get things done, from “build, baby, build” to the unedifying spectacle of his going full Doge on the civil service. That approach might work across the Atlantic, but as my civil service godfather Penman haspointed out, “scapegoating civil servants might generate headlines, but it’s not a strategy for effective reform”.Starmer, to his credit, seems to be coming to this realisation already, afterbeing warnedby former cabinet secretary Gus O’Donnell and the Institute for Government that an adversarial approach will probably spell disaster. Even the most gimlet-eyed civil servants among us shed a tear overhis beautiful letter to uson 10 March that gushed: “Your talent has been constrained for too long … we are proud of what you do and thank you for your continued dedication.”Very touching, but having seen first-hand every leader since Tony Blair have a go at overhauling the machinery of government, my hope is that this is a lesson Starmer won’t have to keep relearning. Because when it comes to civil service reform, what goes around, comes around.That’s because, simply, it’sbloody hard work. Maybe the hardest thing of all in public service. In fact, despite Starmer’s reforming zeal, in its short time in office, his own government has been unable to resist the temptation to create quangos and arm’s-length bodies –more than 20 of themhave been created since Labour came to power, including, perhaps ironically, Rachel Reeves’Office for Value for Money.Politicians also sometimes choose to forget that reform is already happening: the civil service is a very different animal than the one I first encountered in the early 2000s. It’s more diverse (though not yetdiverse enough), it’s far more decentralised (most UK civil servants work outside London), and it already spends£26bn a yearon digital technology and employs more than 100,000 digital and data professionals. Yes, every day, HMRC still takes 100,000 calls, and the Department for Work and Pensions still opens 45,000 envelopes, but don’t fall for the rightwing trope that we’re flabby, tepid, recalcitrant losersintent on destroying democracy.Above all, the prime minister needs to remember that civil servants are up for reforming the state. Not only do we have to work inside it, we, too, are trying to get that appointment with a GP. We know what it’s like to bein receiptof the very benefits we administrate. And we, too, feel deepfrustration with the bureaucracyand – as I wrote at the end of last year –want to work with the PMto improve how public services are delivered. While the prime minister’s language has beenhurting civil service moralefor quite some time now, we aren’t afraid of getting our hands dirty to make change happen.

Imagine that at least2 million peoplein England and Scotland alone were affected to some degree, each with a mix of debilitating symptoms, from breathlessness to brain fog to multi-organ damage.Then imagine that there were no proven treatments for this life-changing illness, let alone a cure. In fact, patients areoften toldit’sall in their heads. Now imagine that more people are falling ill every day with the virus that causes this devastating disability – and that successive governments have abandoned almost every strategy to try to get to grips with it.There is no need to conjure up such a nightmare, of course – it is already real.Five yearsafter the first coronavirus lockdown, long Covid is in many ways the pandemic’s shadow. While the era of news banners flashing up weekly death tolls on our phones is thankfully a distant memory, vast swathes of people are still living with chronic symptoms years after they were first infected with the virus.And yet you’d be forgiven for thinking long Covid was old news, a relic of the pandemic past alongside banana bread and clapping for theNHS. When was the last time you heard a politician utter the words “long Covid”? Or saw calls for research or support for sufferers make the front pages? In 2025, long Covid is the public health crisis no one wants to talk about, taking a wrecking ball to people’s lives, the economy and the health service while those with power pretend there’s nothing to see here.Take treatment. Back in 2020, Boris Johnson’s governmentpromised, to much fanfare, that long Covid patients would receive specialist help at clinics, supported by an additional £10m in local NHS funding. Five years on, there are now more than90 adult post-Covid servicesacross England to provide diagnosis and rehabilitation for those with long-term symptoms. Butdata showsonly a “fraction” of people with long Covid have actually received help, with a third of them waiting more than three months to be assessed after a GP referral. Recent months have seen long Covid clinics across the countryclose their doors; NHS Cheshire and Merseyside is the latest to be under threat,with reportsit is “no longer financially viable”. It’s no wonder some patients are turning tocostly and unproven remedies. When the NHS isn’t helping, desperate people drain their life savings togo abroad for “blood washing”.Or consider access to disability benefits. A study in theLancet in 2021found that 22% of respondents with long Covid were too sick to be in employment, and 45% were on reduced hours. And yet, read news coverage of the growing number of people off work due to long-term illness and you’re lucky to even see a mention of coronavirus – just a cruel complaint about the “soaring welfare bill” and plans to further cut disability benefits.‘We’re losing decades of our life to this illness’: long Covid patients on the fear of being forgottenRead moreIt’s not like people with long Covid who have kept their jobs are treated any better by the benefits system. In 2023, just 5,224 personal independence payment claimants (paid to those in or out of work)listed long Covidas their main disabling condition – a minuscule amount compared with how many have the condition. That doctors and nurses who developed long Covid saving our lives during lockdown are nowreportedlybeing denied disability benefitsgives an insight into how much the state can be trusted to be there in our time of need. Calls for acompensation schemefor key workers with long Covid, you may not be surprised to hear, have alsorepeatedly been ignored.Even children are being left to suffer alone. In 2024, more than 110,000 minors aged three to 17 in England and Scotlandwere estimated to have long Covid, with more than 20,000 of them severely affected. At a time in their lives when they should be running around the playground, these children can barely make it out of bed. Not that you ever hear about coronavirus in the school absence debate. Instead, parents of children with long Covid are threatened with beingtaken to court for truancy.The human cost of all this is palpable, of course, but there is a financial toll for the country too. One study estimated long Covidcost the UK economyat least £5.7bn in lost productivity from 2022 to 2023, while some economists calculate that theannual healthcare billfrom the disease could be as much as £4.2bn by 2030.Against this backdrop, you would think ministers would want to curb the spread of coronavirus. After all, the best – and probably, cheapest – way to tackle long Covid is to not catch the virus in the first place. But in 2022, the last official Covid protections were removed, including theend of most free testing. By 2024, thevaccine was severely restrictedto only a tiny proportion of the public. That’s despite the fact studies show that if a person has been fully vaccinated and is up to date with their boosters, theirrisk of long Covid is much lower. This decision has had two major consequences: it has become normalised for the public to be repeatedly infected with Covid and, as such, to increasingly be put in danger oflong-term health complications.When the pandemic rules were lifted, many spoke excitedly of a “return to normal”. The millions of people with long Covid have not had that privilege. While the fortunate recover with time, the worst affected are stuck in their own perpetual lockdown: too sick to go to the pub with a mate or sit in the office for a career they had to quit. As you read this column, more people will be falling ill with an exhaustion and pain that won’t go away. If the dice lands wrong and it is you or someone you love next, you will hope – at the very least – there will be help on the way. That long Covid sufferers know there won’t is not simply the pandemic’s dark shadow, but its mark of shame.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

That it has chosen to declare itself the “party of work” rather than the “party of workers” is not, on the face of it, a significant semantic shift. But in politics, words matter. And this subtle rebranding effort says a lot – perhaps more than Labour intended – about where the party now stands in relation to class, social justice and its historical roots.Labour was never merely a party that supported people in work. It was a party of workers – an important distinction. It was not just about wage labour as an abstract good but about those who perform it, theirdignity, security and place in society. To be a party of workers was to recognise the structures that exploit them and seek redress. It is a position tied to broader ideals of equality, family life and community identity.To be the party of work, on the other hand, is to endorse a different worldview: one where economic productivity is an end in itself, where a person’s worth is measured by their output, where those who cannot work – through disability, ill health or old age – are considered burdens rather than individuals with rights. This is the logic in which Labour now finds itselfentangled, justifying benefit cuts as fiscal discipline and balancing the books on the backs of sick and disabled people.This shift signals economic responsibility to business elites, justifies spending cuts asmoral imperativesand reassures traditional supporters that the party still values “hard work” – but in a way that rewards business more than workers. It is a rebrand that offers a palatable message to those who own the means of production rather than those who work under them.This new self-definition conveniently excludes many who once relied on Labour. The party leadership argues that it is reforming the state to broaden its appeal. If this alienates the base, it may backfire – Labour won more thansix in seven constituenciesin Britain’s poorest half. The Tories, meanwhile, have lostgroundin more middle‑class areas, especially after Brexit, but that shift hasn’t been fully captured by either Labour or the Liberal Democrats.Labour’stransformationcan be seen as a quiet coup by the professional-managerial class who prize economic orthodoxy over radical redistribution. After all, they too are “working people” – albeit in the sense that corporate lawyers, tax auditors and City analysts are also workers. Rebadging itself as for “working people” allows Labour to prioritise a managerial elite while purporting to maintain class solidarity.This shift echoes Thomas Piketty’sanalysisof western democracy coalescing around a “brahmin left” and a “merchant right”, where both factions compete for the votes of a modernworking class– restaurant staff, drivers and cleaners – whom they neither represent nor truly serve. Labour’s embrace of “work” rather than “workers” is a tacit admission of this: it has become a party that chases middle-class respectability while assuming that working-class voters will fall in line. The irony is that, in making this pivot, Labour risks alienating the people who once formed its bedrock. For all its efforts to appear fiscally responsible and electable, it may find that a party of work, rather than workers, is one that inspires very little passion at all.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But his achievements will need to be safeguarded in an inevitable power struggle to comeMon 17 Mar 2025 14.25 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 14.49 EDTShareThe release on Sunday of the firstphotographof Pope Francis since his admission to the Gemelli hospital in Rome was an uplifting moment for the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics. In a messagepublishedby the Vatican, he said that he continued to feel “fragile” and was “facing a period of trial”. But after battling pneumonia in both lungs for more than a month, he is now off the critical list.How long the 88-year-old pontiff is able to carry on in St Peter’s chair, though, is another matter. Rumours have inevitably swirled regarding a possible resignation – following theprecedentset by his predecessor, Benedict XVI. Though he has overcome multiple health issues to pursue an active and dynamic papacy, a prolonged period of illness may lead him to contemplate stepping down if he can no longer carry out a pastoral role effectively.Progressives both inside and outside the church must hope that he is able to continue for a good while yet. The pope’s enforced absence from the world stage has served as a reminder of his importance, as universal values are repudiated and cast aside in the name of a narrow and aggressive national self-interest.The weaponisation of Christianity as a means of cultural exclusion, and as a justification for illiberal policymaking, has been a key feature of this shift in the zeitgeist. The latest egregious example is JD Vance, the US vice-president andCatholic convert, who on Sunday reportedlyattended massin Washington with the visiting British foreign secretary, David Lammy.In February, Mr Vancedefendedthe Trump administration’s mass deportations and savage cuts to international aid by recasting the Catholic idea of ordo amoris, or the right ordering of one’s love, as a justification for nativism. Just prior to falling ill, the pope sent an extraordinary and excoriatingresponseto US bishops. Citing the parable of the good samaritan, he described the “true” ordo amoris as the love that “builds a fraternity open to all, without exception”. Focusing solely on family, community or national identity, he added, “introduces an ideological criterion that distorts social life and imposes the will of the strongest”.It is something of a paradox that the head of the Catholic church – a deeply hierarchical institution that the pope has striven to reform – has become one of the west’s most combative defenders of liberal democratic values. But in relation to migration, theclimate emergencyand the rise of the oppressive form of rightwing communitarianism espoused by Mr Vance, Francis has been an influential and often lonely progressive voice.As that witness nears its end – although hopefully not imminently – the pope has wisely been making moves to protect his legacy. The likelihood of a traditionalist counter-revolution has been diminished by the energetic creation of new “cardinal electors” – almost three-quarters of the cardinals who will vote in the next conclave were his choices. Last month heappointedan Italian nun as the first female governor of Vatican City, and there have been other moves to safeguard the modernising spirit of his papacy.An eventualpower struggleis inevitable, in which Mr Vance and Washington’s other high-profile Maga Catholic, Steve Bannon, may try to bring a Trumpian influence to bear. For now though, it is good to see the vice-president’s arch-antagonist in the Vatican apparently on the mend. Hisadvocacyon behalf of “the global common good” has never been more relevant.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus a letter on the iniquities of leaseholdMon 17 Mar 2025 13.12 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 13.15 EDTShareThe rationale for the planning and infrastructure bill is that planning is the main reason for the tardy rate of housebuilding (The Guardian view on the planning bill: new towns must be for people who need them, 11 March). Removing red tape, it is supposed, will facilitate the market speeding up housebuilding. In reality there are more than1m plots of landthat have planning permission and have not been built on. That’s because housebuilding is dominated by large-volume builders that build at a pace and scale to maximise profits and shareholder dividends.The solution to what’s called the “housing affordability crisis” does not lie in the market. It lies with making social-rent council housing the priority, as the Attlee government did. Angela Rayner cannot deliver a “council housing revolution” without funding it. Instead, Labour has maintained the Tory definition of affordable housing that includes fundingaffordable rent, shared ownership and affordable private rent.None of these tenures should be funded by the government. Funding should only go to social-rent homes. It will save money on the benefit bill and is most affordable to tenants.As we approach the 80th anniversary of Attlee’s government, we should remind ourselves that, in far worse economic conditions, Aneurin Bevan managed to persuade the then chancellor Hugh Dalton to triple funding for building council housing. To facilitate it, he followed a policy of cheap money (low interest rates). Councils got grants for 60 years and were able to borrow from the Public Works Loan Board to pay the costs of building.The funding of grants for building/acquisitions on the scale of 100,000 a year can be found, if it is a political priority, by returning to a progressive taxation system, taxing wealth and ending corporate welfare.Martin WicksSecretary,LabourCampaign for Council HousingThe success of planning reforms will hinge on creating sustainable communities. In the government’s rush to build houses, we can’t forget that what we actually need is homes for people – and people need to be part of a community. Schools, healthcare and essential retail are often left out of the conversation or abandoned to the whims of the market, but this social infrastructure is vital, as are energy, transportation and water. With more than 1m empty homes in England and the significant carbon impact of construction, the focus should be on incentivising retrofitting of empty homes and upgrading existing infrastructure – especially when it is already at the heart of a community.We must address the housing crisis, and home building could unlock economic growth. But our lodestar must be growth that is sustainable.Rebecca Dillon-RobinsonPrincipal urban planner, RambollI read your editorial and was amused by the thought that “protection of nature” should be an essential part of proposals. The Labour-controlled council in Lincoln has begun a development (with a local building company) of 3,200 homes, plus necessary infrastructure. The first part of the project was to create a new road and 52 houses. In doing so, eight magnificent oaks were felled (at least one ancient) – all with tree preservation orders. Dozens of other trees were destroyed and hundreds of naturalised bulbs dug up. I walk past the site daily and am still mortified 18 months later. I have resigned from Labour in protest.Pip SandersLincolnAs a leaseholder myself, I strongly agree with Harry Scoffin (A two-tier housing market will be the result of Labour’s half-baked leasehold reform plans, 13 March) that this medieval system needs to be abolished once and for all – not just for new and future homes but for all the millions of homes currently trapped in it. The whole concept of leaseholding is, when looked at objectively, a grotesque financial con trick: how can it be said that I and my wife are “homeowners” when a few decades down the line the leasehold runs out and presumably we will be dispossessed of our legally purchased property?

As Alexander Masters says, failure to move new medicines to commercial, and therefore clinical, use results in vast wastage of research resources and loss of valuable treatments because most never leave the lab. This also applies to implantable medical devices, which are in common use today.New devices, particularly those that can significantly reduce complications such as infection, are potentially available, but, as with new drugs, often stay in the lab for want of commercial support to the next stages. Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) are often thought of as the “gold standard” next step, but many new drugs and devices fail at this stage. Those that pass the RCT, which as Masters says are not representative because of numerous restrictions on those taking part, can also fail when released into “real life” assessment on the general population. But these stages are essential to show safety and effectiveness.Another big cliff at the other side of the “valley of death” is regulatory approval that, though essential, is out of date, too costly and not suited to modern innovations – another reason for the failure of new drugs and devices to advance to clinical application.Roger BaystonProf emeritus of surgical infection,University of NottinghamHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Both things can be trueMon 17 Mar 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 19.21 EDTShareWell, that’s the nice bit done. Warm feelings, heritage bonds, a cocoon of distracting noise. Wembley is such a different place on these domestic cup days, certainly compared with the Cliff Richard concert vibe of a midweek international.And that feeling was there right from the start of the Carabao Cup final on Sunday as Newcastle were awarded their first corner, drawing the most extraordinary outburst of noise, static, shared energy from one end to the other, filling all that empty Wembley air.‘So proud’: Newcastle fans reflect on historic cup win after 70 years of hurtRead moreThere is no other human activity where this happens in the same way, an unchoreographed mass human theatre. But this is also power, and power is more than ever open to being used. So the nice bit is done. And maybe it is time now to look at this with a little more clarity.Two things can be true simultaneously.Newcastle United winning a first major domestic trophyin 70 years is a euphoric feelgood story for the fans. This is true. That same trophy is also a first significant victory for the Saudi Arabian regime harnessing all this untamed human feeling to wash the blood and cruelty from its hands. This is also true.Does it still feel OK? Is there an aftertaste? Perhaps something very slightly acid? This would be only human. That extraordinary outpouring around Wembley is also, like it or not, a piece of targeted public theatre, the good intertwined with the bad, that thing you love being piggybacked by dictator state ambition, a kind of BurnSaw/BoneSaw dynamic in action.It is important to recognise none of this is the fault of Newcastle’s supporters. The entire process is an act of macro-violence towards sport, clubs, leagues and fans, one in which the football authorities and UK government are complicit.When Tracey Crouch MP told a parliamentary committee that Newcastle’s owners were “a fund” and nothing more, she was making a misleading statement. A few months later the Saudi wealth fund would assert exactly the opposite in a US court, that the Saudi Private Investment Fund is a government arm, all the better to avoid the discovery process. Naturally Yasir al-Rumayyan, governor of the PIF and lieutenant to the crown prince, was present at Wembley to oversee victory on Sunday.And there are two points worth making now the fizz has subsided. The first is to accept the obvious truth, that football is being used to wash the blood from a hardline regime, treating its supporters like useful idiots in an economic and public relations war; and from there to acknowledge that we don’t actually have to acquiesce in this process.The effects are at least clearer now. One thing Wembley revealed is how thoroughly this has been normalised, to the extent apathy and acceptance can seem like the only options. There is an inescapable puzzle here. To celebrate unconditionally the triumphs of a state-owned propaganda team is to make yourself a conduit for state propaganda, emotions fully hijacked. To refuse to celebrate, to walk away and cede the ground, is to allow that propaganda state to take from you something vital and human, to say: yes, propaganda state, you have effectively won. Sport now belongs to you.Faced with this the easiest response is simply to retreat into cognitive dissonance, to give in to whatever line you’ve been fed. Not long ago Dan Burn said Newcastle’s players are motivated by a sense of outsiderdom. “In our pre-match huddles we’ve said: ‘It’s us against the world.’”This is such an absurd idea it deserves to be considered properly. The notion that a sporting arm of the world’s most persuasive carbon-bribery state, chief producer of economic crack cocaine, can consider itself outsiders, little guys, underdogs is so laughable it feels like it must have its roots in some kind of top‑down messaging. Only billionaire‑level entitlement, seeping through the ecosystem, could suggest this. It is just so much easier, after all, to agree with the people throwing the money around.Again, it is vital to restate the facts, and to be completely clear at this point who you’re embracing in that crowd. The list of human rights issues in Saudi is familiar. A booming execution rate. Dissolution of the rule of law. Accusations of arbitrary detention and torture. Migrant workers treated like human collateral damage. Prison terms for social media posts. Meanwhile, last week in New York there was outrage at the appointment of Saudi Arabia as chair of UN’s chief commission on women’s rights, described by Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, as “like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank”.What about modernism and reform and reaching out? These are certainly words, and sport is clearly key in giving the impression they might actually be real things, too. Football is the chief conduit for this. A trophy,warm feelings about Burn, blanket unquestioning coverage will naturally make this process more impactful and more obviously value for money. It represents an opportunity, too. This is not the moment to slide further into apathy, but a moment to question more thoroughly the means.The second point about Newcastle’s victory is what it says about regulation. Which is that regulation is good. The profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) may need some tinkering. But Newcastle winning a cup is the best argument the rules are working, the same rules some would see as unfair or geared solely towards holding back the oppressed billionaires of the sporting world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s there to stop you becoming a version of Chelsea or insanity-era Paris Saint-Germain. PSR are prompting Newcastle’s owners to push through plans for a new ground. Regulation helped Newcastle to build the current settled, well coached, high-functioning team. How much better to win a trophy by astute recruitment and improving players, as Eddie Howe has done.It is hardly a corset, either. Eight of the starting team at Wembley were bought in the Saudi era. Joelinton has been repurposed out of necessity into a seriously useful force in the central-shithousery role. Even Burn, the good news magnet on Sunday, might have been levered out by now if money were no object. Regulation helps to produce a robust league. Far from undermining international “competitiveness”, it may just save English football from the worst of itself.Again, football supporters are essentially bystanders in this, victims of the process, forced to make a series of impossible choices. The same cannot be said of those whose role involves reporting it, and who have a responsibility to do something other than jumping on the bus.Blindly cheerleading journalism is undoubtedly a route to popularity, clicks, affirmation. But it also represents complicity in the process. Perhaps the hoisting of a trophy will give some space for more measured analysis. It was notable on Sunday afternoon that Sky Sports made no mention of the issues around the Saudi ownership of Newcastle, and by implication of the way its broadcast was being piggybacked by a PR project.This is perhaps both a commercial and an editorial decision. Not just, do our viewers really want to hear this today, but also: do we really want to make an enemy of the sport’s great gushing money tap? Who knows, the current broadcast rights holders may feel the need to shift this position before long.Dazn, the loss-making streaming platform, is now part Saudi-owned, which means essentially limitless in its financial reach, which means Dazn may just be coming for your content before long. Either way the lesson remains the same. Take the warm feelings and the spectacle. But there has never been a greater need to enter this world disabused of all illusions, eyes wide open, and above all prepared to tell the truth.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedSaudi Arabia and sportcommentShareReuse this content"

United’s chief executive, Omar Berrada, said the increase in cost was “fair and reasonable”, ­arguing it was necessary while the club faces “financial issues”.Berrada said: “We understand that any price rise is unwelcome, especially during a period of underperformance on the pitch, and we listened carefully to the strong arguments put forward by the FAB [fans’ advisory board] in favour of a freeze. However, the club has decided that it would not be right to keep prices unchanged while costs rise and the club continues to face financial issues.Rasmus Højlund ends goal drought as Manchester United cruise past LeicesterRead more“We appreciate the loyal and patient support of our fans, and particularly our season-ticket holders who represent the core of our match‑going support base. We understand the importance of their backing for the team and have worked hard to come up with a pricing package that is fair and reasonable.“We have kept the increase to the lowest possible level and protected our ­youngest season‑ticket ­holders from any rises, while ensuring the club remains financially strong enough to invest in improving the team.”Alongside increased ticket prices, United announced other new revenue-generating measures. They said they would convert the areas adjacent to the managers’ ­dugouts into ­hospitality seating. This decision, the club said, reflected “the high value of this unique location” and fans who hold season tickets there will be forced to move.United also said fans would be charged £10 if they used the club’s official resale service within 14 days of a game.The announcements are the latest step in United’s attempts to cut costs and raise revenue. Last week the minority co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe warned that the club “would have run out of cash at Christmas” had action not been taken. He also said that the club would become “the most profitable” in the world in three years.The rises conform with prices announced by some of United’s top-flight rivals. Newcastle are also to raise season-ticket costs by 5% and Arsenal’s are to go up by 3%-5%. Liverpool and Tottenham are among clubs who have frozen prices.The club’s fan advisory board said they “strongly advocated for an across-the-board price freeze for 2025-26 season, one we felt was justified due to the current circumstances. While we did not get the freeze we argued for, we are relieved that the club was persuaded to limit the increases to the same percentage rise as recent seasons, and we are pleased they froze prices for our youngest fans.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We call for a strict cap on the number of games that will be placed in the higher price categories … [and] we fail to see any justification for the increase in season-ticket holder minimum usage requirement.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

But there is a school of thought that separate areas of concentrated visiting fans would lead to greater noise.Premiership Rugby announced in October that it was considering a trial and it is understood a number of clubs have expressed an interest. Organisers are keen to stress that visiting supporters can still watch elsewhere in the stadiums and mix with home fans if they wish.The Premiership has a target of 82% attendances across the season and this campaign is operating at an average of 81%, which represents an increase on recent years. It would be on track if Leicester, traditionally the best supported club in England, were not experiencing a worrying drop‑off. League officials, however, believe that away sections could help to meet targets.“Away fans can and will sit amongst the main crowd, this is just giving people a choice,” a source said.“This is not meant to be adversarial. It’ll be done in the right spirit. It’ll be enough fans to make a noise. The players say they feed off it, and it gets more out of the home fans as it creates a back and forth.”The concept is a polarising one but is something Harlequins fans have been doing unofficially for years, most notably at Ashton Gate fortheir 43-36 Premiership semi-final victory against Bristol.The club’s flanker Will Evans has been a vocal supporter of the idea, saying: “Rugby stadiums need a ­designated away fan area that stays the same year on year. We can’t continue to hold the game back any longer. It’s bor­dering on arrogance that we think we’re the only sport where people can sit together and not be violent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The main question on everybody’s mind between now and the final in Lisbon on 24 May is: can anybody stop Barcelona?The defending champions are bidding to reach a fifth consecutive final and win the title for the third year in a row, but they did not complete the group stage with a perfect record – only Chelsea and Lyon did – and provided a rare glimpse of their mortality with an away defeat against Manchester City in October.Top women’s clubs to play in lucrative seven-a-side tournament in buildup to WCL finalRead moreWith that in mind, and in view of the relative strength of the teams in the last eight, the battle to reach Estádio José Alvalade has a wide-open feel to it, especially with both Chelsea and Lyon currently unbeaten in their domestic leagues. Throw into that mix the renewal of old rivalries, asWolfsburgmeetBarcelonain a repeat of the 2023 final, plus added elements for unpredictability after the appointment of Nick Cushing as Manchester City’s interim head coach, and it all adds to the recipe for four tantalisingly poised quarter-final ties.England is the first nation to have three clubs playing in the quarter‑finals of this competition in the same season, and at least one is guaranteed to progress, asManchester CityandChelseago head-to-head for Acts II and IV of their ongoing four-part drama. On Saturday they played the first of their four consecutive meetings across three competitions, when Chelsea were 2-1 winners to lift the English Women’s League Cup, and they also have a league meeting at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday sandwiched in between these two legs of their European quarter-final.Cushing, who led City to the semi-finals in back‑to‑back campaigns in 2016-17 and 2017‑18 in his previous spell in charge, has said his side’s display in their defeat on Saturday gave him belief that they can beat Sonia Bompastor’s team, who are yet to lose a game under her management. Both teams remain without long-term injury absentees, but City had a scare when their top scorer Khadija Shaw was substituted “feeling her hamstring”, while Chelsea’s big-money January signings, Naomi Girma and Keira Walsh, missed the game and are both doubts.Meanwhile, despite not having played a match since 2023 because of her anterior cruciate ligament injury, Sam Kerr was added to Chelsea’s Champions League squad for the knockout rounds, although it would be a surprise if she was deemed ready to feature.View image in fullscreenKerstin Casparij of Manchester City.Photograph: Barrington Coombs/Uefa/Getty ImagesArsenal, who are in the opposite half of the draw, will be hoping to join one of their WSL rivals in the semi-finals, but they do not face an easy task as they face aReal Madridside just seven points behind Barcelona at the top of the Spanish league. Real could field dangerous attacking-midfield weapons in the form of Linda Caicedo, Athenea del Castillo and the Scotland midfielder Caroline Weir, who played for Arsenal more than a decade ago as a teenager.Arsenal won the competition in 2007 while Real are yet to reach the semi-finals and the Madrid head coach, Alberto Toril, said on Monday: “I expect a close tie between two teams that are doing really well. My players will need to get to grips with the key moments of each leg. We have to take the game to where it suits us, starting with possession, being well positioned so as to not afford them too much space, stretching the game out and always being in it.”The winner of that Arsenal-Real tie will face eitherBayern Munichor the record eight-time championsLyonin the next round. Alexander Straus, Bayern’s head coach, hopes his team’s defensive record – conceding just 12 goals in 17 Frauen Bundesliga games this season – can get them over the line. “We have the best defensive record in the Bundesliga,” he said. “It is not going to be easy, they have very good individual players, [but] we will try to defend against them the best way we can and do what we believe will work.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The prospect of Augusta National morphing into Rory Land in mid-April has intensified. Rory McIlroy’s second Players Championship victory suggests that maybe, just maybe, he has timed his Masters run perfectly this time. Never before has he landed at the first major of the year with two victories already banked.McIlroy laid down a marker on the course here on Monday before immediately making a similar statement off it. “I feel like I’m a better player now than I ever have been,” he said.Tiger Woods biopic in the works with the Obamas set to produceRead moreThis was the playoff McIlroy dare not lose. It was one he never looked like losing. By the time JJ Spaun found water on the 17th – the second of three aggregate extra holes – this contest was over. And yet, McIlroy endured a sleepless night as he contemplated his joust with an opponent who had entered the Players Championhip ranked 57th in the world.“Standing over that tee shot on 16 this morning is the most nervous I’ve been in a long time,” McIlroy said. “So feeling like that and being able to hit the shots that I needed, while your stomach is sort of not feeling great and your legs are a little shaky and your heart rate is racing … To have to go through that, it’s nice to have that in recent memory for some of the tournaments coming up.”Georgia is already on McIlroy’s mind. Here, he became the first European to win multiple Players Championship titles.From that 16th tee, he battered a drive almost 340 yards down the fairway. It was his flighted nine-iron into the 17th that was the most impressive shot of the day, though. Technical excellence combined with maturity. Spaun had been deceived; he had noticed what club McIlroy chose and looked on in disbelief as his own ball overshot the green before landing in alligator-infested waters. McIlroy was three clear with one hole to play; the fat lady had cleared her throat.View image in fullscreenRunner-up JJ Spaun congratulates Rory McIlroy.Photograph: Chris O’Meara/APSo why the earlier anxiety? “Back in 2019 [whenhe won his first Players] I maybe didn’t appreciate how big this tournament was and how much it meant,” McIlroy said.“Every time we come back to this tournament, it gets bigger and better each and every year, from the course to the facilities for the players, to the facilities for the fans. I don’t want to put any sort of label on it but it is one of the biggest championships in the world. That was part of the reason.“I didn’t get it done last nightand I really wanted to. And as well I’m going out there and I’m expected to win. That brings pressure in some way. I felt like I handled those nerves really well.“People say pressure is a privilege and it really is. You want to feel like that on the course. That’s why I spend the time that I do practising and trying to master my craft, that you get yourself in those positions to see what you’re made of.”Scottie Scheffler is scratching around for form. Xander Schauffele is battling back from injury. The competitive status of Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau is unclear as they play on the LIV circuit.

He has onePGA Tourtitle to his name and a year ago was trying to halt a miserable run of missed cuts. There is a Masters berth for Spaun as Sawgrass consolation.“Every great athlete talks about being in the moment, having the opportunity to win and wanting the ball, to shoot the final shot, the final three or have the last pitch to win the World Series,” Spaun said. “Those guys want the ball. Even though I didn’t win, I want the ball.”This was, however, indisputably McIlroy’s day.

The odds-on Constitution Hill’s departure at the fifth drew the biggest gasp of the week from the stands, while State Man’s fall at the last with a second successive title within sight prompted the biggest groan. The regular failure of hot favourites including Jonbon, Ballyburn and, inthe Gold Cup, Galopin Des Champs,to justify their short odds led to a series of compelling tales of the unexpected. The 100-1 success of the fast-finishing Poniros, on his hurdling debut, in the Triumph was the biggest shock of the lot,the third winner at a three-figure price since 1954.The British challengeC-, and that’s perhaps a little generous. After going into the week with strong fancies for several championship events, the home team’s eight winners was the second-lowest in the four-day era. That did, admittedly, include three Grade One wins – a slight improvement on two in 2024 – and The New Lion looks a serious contender for championship honours next season while there is also some succour in the fact that Nicky Henderson’s Jango Baie took the Arkle in the enforced absence of his stable star, Sir Gino. But for the fourth year running, Ireland had the majority of runners – 249, 55%, versus 200 from British stables and three from France – and comfortably outperformed its representation, with 71% of the winners. Willie Mullins matched his record total of 10 winners at the meeting despite three odds-on defeats and a repeat of Ireland’s 23-winner haul in 2021 still feels a more likely prospect over the next few years than a Prestbury Cup success for the British.View image in fullscreenWillie Mullins (left) once more dominated the festival with Fact To File one of his 10 winners.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAThe startsSadly, aUis the only option here since so many failed to reach the minimum standard for a pass. Precisely why the combined might of the British and Irish weighing rooms found it so difficult to stick to the rules is hard to say – and the stewards failed to apportion any blame in almost every case – but the automatic standing starts that followed every failed attempt to get them away in the orderly fashion that works for almost every other jumps races all year seriously compromised the chances of several fancied runners. Maughreen, who whipped around at the start of the Mares’ Novice Hurdle, was the most obvious sufferer, but Jonbon, the odds-on favourite for Wednesday’s feature, was also on the back foot from the off after being slightly slow to stride. Significant numbers of punters will have endured the infuriating sense at some stage that they did not get a fair run for their money. The starts were much less of an issue on the final afternoon so perhaps the first three days were an aberration, but any repeat of similar problems at Aintree in three weeks’ time will suggest that sterner intervention from the official may be required.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowWetherby2.00 V Twelve 2.30 Bois Guillbert 3.00 Audacious Annie 3.35 Grand Albert 4.10 Wearapinkribbon 4.45 Ballynoe BoyExeter2.15 Devon Dude 2.45 J J Moon 3.17 Stoner’s Choice 3.52 Cooleenymore (nap) 4.27 Night Duty (nb) 5.02 Filanderer 5.35 KnockmoylanWolverhampton4.55 Victoria Harbour 5.25 Under Curfew 6.00 Aviano 6.30 Bold Suitor 7.00 Pessoa 7.30 Mariner 8.00 Rumba Bay 8.30 Harry The HagglerWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.AttendanceDfor deflating. People still turned out for Gold Cup day, but the failure of the track’s scheme offering a 20% discount on a ticket for Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday with a full-price purchase for any other card to generate any upturn over the first three days was disappointing, to say the least. The overall Tuesday-to-Thursday crowd is nowdown by 25% in three years. For many National Hunt fans, festival-going now seems to be one-day experience, with Gold Cup day seen as the only one worth the effort, expense and assorted travel-related indignities of being there. Attendance remains buoyant at other meetings earlier in the season, possibly as a result of some former festival-goers shifting their allegiance to the less frenetic days, so perhaps the discount offer could be extended to buying a ticket in November or December. While it makes sense to mine Cheltenham’s audience and database for extra festival ticket sales next year, it will be a thankless task without also focusing on their all-important sense of …Value For Money… which was perhaps aC+, or maybe aB-, for all that it is hard to assess objectively if you are in the privileged position of getting in for free. The significant jump in the crowd size for Friday’s Gold Cup, and the knock-on effects on the experience of being there, were impossible to miss. The queues for food and coffee were much longer and so were the scrums for buses and taxis before and after racing. The bars – according to second-hand reports – were all but impenetrable too. The flipside is thatracegoers on the first three daysenjoyed something much closer to the “premium” sporting experience Cheltenham would be hoping to supply. Relaxation of the rules on alcohol consumption in the enclosures seemed particularly welcome and we can only wonder how many thousands of hours have been wasted at previous festivals telling racegoers “you can’t bring your beer through here”. Business was seemingly much brisker in the betting ring, but a key element in overall attendance and customer experience is still the hyper-inflated cost of accommodation in the local area. That, to a large extent, is out of the track’s control.OverallThe festival has many strengths, its biggest afternoon retains huge popularity and significance and, on balance, it enjoyed a positive year, albeit with some very obvious areas of weakness that are in need of urgent improvement. With Guy Lavender, its new head, having taken over less than three months ago, this was always likely to be a transitional season. Next year will be the first real examination of whether his new regime is starting to achieve results.Explore more on these topicsCheltenham festival 2025Talking HorsesCheltenham festivalHorse racing tipsHorse racingCheltenhamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This was confirmed by aerial surveillance flights, and other assets have subsequently been deployed. Some nurdles have now also been identified on the shore.“Retrieval has started today. This is a developing situation and the transport secretary continues to be updated regularly.”Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust and Norfolk Wildlife Trust said they were very concerned about the pollution from the collision and said seabirds could die from choking or starvation if they ate the nurdles.Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust’s head of conservation, Tammy Smalley, said: “We’re very concerned about the nurdles and burnt material that is adrift at sea as well as being washed up along the Wash and the Norfolk coast following the tanker collision last week, and we will continue to support the authorities in their efforts to clean up the pollution.“At this time of the year there is also the risk that the birds return to their nests and feed the nurdles to their chicks. The plastic may also work its way up the food chain to larger marine mammals which feed on fish or smaller animals which have eaten nurdles.”Sophie Benbow, the director of marine at the conservation organisation Fauna & Flora, said plastic pellets were “one of the largest sources of microplastic pollution globally and pose a grave threat to nature and coastal communities”.She added: “It is extremely concerning that the North Sea ship collision has resulted in a mass plastic pellets spill. Once lost into the ocean, these tiny pieces of plastic are almost impossible to contain.”View image in fullscreenBurned clumps of plastic pellets on the shoreline at RSPB Titchwell Marsh in Norfolk.Photograph: RSPB/PAThe master of one of the vessels appeared in court at the weekendcharged with gross negligence manslaughter.Vladimir Motin, 59, a Russian national, was in charge of the Solong when it collided with the US-flagged tanker about 12 miles (19km) off the EastYorkshirecoast.The Crown Prosecution Service said a Filipino national, Mark Angelo Pernia, 38, was missing and presumed dead after the collision.On Saturday, Motin appeared at Hull magistrates court. He did not enter a plea and was remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey in London on 14 April.On Friday, O’Callaghan said both vessels were “stable” and salvors had boarded them to continue damage assessments.He added: “There are now only small periodic pockets of fire on the Solong, which are not causing undue concern. Specialist tugs with firefighting capability remain at both vessels’ locations.“Regular aerial surveillance flights continue to monitor the vessels and confirm that there continues to be no cause for concern from pollution from either the Stena Immaculate or from the Solong.”It was initially feared the Solong, a container ship with a Portuguese flag, was carrying the highly toxic chemical sodium cyanide, but its owner, the Hamburg-based maritime company Ernst Russ, said four containers that had previously held the substance were empty.Explore more on these topicsShipping industryYorkshireNorth of EnglandPlasticsPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

The first summit will take place in London later this year. China’s minister of ecology and environment, Huang Runqiu, is expected to attend.The dialogue “is an essential start to putting an end to what I call the previous strategy of negligence”, Miliband said. He said the new annual summit represented “a strategy of committed engagement”.The dialogue will allow ministers and officials to share experiences on issues such as energy market reform, carbon capture and storage, domestic climate goals and other issues related to the clean energy transition. It will be the first regular dialogue to be held at secretary of state level.Miliband stressed that “the world is way off track from where we need to be” before the Cop30 UN climate summit in Brazil in November. He said that in his first eight months as secretary of state, he had visited Brazil, India and China, showing that “Britain is back as a climate leader” on the world stage. The UK ishoping to shapea new global axis in favour of climate action along with China and developing countries, to counter Donald Trump’sabandonment of green policiesin the US.Asked about how Britain could show leadership on sensitive areas in China’s energy transition, such as human rights, Miliband declined to give details.Campaigners have highlighted that nearly half of the world’s solar-grade polysilicon, a crucial raw material for solar panels, comes from Xinjiang, a region of China where there are crediblereports of forced labourfor Uyghurs and other minorities via “surplus labour” programmes in which workers are transferred to work in other parts of the country. China says the labour initiatives are voluntary and aimed at tackling poverty.Miliband said: “The issue of forced labour is absolutely something I’ve raised and it is a concern in the UK … I raised it with my Chinese hosts.” He said China “will continue to play a really important role in solar production”.The government’s massive investments in the solar industry mean that China dominates about 80% of the total supply chain, with western leaders concerned about oversupply driving down prices.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Despite the country’s huge rise in clean energy production, Beijing remains committed to coal, and recently pledged “increase coal production and supply capacity” to ensure energy security.“We obviously want China and all countries indeed to move away from fossil fuels,” Miliband said. He said that he believed the Chinese side “sees renewables as the kind of driver of the system” and fossil fuels as the “underlying backup”.Explore more on these topicsEd MilibandClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsFossil fuelsChinanewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday, Tesco said it was increasing basic pay for shopworkers from £12.02 to at least £12.45 an hour by the end of this month and to £12.64 from the end of August – 5.2% in total. However, it is removing a 10% premium that some workers receive on Sunday shifts.Frederick Wild, a retail analyst at Jefferies, said it was clear that “market conditions are changing rapidly”, meaning the value of the listed grocers was likely to remain under pressure in the short term. “We would be more sceptical of any grocer found to be flat-footed in this changing environment,” he added.However, Wild said it was “far from clear whetherAsdahas the ability to commit to the scale of cuts outlined on Friday if volume growth does not improve measurably in the coming weeks and months”.Asda’snew chair, Allan Leighton, said on Friday he had “a pretty significant war chest” to tackle several years of weak trading at the Leeds-based supermarket, where sales have been falling despite inflation. Tesco, Sainsbury’s, M&S and others have exploited Asda’s weakness to win more shoppers.Asda has lost more than a percentage point of market share in the past year, according to the industry analysts Kantar, a figure that represents sales worth millions of pounds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Harry Purcell, 17, Tilly Seccombe, 16, and Frank Wormald, 16, fellow pupils at Chipping Campden School in Gloucestershire who were passengers in Spencer’s car, died as a result of their injuries.A woman and two young children, who were travelling in another car, were seriously injured and continue to receive treatment for their life-changing injuries.Insp Michael Huntley, from Warwickshire police, encouraged young people and their parents to consider the limitations of being a newly qualified driver. He added: “Drivers need to be aware of the devastating consequences that can occur if a car is driven carelessly.“Edward Spencer had only passed his test five weeks prior to the collision and his careless actions cost the lives of three young people travelling in his car. Driving requires judgment and care, even more so when you lack experience. As this tragic case shows, the consequences of careless driving can be devastating.“So many lives have been ruined by this terrible incident. I can’t begin to imagine the pain this has caused, and our thoughts remain with the individuals and families affected.”Spencer was granted bail and will be sentenced on 28 April.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their sister Chanel Williams said it was important to share the circumstances of their death because ketamine use was becoming more prevalent in the UK.She said the family “continue to be completely devastated” by the performer’s death, and were planning to work with substance abuse charities in an attempt to let more people know about the drug’s dangers.“Ketamine is an extremely dangerous drug that is becoming more and more prevalent in the UK,” Williams told the BBC. “If we can help raise awareness of the dangers of this drug and help people who may be dealing with ketamine addiction then something positive will come from this complete tragedy.”An inquest into the death is scheduled to take place in June. Cheshire police have said there are no suspicious circumstances. Simon Jones, Williams’s manager and friend, echoed the family’s sentiments by saying it was an important moment to talk about the causes of the performer’s death. “I hope by us releasing this information we can raise awareness about the dangers of ongoing ketamine usage and what it can do to your body,” he said.The family will work with the charity Adferiad. Their decision effectively continues Williams’s legacy of being open about substance abuse. During their time competing on series one of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK, Williams talked about how they had sought help for ketamine addiction.Ketamine is used as a horse tranquilliser but is licensed in the UK as an anaesthetic and for short-term pain relief. A version of ketamine has a licence for the treatment of depression. There has been a large increase in the use of the drug in the US.It is classified as a class B substance in the UK, but it emerged in January that ministers were seeking “expert advice”on reclassifying it as class Ain response to increasing use among young people. About 299,000 people reported use of the drug in 2023 in the UK. Elon Musk is among those tohave said he has taken the drug.According to the national drug treatment monitoring system, the number of under-18s in England entering treatment who described ketamine as one of their problem substances increased from 335 in 2020-21 to 917 by 2023-24.Williams received widespread tributes after their death was announced. The Dancing on Ice judge Oti Mabuse praised them for being a “phenomenal entertainer” and the Drag Race judge Michelle Visage said The Vivienne was “a beacon to so many”.Explore more on these topicsDrugsDragRuPaulnewsShareReuse this content"

Along with the 27 confirmed dead, four people remain missing, while two survived.Tipton said that up to 15 of those on board may still have been alive more than four hours after the dinghy capsized. On that day sunrise was at 7.26am. Distress calls from the stricken dinghy started to come in just after 1am and the last distress call was at 3.11am. It is estimated that the passengers went into the water at 3.12am or 3.13am.Tipton said he believed that at 3.24am the majority of people in the dinghy were still alive and that possibly by dawn, eight, 10 or 15 people were still alive. According to the coastguard log shown to the inquiry, a decision was taken to stand down the Border Force cutter boat Valiant just before 6am and it returned to shore at 7.03am with 98 passengers rescued from other dinghies but not from the dinghy where the mass drowning occurred.Initially there was confusion about whether or not the passengers on the stricken dinghy had been rescued because it was confused with another dinghy in a separate incident.One of the only two survivors, Issa Mohamed Omar, previously gave evidence to the inquiry. “I’m a voice for those people who passed away,” he said.He described the scenes of desperation on the dinghy with people making frantic phone calls for help right up to the moment the dinghy capsized.“It was very cold. People were screaming when we fell into the sea. We all thought we were dying.”Maria Thomas of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who represents 21 bereaved families and one survivor, said: “We heard today that although some may have succumbed to ‘cold water shock’ almost immediately upon entering the water, many onboard the small boat known as incident ‘Charlie’ were likely to still be alive many hours after the boat capsized.“It is therefore entirely possible, indeed likely, that had additional assets been deployed to continue the search for Charlie after Valiant returned to port at 07.03 to disembark the 98 people it had rescued, many more of the victims from that night may have been alive today.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our thoughts remain with everyone affected by this tragic event, including the loved ones and families of those who lost their lives.“We remain committed to supporting the inquiry and will give due consideration to any recommendations made. It would be inappropriate to comment further.”The inquiry continues.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumWater transportMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It said the decision to seek £220,000 from its disaster fund, which is earmarked for emergencies in the UK and overseas, was to buy items for 12,000 asylum seekers who were struggling to clothe themselves.Some of the people had contracted scabies and only had the infected garments they were standing in, according to evidence the charity has submitted to the House of Commons cross-party home affairs committee for its investigation into asylum accommodation.The Red Cross is one of 97 organisations and individuals who have provided written submissions to the investigation.Its first evidence session will be on Tuesday when David Bolt, the interim independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, and other experts will be questioned by MPs about findings from recent inspections, including the effectiveness of the government’s strategy in this area as well as the quality of services provided.Amid an increase in demand, spending on asylum accommodation and support has risen from £739m in 2019-20 to £4.7bn in 2023-24, with increased use of hotels during that period. At the end of 2024, 38,079 asylum seekers were accommodated in hotels.Two of the Home Office’s three accommodation providers – Clearsprings Ready Homes and Serco – have been exploring alternatives to expensive and controversial hotels including freehold purchases, compulsory purchase orders for unused or derelict properties, conversion of existing shops and office spaces, repurposing student accommodation and brownfield development.The decision by the Red Cross to access £220,000 from its disaster fund to provide basic clothing arose following scabies outbreaks in hotels after people were moved from Manston processing centre for small boat arrivals inKentat the end of 2022.The centrebecame seriously overcrowdedwith up to 4,000 people detained there for longer periods than the 24-hour specified time in facilities designed for a maximum of 1,600.Many people moved from Manston to hotels did not have a change of clothing and were only given £8.86 a week by the Home Office to buy basics. Public health officials were initially unable to contain the outbreak until alternative clothing was made available. The clothing was then distributed to many asylum seekers across the UK “driven by the scale of need and the imperative to prevent human suffering”, according to the Red Cross submission.Other concerns included: the cuckooing of rooms of vulnerable individuals in asylum accommodation (when rooms were taken over by perpetrators of trafficking and other exploitation); 600 age-disputed children forced to room share with unrelated adults; 240 children in one hotel unable to go to school because they could not afford the cost of school uniforms; and some children experiencing severe malnutrition as a result of being unable to eat hotel food.The charity Refugee Action also raised concerns about Home Office asylum accommodation. According to its submission: “What emerges is a picture in which brown and black people are being held for months and years in segregated spaces, cut off from communities in buildings that are called hotels but are in reality de facto detention.”A Home Office spokesperson said:“This government inherited an asylum system under unprecedented strain, with thousands stuck in a backlog without their claims processed, having to be housed in asylum accommodation at an unacceptably high cost to the taxpayer.“While many of the issues the Red Cross has raised occurred under the previous administration, we will continue to cooperate with the inquiry fully and investigate any allegations thoroughly, as we work to deliver an asylum system that operates swiftly, firmly and fairly.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumMigrationManston asylum centreKentnewsShareReuse this content"

The 25-year-old, who was deaf, raised awareness of hearing and mental health issues on her social media accounts, which gained more than 780,000 followers.On Monday, an inquest into her death in Horsham heard that Nunn was “failed” by services that were meant to help her, according to a statement by her mother, Louise Sutherland.The inquest was told that Nunn, who was called “Immy” by loved ones, had contacted her support worker at the deaf adult community team (DACT) at South West London and St George’s NHS trust on 23 November 2022, and told them she had “bought something online that she planned to take to end her life”.She also made reference to a “pro-choice suicide forum”, the court heard.In the statement read to the inquest, Thomas Beamont, representing Sutherland and Nunn’s father, Ray, said: “Ray and I believe that Immy felt hopeless and let down by the time of her death, and that she was failed.“Immy didn’t want to die, but she was exhausted from fighting desperately for the help she needed.”Sutherland told the court her daughter, who was born “profoundly deaf”, had mental health difficulties from age 14. In the years that followed, she made several attempts on her life, and was detained under the Mental Health Act in 2018.During her time in hospital, Nunn began sharing her experiences on social media posts.In a statement, Sutherland said: “She found success on TikTok where she established over 800,000 followers, a platform she used to share her experiences and struggles with mental health, and the challenges she faced as a deaf person.“In her TikTok videos, Immy would put a positive spin on her experiences. We thought it was a good outlet for her, helping her to build up her self-esteem which had almost completely depleted after missing out on so much of her teenage life.”On 15 September 2021, after spending nearly four years as an inpatient in Springfield hospital’s ward for deaf adults in south-west London, Nunn was discharged and started living in a flat in Brighton, with the support of community mental health teams.But the inquest was told by July 2022 her mental health began deteriorating again and she stopped engaging with mental health professionals. The court heard she bought lethal chemicals online on 14 November and received the parcel at home on 21 November.On 23 November, she contacted her allocated worker at DACT, explaining that she had suicidal thoughts. This prompted Sussex police to conduct a welfare check, but no British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter attended, and Nunn did not see mental health professionals “for at least several weeks afterwards”, the coroner heard.After spending Christmas with her parents, Nunn harmed herself on 29 December and went to A&E at Royal Sussex county hospital with a wound on her arm.The inquest heard she texted her care coordinator at Sussex Partnership NHS foundation trust, saying: “I’m simply having the worst few months and I think I need to be admitted to a ward with sign language. I cannot look after myself any more. I can easily go into the last resort and I don’t want to.”Despite this, Nunn was left alone in the emergency room and left before being seen by the hospital mental health team.On 30 December, Nunn told her psychologist that she “did not feel safe” and had “a plan to kill herself” by drinking poison. She told them that she did not possess any poison, and agreed to be admitted into a mental health crisis facility “to keep herself safe”, the inquest heard.But her care coordinator did not meet her that day as planned, and her admission never happened, the court was told.Separately Kenneth Law, a Canadian chef, is facing a murder trial in his home country for allegedly supplying poisonous chemicals to people around the world who have ended their lives.

In total, he was convicted of 97 offences. He will be sentenced on 7 April.The jury heard that Burrows systematically abused boys with whom he came into contact.Mark Connor KC, prosecuting, said: “He obtained positions of trust and responsibility which he breached to satisfy himself sexually with the youngsters.”Burrows had worked as a housemaster at a school for troubled teenagers inCheshirein the 1960s. He was later involved with the scouts and amateur radio clubs in the Midlands.During his trial, Burrows admitted being a paedophile but denied the more serious allegations, describing them as “degrading and disgusting”.DI Eleanor Atkinson, of Cheshire constabulary, said Burrows was a “prolific sex offender” who had shown no remorse for his actions.In one email found by police, the former scout leader wrote that he had spent three decades “living in paradise” while on the run in Thailand.He was eventually tracked down in 2023 by officers who used specialist facial recognition software to locate him in Chalong, Phuket.Detectives found that Burrows had been living under the name Peter Smith, a terminally ill acquaintance whose identity he had stolen in order to obtain a bogus passport and flee the country while on police bail in 1997.DI Atkinson said: “While his victims will never be able to forget what happened to them, I hope that the fact that Burrows has now been held accountable will finally provide them with some closure. Sadly, four of his victims have now passed away and so did not get to see justice served.”Samantha Thompson, a specialist prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service, described Burrows as a “an unrepentant paedophile” who used his position of trust to sexually abuse boys over three decades.She said: “His victims suffered horrendous abuse made worse by many of them not being able to tell anyone for fear that they would not be believed. This was borne out in some cases, where boys did speak up but were dismissed, and Burrows was able to move on.”Burrows, who previously lived in Birmingham, was asked by the prosecution why he had gone on the run and relocated to Thailand for several years.Giving evidence, he said this was because “the number of charges weren’t me – I hadn’t done them”, and that he had chosen Thailand because he could go sailing. He said he wanted to come home after 27 years because he had run out of money.Explore more on these topicsUK newsCrimeRape and sexual assaultCheshireWest MidlandsThailandChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

A record-breaking 53 white storks fledged from wild nests here in 2024, mostly in the tops of ancient oak trees. The birds line their huge nests with soft, fibrous dung from Knepp’s free-roaming ponies.View image in fullscreenWhite storks reach maturity at about three years old and can live for 20-40 years.Photograph: Knepp estateStorks are finding the rewilded former farmland of Knepp ideal habitat, with its insect- and earthworm-rich rough meadows and wetlands providing plenty of food. Pairs are also bonding at another site in Wadhurst, East Sussex, and are frequently seen flying across the region.The scheme to bring white storks back to Britain began in 2016, with theWhite Stork project, a collaboration between the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation, Cotswold Wildlife Park, the Knepp estate and Wadhurst Park. First, a group of birds were introduced from Warsaw zoo to Knepp. These drew in wild birds, and the first free-flying pairs hatched chicks in the wild in 2020.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Most of the cases relate toGB News, but others relate to TalkTV and LBC.The cases have been dropped after GB News successfully challenged two recent Ofcom rulings relating to the former Conservative cabinet ministerJacob Rees-Moggover reading updates about news stories.The high court ruled that he did not breach the rules because he was presenting a “current affairs” programme, rather than a news programme.Ofcomis now conducting a rapid review of those regulations to ensure that all programmes are covered by the same impartiality rules.The regulator said: “Ofcom will now review [the relevant rules] and consult on proposed changes to restrict politicians from presenting news in any type of programme. We aim to move as quickly as possible with the publication of this consultation so broadcasters should expect it later in the spring.”An Ofcom review of a similar incident involving the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, on GB News has now been cancelled, alongside five investigations into shows featuring the former Conservative minister Jake Berry, ex-MEP Alex Phillips and former deputy Reform UK leader David Bull on Talk, as well as Labour’s David Lammy onLBC.Ofcom had already withdrawn three other decisions against GB News in light of the high court’s findings, including over programmes presented by the Conservative MP Esther McVey and the former Tory MP Philip Davies. Broadcasting rules state that the news must be “presented with due impartiality”, and that politicians cannot act as newsreaders except when “editorially justified”.Angelos Frangopoulos, the chief executive of GB News, said that Ofcom’s decision to withdraw more cases was “another vindication of GB News editorial decision-making”.Nevertheless, Ofcom also said it was launching an investigation into the GB News programme Headliners, in which a presenter said that the “full inclusion of LGBTQ+ persons” at a church would “include paedos”. The presenter, Josh Howie, said the comments were part of a “comedy show”, in which “three comedians make jokes as we review the next day’s newspapers”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More than 20 of those wounded and three of those killed were under the age of 18, according to the interior ministry.View image in fullscreenMourners grieve during a protest following a fire at the Pulse nightclub that resulted in dozens of deaths in the town of Kočani.Photograph: Marko Đurica/ReutersOn Monday, as relatives queued outside hospitals to give DNA samples as part of the grim procedure of identifying the dead, bulldozers and workers could be seen digging graves in Kočani, a town of fewer than 30,000 residents 60 miles east of the capita, Skopje. Funerals are expected later this week, once autopsies have been conducted.“I will have no mercy,” the country’s prime minister, Hristijan Mickoski, said on Sunday. “There is no person in Macedonia who is not broken and with a destroyed spirit after this.”Mickoski said preliminary investigations had revealed that the entertainment venue was operating illegally with an invalid licence obtained from the country’s economy ministry “in exchange for a bribe”.A former mayor of Kočani, Ratko Dimitrovski, had refused to issue a permit for the nightclub because it failed to meet basic safety standards.The fire broke out at about 2.30am local time (0130 GMT) when sparks from pyrotechnic devices, described variously as fireworks and flares, set the roof ablaze. Many of the victims died in the ensuing crowd crush as panic-stricken people attempted to escape.View image in fullscreenSome demonstrators damaged an establishment that was said to belong to the owner of the nightclub.Photograph: Marko Đurica/ReutersBy Monday, the scale of the security violations were laid bare by the country’s state prosecutor, Ljupco Kocevski. The building, a former carpet warehouse, had no fire alarm system, only two fire extinguishers and a ceiling made of highly flammable material.“It did not have two exit doors, but only one single improvised metal door at the back of the building, which was locked and without a handle on the inside,” Kocevski said, listing the infractions. “There was no access for fire engines from either side in accordance with the fire safety regulations. The interior of the building was lined with plasterboard, but it was not fireproof.”Local media outlets described the former warehouse as an “improvised nightclub”.Among the 20 people detained in connection with the disaster is a former economy minister, Kreshnik Bekteshi, under whose watch the club’s licence is thought to have been issued; his top aide who allegedly signed the document, officials of various state agencies and the venue’s manager.“The detainees will be questioned since there are grounds for suspicion that there is bribery and corruption linked to the fire,” the interior minister, Pance Toskovski, told reporters. “The number of people inside the club was at least double its official capacity of 250.”View image in fullscreenThe Pulse nightclub was said to have multiple safety violations.Photograph: Georgi Licovski/EPAInitial reports suggested as many as 1,500 were at the venue when the blaze broke out. On Monday as authorities stepped up inspections of nightclubs across the country, Mickoski said he had been astounded to discover that licences for only 12 cabarets had been issued last year despite the number of such venues nationwide.“The situation on this issue is shocking,” he said, while visiting some of the wounded in the Mother Teresa hospital in Skopje.The rightwing-led government, in power since last year, has declared a seven-day period of national mourning in honour of the dead. Memorial rallies have also been held.Thousands of students gathered on Monday at Skopje University in a silent protest that they have vowed to repeat daily over the course of the next week. More rallies are expected on Tuesday after a civic group called for people to rally in city centres around North Macedonia to place further pressure on the government to stop the corruption that has now cost the 1.8-million strong nation so many young lives.Explore more on these topicsNorth MacedoniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Carney spoke in French and English, and said it was important forCanadato strengthen ties with “reliable allies”.“I want to ensure that France and the whole of Europe work enthusiastically with Canada, the most European of non-European countries, determined like you to maintain the most positive possible relations with the United States,” he said.View image in fullscreenCarney and Macron embrace at the Élysée Palace on Monday.Photograph: Maya Vidon-White/UPI/Rex/ShutterstockA senior Canadian government official who briefed reporters on Carney’s plane said the purpose of the trip was to strengthen partnerships with Canada’s two founding countries. The official said Canada was a “good friend of the United States but we all know what is going on”.Carney, who turned 60 on Sunday, travelled later on Monday to London where he was received at Buckingham Palace by King Charles, Canada’s head of state. After a 30-minute private conversation with the king, he was greeted warmly byKeir Starmeron the doorstep of No 10.The UK prime minister said: “The relationship between our two countries has always been strong. Two sovereign allies, so much in common – a shared history, shared values, shared king.”Carney said the relationship between the two countries was “built on shared values” and that “we’re at a point in history where the world is being reordered”.The trip to London is something of a homecoming for Carney as a former governor of the Bank of England, the first non-citizen to be named to the role in its more than 300 years.View image in fullscreenMark Carney and his wife, Diana Fox Carney, visit Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.Photograph: Sean Kilpatrick/ReutersThe former economist is deliberately making his first foreign trip to the capital cities of the two countries that shaped Canada’s early existence. At his swearing-in ceremony on Friday, he noted the country was built on the bedrock of three peoples: Indigenous, French and British.He said Canada was fundamentally different from the US and would “never, ever, in any way shape or form, be part of the United States”.Carney also noted the US, France, UK and Canada are members of Nato and it would be “unthinkable” for the US to annex Canada through military means.Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, said: “The Trump factor is the reason for the trip. The Trump factor towers over everything else Carney must deal with.”On his trip home from Europe, Carney will travel to the edge of Canada’s Arctic to “reaffirm Canada’s Arctic security and sovereignty” before returning to Ottawa, where he is expected to call an election within days.Carney said he did not plan to visit Washington at the moment but hoped to have a phone call with the president soon.He added that Trump must stop making “disrespectful” comments about Canada before the two countries can start serious talks about future ties.2:05New prime minister says Canada will 'never be part of the US' – videoSweeping tariffs of 25% and Trump’stalk of making Canada the 51st US statehave infuriated Canadians, and many are avoiding buying American goods. Carney’s government is reviewing the purchase of US-made F-35 fighter jets in light of Trump’s trade war.The governing Liberal party had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared economic war. Now the party and its new leader, Carney, could come out on top.Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, said Carney was wise not to visit Trump. “There’s no point in going to Washington,” Bothwell said. “As [the former prime minister Justin] Trudeau’s treatment shows, all that results in is a crude attempt by Trump to humiliate his guests.”Bothwell said Trump demanded respect, “but it’s often a one-way street, asking others to set aside their self-respect to bend to his will”.Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said it was absolutely essential Canada diversified amid the trade war with the US. More than 75% of Canada’s exports go to the US.Béland said Arctic sovereignty was also a key issue for Canada. He said: “President Trump’s aggressive talk about both Canada and Greenland and the apparent rapprochement between Russia, a strong Arctic power, and the United States under Trump have increased anxieties about our control over this remote yet highly strategic region.”A No 10 spokesperson said Starmer “underlined that the UK and Canada are the closest of sovereign allies and friends” during their meeting.Carney praised Starmer’s “leadership on Ukraine”, they added, and the two leaders agreed to work together “to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position to see a just and lasting peace”.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyAmericasKeir StarmerForeign policyDonald TrumpInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

He has been one of the biggest stars of the UFC, which was founded by the Trump ally Dana White.In November McGregor was ordered by an Irish civil court to pay nearly €250,000 (£210,000) in damages to a woman who said he “brutally raped and battered” her in a hotel in Dublin in 2018. McGregor claimed they had consensual sex and is appealing against the verdict with a hearing in Dublin’s high court due later this week.The fighter has said he is considering running for president in Ireland later this year, a prospect some thought would be ruled out after the civil trial verdict.He has been supported by figures including the self-styled misogynist influencerAndrew Tate and anti-immigration campaigners in Ireland whose reach has been turbocharged by Elon Musk retweets.Immigration is a hot topic in Ireland with many arrivals entering Northern Ireland on ferries or planes and crossing the invisible border on the island to enter the Republic of Ireland.The justice minister, Jim O’Callaghan, has promised to clamp down on those who are not entitled to international protection. Last month he said more than 80% of applications for asylum in January were rejected in the first instance.Explore more on these topicsConor McGregorIrelandUS politicsDonald TrumpEuropeUFCMMAnewsShareReuse this content"

Likewise, Ashley Biden who has 13 agents will be taken off the list,” Trump added.There was no immediate reaction from the former president’s office.Former presidents and their spouses receive lifelong Secret Service protection under federal law, but the protection afforded to their immediate families over the age of 16 ends when they leave office, though both Trump and Biden extended the details for their children for six months before leaving office.While touring the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Monday afternoon, a reporter asked Trump if he would revoke the protection for the former president’s son.“Well, we have done that with many. I would say if there are 18 withHunter Biden, that will be something I’ll look at this afternoon,” Trump said, who added this was the first time he heard about the matter.“I’m going to take a look at that,” he said.This wouldn’t be the first instance of Trump revoking security details, in January, herevoked the security detailsfor Mike Pompeo, Trump’s former secretary of state; Brian Hook, a former top aide; and John Bolton, his former national security adviser, within 72 hours of Trump’s second term beginning.Trump’s decision to remove their security details, which were believed to be provided by the state department, comes despite warnings from the Biden administration that both men faced ongoing threats from Iran due to actions they took following Trump’s orders during his first term as president.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it doesn’t come down to feasibility when it’s about human beings and bringing these people home,” Cambria Harris, Morgan’s daughter, said at the time. After meeting with former prime ministerJustin Trudeau, she was blunt: “I told him these women need to be found, and they need to come home.The province’s former Progressive Conservative premier Heather Stefanson nonetheless defended the decision not to search the landfill in 2023.“My heart goes out to the families. It’s a horrific situation that they’re facing right now, but I’m also the premier and we have to make what are difficult decisions,” she said. “These are decisions that need to be made, and I continue to stand by the decision that has been made.”She and others in her government said the search was too costly and too hazardous – a conclusion other experts rejected.At the time, Federal Crown-Indigenous Relations minister Marc Miller called the decision “heartless” and said a search was necessary.View image in fullscreenCamp Marcedes set up in front of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in downtown Winnipeg, Canada, on 27 September 2023.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesA search of the landfill became central to a provincial election in 2023, in which New Democratic party leader Wab Kinew campaigned on a search of the landfill.

She said the outlet’s funding had been discussed at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.‘The EU wants Ukraine to win this war’: who is its new chief diplomat Kaja Kallas?Read more“Now the question for us is, can we come in with our funding to fill the void that the US is leaving? The answer to that question is … not automatically,” she said adding that the EU would “see what we can do”.The Czech Republic is leading a push for the EU to support the Prague-based media group. Ahead of the meeting, the Czech foreign minister, Jan Lipavský, said he wanted to discuss with counterparts “how to at least partially maintain its broadcasting”.“If it shuts down, it cannot be easily rebuilt,” Lipavský said.The EU was already discussing how far it could fill gaps leftby the abrupt termination of much of USAid, which goes far beyond the media group.One senior diplomat has said the EU cannot make up the shortfall and that the bloc would be most likely to support projects that matched its own short-term interests.Founded in 1950, with broadcasts to Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania a year later, RFE aimed to bring unbiased local news to audiences behind the iron curtain. In 1953 Radio Liberty began broadcasting to the Soviet Union in Russian and other local languages.According to RFE/RL, it reaches 47m people every week in 27 languages in 23 countries, with more than 1,700 staff.Responding to the decision, Polish security expert Katarzyna Pisarska said her parents had learned about the Chornobyl nuclear disaster via RFE “while the Polish communist regime continued to hide the fact that a radioactive cloud was passing over Poland”. She described the US decision as “nothing more than a gift to dictators around the world” especially the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.RFE has beenclassed as “an undesirable organisation” in Russiasince last February, effectively banning the outlet.Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: “These media outlets … can hardly be classified as popular and in demand in the Russian Federation,” describing the decision to cut funding as an internal decision of the US.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Such is the nature of this state,” he added, referring to potential talks on war-torn Ukraine’s fate.Explore more on these topicsLithuaniaRussiaEuropePolandUkraineIkeanewsShareReuse this content"

Under Texas law, the illegal performance of an abortion is considered a second-degree felony. If convicted, Rojas could face decades in prison.Rojas’s arrest is believed to be the first criminal arrest under Texas’s abortion ban. Last year, Paxton’s officesued Dr Margaret Carpenter, a New York-based abortion provider, for allegedly mailing abortion pills to a Texan.“InTexas, life is sacred. I will always do everything in my power to protect the unborn, defend our state’s pro-life laws, and work to ensure that unlicensed individuals endangering the lives of women by performing illegal abortions are fully prosecuted,” Paxton said in a statement accompanying the news of Rojas’s arrest. “Texas law protecting life is clear, and we will hold those who violate it accountable.”In the years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, enabling Texas andmore than a dozen other statesto ban almost all abortions, anti-abortion activists have grown increasingly fed up with the lack of prosecutions of abortion providers. In Texas, advocates haveincreasingly encouraged menwhose partners have had abortions to strike back with legal action.Rojas, 48, operated a network of three clinics in theHoustonarea, according to Paxton’s office. These clinics, his office said, “unlawfully employed unlicensed individuals who falsely presented themselves as licensed medical professionals to provide medical treatment”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Holly Shearman, a midwife who runs a birthing center where Rojas sometimes worked,told the Texas Tribunethat she did not believe the allegations.“I’ve known her for eight years and I’ve never heard her talk about anything like that,” said Shearman, who said Rojas is a devout Catholic who often works with Spanish-speaking, low-income individuals. “I just can’t picture Maria being involved in something like this.”Midwives – in particular, midwives of color – have long been a target of US anti-abortion activism. As abortion bans spread across the country in the 19th century, midwives were often driven out of work or faced criminal consequences, which in turn led white, male doctors to siphon up their patients and dominate the medical field.Explore more on these topicsTexasAbortionReproductive rightsHoustonWomenRoe v WadeLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Specifically, he physically assaulted [name withheld], which is a grave violation of personal safety and workplace norms.”“Furthermore, he threatened to kill [name withheld], creating an environment of fear and intimidation. I remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim.”The email demanded: “It is imperative that immediate action is taken to ensure my safety and the safety of all employees.”It said “numerous concerns” had been raised about the alleged attacker, between the team being dropped off in Antarctica by South Africa’s SA Agulhas II ship in late December and the boat departing a little over a month later.The SA Agulhas II is notdue to make the 10- to 15-day journey from Cape Townto pick up the overwintering team and drop off a new team until December. There is a German base, the Neumayer Station III, about 137 miles north-west of South Africa’s station. Farther inland, about 118 miles south-east, is Norway’s Troll Base.A spokesperson for South Africa’s department of forestry, fisheries and the environment said: “The wellness unit is in contact with the team at the base on a continuous basis to find solutions and sustainable way forward for the wellbeing of the team members located in that remote base.“A full investigation is currently being commissioned and the department will act accordingly in relation to any wrong conduct against any official that has misconducted themselves.”South Africa first established a scientific station in Antarctica in 1960, when it took over a Norwegian base. Researchers at the base, which comprises three linked, double-storey buildings, 44 metres long by 14 metres wide, study the Earth’s electromagnetic fields, as well as Antarctic geology and biodiversity.South Africa also has research stations on Marion Island, 1,300 miles south-east of Cape Town, and Gough Island, 1,600 miles south-west of the Cape of Good Hope, where it leases land from Britain, due to the latter’s control of Saint Helena.It is not the first time that one of South Africa’s Antarctic teams has been involved in a violent controversy. In 2017, a Marion Island research team memberallegedly attackeda colleague’s laptop with an axe, after a woman involved with the colleague turned down his marriage proposal.Explore more on these topicsAntarcticaSouth AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The drama dropped on Netflix just as it emerged that crossbow killer Kyle Clifford had searched online for misogynistic podcasts andwatched Andrew Tate videoshours before murdering threefemale members of the Hunt family. Then again, such stories hit headlines with depressing regularity. Perhaps Adolescence would have felt unnervingly on-the-nose whenever it launched.The initial idea came to its star,Stephen Graham, after a spate of distressing violent crimes. In 2021, 12-year-old Ava White was fatally stabbed by a 14-year-old boy in Graham’s home city of Liverpool. In 2023, 15-year-old Elianne Andam was attacked with a kitchen knife by 17-year-old Hassan Sentamu outside a Croydon shopping centre.“It really hit my heart,” Graham said at the show’s premiere. “I just thought: ‘What’s happening? How have we come to this? What’s going on with our society?’” The actor roped in his regular collaborator, top-tier screenwriterJack Thorne, to create a hard-hitting drama interrogating why boys are committing such extreme acts against girls.The result is the harrowing but heartfeltAdolescence, a four-parter that follows the Miller family, whose lives are blown apart when 13-year-old schoolboy Jamie is arrested in a dawn raid for killing a female classmate called Katie.On a street level, it’s about knife crime. Over the past decade, the number of UK teenagers killed with a blade or sharp object has risen by 240%. On a cultural level, it’s about cyberbullying, the malign influence of social media and the unfathomable pressures faced by boys in Britain today. Male rage, toxic masculinity, online misogyny. This isn’t just all-too-plausible fiction. It’s unavoidable fact.View image in fullscreenFlat-out phenomenal … Owen Cooper as Jamie.Photograph: NetflixAs the boy’s father, Eddie, a self-employed plumber in an unspecified Yorkshire town, Graham spends the opening hour shell-shocked. He is inclined to believe his son’s protestations of innocence, as any parent would. That is, until he is poleaxed by chilling footage of the frenzied multiple stabbing.It might be a masterclass from the best actor working today but Graham leaves room for his castmates to shine. Ashley Walters delivers a career-best turn as lead investigator DI Luke Bascombe. Walters was considering quitting acting and moving behind the camera but Adolescence changed his mind, not least because it resonated personally with a man who, in his own teens, was sentenced to 18 months for gun possession. He has admitted to “crying most nights” while learning the script.Erin Dohertydrops in for a blistering head-to-head as clinical psychologist Briony. Christine Tremarco is heartbreaking in the finale as Jamie’s mother, Manda. And then come the kids. Newcomer Owen Cooper – incredibly, it’s the 15-year-old’s acting debut – is flat-out phenomenal as Jamie. He goes from sympathetic to scary, lost little boy to angry young man, often within the same breath, announcing himself as a major talent in the process. Fatima Bojang is movingly raw as Katie’s bereaved best friend Jade. Amélie Pease excels as Jamie’s elder sister Lisa, whose low-key wisdom becomes the glue holding her fractured family together.The story is brought to life by telling details. The way that Jamie still has space-themed wallpaper in his bedroom and wets himself when armed police burst in, reminding us of the “gormless little boy” behind the shocking violence. The way the secure training centre where he awaits trial is populated by youngsters with radiator burns who yell at Coronation Street. The way incidental characters – the creepy CCTV guy, the DIY store conspiracy theorist – warn us that adult males can be equally threatening. The way nonsensical graffiti and a nosy neighbour are what finally tip Eddie over the edge.This authentic naturalism can also be seen in the recurring motif of food. Teenagers are permanently hungry, after all. When Jamie is offered a bowl of cornflakes in his holding cell, his dad repeatedly nudges him to “eat your cornies”. DI Bascombe reaches out to his own son by taking him for “chips and a Coke”. Briony bonds with Jamie by sprinkling marshmallows in his hot chocolate. Like a typical vegetable-averse kid, he expresses horror at the idea of salad in a sandwich. The Miller family maintain a veneer of normality via a full English breakfast (complete with black pudding) and a Chinese takeaway (complete with prawn crackers).View image in fullscreenCareer-best turn … Ashley Walters as lead investigator DI Luke Bascombe.Photograph: NetflixAdolescence reunites Graham with Boiling Point director Philip Barantini, who’s clearly a glutton for single-shot punishment. The 2021 chef drama was filmed in one continuous take. Each episode of Adolescence is shot in the same seamless style, without a single edit. It’s not only a stunning technical accomplishment – exactly how does it flow from overhead crane shot to in-your-face closeup, from corridor to car interior to play park, without us seeing the joins? – but it lends an immersive, unflinching immediacy to proceedings.The camera never leaves the action. Neither can we. It’s no flashy gimmick but a way of ratcheting up the thrumming real-time tension. Rarely has a state secondary school been so vividly portrayed as in episode two. It’s Grange Hill with smartphones and security lanyards. When Bascombe and his sidekick DS Misha Frank (Faye Marsay) complain about the stink, noise and claustrophobic chaos, the audience feel it too.Adolescence review – the closest thing to TV perfection in decadesRead moreIt’s refreshing that Adolescence comes from Netflix, a platform not exactly known for quintessentially British drama. Nor indeed self-contained stories told over a punchy four episodes. In many ways, this feels like a BBC or Channel 4 project. Instead, the streamer’s deeper pockets are partly what enabled Barantini to be so technically ambitious.Adolescence lays bare how an outwardly normal but inwardly self-loathing and susceptible youngster can be radicalised without anyone noticing. His parents recall Jamie coming home from school, heading straight upstairs, slamming his bedroom door and spending hours at his computer. They thought he was safe. They thought they were doing the right thing. It’s a scenario which will ring bells with many parents. Some will be alarm bells.View image in fullscreenA blistering head-to-head … Owen Cooper and Erin Doherty.Photograph: NetflixWe take pains to teach them how to cross roads and not talk to strangers. We rarely teach them how to navigate the internet. There is often a glaring gap between parents’ blissfully ignorant image of their children’s lives and the truth of what they get up to online. We think they’re playing Roblox but they’re actually on Reddit. We think they’re doing homework or innocently texting mates. They are watching pornography or, as DS Frank pithily puts it, “that Andrew Tate shite”.Jamie’s plight becomes a poignant study of the nightmarish influence of the so-called manosphere – that pernicious online world of “red pills”, “truth groups” and the 80-20 rule (which posits that 80% of women are attracted to 20% of men). It’s a shadowy sphere populated by alphas, “incels”, MRAs (men’s rights activists) and PUAs (pickup artists), whose fragile egos turn into entitled fury. From mocking emojis on Instagram to the dark web and deepfakes, it’s another country to anyone over 40. No wonder parents are, as Bascombe’s son points out, “blundering around, not getting it”.The fourth and final episode is where the reliably superb Graham reduces viewers to rubble. Eddie turns from a combustible ball of anger into a hollowed-out husk of grief, guilt and regret. The climactic scene of him tearfully tucking Jamie’s childhood teddy bear into his bed and apologising to it (“Sorry, son, I should’ve done better”) is devastating.Is this the most terrifying TV show of our times? Adolescence, the drama that will horrify all parentsRead moreAs unanimous five-star reviews attest, Adolescence is the best drama of 2025 so far. We’re less than a quarter of the way through, admittedly, but the rest of the year’s TV will have to go some to beat it. This is old-fashioned, issue-led, socially conscious television – and all the better for it. It might not be as overtly political as Thorne’sToxic Townbut in terms of its potential to kickstart real world change, it’s the most rousing TV since Mr Bates vs the Post Office.It’s a cautionary tale about getting teenagers off screens and engaging with real life again. A reminder that human contact and family time might help save them. A plea to support, talk and listen, not let them fall through the cracks and disappear down the digital rabbit hole. It will open conversations that desperately need to be had.With its killer combination of artistic virtuosity, startling performances and gut-punch power, Adolescence is a howl of despair and a call to action. It will resonate with troubled teens, terrify their parents and linger with viewers. The questions it poses are urgent and vital. Providing answers? Well, that’s the hard part. But it’s up to us to solve this pressing issue before many more people die.Adolescence is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionStephen GrahamViolence against women and girlsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was the most incredible thing I’d ever filmed but the bouncer took the tapes. It took me years to get them back’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 17 Mar 2025 10.32 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 10.46 EDTShareOndi Timoner, directorI wanted to make a documentary about 10 bands on the verge of getting signed by record companies, to see what would happen to them. When I first heardthe Brian Jonestown Massacre, I thought they were some lost band from the 1960s. But a friend told me they were alive and well – and that every label wanted to sign them. I filmed them soundchecking for an industry showcase gig at the Viper Room in Los Angeles, then they came over to my house, which is the backyard scene in Dig!They were on the verge of getting signed, but had spent all their money on sitars and were taking the record companies off the guest list because they didn’t want to “give away” tickets. The gig itself ended up with fights on stage. It was the most incredible thing I’d ever filmed, but I ended up crying on Sunset Boulevard because the bouncer took the tapes, which took me years to get back. Outside the club, singer Anton Newcombe told me he was covered in “blood from people’s faces”.The next day he told me: “Forget those other bands. Go meet theDandy Warhols. Together we’re going to change the record business for ever and you can film us.” Within 10 minutes of meeting Dandy Warhols singer Courtney Taylor-Taylor, he told me: “I sneeze and hits come out.”Dig! looks at art versus commerce, friendship, collaboration and madness through the eyes of two lead singers who each possess what the other has not. Anton can live on the edge and make records for the price of a six-pack of beer. Courtney needs stability. I filmed the Jonestowns in Super 8 and the Dandys in 16mm and 35mm because they made it commercially. It made for a contrast: I wanted the footage to reflect the diverging fortunes of what Courtney calls the “most well-adjusted band in America” – the Dandys – and the least well-adjusted.I recently lost my house in the California fires. I found my Sundance award in the rubbleWhen I started filming I was 23 and had no idea if it would see the light of day. Between 1996 and 2003, I shot 2,500 hours of footage. My child’s birth prompted me to finish editing, so when I won the Sundance grand jury prize in 2004, I thanked him for the deadline.Dig! is Romeo and Juliet, or the real-life Spinal Tap. The new cut – Dig! XX – brings the story up to date. Them becoming friends again and playing together is the last thing you’d imagine happening at the end of the original film. I recently lost my house in theCalifornia fires, but the raw footage was at my office and so survived. I found my Sundance award in the rubble.Joel Gion, tambourine, the Brian Jonestown MassacreIf Ondi and Anton had discussed filming, the rest of us weren’t privy to it. Suddenly we were outside the club, pissed off, with cameras in our faces. The gig had blown up but being in a film was a consolation prize. I thought: “We’ll blow all those other bands in the documentary away.” At first I was hamming it up for the camera, but later, when everything started sinking, the camera became a coping mechanism, or confessional friend.I’d wink at the camera as if to say, ‘Don’t worry folks, everybody’s fine, even though there’s chaos reigning’Dig! was intended to be a celebration of scrappy artists socking it to the man, but turned into a film about the Dandys becoming a pop band and living the MTV life while everything fucked up around the Brian Jonestown Massacre. We had even more fights than are shown in the film but they were still relatively rare and they weren’t all started by Anton. In the early days Anton had been a super-driven songwriter, but we were all a bunch of fuck-ups by then, at the end of the filming. I’d wink at the camera as if to say: “Don’t worry folks, everybody’s fine, even though there’s chaos reigning.” But I’d hate to be typecast as the party guy or court jester.Dig! review – a hilarious, heartbreaking battle of the bandsRead moreI lucked out at the end of the movie when I quit before things went full-metal blotto [he rejoined the band in 2006]. But when I see the original film now, I have no regrets. We had so much belief in ourselves, which wasn’t blind illusion. Twenty years on, we’re much mellower – most of the time. There haven’t been any fights on the current tour, and we’ve got the place in pop culture we always imagined. In a way, it took everything we went through in Dig! to get to where we are.The 20th anniversary expanded documentaryDig!

The harsh, extreme-bass sound of his second, 2020’s Whole Lotta Red, took him to a new level of fame and acclaim – it was canonised as the second best album this decade by Pitchfork (beaten only by Fiona Apple) and a massive influence on a whole generation of rage-rap from Yeat to Ken Carson, OsamaSon and numerous other noisy young MCs. Carti initially announced Whole Lotta Red’s follow-up just three months after its release. Instead, it’s been – cue Titanic grandma voice – over four years, with Pitchfork recently issuing a 34-entry breakdown of all the false dawns and teased info that Carti has drip-fed his starving fans in that time.It looked like Music (renamed from I Am Music) would finally arrive on Friday, but the promised release time was moved back by three hours. When that time arrived, no album appeared. “My bones are weak, my soul is drained, and my will to live is hanging by a thread” was one typical reaction in the Instagram comments; the danger was that the wait was so long it could never be worth it. But Music is easily good enough to sweep any embitterment away and could come to be seen as a trap classic.This is not a forum for politically conscious lyrics or scrupulously tailored ethics, nor is it aiming to be (though the latter are complicated in Carti’s case by allegations around his own behaviour: his ex-partner, rapper Iggy Azalea, claimed he was absent from their son’s birth in 2020, and he was arrested in 2023 for allegedly assaulting his pregnant girlfriend, which he denied). Instead it’s a litany of boasts, threats, consumption (material and chemical) and reports of sexual congress that range from coldly efficient to outright demeaning: I winced at “spit on a bitch like Pac”.But for the most part, Carti’s nihilism is riveting, partly because of what he says (“I put your ass in the food chain” is a Sopranos-worthy threat) but mostly because of how he says it. You can certainly spot the MCs that have inspired him, from Lil Wayne’s gnarled croak to Future’s narcotised mantras, but Carti, a self-styled “emo thug”, subsumes them into his own bizarre and massively varied diction. On I Seeeeee You Baby Boi he babbles in a downy-soft high register, on Evil J0rdan he uses a hoarse, jaded mid-range and on Mojo Jojo there are deep pronouncements like a vocal-fried wizard: his delivery of the phrase “he a goon” is worth the price of admission alone. While many MCs dutifully work their lyrics to the beat, Carti makes the beat for work for him, adding little bursts of chatter or slurred words outside it while maintaining a core rhythm. It makes freestyle tracks like HBA especially involving.The beats themselves are just as varied, from classic Atlantan trap to a Hungarian psych sample underpinning the superb Philly, dainty chipmunk-soul on Backd00r, bright R&B on We Need All Da Vibes and some mechanistic ragers such as Pop Out and Cocaine Nose, the latter sampling the sensuously heavy guitar from Ashanti’s Only U.The frequent interjections of DJ Swamp Izzo, admiring Carti or simply shouting his own name at maximum volume, helps to glue these styles together, and nicely offsets the grandeur of this most lofty and long-awaited album project, making it feel more like a mixtape or radio session. But the guest rappers clearly sense the history being made here. Future’s triplet flow is fearsome and relentless on Trim, as if putting his nose to your face and backing you towards a ledge, while Travis Scott subtly moves his lines on Philly up and down in pitch to make cleverly minimalist hooks.Like Carti himself, Kendrick Lamar bends his voice into various forms, from Mojo Jojo – where he’s a trickster-god capering on Carti’s shoulder, throwing mischievous ad-libs in his ear – to Backd00r, with the doleful melodic style he recently used on SZA’s 30 for 30, to the crotchety-uncle voice he used all over his album GNX which reappears here on Good Credit. And the Weeknd is on top form on Rather Lie, a cloud-rap track of chest-clutching beauty that will probably become the big pop hit in the ensuing weeks – though everything on Music is already proving massively popular, becoming Spotify’s most streamed album in a single day this year.Across 30 tracks there are some lapses – Dis 1 Got It and Walk can’t break out of Future cosplay, Twin Trim is a witless Lil Uzi Vert showcase, and Munyun is rather tepid and polite for a blown-out speaker-botherer. But for most of the 77-minute running time, Carti meets the expectations he made so high for himself.Explore more on these topicsRapalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, it lands on Netflix – and all this week, influencers (plus a legendary footballer) will have to deplete their prize pot to survive. Oh, and everything costs through the roofStuart HeritageMon 17 Mar 2025 10.42 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 10.45 EDTShareAt the end of last year, MrBeast – an unfathomably successful YouTuber who revels in obnoxious demonstrations of wealth – went mainstream. He launchedBeast Gameson Prime Video, a sort of cloth-eared, Squid Game-style elimination show that entirely failed to twig that Squid Game was a satire. I gave it a pasting, but it went on to become Prime’s second biggest series debut of 2024.As such, we now find ourselves in a weird new world. Streamers have realised that the only way they can compete with YouTube is to open the cheque book for its content and run it on their own platforms. It’s what Amazon did with Beast Games, and it’s whatNetflixhas done with Inside. The latter is a British reality show that premiered on YouTube last year. Every episode got more viewers than anything shown on BBC One, so Netflix quickly snapped up the rights to the second season. Inside will be watched by so many people that it’s almost pointless for me to tell you whether it’s any good or not.I can tell you, at least, that it isn’t particularly original. The central conceit of Inside is that a bunch of people have to live in a house together, which makes it largely indistinguishable from Big Brother. There’s a room where everyone hangs out, and a shared bedroom, and a room with a chair where everyone can directly address the camera, almost as if it were some kind of diary. The contestants must also intermittently submit to challenges, which seem to primarily involve being covered in rats and spiders, which may raise eyebrows in the I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! legal department.View image in fullscreenFull of spider- and rat-based challenges … Percy Kiangebeni (PK Humble) on Inside.Photograph: NetflixHowever, two things separate Inside from generic reality mush. The first is that it only lasts for a week, with a new episode every day, so it won’t run the risk of wearing out its own novelty. The second, and by far the most interesting, is that the contestants have to deplete their own prize to survive. They start with a million pounds and, aside from basic nutrition, have to buy everything else at comically jacked up prices. Want a cup of tea? That’s £400. A packet of crisps? £500. Fancy a Pot Noodle? That will set you back a grand.From this, it will be perfectly clear to everyone reading that the point of Inside is impulse control. By depriving yourself of unnecessary luxury for a very short amount of time, you have more chance of winning a life-changing sum of money. Anyone with even a shred of common sense could understand that.However, the contestants on Inside do not have a shred of common sense between them, because the contestants on Inside are all influencers.

And that is before the Sidemen start selling them miserable little cups of prosecco at £1,000 a pop, which sets off a firesale of unregulated spending. I’m tempted to keep watching purely to see if it becomes the first reality show in history where the contestants end up owing the producers money.So it’s all a bit naff, but at least Inside benefits from being more watchable thanBeast Games.That show was self-aggrandising to the point of psychosis, whereas this is slightly more British and low-key about things. The narration is a little bit sarcastic and Come Dine With Me – “Let’s see which influencers are having tax issues this time,” it sniffs, by way of introduction – which helps to undercut some of the shrill, full-volume attention-seeking elsewhere on the show.Plus, it’s never a good thing to judge a show like this on its first episode. Like Big Brother, The Traitors and I’m a Celebrity before it, there are simply too many big personalities trying to make a splash at the same time. Once the herd has been thinned a bit, it should gain a bit more breathing room. Who knows, with time and familiarity, it might even end up becoming a bit compelling.Inside is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewNetflixReality TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

The London-born rapper and actor said that the debt left her unable to pay her full tax liability in January 2024.Inflo had worked with Simz, born Simbiatu Ajikawo, since her third album, 2019’s Grey Area, as well as producing for Adele, Michael Kiwanuka, Tyler, the Creator, and Inflo’s wife, soul singer Cleo Sol.The rapper filed her claim in January, alleging that Inflo held on to loans for more than a year and that his company provided improper accounting to her for funds that Sony supplied to cover recording,Law360 reports.Inflo has not yet filed a defence to the claim. Representatives for Simz offered no comment. The Guardian has contacted representatives for Inflo.In April 2022, Simz left her previous manager to work with an employee of Inflo’s company, Forever Living Originals. When her publishing contract with Universal Music Publishing ended, Inflo advised her to self-publish her music, the claim states.Simz then worked with Artists Without a Label (AWAL), a label services company for independent artists, owned by Sony. In November 2022, she entered a three-album deal with a total advance of £2m, as well as £625,000 to cover the costs of recording the third album.Prior to receiving the costs payment, Simz made two separate payments of £350,000 and £275,000 to Inflo to cover the costs of that record with AWAL. In October 2024, a letter sent by Inflo’s solicitors stated that the total costs only came to £524,436. Her claim states that she was under the impression any remaining funds would be returned to her on completion of the album.Simz lent Inflo the money on 1 December 2023 to cover the Drumsheds show on the condition that he repay her by 4 December. The claim states that he failed to do so, saying he was “still getting [his] deal over the line” and would send the money “back as soon as it lands”. Tickets for the event cost £99 each.Simz lent Inflo further sums of £500,000 and £200,000 in December 2023, but she claims he failed to repay them in 2024 despite repeated requests. Her inability to pay her full tax liability left her subject to interest and charges, she claims.Her claim states that Inflo’s lawyers acknowledged the debt in October 2024, but incorrectly framed it as a debt owed by Forever Living Originals, not Inflo himself.Simz is set to release her sixth album, Lotus, on 9 May. The album was produced by Miles Clinton James, who has previously produced for London jazz outfit Kokoroko. She shared the lead single,Flood, in February. In June, she will curatethe Meltdown festivalat London’s Southbank Centre. The lineup is yet to be announced.Explore more on these topicsLittle SimzRapnewsShareReuse this content"

Until one day in 2022, stuck in Melbourne traffic, I glanced towards the park in Bayside and saw mist rising from the trees, as if they had just exhaled into the dawn sunlight. This sight cheered me, lifting the pall of the workday grind ahead. Right then I made a resolution to interrupt my commute at least once a week by visiting the park and I have kept to it ever since.The next day I left the stream of traffic, parked the car and walked into the park, skirting the cricket oval where dogs chase sassy swallows skimming the grass just out of reach. Past there is a quiet pond where you will find ducks and turtles, and beside it is one of those forgotten patches of land where nature gets to do her thing unhindered.As I approached what would become my special place, the traffic noise faded and work worries vanished. I reached a small patch of green where understorey saplings rise almost branchless beneath an ancient white-trunked eucalyptus, protected by its vast embrace. I felt its protection, too. As I stood there in the company of trees I closed my eyes and inhaled. I couldn’t help smiling. After countless visits, I’ve discovered that each season has its special scent.I once flew in a balloon over Queensland’sAtherton Tablelands. I had never truly understood that trees were flowering plants until the pilot descended into a valley to follow a stream, drifting so close and silent above the giant trees that we could hear the hum of bees in that high canopy of flowers, just below our feet.My special place in spring has that same waft of honey, when eucalyptus blossoms spin to the ground like tiny pink tutus, their job done. They mingle there with petals from the saplings, which have a citrus tang that reminds me of the lemonade I drank as a child.On warm summer mornings the vapour from eucalyptus, the oil highly flammable, is so strong that I know there is a danger of bushfires somewhere. In autumn, I smell the mushrooms before I spot them. In winter, water falls through the eucalyptus leaves, turning it into perfumed rain. Breathing there makes me feel grateful to be alive.This need to spend time in green spaces is universal. On holiday in Japan, I saw small gardens lovingly tended to in so many places. Even railway substations, otherwise all ugly transformers and high-voltage wiring, were turned into charming oases with gardens of playful topiary – an antidote to industrial blight.I still can’t explain why greenness has such an effect on us, except that it may be the fundamental colour of growth, and of life. Grey is not. Concrete may be useful, but it cannot sustain us.I urge you to find your nearest patch of wild. If you don’t know where that is, find one. Change your usual route, just a little, and spend a few minutes there. Go into that green place and breathe.Explore more on these topicsParks and green spacesThe one change that workedGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s (not) looking at EuclidThe answers to today’s triangular teasersAlex BellosMon 17 Mar 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 13.01 EDTShareEarlier today I set you these mind-mangling puzzles about non-Euclidean geometry, in which the internal angles of trianglesdo notadd up to 180 degrees.1. Right, Right, Right.Assume the Earth is a perfect sphere. Imagine drawing a straight line from the North Pole to a point on the Equator. Can you draw two more identical lines to make a triangle where all the internal angles are right angles (i.e. they add up to 270 degrees overall)?SolutionAdd one line going a quarter of the way around the Equator, and another going back to the North Pole.2. Full circleNext, let’s go bigger, angle-wise. Can you find a way to cover the Earth with equilateral triangles that have internal angles of 120 degrees (i.e. they add up to 360 degrees overall)? These triangles must all be the same size and there must be no overlaps or gaps between them.(Hint: think about drawing triangles side by side.)SolutionImagine starting with one triangle that meets the criteria on the sphere’s surface. Now, add three more identical triangles, one along each edge of the original triangle, so that their edges align. Because each of these triangles has internal angles of 120 degrees, then at each corner where three triangles meet, the angles will add up to 360 degrees. As a result, the triangles completely cover the surface of the sphere!We can show this more intuitively by imagining a triangular-based pyramid made of 4 ‘flat’ equilateral triangles. If we ‘inflate’ this pyramid until it becomes a sphere, then its surface will still be covered by 4 triangles, but they’ll now each have internal angles of 120°. Each triangle will cover a quarter of the sphere.3. Tasty trianglesNow imagine a donut instead of a sphere. Can you draw two identical right-angled triangles on the donut so they perfectly cover its surface? And what will the sum of the six internal angles of these two triangles add up to?(A donut is a ‘torus’, a cylinder that curves and joins itself in a loop, as in the image above.)SolutionThe trick is turn the donut back into a cylinder by ‘cutting’ along one of its loops and re-straightening. Then, cut the cylinder open along its side to ‘unwrap’ it into a rectangular strip. Now, if we divide this rectangle diagonally, we create two identical triangles. Since this rectangle originally came from the donut, we can wrap it back up to recreate the donut, now covered with these two triangles. The six angles of the two triangles will meet at a single point: marked by where the ‘cut’ and ‘wrap’ lines form a cross on the surface of the donut. The angles of the four segments of the cross (with two segments split in two, to give the six internal angles of the triangles) will add up to 360 degrees.Thanks to Adam Kucharski for today’s puzzles. Adam is the author of a fascinating and beautifully-written new book,Proof: The Uncertain Science of Certainty. One of the many stories it tells is of how non-Euclidean geometry made mathematicians reassess what they had assumed were fundamental truths.The book is out on Thursday in the UK, and you can buy it at theGuardian Bookshop.I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015.

We had booked an accessible room for two nights in theLondon Stratford hotelover Christmas while we visited our daughter. The room was in good order when we checked in but when we returned from our daughter’s at 9pm we were horrified to discover that people had participated in sexual relations in the bathroom. Knickers were strewn, condoms were in the toilet and a party hat was in the bedroom.I called reception but there was no answer. I was unable to leave my husband to seek help, so had to clean the toilet with a towel. The following morning, I could only find a member of staff on the bar who cleared away the offending items but said there were no housekeeping staffon siteto clean up. We therefore felt unable to use the showerduring our stayas we didn’t know where body fluids were.Premier Inn insists there is no record of our room being accessed while we were out and has been ­dismissive. As you can imagine, my husband and I are not going to be having sexual relations in this ­manner at our age.BT, DerbyshireYour experience was so outlandish that I pressed you on each detail. The photos you took show a paper hat from a cracker on the bedroom floor, a pair of black panties balled in the washbasin and several condoms floating in the lavatory.Premier Inn’s initial response to you was certainly dismissive. It apologised for “any inconvenience” for this disruption to your “­positive journey”, insisted that only your key card had been used to access the room that afternoon and informed you that it would make every effort to prevent “any similar incidence” [sic] and would not correspond further.Now, perhaps the company has experience of pensioners bringing carpet bags full of sex aids to strew about the room in order to claim a refund. Maybe it assumed that ­festive cheer had gone to your heads that evening. Or maybe its room lock readers aren’t as reliable as it assumes. It backtracked at speed when I asked whether there was CCTV in the corridor to pinpoint the culprit and why the hotel had been so understaffed.It remains adamant that you were the only people to enter the room after it was cleaned in the morning, and there is apparently no CCTV in the corridors. However, it conceded the door might not have shut properly when you left for your daughter’s and that a passing couple might have seized the opportunity for high jinks. It also conceded that there should have been staff available to clean the room.A spokesperson said: “We acknowledge and apologise for the subsequent experience of how the complaint was dealt with, and as such as a gesture of goodwill we will be contacting the guest directly to arrange a refund for their stay.”Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

He can tell you the exact time, too: 5pm.As he paddled for 10 minutes towards three other surfers, he could smell remnants from a whale carcass that had washed up months earlier. Seagulls circled.He ducked under a wave and, weirdly, could hear the foam hiss as he surfaced. Then the foam parted like curtains. Salter saw the head of a great white cruising underneath the front of his shortboard, ballooning out at the body. By his estimation, it was four metres long. Likely attracted by the whale, the shark was unable to reach that all-you-can-eat buffet.“Great whites are the only sharks whose eyes move like ours, from side to side,” Salter says. “As the shark went past, we locked eyes.”View image in fullscreen‘It came straight at me’: Will Salter remembers the moment 15 years ago when locked eyes with a great white shark.Photograph: Alex Coppel/The GuardianSalter yelled to the surfers. In a panic, he was paddling out to sea, so he manoeuvred his board to aim for the shore. Though the shark was now 25 metres away, he saw a dorsal fin rise out of the water.“It came straight at me,” Salter says. “The fin brushed my ankle, rocking the board. Sometimes they bump objects, to see how they move.”A nearby paddleboarder, Mick, yelled that there was a wave. As Salter got in position, he saw the shark surface. “It thrashed its tail, then it submerged,” he says. “People say, ‘Did you get up and ride the wave and give it the finger?’ No, I was hanging on for dear life.”Once safely on shore, the emotions came out. Salter got to his car with his legs shaking and called his partner. Then he bought a lottery ticket – this was his lucky day.“I’ll always remember the guy at the newsagents,” Salter says. “He was looking at me strange because my eyes must have been bulging. I was like, ‘Mate, you wouldn’t believe what happened.’ He got bombarded with this story.”Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsSalter’s experience is dramatic, but stressful events come in many forms. What kind of help is there to process them, and how does a person get back on the horse – or back in the water, in Salter’s case?View image in fullscreenAfter an encounter with a great white, Will Salter has become more shark literate.Photograph: Alex Coppel/The GuardianEmma Vaughan, a clinical psychologist at FoundationPsychologyMelbourne, studied to be a paramedic before switching to psychology, and now works with first responders and people who have been in accidents or experienced other traumas. Treatment time is “as long as a piece of string”, she says – weeks, months or years. The pace is led by the client.“A first appointment will often be getting to understand someone’s story,” says Vaughan. “I need to build that rapport and make them feel safe, even avoiding reminders of the trauma. Maybe we’ll discuss what’s changed for them and how they’re coping.”Vaughan says there’s a difference between “acute stress” and PTSD. It’s normal for people to experience anxiety, sleeplessness and flashbacks for up to a month – that’s acute stress – and it can be useful to check in with a professional to normalise that. With PTSD, symptoms persist beyond a month, with natural fears turning into fixed beliefs.“PTSD is more of a disordered way of adjusting,” Vaughan says. “Often things have changed in the way the person sees themselves. They might feel they’re going to die, or they can’t trust anyone, or that bad things happen to bad people. The brain is unable to process that they’re safe now.”When a stressful event occurs, the unpredictability of the fallout is its own issue. No one knows that better than Ben Hamlett, for whom two concussions became massive question marks over his life.Hamlett was a professional footballer who now has his own strength and conditioning coaching business in Tasmania. In his early career he suffered much surgery and rehab after a knee and ankle injury, which ripped him away from playing professionally in the US and grounded him on the family couch in Hobart. Initially he turned to substances and struggled with depression, but then he found a mindfulness specialist.View image in fullscreenFormer professional footballer Ben Hamlett turned to mindfulness and meditation after significant injuries.Photograph: Matthew QinMindfulness and meditation taught him “to understand how my emotional reactions influence my decisions, behaviours and perceptions”. It also helped him sit with pain and ask what he could learn from this suffering. “You are allowing sensations to arise and pass away again, not being attached to the outcome or your identity,” he says.Hamlett returned to the game, but his subsequent traumatic brain injuries forced him to dig deep. The first injury occurred in 2016. He’d gone for a header and collided with another player.“I woke up the next day and I couldn’t stand up, I couldn’t deal with light, I couldn’t deal with talking or noise,” he says. “This persisted for five months. It was confronting, because I’d never had an experience where I couldn’t do the simplest things, like standing or walking. I remember sitting in the consulting room with these brain specialists who said, ‘Look, you need to consider retiring.’ I was 24.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

His psychologist taught him about a core principle of mindfulness, “equanimity” – developing a state of neutrality so that future experiences could be met without craving a specific outcome. “I had to really rely on that practice,” he says. “Rather than try to control the outcome, I just showed up with the fullness of my awareness.”Friendship, fitness and freedom: why LGBTQ+ Australians are turning to sports clubs to find ‘queer joy’Read moreHe moved to Europe to play in a third division league in Portugal. Then in 2022 came another concussion. Though the collision wasn’t as severe, the effects lasted three years and he was forced to retire.By now, Hamlett had a baby daughter, a business and was completing a psychology degree – and had to hit pause on looking after all three. “It was terrifying,” he says. “I noticed significant changes to my mood, to my ability to deal with pressure, which I’d never had before.”Reading Man’s Search for Meaning, by concentration camp survivor and neurologist Viktor Frankl, made Hamlett realise he had a choice in how he reacted to setbacks.“That helped me think, how would I like to look back on my life, and how would I like to step forwards?”For any of us, getting “back on the horse” requires risk assessment. After his second concussion, Hamlett reframed his goals, quit football and focused on building his coaching business.In addition to mindfulness, other common tools used to treat acute stress are cognitive behavioural therapy and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing.Vaughan recommends a “graded exposure” after a stressful setback. “Let’s say a surfer has gone through a shark attack,” she says. “Sitting at the beach and recognising any unhelpful thoughts would be a first step.”View image in fullscreenSalter got back in the water after four days – and he’s still surfing.Photograph: Alex Coppel/The GuardianThis tactic is exactly what Salter tried. Being a men’s counsellor, he had a good instinct for what tools to use. One of the other surfers out with him that day didn’t get back in the water for 18 months, but Salter got in after four days – and he’s still surfing.“The longer I left it, the more it was going to freak me out. I stayed in the shallows a bit, sitting on my board, getting comfortable. Over the next three years I would often see shadows and if my mind started racing, I’d paddle in.”These days, he’s more shark literate. He also knows how important surfing is for his wellbeing. And he’s framed his experience as something profound.“That was one of the most significant moments in my life,” he says. “I feel privileged to have been that close to an apex predator, but also, my dad died two weeks later and that was emotionally huge for me. Because it was almost like that shark was saying, ‘Not your time. You’ve got family to look after.’”Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleMental healthFitnessPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You get an incredible flavour from the onion, which are slowly melted in butter with cloves, cardamom and my addition of a handful of flaked almonds, plus a fried egg on top for balance. If your house is anything like mine, there are always peas in the freezer, rice in the cupboard and eggs on the counter, so this is the perfect store-cupboard meal.Green pea pulao with cardamom and almondsPrep10 minCook25 minServes2130g white basmati rice1tbsp neutral oil,plus extra for frying the eggs (or use extra butter)25g salted butter4 green cardamom pods, bashed to release the seeds1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped50g flaked almonds150g frozenpeas, defrosted1tsp sea salt flakes2free-range eggsPut the rice and 275ml boiling water in a microwaveable bowl with a lid (I use a Pyrex one with a snugly fitting plate on top). Microwave on a medium setting (ie, 600W on a 800W microwave) for nine minutes, then leave the rice to stand for 10 minutes. If you don’t have a microwave, put the rice and 275ml boiling water in a saucepan with a tightly fitting lid, bring to a boil on the hob, then cover, turn down the heat to very low and cook for 10 minutes without lifting the lid (this is important!). Fluff the rice with a fork and, if you want, spread it out on a plate to help it dry out.Meanwhile, put the oil and butter in a large frying pan on a medium heat, then add the bashed cardamom pods and fry for 30 seconds. Add the onion, turn down the heat and slowly melt them down, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes – you want just a very light colour on them.Add the flaked almonds, stir-fry for three to four minutes, then add the peas and salt, and cook for another two minutes.Tip the cooked rice into the pan and stir gently so as not to break it up too much. Taste and adjust the salt as needed, add more butter if you’re feeling decadent, then take off the heat and cover while in a separate pan you fry the eggs in oil or butter to your liking – I do mine for two to three minutes on a high heat, until the whites start to crisp at the edges, but the yolk is runny. Season with salt.Divide the rice between two bowls, and serve each topped with an egg.Explore more on these topicsRiceQuick and easyFoodNuts and seedsVegetablesVegetarian food and drinkEggsMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

So, after being made redundant, he set up his own rubbish compacting businessPaula CocozzaMon 17 Mar 2025 02.55 EDTShareEric McBean was living on the 19th floor of a high-rise in Eccles, Greater Manchester, when he had his lightbulb moment. “Everywhere in the building was nice – apart from the bins,” he says. On Friday they’d get emptied; by Sunday they’d be overflowing. “People who don’t even live in the block decide: ‘There’s a place to chuck stuff.’ A sofa turns up, then a telly.”McBean’s landlord, the housing association ForHousing, happened to be his boss, too. McBean was the lead for enterprise and innovation. “I thought: I’d like to find a solution to this.”He trialled a mobile compacting service in 2020 – which proved effective – but owing to a restructure, his role was made redundant a few years later. McBean was 59.Job-hunting felt like “starting over again. I didn’t think I had it in me,” he says. “I had more confidence in doing my own business.” He cashed in a small private pension and, with his modest redundancy, at 60 bought a vehicle and machinery to start his own rubbish-compacting service:Squosh. “We squash what’s in the bins and create more space.”For many people, finding a job would feel like the easier option. But even as a child, McBean always thought: “I’m going to be a businessman.” He has had a few attempts. “I’ve gone through life thinking: ‘Is this the one?’”I’ve gone through life thinking: ‘Is this the one?’Eric McBeanHis first effort, at 17, entailed hiring a minibus to transport friends and clubbers from their home town of Nuneaton to Great Yarmouth on Saturday nights. After that, he had a spell setting up an employment agency for people from the Midlands who were looking for work and accommodation in London. Then followed a company that distributed packed lunches; clients included Aston Villa’s youth team and Coventry airport, but then McBean’s partner went bust.“My dad always said: ‘You can have anything you want – if you work for it,’” he says. “As parents, they always believed in me.” They had moved to Nuneaton from Clarendon, Jamaica. McBean’s father worked down a mine, his mother as a healthcare assistant.The family didn’t own a car – McBean’s dad took the pit bus each day. But when he was 10, McBean joined a cub scouts trip to Baden-Powell House in London. “We were all looking out the window, car spotting. ‘There’s a Porsche … There’s another Porsche … Another Porsche.’ I thought: ‘How come no one drives them in Nuneaton?’”When he saw a silver Porsche 911, he set his sights on driving his own.View image in fullscreenMcBean and the tools of his trade.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIn the meantime, he got his HGV licence so he would “have something to fall back on”, and intermittently drove lorries to support himself and his family – he has three children – while waiting for his entrepreneurial luck to break, “like an out-of-work actor who gets a job waiting tables,” he says.In adulthood, he used to look at the Ford badge on the steering wheel of his car, and say: “One day that will be a Porsche.” Eventually, he bought a secondhand model “for less than the price of a new Ford”.But on holiday in the Gambia three years ago, he was involved in a fatal car accident when the taxi in which he was riding collided with another vehicle. McBean suffered a broken hip and pelvis, and was hospitalised for months. He sold the Porsche, now too low-slung for him to drive without pain.These days, McBean splits his time between driving the compactor van, pitching for new business and exhibiting at events. His first client was the Pennine Care NHS trust. Two housing associations followed, and Squosh has twice beenshortlisted for a British business award. He has just ordered his second van.A new start after 60: I got divorced – and became a sex therapistRead more“Some people shout: ‘What are you doing with our bins?’ We make it look like the rubbish was never there. The lids close and the place is tidy. That’s all people want.”McBean hopes that, in business terms, he has finally found “the one”. He was 30 when his parents died, and “never had the chance to show them I was successful … Maybe I am going through life seeing what I could be, and giving it a go.”Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60featuresShareReuse this content"

Now, there is no life here at all and anyone who comes is sad. They can remember what it once was,” the 40-year-old museum director says.There is little left of the palace – a mansion and fortress during Mamluk and Ottoman rule over Gaza and where Napoleon Bonaparte once spent several nights. Israeli bombardment and fighting in Gaza City during late 2023 and early 2024 left just a few sections of wall and an arch standing. Almost nothing remains of the museum.For Dahda, the loss is personal too. He had not wanted to leave the palace and so did not join hundreds of thousands of others fleeing to the south of Gaza when war broke out. In December 2023, he was staying with his wife and three daughters nearby when there was a huge explosion.“All my close family members were pulled out from under the rubble injured, except for my daughter Mervat, 12 years old, who was pulled out as a lifeless body. May God have mercy on her,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe Pasha Palace seen in 2022 and again on 5 January last year.Photograph: Getty ImagesPasha Palace is one of dozens of major heritage sites destroyed or badly damaged in the war in Gaza, which was triggered by a Hamas surprise raid into southern Israel in October 2023 in which 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and 251 abducted. The death toll from the Israeli offensive that followed reached more than 48,000 people, also mostly civilians, before a fragile ceasefire came into effect in January 2025.The offensive devastated Gaza, leaving fewer thana 10th of homes untouched, and destroying sanitation systems, health facilities, schools, universities, roads and much else.Palestinian experts working with British archaeologistsestimate that more than two-thirdsof heritage, cultural and archaeological sites in Gaza have been damaged, often very badly.Many appear to have been directly targeted by Israeli forces in attacks that could constitute war crimes in some circumstances. Israeli officials have said cultural monuments such as the Pasha Palace were only ever attacked if used by Hamas for military purposes and deny accusations that such sites were deliberately targeted for destruction.Close to Pasha Palace is Hamam al-Samara, a 700-year-old bath house that was among the most important of Gaza’s monuments. Its guardian was Salim al-Wazir, 74, who spent the war in southern Gaza living in tents.View image in fullscreenSalim al-Wazir, 74, guardian of Hamam al-Samara.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianAl-Wazir took over management of the bath house in 1970 from his father, whose own father had rented it from a famous family of Gaza notables during the era of Ottoman rule.“On the first day we could return to the north of Gaza from where we had been sheltering, I didn’t go to my home but instead came first to check on the hamam,” he says.Wazir was stunned. The hamam had been almost entirely destroyed.“I lost a place that meant a lot to me, a place that gathered people and provided them with comfort and relaxation. I also lost a part of my family’s history and of course of Gaza’s collective memory,” he says.View image in fullscreenMen relaxing in Hamam al-Samara in 2021 and a view of the destroyed bath house in January 2024.Photograph: Getty ImagesA recent reportby Palestinian conservation expertsin the occupied West Bank and UK-based archaeologists estimated that just protecting historical sites from further damage in Gaza – if the current ceasefire holds – will cost about $33m and take up to 18 months. Full reconstruction could cost almost 10 times more and take up to eight years.Competing proposals for the reconstruction of Gaza have paid little attention to historical sites. Donald Trump proposed levelling the territory after displacing its inhabitantsto build a “Riviera of the Middle East”. Others look to cities such as Dubai for inspiration, with a focus on towering hotels and malls, not heritage.But many in Gaza City want a different future for even the most badly damaged historical buildings, calling for their protection and eventual reconstruction.“If no one else takes on the task, I will spend the rest of my life rebuilding [the Hamam al-Samara] myself,” says Wazir. “I think we can reconstruct it exactly as it was, using the same stones and design. That way we can restore its former spirit.”Experts also point to bombed Roman and Greek remains, as well as bulldozed historical cemeteries, to underline the cultural richness that is still potentially at risk of further damage – either from a return to war or clumsy reconstruction.Many residents see theal-Omari mosque, the oldest and largest in the territory, as the greatest potential loss. The building was originally a Byzantine church, then was converted into a mosque after the Islamic conquest of Palestine almost 1,400 years ago. It was expanded over the centuries and rebuilt once after being almost destroyed by British artillery targeting an Ottoman ammunition dump there.View image in fullscreenAl-Omari mosque seen in 2013 and again in January last year after Israeli bombardment.Photograph: Getty ImagesHistorians point to the mosque, along with a Roman port and other sites, as evidence of the importance of Gaza as athriving trading centrefor 2,000 years.Tarek Haniya, 60, had been working at the mosque as a tour guide since his youth.“I have lived my life in Gaza, next to the mosque. The war was harsh in every sense of the word. Every day felt like a new nightmare. I lost my friends, I lost family members, I lost my home that had sheltered me for decades, and I lost the Omari mosque as I knew it too,” he says.View image in fullscreenTarek Haniya, the guide at the mosque.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianThough the mosque’s famous Mamluk-era wooden pulpit has survived almost undamaged, much of its roof is gone, most walls are in ruins and the minaret partly toppled.“It will definitely be restored. In fact, we are already working on that. There is a team collecting the broken stones of the mosque to restore it as soon as possible. True, the old mosque held irreplaceable history within its walls, but we will rebuild it.”Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warHeritageArchaeologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dior, Cartier and Rolex are among the high-end shopfronts overlooking the water. René Rottenberg, 75, has just finished his 400m swim through this upmarket urban jungle – a ritual he repeats up to five times a week, even in midwinter.For the retired gynaecologist, being able to swim in the crystal-clear water is the greatest luxury. “It’s just so fun,” he says. “The place is beautiful.”View image in fullscreenPascal Baudin, left, and René Rottenberg at the Bains des Pâquis on Lake Geneva.Photograph: Phoebe Weston/The GuardianRottenberg is a member of Les Givrés swimming club, which launches off a jetty, beach and swimming area in the centre of the city. A toddler playing on the artificial beach checks his mum isn’t watching before lobbing a pebble at a swan.Dentists, secretaries, judges, teachers and retirees all brave the 8C (46.4F) water during their lunch break, emerging red and blotchy with cold. “You find everyone here,” says Rottenberg. They have lunch together afterwards, before being swallowed back into the city.The sight of people launching themselves into an inner-city waterway would be unthinkable in most cities in Europe, the US and many other parts of the world. Three-quarters of Britain’s rivers are in poor ecological health,according to datacollected by thousands of citizen scientists in 2024, with experts describing the findings as “truly disturbing”.Pollution from water companies and agricultural runoff are driving the contamination, which affects all parts of the country, causing toxic algal blooms, mass die-offs of fish, and risks to human health.View image in fullscreenVisitors to thefete des vignerons(winegrowers’ festival) cool off in the waters of Lake Geneva in Vevey, Switzerland.Photograph: Laurent Gilliéron/EPA-EFEYet across Switzerland, such swimming scenes are normal. This hasn’t always been the case. In the 1960s, Switzerland had among the dirtiest water in Europe, blighted by mats of algae, mountains of foam, scum, anddead fish floatingon the surface. For decades, swimming was banned in some rivers such as the Aare and Limmat on health grounds, and people couldget illif they swallowed the water.Raw sewage and industrial wastewater flowed directly into water bodies –in 1965 only 14%of the population was connected to a wastewater treatment plant. Today, it is98%, and the country has a reputation for pristine swimming waters, sometimes referred to as its“blue gold”– and it’s all thanks to a complex network of sewage plants.View image in fullscreenSoldiers arriving in Zermatt to help out with the typhoid epidemic in 1963.Photograph: Ullstein bild/Getty ImagesA key driver of that transformation was a tragedy in the mountain resort of Zermatt in 1963, when a typhoid outbreakkilled three peopleand made 437 others ill. Soldiers were deployed and schools turned into emergency hospitals as panic spread. Pressure grew on the government to clean up the waterways, found to be the source of the outbreak. In 1971, the treatment of wastewater was written into Swiss law.Now Switzerland has some of the cleanest rivers in Europe. According to2023 datafrom the European Environment Agency, just five of the country’s 196 bathing areas were rated as poor quality. Politicians across the spectrum agree on the need to prioritise clean water.“Very high water quality is important to the population,” says Michael Mattle, head of wastewater technology at the engineering company Holinger. “We take a lot of care not to pollute water on its way throughSwitzerland.”And they pay for it: the government spent an average of £174 a person on wastewater treatment in 2022, compared with about £90 a person in England and Wales in the 2022-23 financial year, according to analysis byEnds Report.View image in fullscreenMichael Mattle, head of wastewater technology at the engineering company Holinger, in Geneva, Switzerland.Photograph: Phoebe Weston/The GuardianNow, Switzerland is leading the world in purifying its water of micropollutants: a concoction of chemicals often found in bodies of water that look crystal clear. They include antidepressants, antibiotics, diabetes treatments and anti-inflammatories, which haveunknown and potentially damaging consequencesfor human and ecosystem health.I think Swiss people are proud of their waterMichael Mattle, water engineerIn 2016, Switzerland became the first country to enforce legislation to clean up drugs and chemicals that collect in waterways. This work is based on a precautionary principle – if something has unknown effects, err on the side of caution. “It’s just a matter of time before they cause problems,” says Mattle.Conventional sewage treatment works are designed to deal with organic waste but are less effective with chemicals, hence plants across Switzerland are getting an upgrade.A 20-minute bus ride from the lake is the Villette wastewater treatment plant, Geneva’s first to treat micropollutants.View image in fullscreenFrédéric Galley, an engineer at the Villette wastewater treatment plant in Geneva, looks over the bacterial treatment area.Photograph: Phoebe Weston/The GuardianThe facility filters through 250 litres of water every second. First it filters out rubbish, food, money – anything people might flush down their toilets (a study found$1.8m(£1.4m) worth of gold flows through Swiss sewers every year). Then fat and sand are removed before the water is treated in huge basins of bacteria that removes organic matter.“It works like your stomach,” says Frédéric Galley, an operations engineer at Services Industriels de Genève (SIG), which manages the plant.Then the water is passed through activated charcoal, which acts like a sponge, absorbing the microchemicals.View image in fullscreenGalley inside the Villette treatment plant.Photograph: Phoebe Weston/The GuardianEach year, the Swiss are adding micropollutant treatment facilities to seven sewage plants, and now have a total of 37. By 2040, there will be about 140, according to unpublished data from theSwiss Water Association (VSA). “Many people don’t know the multitude of operations we have here, and how we do it,” says Galley. “All our actions that we carry out, we do for the sake of the community.”Before 2016, a series of pilots found removing 80% of pollutants was the maximum amount achievable for a reasonable cost. Within the 20% of chemicals that are not removed are PFAs, known as forever chemicals. Mattle says: “The endgame is to get these substances prohibited. Very resistant pollutants should not be used any more.”Wastewater experts from France, Italy and Belgium among other countries, have visited the plant to see what lessons in micropollutant treatment they could take back home. “On micropollutants, we are 10 to 15 years ahead of our neighbours,” says Mattle.View image in fullscreenA net full of freshly caught fish from Lake Geneva.Photograph: Alexandra Lavizzari/AlamyIn response to Switzerland’s work, the EU requires wastewater treatment plants serving more than 10,000 people to be able to remove micropollutantsby 2045. “They want to go very fast,” says Mattle.There are no plans in the UK to do the same, despite high levels of antibiotics and other drugsbeing foundin waters on some of the most protected national landscapes.‘Rivers you think are pristine are not’: how drug pollution flooded the UK’s waterways – and put human health at riskRead morePeople are not aware of how much work was necessary to purify Switzerland’s water, but they consider it important, says Mattle. “I think Swiss people are proud of their water,” he says, adding that it helps citizens enjoy a “healthy and joyful life”.On Lake Geneva, it is not just swimmers benefiting from the inviting waters: people read, share beers with friends, children jump between rocks.“We are united by a love of water,” says Pascal Baudin, a member of Le Givrés swimming club. Baudin, who is retired, comes here every day, and says that since he stopped working, the swimming group has become an even more important social connection.“If you don’t have friends, if you don’t have a social life, you lock yourself in your house and you get depressed. Here is the ideal medicine – cold water and friends,” he says.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe age of extinctionWaterSwitzerlandEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some children have been separated from their parents.“My Russian clients tell me, ‘Now our prison is 80% Russian, the remaining 20% are from rotating nationalities who stay for a while,’” said immigration attorney Julia Nikolaev, who has been advocating for detainees’ rights alongside representatives of the Russian opposition. “Only Russians and a few other post-Soviet nationals remain in detention until their final hearings.”US deports 250 alleged gang members to El Salvador despite court ruling to halt flightsRead moreAlexei Demin, a 62-year-old former naval officer from Moscow, was detained in July of last year.In the last 20 years, Demin rarely missed an anti-Vladimir Putin protest in the Russian capital. He had become concerned almost immediately after Putin, a former KGB agent, rose to power, he said. For years, he criticized Putin’s regime on Facebook, and he was detained twice at protests. Still, he never imagined that he would end up fleeing his homeland for fear that Putin’s regime would imprison him. Or that he would end up imprisoned in the US.When Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a colleague asked Demin why he wasn’t enlisting to fight. He replied: “If I go, it will be on Ukraine’s side.” Soon, as the crackdown on dissent in Russia intensified amid the war, Demin and his wife, like many others who had long openly opposed Putin, fled to the US to seek political asylum. For years, Russians have been among the topfivenationalities granted asylum.The couple arrived in the US in the summer of 2024, after securing an appointment through CBP One, the app launched by theBiden administration(and since then shut down by Donald Trump) allowing asylum applicants to schedule to meet with immigration officials. At their appointment, Demin and his wife were detained, separated and sent to detention centers in different states. They haven’t seen each other since.His predicament, Demin said, was “a trap and a blatant injustice”.“This is how the US treats people who protest against Russia’s policies,” he said in a call from a detention center in Virginia in January.US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) does not release public data on the number of people from post-Soviet countries it holds in detention. But Nikolaev said that law enforcement officials have privately acknowledged to her that asylum seekers from those countries are being held longer.Other activists say they have seen similar patterns. The non-profit Russian America for Democracy in Russia (RADR) has played an active role in assisting detainees in immigration detention centers, finding lawyers and working with the government officials.Dmitry Valuev, president of RADR, said it was an issue that affected not only Russians, but also citizens of several other post-Soviet countries.There have beenreportsthat some immigrants arriving from post-Soviet states are facing increased scrutiny over fears they are connected to Islamist terrorist organizations. It’s unclear what prompted US authorities to keep the Russian asylum seekers in detention. One theory is that immigration officials are targeting Russians and other post-Soviet nationals as spies.Eric Rubin, former US ambassador to Bulgaria who also served as a deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Moscow, said that the complicated history of US-Russia diplomacy can hurt Russian asylum applicants.“When you meet Russians in the United States, obviously you need to wonder whether some of them are actually working for Russian intelligence. Some of them are, most of them are not,” said Rubin.Nikolaev isn’t so sure. “Russian spies can enter the country with European passports, visas and all the right documents,” she said.Nikolaev in January took her concerns to US government officials, alongside Ilya Yashin, a leading Russian opposition figure. They met with officials at the national security council, who requested a list of separated families, Nikolaev said.The Department of Homeland Security, Ice and the national security council did not respond to repeated questions about detention policies or the specific cases outlined in this article.In a statement, the White House said that the duration of cases varies based on legal proceedings and any protections sought. The White House also said there had been “zero instances of children from any of the countries you mentioned being separated from their families byUS immigrationauthorities in this entire fiscal year”.View image in fullscreenGalina Kaplunova with her son.Photograph: Anita LozinskaBut Galina Kaplunova, 26, an illustrator and anti-Putin activist, was detained and separated from her child and mother at the US border last August.In the summer of 2024, Kaplunova’s husband, a Kremlin supporter, had threatened to take her child away and report her to the police for her political activism, Kaplunova said. A native of St Petersburg, she had been detained multiple times at protests and had volunteered in opposition leaders’ campaign offices. Two days after her husband made the threat, Kaplunova, her four-year-old son and her mother fled to the US.At the US border with Mexico, Ice agents separated Kaplunova from her son, she said. He was placed in foster care, while she and her mother were sent to different detention centers in separate states.After being separated, her son was placed with a Mexican American family, she said. He didn’t speak English, so communicated with them through Google Translate.“I fled Russia so they wouldn’t take my child or jail me. But the US did,” she said.About two months after being detained and separated, Kaplunova was released and reunited with her son, she said. It was a miracle, she said.Now Kaplunova and her son now live in California. Her mother is still detained. Her son is afraid of being abandoned. Whenever she tries to discuss his time in foster care, he simply says he doesn’t remember it.“It’s as if he erased that part of his life so he wouldn’t have to remember it,” she said.He learned some English in foster care, but refuses to speak it with his mother.“Maybe he associates English with something bad, something negative,” she said.Valuev, the president of RADR, said that long periods of detention can hurt applicants’ asylum cases. Hiring a lawyer from within a detention center is nearly impossible due to the lack of internet access, he said. “Detainees are given a list of contacts, but most of these numbers don’t answer the phone,” he said.Additionally, many detainees have no access to materials for their asylum cases because their documents were stored on computers and phones that were confiscated.Vladislav Krasnov, a protest organizer and activist from Moscow, said he spent 444 days in a Louisiana detention center. Krasnov fled Russia in 2022 after Putin announced a draft. He crossed the border with the CBP One appointment and was swiftly detained. Now free, he is still waiting for a court hearing to review his asylum case.Reflecting on his experience, he said he was shocked by the welcome he got in the United States. “I escaped one gulag only to end up in another,” Krasnov said.He was also angry at Russian opposition leaders for not paying attention to his plight until recently.“Last summer, I watched Yulia Navalnaya hugging Biden in the Oval Office. Then she talked on the phone with [Kamala] Harris, and Harris declared that America supports people fighting for Russia’s freedom. To put it mildly, I had a complete breakdown at that moment, sitting in detention,” Krasnov said.About 300 detainees from Russia and other post-Soviet countries filed a lawsuit last November, calling their detention discriminatory, and demanding freedom for people they argue were held without a justification. A federal judge ruled in February that the court lacked the jurisdiction to review the detention policy and dismissed the case.View image in fullscreenPolina Guseva with the Russian dissident leader Alexei Navalny before he was detained and died in prison.Photograph: Polina GusevaAmong those mentioned in the lawsuit was Polina Guseva, a political activist and volunteer on the team of the late Russian dissidentAlexei Navalny. Guseva arrived in the US in July 2024, applied for asylum and was sent to a detention center. She said Ice officers at the Louisiana detention facility where she’s being held “openly say that Russians are not being released”.Still, she does not regret coming to the US, she said, adding safety concerns in Russia left her with no other choice.“Two thoughts help me a lot. First, better to be here than to be raped with a dumbbell in a Russian prison,” Guseva said. “And second, my friend Daniil Kholodny is still in prison in Russia. He was the technical director of the Navalny Live YouTube channel. He was tried alongside Alexei Navalny in his last trial and sentenced to eight years. He has been imprisoned for more than two years now. If he can hold on, why shouldn’t I?”Alexei Demin, the former naval officer and longtime protester, was supposed to have his first asylum court hearing reviewing his asylum case in early February, but the hearing was rescheduled to mid-April because of the judge’s sickness. By that time, he will have been in detention for more than 300 days.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationRussiaTrump administrationDonald TrumpVladimir PutinAlexei NavalnyBiden administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Millions waded into the freezing waters of thesangam– the sacred confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, plus a mythical one, the Saraswati – believing that a single dip could wash away a lifetime of sin.From dawn until well past midnight, the riverbanks teemed with saffron-clad sadhus, bare-chested pilgrims and families clutching brass urns, garlands and clay lamps, an unceasing tide of pilgrims.View image in fullscreenPilgrims performing one of the rituals associated with the ‘holy water’ of the rivers at this year’s Kumbh MelaThe Maha Kumbh Mela, which is likely to have been the world’s largest religious gathering, concluded on 26 February, with the Uttar Pradesh government claiming that a staggering660 million peoplehad visited over its duration.It was also the scene of a tragedy this year whenat least 30 devotees died in a crush, and another 60 were injured, on one of the busiest days.It is easy to see the risk of such crushes when, on the days seen as most auspicious for bathing, when the crowds swelled to tens of millions, the riverbanks seemed to disappear under the weight of pilgrims pressing forward, their chants and the sound of conch shells blown in rituals echoing through the air.The Kumbh Mela has been held every 12 years for centuries, but this year’s was no ordinary pilgrimage. The state government, along with Hindu leaders,declared the 2025 Maha Kumbhto be a once-in-a-lifetime event, citing a rare celestial alignment that occurs once every 144 years.With an eye on spectacle and scale, the government allocated about £720m to build a sprawling temporary metropolisspread across 4,000 hectares(15 sq miles). Constructed in a matter of weeks, this tent city accommodated a fluctuating population – ranging from 3-4 million to80 millionon the festival’s busiest days.View image in fullscreenThe temporary city had 200,000 tents, 250 miles of temporary roads and 30 pontoon bridgesAccording to Rahul Mehrotra, chair of urban planning at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, the temporary settlement had all the characteristics of a megacity. “Built on a grid, the festival grounds replicate various social and physical infrastructures, including piped water, electricity, sanitation and road networks, transforming the barren floodplain into a fully functioning city,” he says.With 200,000 tents to rent, 500,000 parking slots and 25,000 free tents, the site is a massive logistical feat. It is illuminated by 67,000 streetlights, with 250 miles (400km) of temporary roads, nine permanentghats[steps to the river], and 30 pontoon bridges.A 775-mile network of water pipes was laid to support the massive influx of pilgrims, and 150,000 toilets were installed, cleaned and maintained by 15,000 sanitation workers. Every day,400 tonnes of rubbishwere collected.View image in fullscreenA temporary ashram – a monastery-like retreat – with lifesize cutouts of Hindu sages on the upper floorsAfter nearly two and a half years in the planning, the temporary festival city is now being dismantled, with more than10,000 labourersworking day and night to remove tents and dismantle infrastructure.Dismantling it will take nearly two months. It’s also a race against time as it must be done before the monsoonVijay Kumar AnandVijay Kumar Anand, a district magistrate, says: “It took months to build this city; and dismantling will take nearly two months. It’s a race against time as it must be done before the monsoon arrives, as the river will reclaim what was always hers.”Suppliers span India, with vendors transporting materials from other states. Some, such as Lalloo Ji & Sons, a local event-management company, have been providing materials for the religious festivals for nearly a century and were also commissioned to erect35,000 tents this year.Streetlights, tents and pontoons will be dismantled and stored in warehouses to be repurposed for future events, including the next Maha Kumbh in 12 years and the Magh Mela, a smaller gathering that takes place in Prayagraj every year.View image in fullscreenCleaners, most of whom are from the Dalit community, expect to be working here for another monthView image in fullscreenThough efforts were made to avoid single-use disposable materials, 400 tonnes of waste a day were collectedA portion of the inventory – such as pontoons, generators and streetlights – will be redistributed across Uttar Pradesh. “Wherever there is demand, these resources will be deployed,” says Anand. “Pontoons are often sent to flood-affected villages, while streetlights find their way to rural areas in need of better infrastructure.”Of the streetlights, poles, transformers, LED lights and solar hybrids, 25% will be reserved for the annual Magh Mela festival.Items with limited value gradually trickle into local markets. “Over time, they make their way into informal settlements, where the poorest communities repurpose them – bamboo, tarpaulin and metal sheets, for instance, are often used to construct homes in urbanbastis[shanties],” says Mehrotra.View image in fullscreenAbout a quarter of the lighting and power infrastructure from the vast site will be kept for use at future festivals in Uttar PradeshView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenOver time, much of the material used at the festival, such as bamboo, tarpaulins and sheets of metal, will make its way to the slums, where it will be used to build homesAs the Kumbh festival comes to an end, people continue to take a dip, especially those who could not attend the main event. But the holy river itself is in a dire state, with mounds of rubbish strewn along the riverbanks and in the water.I must be filling 100 to 150 garbage bags a shift … we’ll be cleaning for another monthRaju BalmikiFaecal bacteria in the water were about500 times the level considered to be high riskfor drinking. According to India’sCentral Pollution Control Board, the level of faecal coliform in the Ganges at thesangamwas 49,000 MPN (most probable number) per 100ml on 20 January, while the Yamuna recorded 33,000 MPN before merging at thesangamthe same day. This vastly exceeds themaximum permissible limit for bathing waterof 2,500 MPN per 100ml and the desirable level of 500 MPN per 100ml.Thousands of workers continue to clean the riverbanks, removing the waste left behind by pilgrims – both as religious offerings and indiscriminate dumping. The vast majority of these workers belong to lower-caste communities, especially Dalits, who are historically forced to undertake sanitation work.View image in fullscreenPilgrims left behind a combination of rubbish and religious offerings, such as flowers and garlandsRaju Balmiki, a sanitation worker, has been clearing waste from the ghats, working daily from 6am to 3pm since the festival began. “I must be filling at least 100 to 150 garbage bags a shift,” he says. “There’s all sorts of trash – flowers, coconuts, clothes, even shoes. We’ll be cleaning for another month, but people won’t let the river breathe.”As Kumbh disappears, its tents and makeshift streets dismantled, those who came not as pilgrims but as labourers begin boarding crowded trains and trucks. They return to their home towns, not with divine blessings, but with good fortune earned from a city that existed only briefly.View image in fullscreenThe sun sets over the scene of the largest ever gathering of humanity.

Many were wounded and their arrival spread panic around the town.According to Atosha, a solider who had lost an eye in the fighting told her: “If there’s a way for you to go to Burundi, do it today because the fighting is coming here tonight and it’s bad. People are getting killed and women and girls are being raped.”As gunfire echoed around the town, Atosha’s family agonised over what to do. A few days later, her father told her to travel to the border, just a couple of miles to the east, with her sisters. Her parents would follow.Atosha gathered the children, and they left without any belongings. “With gunshots ringing, you can’t even get the strength to pick up a pen,” she said.They trekked as fast as they could, joining fleeing crowds – some using bicycles – until they reached the Rusizi, where Atosha paid 20,000 Congolese francs (£5.40) to a group of young men to swim each family member to the other side.More than 7,000 people have been killedand hundreds of thousands uprooted by the surge in violence in DRC in recent months. Sexual violence and human rights abuses are “rampant” near the frontlines,the UN has said, as is the looting and destruction of civilian homes and businesses.At least 65,000 peoplehave arrived in Burundi in the past month, the largest influx into the country in decades.In Cibitoke , what used to be a bustling sports venue is now a key transit centre for the refugees as they await relocation to designated sites.View image in fullscreenPeople fetching water at the displacement centre.Photograph: Carlos Mureithi/The GuardianThe new wave of refugees has further strained the humanitarian situation in Burundi, a country of 13 million that was already struggling to cope with handling Congolese refugees from previous conflicts, returnees from past Burundi crises, and its own people displaced internally due to climatic disasters.“It’s an emergency that is underreported,” said Geoffrey Kirenga, the head of mission for Burundi at Save the Children, which is providing a humanitarian response in the stadium and elsewhere. “Now this influx has overwhelmed our existing capacity. It is very exhausting, but also underfunded.”DRC mapAmadou Ali, the Burundi country director for the International Rescue Committee, which is also providing humanitarian relief to people fleeing DRC, said: “As a human, if you see that situation, all you can do is to provide support. It can be material support, it can be moral support, it can be financial support, but its contribution today is very important.”The stadium was a hive of activity when the Guardian visited earlier this month. Densely packed crowds joined long queues to register as a refugee or fetch water from a truck, jerrycans in hand. In one area, Red Cross officials called out names through loudspeakers and handed out essentials – a blanket, a bucket, a mat, soap and a mosquito net for each person. Many in the stadium had survived weeks without them.Despite the best efforts of aid agencies, the tired and often traumatised people who made it to the stadium found a shelter in distress.Many said food distribution happened once a day, and was not sufficient.“People are suffering here,” Atosha said. “Being a refugee or being called a refugee isn’t something you can be proud of.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s so sad that people are dying, others are disappearing, and families are being separated.”Many of those in the stadium had lost loved ones to the deadly currents of the Rusizi, or were otherwise separated at some point on their journey to Burundi.Therese*, 46, paid a man to move her two children, aged 12 and 14, across the river weeks ago. “He asked me to let him take the children first then he’d come for me,” she said. “I didn’t see him again.”View image in fullscreenTherese speaks with Flavia Bigirimana, a gender-based violence and child protection assistant at Save the Children, at the displacement centre.Photograph: Carlos Mureithi/The GuardianTherese, who crossed herself with the aid of another man, said: “I cried. Other transporters told me I’d find my children on the Burundian side, but I didn’t.”Emmanuel*, 15, is one of hundreds of unaccompanied children who have arrived in Burundi. He was separated from his family amid the chaos that ensued when gunshots started echoing in his home town in Ngweshe Chiefdom, south of Bukavu.His family ran towards the hills in eastern DRC, while he went in the direction of Burundi. “We don’t know whether they’re dead or alive. We heard the fighters bombed the hills,” he said.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel speaks to Dushime Entente Habib, the advocacy and communications coordinator at Save the Children, at the displacement centre.Photograph: Carlos Mureithi/The GuardianHe and his friends walked for two days. On the way, they slept in a forest at night, got robbed, saw dead bodies, and women giving birth along the road.Others were able to get to Burundi with their entire families. Safari fled Ngweshe Chiefdom with one child on his shoulder and food on his head, while his wife carried one child on her back and another at the front, and clothes on her head. They walked for two hours to cross the river. “When I saw my entire family cross, I saw that God had helped me, and our hearts became at ease,” Safari said.Some of the refugees in the stadium are volunteering for tasks to help each other, including cooking and chopping firewood.In one shelter, Safari, a former teacher who is being supported by the IRC in Burundi, was showing children how to write, inscribing the letter “o” using chalk on a small blackboard for a handful of enthusiastic children who then did as he had taught them.In another, Atosha, who completed her degree a few months ago, rocked a crying toddler on her thigh. She was surrounded by more than a dozen other children gazing down at colourful wooden number puzzles.She picked up scattered pieces on the mat and stretched her hand to distribute them to some children. “Put this here,” she said, guiding one of them.She was taking care of children and keeping them busy with the number puzzle as their parents scrambled to register as refugees and look for food and other essentials.“We’re all brothers and sisters here,” she said. “Some people here have given up hope and have been crying every day because they lost their family members. If you have strength to encourage somebody even though you have your own struggles, you should do it.”*Names changed for safety reasons.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoBurundiAfricaRwandafeaturesShareReuse this content"

When it comes to getting people off incapacity benefits and back into work, breadmaking, it seems, has a part to play.Kendall is atWorkbridge, a community centre in Northampton. There’s a cafe, a garden centre, and workshops and kitchens offering people with mental illness, autism, learning disabilities and brain injuries the chance to develop their life and job skills.People referred to Workbridge are often taking their first, tentative steps towards a job or returning to work. The activities – art, wood-turning, ceramics, breadmaking – are essentially therapeutic, about building confidence, routine and trust.On her visit last month, Kendall was keen to highlight the less-discussed aspects of Labour’s ambitious employment plan,Get Britain Working, but the visit came against a backdrop of political noise around the government’s cuts to incapacity benefits.The benefit system was “broken”, said Kendall. She said she wanted to replace the idea of the jobcentre as a place of distrust and punishment with one that provided real help to people on incapacity benefits, many of whom say they want to work.The existing system did not provide proper support for disabled jobseekers but created incentives for them not to work, she said, adding that places such as Workbridge would be part of the new approach. “I’m here to change the system,” she said. “It’s got to be a genuine reform, not just about cuts.”Josh, a 19-year-old with dyspraxia, has been doing courses at Workbridge in leatherwork and breadmaking. With extra support from Mencap, he was due to start working, with a workplace buddy, at Amazon.He was at first uncertain, and then irrepressibly charming. Had Workbridge helped him? “It’s given me more confidence to talk to people,” he said. A friend asked him what he’d “really” like to do. Josh smiled: “I like acting.”View image in fullscreenLiz Kendall chats to participants in the Workbridge scheme in Northampton.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianMark, 54, was an experienced IT professional when the anxiety that had plagued him for most of his life turned into a breakdown. In a fug of depression he lost his job, his relationship and his savings, and became a virtual recluse.The local jobcentre referred him to Woodbridge. “I would never have chosen to do a sourdough-making course in a million years. But it got me out of the house. After two or three weeks I went from terrified to: ‘right, what’s next?’”Breadmaking was no magic bullet, he said. He was not ready to return to a full-time job. But it was a start. He contrasted it to his first, disastrous meeting at the jobcentre.“I was sweating, panicking. It was like they just wanted me off universal credit asap,” he said. “If I had been forced into a job [at that point] I would have been off ill after three weeks. I would have had none of the tools that I needed. Compulsion doesn’t work.”Richard Draper, a disability employment adviser at the Northampton jobcentre, said jobcentres had lost their way in recent years, becoming too focused on processing benefits andissuing financial penaltiesto people who fell foul of rigid benefit rules.He wanted to see a more personalised and flexible approach. More face-to-face, sustained engagement, helping claimants who had not worked for years to “find their feet” in the world of work. “Absolutely everything in this business of getting people back into work is about relationships,” he said.Sanjith Kamath, deputy chief executive of the charity St Andrew’s Healthcare, which runs Workbridge, said it produced positive outcomes, but that it would be wrong to overstate these: “Not everyone is going to be able to work 40 hours a week. Our role is to maximise the hope they can do the best they can.”Funding is precarious for charities such as Workbridge, which are reeling from thefinancial impactof Labour’s national insurance cuts. “We need consistent funding. Everybody acknowledges [what we do] is a good thing. But they have to pay for it,” said Kamath.Kendall said helping people who wanted to work, and who could work but were abandoned by a uninterested benefits system, was a “Labour cause”. She said: “There are many people, who with the right help and support, could work. But we have to help them get the skills and confidence.”Explore more on these topicsBenefitsUnemploymentWelfareLiz KendallNorthamptonMental healthHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Then it made her a star. She talks about her childhood in South Africa, life in Britain, and the ‘full-on’ training for her new tourByEmine SanerMon 17 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 08.19 EDTShareIn news that should gladden the nation, Oti Mabuse – beloved dancer, grafter and bringer of joy – has just become a British citizen. My own feeling is that Mabuse should have received instant citizenship along with her national treasure status, thanks to her work on Strictly Come Dancing, on which she competed for seven years. At least, thanks to theLife in the UKtest, she knows all about our mountains, parliaments and islands, she says with a laugh.No time to celebrate – Mabuse is in the middle of preparing for her new dance tour, Viva Carnival, which opens this summer. Her previous show, I Am Here, “was very personal, aboutSouth Africaand growing up, and everything that happened there, and the reasons why I am the way I am. I wanted a slight continuation of that – not where I come from, but where I would love to go.” She loves travelling, she says, and connecting with people, and she wanted to explore the world’s festivals, from Brazil’s carnival to Glastonbury. The idea was “to kind of create my own dance carnival”.For the past three weeks, Mabuse has been back in the gym for two hours a day, “getting the knees not to crack, and getting that flexibility where I would love it to be, creating stamina and strength to be able to dance a two-hour show every night”. Then she’s in the dance studio for another three hours. “So it is full-on,” says Mabuse, with some understatement when we meet in a central London hotel bar during a rare window in her schedule.Just 16 months ago, Mabuse gave birth to her daughter, 10 weeks early. The baby was in neonatal intensive care for six weeks, and Mabuse had to overcome sepsis and gestational diabetes. In the past year, she has somehow still found the time to reprise her role as a judge on ITV’s skating showDancing on Ice, appear on I’m a Celebrity and write her first romance novel.. And now there’s this new tour, which she is creating with her husband, the dancer Marius Iepure. They run a dance studio and have toured together before. Working with him is “so much fun,” she says. They can irritate each other in their married life, like any couple, but “when we dance, it’s magic”.View image in fullscreen‘She watches and hears everything that I say’ … Mabuse with her daughter.Photograph: Oti Mabuse/PAHaving a baby, she says, has made her more motivated than ever, “because I want to create something that she could look back at and watch mommy and daddy on stage”. Her body is not the same – she is less flexible and not as strong as she was – but that’s only because she stopped for a while. She’ll get it all back, she says.I always think that for athletes, and I include dancers, something as big as pregnancy, or even just ageing (Mabuse is 34) and the physical changes it brings, must bring a sense of loss or grief – but it’s not really like that for her, she says. She was always very critical of her body. She pulls out her phone and finds a picture, taken around 10 years ago, that a friend sent her recently. “I remember being on this shoot and feeling like I was overweight. I was so stressed about what I looked like and feeling like it wasn’t thin enough.” She was tiny but she never thought that was good enough. “Now I look at my body, although a completely different size, as a tool of strength.”There are still times she catches herself being self-critical, often when she’s teaching in her studio. “But now, I think because I’ve created a whole human being, I can look at my daughter and I go, my body is amazing, and what it produced is incredible. The confidence that I have in my body now has totally increased. I have to love my body, and it’s the only one that I have, and unlearn all these toxic things that I learned from a young age because of the world that I grew up in.”View image in fullscreenWith fans at the Brit awards in London this month.Photograph: JMEnternational/Getty ImagesIt was inevitable that Mabuse, who grew up in Pretoria, would become a dancer. Both her older sisters danced – the eldest,Motsi, is a Latin dance champion and judge on Strictly Come Dancing – and their mother, a teacher, also ran dance classes. “I don’t think I had a choice,” says Mabuse, who started when she was around four. “It was in our family from long before I was born, and I think South Africa as a culture, we’re quite a vibrant, dancing country. We dance all the time.”There was also a serious reason for her mother’s interest in dance. Mabuse was two when her older brother, Neo, died by suicide, aged 18. “I think it formulated my mom’s way of parenting,” says Mabuse. “That’s why she put us in dancing, in this world where we would be focused, and we would not have outside influences. We grew up in an area that was full of drugs and violence, so she gave us dance to keep us focused.” Mabuse thinks dance also allowed them to express their grief, “to be kids and to feel happy. I think, as a family, that’s why we would deeply need to dance.”I used to tell my first dance partner: ‘You’re not practising hard enough. I want to win. Let’s go!’As a child, she would compete, which brought her to Blackpool for competitions, which she loved. Her memories seem to revolve mainly around food – fish and chips, pick’n’mix, and “lots of sandwiches. You guys love sandwiches,” she says, a little bemused. Was she always competitive and determined? “Oh my God, my first partner will tell you. I was just like: ‘You’re not practising hard enough. I want to win. We can do this. Let’s go!’”Mabuse says that comes from her parents. “They both had to come out of really bad situations, from poor South Africa, and you have to be determined to make it, you have to be ambitious.” Her mother was a teacher, and her father was a lawyer and is now a high court judge. “He decided to study law because of the injustice and because more people needed defence, and they need to know their rights,” she says of the apartheid era in which he fought to train and work, and of the inequality of South Africa today.View image in fullscreenWith her husband, Marius Iepure, at the London Coliseum in 2020.Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty ImagesHer parents weren’t wealthy by white South African standards, but their education meant they were in situations – in schools, or invited to social gatherings – where they would often be the only Black family. Mabuse remembers just joining in with the other children, but “you can feel that something is going on with the adults in the room. My dad wanted us to be in these spaces because he wanted to let us know, as three young girls, that we belong in South Africa, in all spaces, and all spaces are free. So we grew up with this mentality of, ‘Of course I’m here – why wouldn’t I be?’ But also being used to being the only Black person in that space and having to be confident.”As an adult, she says, “I think I’m comfortable in spaces where people don’t look like me.” Both she and Motsi later moved to Germany to dance.Mabuse was three when Nelson Mandela became president. She says she didn’t grow up with a feeling of pressure that she had to make the most of her dreams because the older women in her family weren’t able to. That might have been the case for Motsi, who is 10 years older, she says. But watching Motsi pursue her love of dance was inspirational, and fuelled Mabuse’s determination and the entrepreneurialism she thinks her own generation identified with. “Create your own businesses, your own opportunities, your own dance schools, your own dance competitions. It was, just, think of other ways. We were let free.”View image in fullscreenMabuse backstage in Birmingham for Strictly Come Dancing dress rehearsals in 2017.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianMabuse’s parents, though, were not too pleased when she abandoned her engineering degree to dance professionally. When Mabuse’s mother saw her in the Australian jungle in last year’s I’m aCelebrity, “she was like, ‘Did you train as an engineer to do this?’” Mabuse laughs. “And then at the end, she was like, ‘I’m proud of you. You’ve done so well.’”Mabuse loved dance, but it was tough. In ballroom, the people who were winning the competitions and getting to compete abroad, she says, “were not of African descent, so they did not have the hips, the belly, the bums and the curves. What we saw was people who didn’t look like us, but had a certain shape, and they were doing well.” It was something she had been aware of, at first subconsciously, since she was four. “Every dancer will tell you that they have such a bad relationship with their body and how they see themselves.”If you’re African and you’re tiny, people think there’s something wrong with youThe people she looked up to, “the people who win, they look this way, this size, this hair. And when you sign contracts as a professional dancer, whether you’re dancing in a theatre or on a [cruise] ship, you get weighed. You get told that if you look a certain way, you dance better. If you weigh a certain amount, you’re not heavy to lift. No one ever told me I was fat – everyone was like, ‘You’re amazing’ – but I didn’t believe that. I think that came from my own insecurity, and growing up and seeing people being smaller than me.”‘I come from a country of strong women’: Oti Mabuse on fame, family, Strictly – and that sambaRead moreHer mother made her eat, she says. “You grow up in this dance world where you need to look a certain way, but if you’re African and you’re tiny, people think there’s something wrong with you. My mom was like, ‘I’m not going to be going to the family meeting and have people think there’s something wrong with my child.’ So we ate – and I love food.” But she tried to stay slim with a lot of training, and “stupid yo-yo diets”. She remembers training while wearing special plastic trousers, in the belief she could sweat herself smaller. “Now, when I look back at it, I’m just like, that was crazy.”Mabuse only really started being kinder to herself since the birth of her daughter. “I had to relearn that relationship [with my body], because she watches and hears everything that I say. She’s going to hear that and talk about her body that way. I’m still learning, and I’m still trying to get to a point where I look at myself and I go, ‘Good girl! You’ve done really well, you’re amazing.’”View image in fullscreen‘Strictly brought me to that audience that had never seen anyone who looked like me’ … Mabuse and Bill Bailey in 2020.Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PASurely Mabuse – twice Strictly champion, inspirer of generations of children, speaker of six languages and (almost) an engineering graduate – deserves to say that to herself every day? “I think everyone deserves to say that. I wonder, why don’t we as women? Then, if you do think that you’re amazing, it’s like, oh my gosh, you think so highly of yourself. You’re seen as overconfident or egoistic.”Mabuse became South African dance champion eight times, and after moving in 2012 to Germany, where ballroom is taken seriously, and looking for a new dance partner, she met Iepure and they married in 2014. The following year, Mabuse appeared on the German version of Strictly, and on the UK original. She won in 2019 with actor Kelvin Fletcher, and again the following year with comedian Bill Bailey. Mabuse’s energy, joy and work ethic made her a fan favourite (she left after the 2021 series, and I don’t think it’s been the same without her). She says early on that many women told her, “‘If I had seen a woman like you, who was your colour or had your [body] or your hair, I probably would have never stopped dancing.’ I think Strictly brought me to that audience that had never seen anyone who looked like me. People felt OK in being themselves, because they saw that.”She realised, she says, that on such a mainstream show, “I represent not just women, or Black women, I represent African women, and I represent African women who come over from Africa to Europe.”View image in fullscreenWith Iepure and their new baby in 2023.Photograph: Oti MabuseShe loved her time on the show – she still works behind the scenes on choreography for it – but over the past year, Strictly has been rocked by allegations of bullying. Although she doesn’t know about the individual dancers involved, she says that if there is pressure on the pros, it’s not created by the producers. “It’s something that comes from us, and that’s something that we have to own up to.”In her experience, Mabuse says, she was reminded that it was ultimately an entertainment show “and your job is to give joy to people. Anything else, I think would be a personal desire, and how you work is how you work, and also how you’ve been brought up.”Mabuse certainly put pressure on herself. Last year, she told the podcastWe Need to Talkthat at one point in one series, when she was paired with a celebrity who “I just couldn’t get to love the job as much as I wanted,” her husband found her on the floor of the shower, fully clothed, in tears because of the stress.She always wanted to do well on Strictly, she says. “I had a lot on my shoulders, like I said. I don’t just represent myself – I stand for something as well, in terms of who is watching me and what it implies.” She wouldn’t have taken her dance partners to the finals without motivating herself to put the work in. “I needed the, ‘Oti, maybe you’re not pushing yourself hard enough. You’ve got to push yourself a little harder.’ When I pushed myself the hardest, I won twice.”Dance has given her everything – a life, a family. It makes her happy. “It’s a dopamine hit, it takes away the negative feelings, any frustrations that you’re feeling.” In the moment when she’s dancing, whether in a studio or on stage, with her husband or working out a little TikTok routine, “anything that is wrong with the world does not exist”.Oti Mabuse – Viva Carnival UK tour starts on 12 JuneExplore more on these topicsThe G2 interviewOti MabuseDanceBody imageEntertainment TVWomenStrictly Come DancinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

But, writes theauthor of an acclaimed new book, fresh discoveries challenge this view of the artist – and even show him as a heroSue PrideauxMon 17 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 06.16 EDTShareIn 2019, the National Gallery held an exhibition of Paul Gauguin’s portraits that provoked uproar. Was Gauguin not a French colonialist who spread syphilis to underage girls throughout the islands of the South Seas? The London show was caught in the crosshairs of cancel culture and there were calls for his paintings to be burned.I have always loved Gauguin’s pictures. Having just writtenI Am Dynamite!,a biography of controversial philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche,and feeling a strong sympathy with #MeToo, I couldn’t live in the dishonest and hypocritical position of loving the paintings and hating the man. I embarked on research.My purpose was simply to discover the facts so I could measure my feelings against the truth. But my research turned up so many new sides to the story that this private project turned into a book, which I titled Wild Thing, as that is what Gauguin called himself. His first seven years were spent in Peru, but they ended when he was brought back toFranceto go to school. He hated it: fitting in was never Gauguin’s forte. He put up his fists and snarled: “I am a wild thing from Peru.” Schoolmates quailed.He discovered a law that helped get island children out of having to attend French Catholic boarding schoolDid he have syphilis? Gauguin, who died in 1903 at the age of 54, spent his last three years on the tiny island of Hiva Oa inFrench Polynesia. In 2000, its mayor decided to restore his hut on its original site in time for the centenary of the artist’s death. Excavations discovered a glass jar containing four human teeth. Examined by the Human Genome Project in Cambridge, they proved to be Gauguin’s. Further tests were carried out for cadmium, mercury and arsenic – standard treatments for syphilis at the time. No trace was found. This was written up in the scientific journal Anthropology in 2018.But I wanted to know more. Syphilis was widespread in the islands in Gauguin’s time. I discovered that his doctor in Tahiti, the largest of the French Polynesian islands, knew the disease well and concluded that the painter did not have syphilis, but rather eczema and erysipelas, aggravated by infected bites of theSimulium buissonifly. The two doctors who later treated him on Hiva Oa were of the same opinion.View image in fullscreenIn the crosshairs of cancel culture … Gauguin in the mid-1880s.Photograph: adoc-photos/Corbis/Getty ImagesNext, the question of underage girls. The age of consent in France and the colonies was 13. This was not untypical of the world at the time. In the US, it varied between 10 and 12. As I finished the book in 2023, Japan raised the age from 13 to 16. These facts horrify and disgust me. However, within the context of the time, Gauguin’s Polynesian lovers were without exception “of age”. Revolting as it is, he was doing nothing illegal or even unusual for that time.Gauguin had three serious relationships. Tehamana, the best known partner, had been supposed to be 13 but a recently discovered birth certificate shows her to have been 15. Within these relationships, Gauguin followed local custom. Sexually experienced girls were offered by their families. No money changed hands. After a couple of weeks, the girl went home to her family for a period, to decide if she then wanted to go back to her new husband. Tehamana returned to Gauguin. There was no coercion. She, like Gauguin’s later lovers, was free to come and go, to return home for good if she liked, and to take other lovers.There was no financial advantage in staying: Gauguin in his beach hut was no richer than the average villager. When he went back to Paris for a couple of years to sell his paintings, Tehamana remarried. On his return, she went to live with him for a couple of weeks for old times’ sake. It argues affection.Wild Thing is the first full biography of Gauguin for 30 years. It has been shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford prize and won the Duff Cooper award.I feel particularly proud to be on the longlist of the Women’s prize for nonfiction, too. Let’s face it, given Gauguin’s historic reputation, it would have been much easier for them to leave it off.The book is based on the discovery of much new information: not only the teeth and Tehamana’s birth certificate, but also a crucial new literary source that emerged as I started writing. In 2020, the manuscript of Gauguin’s most important written work – Avant et Après, or Before and After – reappeared. Missing for a century,it contains 200 handwritten pages of Gauguin’s thoughts on life, art, religion and everything. Then, a year later, the Catalogue Raisonné was completed. This is like the official bible of the artist, gathering every bit of information on all the verified works.I discovered a great-great-granddaughter, too, with family stories, papers and letters. Gauguin had a Danish wife and a son who lived in Norway. There are letters in both languages and a lengthy untranslated family memoir by the son. Norwegian is my mother tongue and I can read Danish, too. One of the most surprising things I discovered was Gauguin’s strong belief in equality between the sexes. His grandmother, Flora Tristan, was a fierce fighter for women’s rights and much admired by Karl Marx. Gauguin cherished her published writings. He actively encouraged the women in his circle, including his wife, to find fulfilment through independence.View image in fullscreenControversial … Manao Tupapau, or Spirit of the Dead Watching.Photograph: SJArt/AlamyThis sheds new light on Gauguin’s complex relationship with Tehamana, who appears in several paintings. Tehamana Has Many Parents, completed in 1893, is a portrait of an individual, but also a portrait of a culture in flux. Tehamana wears a missionary dress but carries a Polynesian fan. On a wall behind her, a line of mysterious hieroglyphs reference the ancient island culture, much of which was destroyed by missionaries. Below them stands Hina, the Polynesian goddess of the moon and creation. Gauguin shows Tehamana as a synthesis of many cultures and many bloodlines, as Gauguin believed we all are.But Manao Tupapau, or Spirit of the Dead Watching, is the picture that has done greatest damage to Gauguin’s reputation. I can easily see why. The 1892 painting, showing Tehamana naked and face down on a bed, can be seen as misogynistic, exploitative and colonialist. But there are other ways of viewing it, which suggest a more sympathetic, caring Gauguin.For Tehamana, as for most Polynesians, Christianity was a veneer – she believed intupapau,malign spirits who stole your spirit in the dark. For that reason, she always kept an oil lamp burning in their hut. One evening, the lamp had gone out and Gauguin found her terrified by the dark. He embodies her fear in the figure of the old woman, symbolising thetupapau, standing at the foot of the bed for our benefit. But what he wanted to capture, he said, was Tehamana’s terror of the unseen.When Gauguin sent the picture back to his wife, Mette, to exhibit and sell in Denmark, she was not offended by it. Rather, she thought it “wonderful”. Mette herself was also frightened of the dark, always keeping a lamp burning.Gauguin believed in cultural synthesis, which today is often condemned as cultural appropriation. He saw the human race as a great synthesis of race, creed and colour. One of the first pictures he painted in Tahiti wasIa Orana Maria, or Hail Mary. This 1891 workdepicts a Polynesian Mary carrying the Polynesian Christ Child on her shoulder. Exhibited in Paris, the picture caused a scandal. A non-white holy family! It was not until 1951 that a papal encyclical made it permissible to represent such a thing.View image in fullscreenA non-white holy family … Ia Orana Maria, or Hail Mary.Photograph: Antiquarian Images/AlamyHorrified by Tahiti’s oppressive and exploitative French colonial regime, Gauguin took up political journalism. He wrote articles for a local newspaper and later started his own paper exposing the corruption and injustice of French officials. He also wrote to the government in Paris pleading for fairer taxation and treatment. Tahiti’s governor brought a libel suit against him but there wasn’t a chance Gauguin would get justice in the corrupt French colonial court, so he fled 500 miles to Hiva Oa, also a French colony. On arrival, he was surprised to be mobbed like a celebrity – not, he discovered, for his painting, but for his journalism.Hiva Oa was run by Bishop Martin, a fearsome puritan who had forbidden nudity, polyandry, the sacred art of tattooing, and any performance of the erotic Upa Upa dance. Bishop Martin compelled all Indigenous children to attend French Catholic boarding school until the age of 14. They were taught the French curriculum and allowed to speak only French, the aim being to erase the Polynesian language, culture, family structure and national identity in one generation.The children’s families were distraught. But Gauguin discovered a minor French law stating that only children living within two milesof a school need attend it. Mass relocation to the countryside ensued. Language, culture and family unity survived on the island and Gauguin became more popular than ever. He was asked to exchange names. When you did this, it was believed, you exchanged souls and had all your property in common, including wives. It was the greatest honour you could confer, the equivalent of becoming a blood brother.On Hiva Oa, Gauguin continued to petition Paris for fairer treatment of Indigenous people and to act as their lawyer in the local court. The Polynesians loved him, the French hated him. The governor reported back to Paris that Gauguin was “a defender of native vices. A subverter of the rule of law and a dangerous anarchist.”He was a marked man. When he accused a gendarme on a nearby island of accepting bribes, the governor responded with a charge of libel. The case was heard by the local French magistrate and Gauguin was found guilty, fined 500 francs and sentenced to three months in prison. Barely a year later, the case would be re-examined and Gauguin’s accusations found to be correct. But by that time, the artist was dead.Wild Thing was driven by all the new material that began appearing in 2019, which coincided with the reopening of the debate about Gauguin’s troubling reputation. It seemed important to re-examine his life: not to condemn, not to excuse, but simply to shed new light on the man and the myth.Wild Thing by Sue Prideaux (Faber & Faber, £30).

But the program is heavily reliant on logistical support from the US Agency for International Development (USAid), which has seen most of its projects killed off.Evangelical groups, many of which backed Trump’s election because of abortion policy, say delivery of anti-retroviral medicines (ARVs) funded by the US has all but ground to a halt in some countries, particularly inAfrica. They warn that could lead to a resurgence of Aids in parts of the world where it has been brought under control, costing millions of lives.US shutdown of HIV/Aids funding ‘could lead to 500,000 deaths in South Africa’Read moreBut other evangelical organizations and churches have been accused of staying silent in defense of what has been described as one of the most successful foreign aid programs in US history for political reasons because so many of their members support Trump.Emily Chambers Sharpe, health director at World Relief, the humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, said that healthcare centers and hospitals in different parts of Africa report that “the supply chain for HIV as a whole has been very badly damaged” by the aid cuts.“When Pepfar was up for reauthorization we, as World Relief, have supported it every time. We see it as really overarchingly a pro-life program in that it promotes the life-saving need for HIV treatment, which many of us in the field have called The Lazarus Effect,” she said.“When you get someone on antiretroviral therapy, you see them literally be able to come back to life. And now we know if you’re on antiretroviral therapy, you can even prevent the spread of the virus to others so it’s not just life-saving for you, it can be life-saving for loads of other people.”Chambers Sharpe criticised what she called a “lack of transparency” within the state department about cuts toUSAidand its impact on Pepfar.Galen Carey, vice-president of government relations at the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE), which has backed some of Trump’s policies while also criticizing its harsh treatment of refugees as unChristian, called on the administration to save Pepfar before it is too late.“We’re encouraging the administration to get the program back up to full speed as soon as possible,” he said.Carey said “there’s quite a bit of concern in Congress because Pepfar has been a very popular bipartisan program” but he added that it has been caught up in the broader assault on foreign aid.About 20 million people are reliant on medicines supplied by Pepfar mostly in Africa and parts of Asia. Some countries, such as Nigeria, depend on Pepfar for almost all their HIV funding. Others are less reliant but Pepfar still provides crucial health infrastructure because its clinics frequently employ medical staff who treat other conditions as part of the broader programme of combatting Aids.Matthew Loftus, a doctor and evangelical Christian working at a mission hospital in Kenya, said the damage was already being done on the ground. He said that Pepfar “is being dismantled” and that “many people will die” as a result.‘Disruptive, unfair and cruel’: jobs lost and treatment stopped as USAid freeze hits HIV care in ZimbabweRead more“In some places they’re not getting the drugs or they’re being asked to pay cash for the drugs. Other places are completely closed and so patients are scrambling to find medications or they’re going without,” he said.“There are going to be consequences. Once you stop taking ARVs, within days the virus can come back online and then start developing resistance. I’m really scared that there are going to be a bunch of people who haven’t been taking their drugs and then, when we try to start them back, we’re going to find that they’re resistant. They could turn everything back on tomorrow and I think there would be permanent damage. Once you fire people and close clinics, rebuilding trust is difficult, getting people to come back is difficult.”Evangelical Christian groups were instrumental in persuading President George W Bush to launch Pepfar in 2004. Carey said churches saw it not only as a pro-life position but an opportunity to promote their values.“When I first went to Africa in 1997, an HIV-positive diagnosis was basically a death sentence. It was devastating. Many pastors spent much of their time conducting funerals. Driving along main roads in Kenya you would see shop after shop selling coffins,” he said.“Over time, it really turned around in a dramatic way. The stories that came out of caring for orphans and helping local churches and promoting Christian understanding of sexual morality and faithfulness in marriage was an important piece of the puzzle since a lot of the transmission was through sexual contact. It fitted in with our broader concerns, both pro-life and pro-family.”A change of heart by the acerbic segregationist senator, Jesse Helms, brought on a lot of conservative support by shifting the US narrative around Aids away from sexual morality.In 2003, the rock star Bono told Helms that Aids had created 10 million orphans in Africa and that the lives of newborn babies could be saved by a single dose of a medicine that limited the transmission of HIV from mother to child. Helms was persuaded that Aids relief was a pro-life position and opened the door to congressional support for Pepfar.Loftus has seen the impact of the programme on the ground in Kenya.View image in fullscreenA child sits as a nurse prepares to dispense antiretroviral drugs at the Nyumbani Children’s Home, in Nairobi, Kenya, which is supported by Pepfar.Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/Reuters“Most HIV-positive patients I see are patients whose viral load is completely suppressed and they are coming to the hospital for a different problem. When I do see someone who dies of HIV-related illness, it’s just another tragedy because now it’s completely preventable,” he said.“I hear stories from older missionaries. They talk about wards full of people with Aids, dying all the time. That’s part of the fear looking ahead. If these programmes don’t survive, what are we going to go back to?”The call to save Pepfar has been joined by a range of religious groups, including the National Latino Evangelical Coalition. But Loftus said that, as an evangelical, he was concerned that many churches are not speaking up in support of the initiative, even though they have in the past, because it would mean criticising Trump.“People I talk to are aggrieved about this. It is challenging the way that churches follow political trends rather than the other way around,” he said.“Some churches are not as eager to put their necks out and advocate for something that seems to be opposed by some of the people in power. I think churches and Christians who are politically active are not aware of what’s at stake, and many of them are probably consuming news in an environment that isn’t even bringing it up as an issue. But I think also that there is this conflict now between our convictions versus who’s in charge and who do we want to please?”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationAids and HIVUSAidUS politicsChristianityReligionAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But it doesn’t come down to feasibility when it’s about human beings and bringing these people home,” Cambria Harris, Morgan’s daughter, said at the time. After meeting with former prime ministerJustin Trudeau, she was blunt: “I told him these women need to be found, and they need to come home.The province’s former Progressive Conservative premier Heather Stefanson nonetheless defended the decision not to search the landfill in 2023.“My heart goes out to the families. It’s a horrific situation that they’re facing right now, but I’m also the premier and we have to make what are difficult decisions,” she said. “These are decisions that need to be made, and I continue to stand by the decision that has been made.”She and others in her government said the search was too costly and too hazardous – a conclusion other experts rejected.At the time, Federal Crown-Indigenous Relations minister Marc Miller called the decision “heartless” and said a search was necessary.View image in fullscreenCamp Marcedes set up in front of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in downtown Winnipeg, Canada, on 27 September 2023.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesA search of the landfill became central to a provincial election in 2023, in which New Democratic party leader Wab Kinew campaigned on a search of the landfill. Kinew’s party won a majority government and last year, the federal governmentpledged C$40mto search for the victims.When the positive identification of Harris’s remains were first announced, Kinew praised the family members as “having been the people who called us to our better nature and to do the right thing”.Canadian police identify remains of murdered Indigenous woman at landfillRead moreExcavation began at the privately run landfill in December, with teams sorting through early 20,300 cubic metres of material with rakes and by hand.An enormous steel heated building was also constructed to allow teams to sift though wet material by hand while outside temperatures hovered at about -20C.Of the 45 search technicians hired, including family liaisons, a forensic anthropologist, a health and safety officer, and a director of operations, half are Indigenous.Kinew said: “The effort itself is a microcosm of where we’re at as a country … people from different walks of life coming together to try to do the right thing for these families.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaIndigenous peoplesJustin TrudeauAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Carney spoke in French and English, and said it was important forCanadato strengthen ties with “reliable allies”.“I want to ensure that France and the whole of Europe work enthusiastically with Canada, the most European of non-European countries, determined like you to maintain the most positive possible relations with the United States,” he said.View image in fullscreenCarney and Macron embrace at the Élysée Palace on Monday.Photograph: Maya Vidon-White/UPI/Rex/ShutterstockA senior Canadian government official who briefed reporters on Carney’s plane said the purpose of the trip was to strengthen partnerships with Canada’s two founding countries. The official said Canada was a “good friend of the United States but we all know what is going on”.Carney, who turned 60 on Sunday, travelled later on Monday to London where he was received at Buckingham Palace by King Charles, Canada’s head of state. After a 30-minute private conversation with the king, he was greeted warmly byKeir Starmeron the doorstep of No 10.The UK prime minister said: “The relationship between our two countries has always been strong. Two sovereign allies, so much in common – a shared history, shared values, shared king.”Carney said the relationship between the two countries was “built on shared values” and that “we’re at a point in history where the world is being reordered”.The trip to London is something of a homecoming for Carney as a former governor of the Bank of England, the first non-citizen to be named to the role in its more than 300 years.View image in fullscreenMark Carney and his wife, Diana Fox Carney, visit Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.Photograph: Sean Kilpatrick/ReutersThe former economist is deliberately making his first foreign trip to the capital cities of the two countries that shaped Canada’s early existence. At his swearing-in ceremony on Friday, he noted the country was built on the bedrock of three peoples: Indigenous, French and British.He said Canada was fundamentally different from the US and would “never, ever, in any way shape or form, be part of the United States”.Carney also noted the US, France, UK and Canada are members of Nato and it would be “unthinkable” for the US to annex Canada through military means.Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, said: “The Trump factor is the reason for the trip. The Trump factor towers over everything else Carney must deal with.”On his trip home from Europe, Carney will travel to the edge of Canada’s Arctic to “reaffirm Canada’s Arctic security and sovereignty” before returning to Ottawa, where he is expected to call an election within days.Carney said he did not plan to visit Washington at the moment but hoped to have a phone call with the president soon.He added that Trump must stop making “disrespectful” comments about Canada before the two countries can start serious talks about future ties.2:05New prime minister says Canada will 'never be part of the US' – videoSweeping tariffs of 25% and Trump’stalk of making Canada the 51st US statehave infuriated Canadians, and many are avoiding buying American goods. Carney’s government is reviewing the purchase of US-made F-35 fighter jets in light of Trump’s trade war.The governing Liberal party had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared economic war. Now the party and its new leader, Carney, could come out on top.Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, said Carney was wise not to visit Trump. “There’s no point in going to Washington,” Bothwell said. “As [the former prime minister Justin] Trudeau’s treatment shows, all that results in is a crude attempt by Trump to humiliate his guests.”Bothwell said Trump demanded respect, “but it’s often a one-way street, asking others to set aside their self-respect to bend to his will”.Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said it was absolutely essential Canada diversified amid the trade war with the US. More than 75% of Canada’s exports go to the US.Béland said Arctic sovereignty was also a key issue for Canada. He said: “President Trump’s aggressive talk about both Canada and Greenland and the apparent rapprochement between Russia, a strong Arctic power, and the United States under Trump have increased anxieties about our control over this remote yet highly strategic region.”A No 10 spokesperson said Starmer “underlined that the UK and Canada are the closest of sovereign allies and friends” during their meeting.Carney praised Starmer’s “leadership on Ukraine”, they added, and the two leaders agreed to work together “to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position to see a just and lasting peace”.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyAmericasKeir StarmerForeign policyDonald TrumpInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The president quietly invoked the law on Friday and progressive groups almost immediately sued to stop it.On Saturday, during a court hearing over the case, Boasberg added averbal orderthat any flights that had already departed with Venezuelan immigrants using the Alien Enemies Act turn around and return to the US.Brown University professor deported despite judge’s order, defying US courtRead more“This is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately,” he told the justice department, according to theWashington Post.At that point (about 6.51pm ET, according toAxios), both flights were off the Yucatán peninsula, according to flight pathsposted on X.Later on Saturday night, however, El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele,confirmedthat the planes had landed in his country and the alleged gang members were in custody, posting on social media,“Oopsie … too late”above a news article about the judge’s order to turn the planes around.White House officials insisted that the migrants were no longer in US territory when the judge issued his order, claiming that it therefore did not apply.The administration “did not ‘refuse to comply’ with a court order”,saidthe White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, in a statement on Monday.She also argued, however, that the order itself did not need to be followed in the first place.“The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA aliens had already been removed from US territory,” Leavitt said. “The written order and the administration’s actions do not conflict.“As the supreme court has repeatedly made clear – federal courts generally have no jurisdiction over the president’s conduct of foreign affairs, his authorities under the Alien Enemies Act, and his core Article II powers to remove foreign alien terrorists from US soil and repel a declared invasion.“A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrying foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from US soil.”Other Trump administration officials, who have not been named, echoed similar statements toAxiosabout the ruling coming too late, claiming that the administration did not defy the judge as the planes were “already outside of US airspace” and therefore arguing that the order was “not applicable”.In a court filing on Monday, lawyers for the administration said that the judge’s oral order was “not enforceable”.ABC Newsalso reported that the administration cited “operational” and “national security” reasons that the planes needed to land, and that the two planes took off during the hearing on Saturday.When asked by a reporter on Sunday whether the administration violated the judge’s orders, Donald Trumpsaid: “I don’t know, you have to speak to the lawyers about that.” He added: “I can tell you this, these were bad people.”Reutersreported that the Trump administration stated in a court filing on Sunday that “some” of the Venezuelans had already been removed from the US before the judge’s order, but did not provide any further details.TheNew York Timesnoted that the filing implied that the government had other legal grounds for the deportations of the Venezuelans, other than the use of the Alien Enemies Act that was blocked by the judge.The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, which sued to stop the use of the act, added in a court filing on Monday that they believe that the governmentviolated the court order , calling the administration’s actionsa “blatant violation of the court’s order”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t care.”He repeated his claim that the flight was “already in international waters” but also questioned why the judge would want “terrorists returned to the United States”: “Look, President Trump, by proclamation, invoked the authorities of the Alien Enemies Act, which he has a right to do, and it’s a gamechanger.”The Georgetown law professor Steve Vladeckcriticisedthe administration’s argument that it was too late to act once the planes had left the US. He argued on social media that “a federal court’s jurisdiction does not stop at the water’s edge” but rather, “the question is whether the defendants are subject to the court order, not where the conduct being challenged takes place”.Vladeck also told theAssociated Pressthat although the judge’s verbal directive to turn around the planes was not technically part of his final written order, nevertheless the Trump administration clearly violated the “spirit” of it.Peter Markowitz, a Cardozo Law School professor and immigration enforcement expert,told Reutersthat he believed the Trump administration’s actions “most certainly violate” the court’s order.Alien Enemies Act: what is it and can Trump use it to deport gang members?Read moreIn a statement on Monday, the Democratic senators Alex Padilla, Cory Booker, Dick Durbin and Peter Welch condemned Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.“Let’s be clear: we are not at war, and immigrants are not invading our country,” they said. “Furthermore, courts determine whether people have broken the law – not a president acting alone, and not immigration agents picking and choosing who gets imprisoned or deported.”The deportations may not be the only instance of the White House directly violating a court order, afterthe administration reportedly deported Dr Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist and Brown University professor, despite a court order temporarily blocking her expulsion.Citing her attorney and court documents, the New York Times reported that the 34-year-old Lebanese citizen – who had a valid US visa – was detained on Thursday upon returning to the US after visiting family in Lebanon. A federal judge had reportedly ordered the government to provide the court with 48 hours’ notice before deporting Alawieh, but she was reportedly put on a flight to Paris anyway. A hearing in her case is set for Monday.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsVenezuelaEl SalvadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The announcement came after data revealed consumer prices had dropped into deflation last month for the first time in a year.The fresh measures lifted many Asia-Pacific stock markets on Monday, and stocks in South Korea, Hong Kong and Australia closed higher. Mainland Chinese investors, however, were less enthusiastic, and the blue-chip CSI 300 closed 0.2% down.The plan came amid mixed domestic economic data from Beijing, as reports showed retail spending was up compared with last year, but unemployment had hit its highest level in two years and house prices had fallen in almost all medium and large cities.“In the first two months, with the sustained effects of macro policies, the national economy maintained the new and positive development,” the national bureau of statistics said, but it added that domestic effective demand was weak.“The foundation for sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough,” it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They would bolster the defences of the strategically important Okinawa island chain and are part of Japan’s development of “counterstrike capabilities” in the event it is attacked, according to reports from Kyodo News agency, citing government sources.Deployment of long-range missiles on the Okinawa islands, which stretch to within 110km of Taiwan, is unlikely to happen, to avoid provokingChina. The islands already house a number of missiles batteries with shorter ranges.“As the threat from the China and North Korea has been mounting, it is natural forJapanto counter this with more effective weapons systems,” said Yoichi Shimada, professor emeritus at Fukui Prefectural University. “I think Japan should rapidly take measures such as the deployment of longer-range missiles to develop more robust security.”On 6 March, the US president,Donald Trump, complained that the Japan-US security treaty was nonreciprocal: “We have a great relationship with Japan, but we have an interesting deal with Japan that we have to protect them, but they don’t have to protect us,” adding, “That’s the way the deal reads … and by the way, they make a fortune with us economically. I actually ask who makes these deals?”The treaty was first signed in 1951, when Japan was still occupied by US forces. Japan’s ability to take military action is restricted by the pacifist article 9 of its constitution, which was effectively imposed on it by Washington after the second world war.Shimada believes that “proactive measures” such as boosting its missile systems will strengthen US-Japan ties, and that “demands from the Trump administration for reciprocal defence arrangements with Japan are not so unreasonable”.However, Trump’s pronouncements on allies and fellow Nato members, including Canada and Denmark, have some in Japan concerned about his administration’s commitment to honouring longstanding treaties, according to Robert Dujarric of Temple University in Tokyo.“It is clear to anyone who is watching this carefully that the US-Japan alliance is in bad shape,” said Dujarric. “Even if China attacked Japan, there is no guarantee that the US under Trump would do anything. That is a big problem.”Two ground self-defense force (GSDF) bases are being considered for the new missiles, Camp Yufuin in Oita, and Camp Kengun in Kumamoto, both on Kyushu and already home to missile batteries. The new weapon systems are reported to be upgraded versions of the GSDF’s Type-12 land-to-ship guided missiles.“This is just one part of a gradual increase in Japanese military capacity,” said Dujarric, who believes the country “needs to rethink its security policy” in light of the shifting geopolitical landscape.Despite having been largely taboo in the 80 years since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, if Japan feels it can no longer rely on US military support, that would “spark debate as to whether to acquire nuclear weapons”, suggested Dujarric.Explore more on these topicsJapanTrump administrationDonald TrumpAsia PacificNorth KoreaChinaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a much needed win for the international criminal court – but success is far from a givenNimo OmerMon 17 Mar 2025 02.35 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 02.44 EDTShareGood morning.Last Tuesday, chaos erupted at Manila’s main airport as authorities arrested the Philippines’ 79-year-old former presidentRodrigo Duterte, who had arrived from Hong Kong. An arrest warrant issued in secret by the international criminal court (ICC) accused him of crimes against humanity for his alleged involvement in killings during his brutal “war on drugs”.During a tense 12-hour standoff, Duterte told officers: “You have to kill me to bring me to The Hague.” But by the end of it, he was on a plane bound for the Netherlands. Seemingly on board that flight,Duterte filmed a videowhere he said he would accept responsibility for the “war on drugs … Whatever happened in the past, I will be the front of our law enforcement and the military. I said this already, that I will protect you, and I will be responsible for everything,” he said. His family has claimed he was “kidnapped”.On Friday, a judge set 23 September as the date of a pre-trial hearing to establish whether or not the prosecution’s evidence is strong enough to send the case to trial. If a trial does go ahead, which could take years to complete, and he is eventually convicted, Duterte faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.Only a few years ago, bringing Duterte to justice seemed a distant prospect. I spoke with the Guardian’sinvestigations correspondent Harry Daviesabout how Duterte ended up on that plane, what this arrest means for the ICC, and what happens next. That’s right after the headlines.Five big storiesBenefits| Keir Starmer is to defy growing anger bydriving through welfare cuts for some of the UK’s most severely disabled people, with an overhaul that could see more than 600,000 benefit claimants lose out on an average of £675 a month.Ukraine| Donald Trump has said he plans todiscuss ending the war in Ukraine with Vladimir Putinon Tuesday and that negotiators have already discussed “dividing up certain assets”. “We will be talking about land.

During a campaign speech in 2016, he told a crowd: “All of you who are into drugs, you sons of bitches, I will really kill you … I have no patience, I have no middle ground.”The ICC estimates that tens of thousands of people were killed in connection with Duterte’s anti-drugs campaign. The primary victims of his violent policy were poor men living in urban areas, while innocent bystanders were dismissed as “collateral damage”. There was no mistaking his goals and the means through which he was willing to get there. A few months after taking office in 2016,Duterte likened himself to Hitler, using the Holocaust as an analogy for his crackdown, declaring that he would be happy to slaughter millions of drug addicts.Despite the numerous allegations against him, the ICC’s case remains relatively narrow. It holds Duterte criminally responsible for the murders ofat least 43 peoplebetween 2011 and 2019 linked to his war on drugs.Duterte’s legacyBefore becoming president, Duterte served as deputy mayor and then mayor of Davao, a city island, across about 20 years. AsKate Lamb highlights in her comprehensiveprofile of the former president, it was in Davao during the 1980s that the earliest version of Duterte’s war on drugs took shape: “Dead bodies regularly turned up on the streets.” Last year, Duterte admitted that he had a “death squad” to crack down on crime during his time as mayor.His promise to replicate Davao’s brutal anti-drug crackdown on a national scale propelled him to the presidency in 2016. Yet, despite his bold claims, at the time of his electionDavao still had the highest murder rate in the countryand the second-highest number of rapes, according to national police data.Over the six years after his election, up to30,000 people are estimated to have been killed, including innocent bystanders, in what Human Rights Watch described as a “campaign of extrajudicial execution in impoverished areas of Manila and other urban centres”. Officers were granted immunity from prosecution for deaths occurring in their custody, and victims’ bodies were often discarded in rivers, grasslands, and rubbish dumps.Why now?Despite widespread condemnation of Duterte’s violent authoritarian crackdowns, his arrest was triggered by internal political squabbles. The former president had expected protection from his successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who initially pledged to shield him from international scrutiny. Marcos, the son of former dictator Ferdinand E Marcos, won the presidency in a landslide with Duterte’s daughter, Sara Duterte, as his vice-president.Their fragile alliance, widely seen as a marriage of convenience, collapsed in spectacular fashion. Sara Duterte declared she wanted to “cut off his head” last year and even threatened to exhume his father’s body and throw it into the ocean. In February, allies of Marcos impeached her. The two political dynasties have since been at war in the lead-up to the country’s midterm elections. As their feud escalated, Marcos’s once defiant stance on the ICC – insisting it had no jurisdiction – began to shift. Eventually, he stated that thePhilippineswould cooperate with any arrest warrant issued through Interpol.Pressures facing the ICCWhile the recent developments may appear swift, the case against Duterte has been meticulously constructed over seven years. In 2018, the ICC initiated a preliminary inquiry into allegations of crimes against humanity committed by Duterte. This escalated to a full criminal investigation in 2021. In response, Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the ICC.His arrest holds symbolic significance for the embattled court because it “has been able to demonstrate that it can continue its work and fulfil its mandate while it is under significant pressure from various directions”, Harry says. Donald Trump has imposed aggressive economic sanctions on the ICC and travel bans on its staff and the chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, is facing an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denies.Khan, despite issuing high-profile arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu, Vladimir Putin, and the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, has so far struggled to secure their arrests. There is pressure on Khan to deliver – and the Duterte case may help. However, Harry adds that it is important to remember “this process began under his predecessor and there is a team of people who’ve been working on this for years, so this is not a case of a singular victory for him – it’s not as straightforward or simple as that”.The significance of Duterte’s arrestFor the victims of Duterte’s actions, this is a significant moment. The former president’s brazen admissions of various crimes fostered the impression that he was untouchable – but now, he sits in The Hague, awaiting trial.“This also helps make the court and its mission feel less theoretical,” Harry adds. “Within days of securing the arrest warrant it acted effectively and quickly in a situation where there are a great many alleged victims, where the atrocity crimes are apparent, and I think that certainly has some symbolic value in this present moment.”Duterte’s arrest serves as a warning to other leaders: their fortunes can change and they too could find themselves on a plane to The Hague. But this is a double-edged sword, as it also underscores the ICC’s weaknesses – justice in this case hinged on the political will of an opposition leader seizing an opportunity to take down a rival.This reflects a broader issue for the ICC. Arrest warrants for figures like Putin or Netanyahu may signal the court’s resolve, but they also highlight its limitations and impotence – there is no chance of either leader being detained in the near future. Still, Duterte’s arrest is a rare moment of respite for the court during an “acute and awkward moment”, Harry says. “It’s a much-needed win for the court at the moment, but this arrest is only the first step in securing a conviction, so this is more of a provisional victory. Cases can and have fallen apart before they get to a full trial.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The British space scientist will be giving the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures this year, science correspondentNicola Davis reports, and she says while science has made giant leaps in the understanding of space, including the sheer size of the universe, there is still much to learn – not least whether humans are alone.“My answer to that, based on the numbers, is no, we can’t be,” said Aderin-Pocock. “It’s that human conceit again that we are so caught up in ourselves that we might think we’re alone.” This year’s Christmas lectures will try to riff on a “sense of wonder and exploration, and the sense that there’s so much more to discover”. As Aderin-Pocock noted, the idea that the Earth was at the centre of the universe – championed by the philosopher Aristotle – lasted for centuries before being overturned, while it was the work of Henrietta Swan Leavitt in the 19th century that gave astronomers the means to understand the scale of the universe.“And then suddenly we realised that we were so much more insignificant than we ever thought,” said Aderin-Pocock, adding that the astronomer Edwin Hubble subsequently showed the universe was expanding, while the eponymous Hubble space telescope later revealed 200bn galaxies.Sign up herefor a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every SundayBored at work?And finally, the Guardian’s puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day.

He said such a push would be targeted at people “who hate our country – who want to cause terrorist attacks”.“My argument is that if you betray your allegiance to our country in that way, you should expect to lose your citizenship,” Dutton said.“We would never grant somebody citizenship if we knew that they were going to undertake a terrorist act and somebody who signs the pledge of allegiance to our country, and then breaks it in such an overt way, or is involved in child paedophilia for argument’s sake, I believe that the community standard demands that people who don’t abide by our laws and don’t respect fellow Australians, and want to harm women and children, I just don’t think that they deserve priority.“If we want to keep ourselves safe, we need to make sure that the laws reflect the community values.”Dutton, asked why such a referendum was needed, said: “We can do as much as we can by legislation, but as they say, you can’t out-legislate the constitution.”“What we’re proposing here is a discussion about whether we’ve got adequate laws, whether the constitution is restrictive, and ultimately, what I want to do is keep our country safe and keep communities safe.”Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie on Tuesday not only backed a referendum but suggested Australia could have a constitutional convention.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, if it gets to the point where it is necessary to amend our constitution to keep Australians safe, then we believe that’s a debate our country is mature enough to have.”Dutton’s previous referendum suggestion – part ofhis opposition to constitutionally enshrining the Indigenous voicein the constitution – would have symbolically recognised Australia’s First Nations people in the document’s preamble.He pledged to hold that referendum in the first term of a Dutton government, stating in September 2023: “I believe very strongly it is the right thing to do.”But a month later, following the failure of the voice referendum, Dutton reneged on the pledge, stating: “I think it’s clear that the Australian public is probably over the referendum process for some time.”Chalmers told ABC radio on Tuesday that Dutton was seeking to “fix his mistakes” made as part of the former government. The treasurer claimed the idea was a distraction from the Coalition’s lack of genuine policy.“He quite bizarrely wants another referendum. I don’t think this idea will last long, just like a lot of the other things that he’s said in an effort to try and avoid talking about the economy and his cuts,” Chalmers said.“We’ve taken a different approach. We rewrote his broken laws to create a more robust system to keep our community safe.”Explore more on these topicsPeter DuttonLiberal partyAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He has been one of the biggest stars of the UFC, which was founded by the Trump ally Dana White.In November McGregor was ordered by an Irish civil court to pay nearly €250,000 (£210,000) in damages to a woman who said he “brutally raped and battered” her in a hotel in Dublin in 2018. McGregor claimed they had consensual sex and is appealing against the verdict with a hearing in Dublin’s high court due later this week.The fighter has said he is considering running for president in Ireland later this year, a prospect some thought would be ruled out after the civil trial verdict.He has been supported by figures including the self-styled misogynist influencerAndrew Tate and anti-immigration campaigners in Ireland whose reach has been turbocharged by Elon Musk retweets.Immigration is a hot topic in Ireland with many arrivals entering Northern Ireland on ferries or planes and crossing the invisible border on the island to enter the Republic of Ireland.The justice minister, Jim O’Callaghan, has promised to clamp down on those who are not entitled to international protection. Last month he said more than 80% of applications for asylum in January were rejected in the first instance.Explore more on these topicsConor McGregorIrelandUS politicsDonald TrumpEuropeUFCMMAnewsShareReuse this content"

More than 20 of those wounded and three of those killed were under the age of 18, according to the interior ministry.View image in fullscreenMourners grieve during a protest following a fire at the Pulse nightclub that resulted in dozens of deaths in the town of Kočani.Photograph: Marko Đurica/ReutersOn Monday, as relatives queued outside hospitals to give DNA samples as part of the grim procedure of identifying the dead, bulldozers and workers could be seen digging graves in Kočani, a town of fewer than 30,000 residents 60 miles east of the capita, Skopje. Funerals are expected later this week, once autopsies have been conducted.“I will have no mercy,” the country’s prime minister, Hristijan Mickoski, said on Sunday. “There is no person in Macedonia who is not broken and with a destroyed spirit after this.”Mickoski said preliminary investigations had revealed that the entertainment venue was operating illegally with an invalid licence obtained from the country’s economy ministry “in exchange for a bribe”.A former mayor of Kočani, Ratko Dimitrovski, had refused to issue a permit for the nightclub because it failed to meet basic safety standards.The fire broke out at about 2.30am local time (0130 GMT) when sparks from pyrotechnic devices, described variously as fireworks and flares, set the roof ablaze. Many of the victims died in the ensuing crowd crush as panic-stricken people attempted to escape.View image in fullscreenSome demonstrators damaged an establishment that was said to belong to the owner of the nightclub.Photograph: Marko Đurica/ReutersBy Monday, the scale of the security violations were laid bare by the country’s state prosecutor, Ljupco Kocevski. The building, a former carpet warehouse, had no fire alarm system, only two fire extinguishers and a ceiling made of highly flammable material.“It did not have two exit doors, but only one single improvised metal door at the back of the building, which was locked and without a handle on the inside,” Kocevski said, listing the infractions. “There was no access for fire engines from either side in accordance with the fire safety regulations. The interior of the building was lined with plasterboard, but it was not fireproof.”Local media outlets described the former warehouse as an “improvised nightclub”.Among the 20 people detained in connection with the disaster is a former economy minister, Kreshnik Bekteshi, under whose watch the club’s licence is thought to have been issued; his top aide who allegedly signed the document, officials of various state agencies and the venue’s manager.“The detainees will be questioned since there are grounds for suspicion that there is bribery and corruption linked to the fire,” the interior minister, Pance Toskovski, told reporters. “The number of people inside the club was at least double its official capacity of 250.”View image in fullscreenThe Pulse nightclub was said to have multiple safety violations.Photograph: Georgi Licovski/EPAInitial reports suggested as many as 1,500 were at the venue when the blaze broke out. On Monday as authorities stepped up inspections of nightclubs across the country, Mickoski said he had been astounded to discover that licences for only 12 cabarets had been issued last year despite the number of such venues nationwide.“The situation on this issue is shocking,” he said, while visiting some of the wounded in the Mother Teresa hospital in Skopje.The rightwing-led government, in power since last year, has declared a seven-day period of national mourning in honour of the dead. Memorial rallies have also been held.Thousands of students gathered on Monday at Skopje University in a silent protest that they have vowed to repeat daily over the course of the next week. More rallies are expected on Tuesday after a civic group called for people to rally in city centres around North Macedonia to place further pressure on the government to stop the corruption that has now cost the 1.8-million strong nation so many young lives.Explore more on these topicsNorth MacedoniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She said the outlet’s funding had been discussed at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.‘The EU wants Ukraine to win this war’: who is its new chief diplomat Kaja Kallas?Read more“Now the question for us is, can we come in with our funding to fill the void that the US is leaving? The answer to that question is … not automatically,” she said adding that the EU would “see what we can do”.The Czech Republic is leading a push for the EU to support the Prague-based media group. Ahead of the meeting, the Czech foreign minister, Jan Lipavský, said he wanted to discuss with counterparts “how to at least partially maintain its broadcasting”.“If it shuts down, it cannot be easily rebuilt,” Lipavský said.The EU was already discussing how far it could fill gaps leftby the abrupt termination of much of USAid, which goes far beyond the media group.One senior diplomat has said the EU cannot make up the shortfall and that the bloc would be most likely to support projects that matched its own short-term interests.Founded in 1950, with broadcasts to Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania a year later, RFE aimed to bring unbiased local news to audiences behind the iron curtain. In 1953 Radio Liberty began broadcasting to the Soviet Union in Russian and other local languages.According to RFE/RL, it reaches 47m people every week in 27 languages in 23 countries, with more than 1,700 staff.Responding to the decision, Polish security expert Katarzyna Pisarska said her parents had learned about the Chornobyl nuclear disaster via RFE “while the Polish communist regime continued to hide the fact that a radioactive cloud was passing over Poland”. She described the US decision as “nothing more than a gift to dictators around the world” especially the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.RFE has beenclassed as “an undesirable organisation” in Russiasince last February, effectively banning the outlet.Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: “These media outlets … can hardly be classified as popular and in demand in the Russian Federation,” describing the decision to cut funding as an internal decision of the US.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

After the law, which only applies to Italian citizens, was passed in parliament in October, Meloni said it was needed to “fill a regulatory gap to also prevent this inhumane practice in procreative tourism”. The measure is among several sociallyconservative policiespursued by her government in its quest to promote so-called traditional family values.Until the international ban was enacted, an estimated 250 Italian couples sought surrogacy overseas, the vast majority of them straight people who turned to surrogates for health reasons.The practice is legal and regulated in 66 countries, although most Italians access the procedure in the US or Canada, where surrogacy is not specified on the birth certificate and where their child can obtain immediate US or Canadian citizenship.Baldini believes there could be “a few dozen” children who have been born abroad via surrogacy since the law was enforced. “We don’t know how many couples are currently in this situation, but from cases I have assisted in the past, I do know there are those who simply do not want to talk about it as they are afraid,” he said.The couple in San Diego are both employed by a multinational company and so could potentially stay and work in the US; however, Baldini said they are also concerned about theclimate towards LGBTQ+ families under Donald Trump’s administration, especially if the US presidentpursues his pledge of ending birthright citizenship.The Italian law does not apply retroactively but even though the pregnancy was conceived before it was enacted, now that their son has been born the couple still risk prosecution if they return to Italy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They want to protect their child and don’t want their situation to become a cinema-style story.”However, if the case did reach court, Baldini said he would aim to take it to Italy’s highest level and argue that the law is unconstitutional. “This is because it violates the principle of double jeopardy – you can’t be criminalised for something if it was not a crime in the country in which it was committed.”The law was partially founded with the aim of protecting poor women around the world who are exploited for surrogacy. “There are certainly women who are exploited, but this happens in countries where there is no regulation,” said Baldini. “Italy can’t argue that surrogates in California are being exploited because in California it is perfectly legal.”Explore more on these topicsItalySurrogacyEuropeParents and parentingPregnancynewsShareReuse this content"

The US later restored military aid, but on Monday it was reported the US waswithdrawingfrom an international body formed to investigate responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine.Trump and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, for whom the US president has repeatedly expressed admiration, are tentativelyscheduledto talk on Tuesday over the phone about ending the war in Ukraine.Glucksmann’s remarks additionally nodded toElon Musk’s brutal staffing and spending cuts to the US federal government, which have affected numerous health and climate research workers. Glucksmann said France could be in a position to benefit if any of the fired workers emigrated.“If you want to fire your best researchers, if you want to fire all the people who, through their freedom and their sense of innovations, their taste for doubt and research, have made your country the world’s leading power, then we’re going to welcome them,” said Glucksmann.“Give us back the Statue of Liberty. We’re going to say to the Americans who have chosen to side with the tyrants, to the Americans who fired researchers for demanding scientific freedom: ‘Give us back the Statue of Liberty.’ We gave it to you as a gift.”France did indeed present the 305ft-tall, 450,000lb Statue of Liberty to the US in Paris on 4 July 1884, the 108th anniversary of the American declaration of independence from the UK. The US needed crucial military aid from France to win its revolutionary war and gain independence from the UK.Nicknamed “Lady Liberty”, the torch-bearing statue – designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi of France – was then installed on an island inNew YorkCity’s harbor and dedicated in 1886. There is a smaller copy of the statue on an island in the Seine river in Paris.A bronze plaque on the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal contains the words of a poem titled The New Colossus, which overtly references the large number of immigrants who arrived in the US in the 19th century and partially reads: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore.”Trump has been aggressively pursuing the deportation of immigrants. Recently, his administrationdeporteda Brown University medical professor to Lebanon, despite her having a valid US work visa and a judge’s order not to do so.Prosecutors reportedly alleged that the professor had recently attended the funeral of Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, among other things.The US also recentlydeportedto El Salvador more than 250 people whom the White House accused of belonging to Venezuelan and Salvadorian gangs, despite a judge’s order halting the flight.David Smithcontributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationFranceUS politicsEuropeNew YorkVladimir PutinUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Airstrikes killed at least 53 people this weekend and appear poised to continue. Meanwhile,Irancontinues to weigh how to respond to a letter Trump sent it last week trying to jump-start negotiations over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear programme.Describing the Houthis as “sinister mobsters and thugs”, Trump warned any attack by the group would be met with “great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there”.“Iran has played ‘the innocent victim’ of rogue terrorists from which they’ve lost control, but they haven’t lost control,” Trump alleged in his post. “They’re dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, ‘Intelligence.’”It is unclear what sparked Trump’s post. However, the head of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guards sought to separate the Houthis’ actions from those of Tehran this weekend. The Houthis also launched drones and missiles targeting the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, though none reached the ship as it continues flight operations in the region.Iran did not immediately comment on the post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, there is no life here at all and anyone who comes is sad. They can remember what it once was,” the 40-year-old museum director says.There is little left of the palace – a mansion and fortress during Mamluk and Ottoman rule over Gaza and where Napoleon Bonaparte once spent several nights. Israeli bombardment and fighting in Gaza City during late 2023 and early 2024 left just a few sections of wall and an arch standing. Almost nothing remains of the museum.For Dahda, the loss is personal too. He had not wanted to leave the palace and so did not join hundreds of thousands of others fleeing to the south of Gaza when war broke out. In December 2023, he was staying with his wife and three daughters nearby when there was a huge explosion.“All my close family members were pulled out from under the rubble injured, except for my daughter Mervat, 12 years old, who was pulled out as a lifeless body. May God have mercy on her,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe Pasha Palace seen in 2022 and again on 5 January last year.Photograph: Getty ImagesPasha Palace is one of dozens of major heritage sites destroyed or badly damaged in the war in Gaza, which was triggered by a Hamas surprise raid into southern Israel in October 2023 in which 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and 251 abducted. The death toll from the Israeli offensive that followed reached more than 48,000 people, also mostly civilians, before a fragile ceasefire came into effect in January 2025.The offensive devastated Gaza, leaving fewer thana 10th of homes untouched, and destroying sanitation systems, health facilities, schools, universities, roads and much else.Palestinian experts working with British archaeologistsestimate that more than two-thirdsof heritage, cultural and archaeological sites in Gaza have been damaged, often very badly.Many appear to have been directly targeted by Israeli forces in attacks that could constitute war crimes in some circumstances. Israeli officials have said cultural monuments such as the Pasha Palace were only ever attacked if used by Hamas for military purposes and deny accusations that such sites were deliberately targeted for destruction.Close to Pasha Palace is Hamam al-Samara, a 700-year-old bath house that was among the most important of Gaza’s monuments. Its guardian was Salim al-Wazir, 74, who spent the war in southern Gaza living in tents.View image in fullscreenSalim al-Wazir, 74, guardian of Hamam al-Samara.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianAl-Wazir took over management of the bath house in 1970 from his father, whose own father had rented it from a famous family of Gaza notables during the era of Ottoman rule.“On the first day we could return to the north of Gaza from where we had been sheltering, I didn’t go to my home but instead came first to check on the hamam,” he says.Wazir was stunned. The hamam had been almost entirely destroyed.“I lost a place that meant a lot to me, a place that gathered people and provided them with comfort and relaxation. I also lost a part of my family’s history and of course of Gaza’s collective memory,” he says.View image in fullscreenMen relaxing in Hamam al-Samara in 2021 and a view of the destroyed bath house in January 2024.Photograph: Getty ImagesA recent reportby Palestinian conservation expertsin the occupied West Bank and UK-based archaeologists estimated that just protecting historical sites from further damage in Gaza – if the current ceasefire holds – will cost about $33m and take up to 18 months. Full reconstruction could cost almost 10 times more and take up to eight years.Competing proposals for the reconstruction of Gaza have paid little attention to historical sites. Donald Trump proposed levelling the territory after displacing its inhabitantsto build a “Riviera of the Middle East”. Others look to cities such as Dubai for inspiration, with a focus on towering hotels and malls, not heritage.But many in Gaza City want a different future for even the most badly damaged historical buildings, calling for their protection and eventual reconstruction.“If no one else takes on the task, I will spend the rest of my life rebuilding [the Hamam al-Samara] myself,” says Wazir. “I think we can reconstruct it exactly as it was, using the same stones and design. That way we can restore its former spirit.”Experts also point to bombed Roman and Greek remains, as well as bulldozed historical cemeteries, to underline the cultural richness that is still potentially at risk of further damage – either from a return to war or clumsy reconstruction.Many residents see theal-Omari mosque, the oldest and largest in the territory, as the greatest potential loss. The building was originally a Byzantine church, then was converted into a mosque after the Islamic conquest of Palestine almost 1,400 years ago. It was expanded over the centuries and rebuilt once after being almost destroyed by British artillery targeting an Ottoman ammunition dump there.View image in fullscreenAl-Omari mosque seen in 2013 and again in January last year after Israeli bombardment.Photograph: Getty ImagesHistorians point to the mosque, along with a Roman port and other sites, as evidence of the importance of Gaza as athriving trading centrefor 2,000 years.Tarek Haniya, 60, had been working at the mosque as a tour guide since his youth.“I have lived my life in Gaza, next to the mosque. The war was harsh in every sense of the word. Every day felt like a new nightmare. I lost my friends, I lost family members, I lost my home that had sheltered me for decades, and I lost the Omari mosque as I knew it too,” he says.View image in fullscreenTarek Haniya, the guide at the mosque.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianThough the mosque’s famous Mamluk-era wooden pulpit has survived almost undamaged, much of its roof is gone, most walls are in ruins and the minaret partly toppled.“It will definitely be restored. In fact, we are already working on that. There is a team collecting the broken stones of the mosque to restore it as soon as possible. True, the old mosque held irreplaceable history within its walls, but we will rebuild it.”Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warHeritageArchaeologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Children are particularly vulnerable to cluster munitions, sometimes mistaking them for toys. By last week, 640 people had been killed or injured,accordingto the world’s largest land mine charity, the Halo Trust. An earlierUN reporthad found that a third of the victims were children.“We cannot say that any area in Syria is safe from war remnants,” said Mohammed Sami Al Mohammed, mine action programme coordinator for theSyrian Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, an NGO funded by governments and development organisations.Mohammed said it would take decades to remove the mines and makeSyriasafe. “There are countries where wars ended 40 years ago, yet they are still unable to completely eliminate this danger. The matter is not that simple and what happened in Syria is far more devastating than what occurred in other places.”Volunteers have been helping to try to clear people’s land to make it safe for them to return, but tragically have also been losing their own lives as a consequence.His final photo was of the bomber that killed him: the last journalist to die before Assad fellRead moreSince the fall of the Assad regime in December last year,Fahd al-Ghajar, 35, had been regularly posting pictures on Facebook showcasing his dangerous work clearing mines in various locations across Syria.In one of his posts, he expressed pride in removing mines from farmland used for grazing livestock,captioning it: “The most beautiful thing is the end.” In February, Ghajarwrote aboutthe death of one of his colleagues, saying: “Syria is free, but we, the engineering team, lose someone every day. In the end, we are all dead; what matters is to clean the country.”On 21 February, Ghajar was killed by a landmine explosion while demining a farm in northern Syria. He had successfully cleared the house, but a mine detonated while he was inspecting the field, killing him instantly, said his brother Abduljabbar Alghajar.View image in fullscreenFahd al-Ghajar, in the last photograph he published before his death in February 2022.

They fearlessly flew over enemy territory to protect the UK and its allies, risking their lives.“He never considered himself a hero and often referred to himself as the ‘lucky Irishman’, a man simply doing his job, like so many others of his generation. Despite his sacrifice, he would tell stories of the joyous memories he made and moments he shared with his peers, many of whom never returned home.“Their sense of duty and service secured our freedom, and we shall never forget them.”Group captain Hemingway DFC retired from the RAF in 1974.The defence secretary, John Healey, said Hemingway’s generation “understood the importance of freedom and sacrificed so much to achieve it”.Air chief marshal Sir Rich Knighton, the chief of the air staff, said the flyer was “an amazing character whose life story embodies all that was and remains great about the Royal Air Force”.Hemingway was the last surviving member of the Few after the death of Terry Clark in May 2020 aged 101.Clark, who died in a care home from natural causes, had served as a radar operator on Bristol Beaufighters during the second world war.Explore more on these topicsUK newsRoyal Air ForceSecond world warMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

Only officials for whom it is absolutely essential should have a card.”Officials use GPCs to buy relatively small items such as flights, office furniture or drinks for official functions.They were introduced by the last Labour government in 1997 as a way to reduce the bureaucracy required to run Whitehall departments. Spending on them has more than quadrupled over the last five years to £676m, with Labour sources pointing to spending on items such as shoes and DJ equipment as potentially wasteful.While in opposition, Labourconducted an investigationinto all spending on GPCs, which found examples of high spending by senior officials and ministers. In 2021, for instance, the then prime minister Boris Johnson used a government card to pay for a £4,445 dinner in New York for himself and 24 of his staff.Later that year Liz Truss, as foreign secretary, spent nearly £1,500 on lunch and dinner during a visit to Indonesia in two of Jakarta’s most exclusive restaurants.Also in 2021, the Treasury under Rishi Sunak spent more than £3,000 buying 13 photographs from the Tate to hang in its Whitehall building, despite already having access to the government art collection.The Foreign Office is one of the heaviest users of GPCs, in part because officials have to organise regular functions to entertain foreign dignitaries. But as well as spending on items such as flights and catering, officials also spent nearly £2,500 at a shoe shop called Shoe Crush in Barbados.Under new guidelines being rolled out by McFadden, the maximum spend for hospitality will be cut from £2,500 to £500, with any spending over £500 requiring approval from a director general.Civil servants will be banned from using cards to buy things such as travel or office supplies, which could be bought more cheaply in bulk at a departmental or cross-departmental level.Most of the 20,000 cards that have been issued will now be frozen, with exemptions for a small number of cases such as diplomatic staff in unstable locations. Cardholders will then be forced to reapply for their cards, and if unsuccessful will lose access to them by the end of the month.McFadden has also asked departments to identify any items of spending that breach government guidelines and discipline the individuals in question.Keir Starmer is spearheading a wider shake-up of Whitehall. As well as cuts to quasi-non-governmental organisations, the prime minister is urging departments to make greater use of technology such as artificial intelligence tools to reduce spending and streamline decision-making.Some experts have warned that rather than making government more efficient, the changes to how Whitehall works could make it harder for civil servants to deliver the government’s main priorities such as cutting NHS waiting lists.Explore more on these topicsCivil servicenewsShareReuse this content"

Along with the 27 confirmed dead, four people remain missing, while two survived.Tipton said that up to 15 of those on board may still have been alive more than four hours after the dinghy capsized. On that day sunrise was at 7.26am. Distress calls from the stricken dinghy started to come in just after 1am and the last distress call was at 3.11am. It is estimated that the passengers went into the water at 3.12am or 3.13am.Tipton said he believed that at 3.24am the majority of people in the dinghy were still alive and that possibly by dawn, eight, 10 or 15 people were still alive. According to the coastguard log shown to the inquiry, a decision was taken to stand down the Border Force cutter boat Valiant just before 6am and it returned to shore at 7.03am with 98 passengers rescued from other dinghies but not from the dinghy where the mass drowning occurred.Initially there was confusion about whether or not the passengers on the stricken dinghy had been rescued because it was confused with another dinghy in a separate incident.One of the only two survivors, Issa Mohamed Omar, previously gave evidence to the inquiry. “I’m a voice for those people who passed away,” he said.He described the scenes of desperation on the dinghy with people making frantic phone calls for help right up to the moment the dinghy capsized.“It was very cold. People were screaming when we fell into the sea. We all thought we were dying.”Maria Thomas of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who represents 21 bereaved families and one survivor, said: “We heard today that although some may have succumbed to ‘cold water shock’ almost immediately upon entering the water, many onboard the small boat known as incident ‘Charlie’ were likely to still be alive many hours after the boat capsized.“It is therefore entirely possible, indeed likely, that had additional assets been deployed to continue the search for Charlie after Valiant returned to port at 07.03 to disembark the 98 people it had rescued, many more of the victims from that night may have been alive today.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our thoughts remain with everyone affected by this tragic event, including the loved ones and families of those who lost their lives.“We remain committed to supporting the inquiry and will give due consideration to any recommendations made. It would be inappropriate to comment further.”The inquiry continues.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumWater transportMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Harry Purcell, 17, Tilly Seccombe, 16, and Frank Wormald, 16, fellow pupils at Chipping Campden School in Gloucestershire who were passengers in Spencer’s car, died as a result of their injuries.A woman and two young children, who were travelling in another car, were seriously injured and continue to receive treatment for their life-changing injuries.Insp Michael Huntley, from Warwickshire police, encouraged young people and their parents to consider the limitations of being a newly qualified driver. He added: “Drivers need to be aware of the devastating consequences that can occur if a car is driven carelessly.“Edward Spencer had only passed his test five weeks prior to the collision and his careless actions cost the lives of three young people travelling in his car. Driving requires judgment and care, even more so when you lack experience. As this tragic case shows, the consequences of careless driving can be devastating.“So many lives have been ruined by this terrible incident. I can’t begin to imagine the pain this has caused, and our thoughts remain with the individuals and families affected.”Spencer was granted bail and will be sentenced on 28 April.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

This move was made to comply withDonald Trump’sexecutive orderto protect second amendment rights, a White House official told the Guardian.The“firearm violence in America”page, where the advisory had been posted, was filled with data and information about the ripple effects of shootings, the prevalence of firearm suicides and the number of American children and adolescents who have been shot and killed. Now, when someone reaches the site they will be met with a “page not found” message.Pentagon webpage for Black Medal of Honor winner restored after outcryRead moreWhen it wasoriginally released last summer, Murthy’s advisory was met with praise from violence prevention and research groups, and was lambasted by second amendment law centers and advocacy groups that argued the Biden administration was using public health as a cloak to push forward more gun control.“This is an extension of the Biden Administration’s war on law-abiding gun owners. America has a crime problem caused by criminals,” the National Rifle Association (NRA) said in a statement posted to X on 25 July 2024.But Daniel Semenza, a firearm violence researcher with Rutgers University, argues that talking about gun violence through a public health lens is meant to “bring the heat down” about a deeply politicized issue and broaden what prevention can look like.In 2023,nearly 47,000people died by firearms, most of them suicides.“When people read gun violence is a public health problem, they read gunsare a public health problem,” Semenza said. “This idea actually removes the politics from the issue and is an engine to get us on the same page. [The removal] feels like an unnecessary and mean-spirited way to politicize something that people have actively been trying to bring people together on.”The removal of Murthy’s advisory and the rest of the information on the page is one of thethousands of piecesof health information and research removed from federal websites. They include information about vaccines, health risks among youth and gender-based violence,the New York Times reported.Some of these pages have beenrestored following a court order, and it is unclear whether the removal of the “firearm violence in America” will see the same fate.In response to the Guardian’s question about the removal of webpages, the White House said: “Illegal violence of any sort is a crime issue, and as he again made clear during his recent speech at the Department of Justice, President Trump is committed to Making America Safe Again by empowering law enforcement to uphold law and order.”While researchers and violence prevention advocates have described gun violence – including both suicides and homicides – as a public health issuefor more than a decade, it’s only recently that this language has entered mainstream discourse. Experts across the field of violence prevention argue that this updated lens is meant to reflect the widespread impacts of shootings on entire communities and offer solutions to violence beyond law enforcement and firearm restrictions andpolicy.‘We’ve been at this rodeo before’: gun-safety groups prepare for second Trump termRead moreThis new framing has also led to more dollars from federal government offices, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health, for research that could illuminate preventive methods. These efforts were supercharged with the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,passed in June 2022, which allocated millions of dollars for research into the unseen consequences of shootings. It also allowed researchers toevaluate groups that are working on the ground in the nation’s most underserved communities where shootings happen most.If this work doesn’t continue or is severely pared down, years of progress and gun violence status as a public health is at risk of being lost, Semenza said.“The vernacular of gun violence as a public health issue that has shaped in the last five to 10 years of research and advocacy is under direct threat,” he said. “I’m really disheartened and sad to hear about it. But it’s not because I’m surprised. This is a clear example of this administration pulling the wool over people’s eyes and being disingenuous about the things that harm people who are most vulnerable.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationGuns and liesUS gun controlDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Likewise, Ashley Biden who has 13 agents will be taken off the list,” Trump added.There was no immediate reaction from the former president’s office.Former presidents and their spouses receive lifelong Secret Service protection under federal law, but the protection afforded to their immediate families over the age of 16 ends when they leave office, though both Trump and Biden extended the details for their children for six months before leaving office.While touring the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Monday afternoon, a reporter asked Trump if he would revoke the protection for the former president’s son.“Well, we have done that with many. I would say if there are 18 withHunter Biden, that will be something I’ll look at this afternoon,” Trump said, who added this was the first time he heard about the matter.“I’m going to take a look at that,” he said.This wouldn’t be the first instance of Trump revoking security details, in January, herevoked the security detailsfor Mike Pompeo, Trump’s former secretary of state; Brian Hook, a former top aide; and John Bolton, his former national security adviser, within 72 hours of Trump’s second term beginning.Trump’s decision to remove their security details, which were believed to be provided by the state department, comes despite warnings from the Biden administration that both men faced ongoing threats from Iran due to actions they took following Trump’s orders during his first term as president.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When given a list of issues includinginflation, healthcare and immigration, 72% of Americans said they are concerned about tariffs.The survey was conducted by the Harris Poll in early March. When it conducted the same survey in mid-January, 61% of those polled said tariffs were a concern.A lot has changed since then. Since returning to the White House, Trump has pushed for tariffs against many of the US’s key trading partners. He tacked on an extra 20% tariff on Chinese imports and hiked tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.Chart showing Democrat/Republican/independent breakdown of responses to concern about tariffs and recession.The president has also threatened to go further next month, promising sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on all imports from across the world and universal tariffs on all products imported from Canada and Mexico.Amid widespread concerns, Trump and his cabinet have spent the last few weeks arguing that this strategy will bring jobs back to the US and ultimately lead to higher wages. The commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, conceded last week that a recession was possible, butsuggestedthis would be “worth it”.But so far, most Americans seem skeptical of this vision: 66% believe theUS economywill take years to recover from Trump’s tariffs, according to the survey.The country remains divided. As shown inrecent polling, how a person views the economy under Trump depends on their political party. Republicans were less likely than Democrats and independents to be concerned about the economy and inflation, a potential recession and tariffs.90% of Democrats and 69% of independents said they are concerned about tariffs, compared to 57% ofRepublicans.89% of Democrats and 75% of independents said they are concerned about a potential recession in the US, compared to 65% of Republicans.85% of Democrats and 62% of independents said it will take years for the US economy to recover from the tariffs, compared with 52% of Republicans.It’s a sudden flip from how Republicans andDemocratsviewed the economy last year while Joe Biden was president. Last May, 70% of Republicans said the economy was worsening, compared with 26% who indicated the same last month. Comparatively, 69% of Democrats now say the economy is getting worse, compared with 36% who said the same in May.This is also reflected in whether someone believes the tariffs against Canada and Mexico are justified. The vast majority of Republicans believe that the tariffs are justified – 79% for tariffs against Mexico, and 75% for tariffs against Canada – while just over 30% for Democrats and about 40% of independents believe the same.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most Democrats (91%) and independents (88%), along with 82% of Republicans, said that they are concerned about the economy and inflation. Similar majorities said that they are concerned about being able to afford their living expenses.TheTrump administrationhas only doubled down on its strategy, and threatened more tariffs, in response to retaliatory tariffs against American exports.When Ontario threatened tariffs on electricity exports to the US last week, Trump said he would double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada to 50%. Only after Ontario said it would drop its tariffs did Trump concede. After the EU put a retaliatory tariff on $28bn worth of American exports, including a 50% tax on American bourbon exports, Trumpsaidhe would put a 200% tariff on European alcohol imports.Trump’s insistence on tariffs comes in defiance ofgrowing concernsthat the policies could ultimately lead to a recession. The uncertainty has shaken Wall Street, which has had aturbulentlast few weeks, despite recent better-than-expected data reports on thelabor marketandinflationthat showed general stability in the economy.Something that most people agree on, regardless of party: a majority (59%) believe that the tariffs won’t last long. That includes 61% of Republicans, 60% of Democrats and 55% of independents.“Most Americans are of the sentiment that ‘this too shall pass’,” said John Gerzema, CEO of Harris Poll. “But there’s growing concern that tariffs could have a lasting and unknowable impact on the economy, regardless of whether they’re walked back soon or not.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS economyUS economic growth and recessionInflationEconomic policyDemocratsRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

For the first time, the talks will be “at the epicenter of the climate crisis”, the summit’s president wrote last week. “As the Cop comes to the Amazon, forests will naturally be a central topic,” he added.But now questions are being asked about a possible conflict of interest after his team confirmed to the Guardian and CCR that it is considering bringing in the American PR giant Edelman to work on the summit. As well as its past work with some of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies, Edelman previously developed a “communications strategy” and message “playbook” for a trade group representing major players in the Brazilian soy industry, according toUS Foreign Agent Registration Act filings.“Edelman’s conflicts of interest at a climate conference are almost too many to count,” said Duncan Meisel, executive director of Clean Creatives, which campaigns for the PR and ad industry to cut ties with fossil fuel clients. He said the agency “maintains at least a dozen contracts with fossil fuel polluters like Shell and Chevron”.“These conflicts of interest make it impossible for Edelman to be effective advocates for Cop30’s agenda, and put the outcome of the talks in jeopardy.”Edelman defends its approach, saying it works with a range of companies and organizations to help clients reduce emissions while meeting global energy demands.View image in fullscreenA soy harvest at a farm near Senador Guiomard in Acre state, Brazil.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesBrazil is the world’s largest producer and exporter of soy. Rather than directly owning farms, most of the major companies in the country’s soy industry source from a complex network of suppliers across Brazil. Members of the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oils Industry group, known as Abiove, include the biggest soy traders, such as Cargill, Bunge and Cofco. JBS, the controversial Brazilian meatpacker whosecomplex beef supply chain has been linked to deforestationof the Amazon, is also a member.Abiove members agreed in 2006 not to source soy from recently cleared tracts of the Amazon, a major milestone that experts credit with drastically reducing the impact of the industry on deforestation in the region. But in 2022,an investigation by the Guardian– in collaboration with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Greenpeace Unearthed, Repórter Brasil and Ecostorm – revealed that Cargill had bought soy from a farm linked to deforestation in the Amazon. And recently,Abiove has been seeking to amend the 2006 moratoriumwhich campaigners worry will put the rainforest in jeopardy once again.Meanwhile, deforestation has continued apace elsewhere. Driven in part by the country’s booming soy industry, deforestation of the Cerrado, a vast grassland in centralBrazil, has reached record levels in recent years. The campaign group Global Witness has described it as an “ecological catastrophe” for the world’s most biodiverse savannah.An agreement similar to the Amazon’s soy moratorium was first mooted for the Cerrado in 2017 by a group of 60 NGOs. Nearly two dozen major companies, including McDonald’s, Tesco and Walmart, supported its aims. In 2020, thehead of Abiove saidthat such an agreement for the Cerrado was “unfeasible”.Between 2017 and 2023 (the most recent data available), 520,200 hectares of the Cerrado – an area larger than the Grand Canyon national park – were cleared and planted with soy, according to figures provided to the Guardian and CCR by the research group Trace. This was significantly higher than in any other biome: over the same period, there were 146,800 hectares cleared for soy planting in the Amazon, the group said.CargillandJBShave said they are taking efforts to help curb deforestation.Edelman was hired by Abiove in 2023 to develop an “overarching communications strategy” and “message architecture playbook”, a copy of a contract filed with the US Department of Justice shows. The firm was paid $75,000 over a three-month period for work including “narrative development” and “risk analysis and scenario planning”.View image in fullscreenSoy plants grow in a field in Brazil.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesThe firm was also scoping a potentially more lucrative second phase of its work with Abiove, which involved “coalition building” and an “ongoing communications program”. This second phase could have generated more than $50,000 per month for the agency, according to estimates included in the contract.A spokesperson for Edelman said its contract with Abiove ended in December 2023. They declined to answer questions about whether its work with Abiove involved developing messaging on deforestation and if it had informed the Cop30 team of its prior relationship with the group. Abiove did not respond to a request for comment.While pressreportslast month suggested Edelman had already been awarded the Cop30 contract, a spokesperson for the summit said a final decision had not yet been made. “The Brazilian Cop30 presidency is in talks with multiple consulting firms, including Edelman,” the spokesperson said. “The hiring process will involve an open bid conducted through the UNDP [United Nations Development Program].”If Edelman were to ultimately win a bid to work on Cop30 in Brazil, it would be the second time in three years it has been closely involved in efforts to deliver one of the major UN climate summits.Edelman was hired by the United Arab Emirates team hosting Cop28 in Dubai in 2023. One of Edelman’s managing directors – a former deputy press secretary for Donald Trump during his first term – was working as the summit’s president Sultan Al Jaber’s “media support”, according to an internal Cop28 document previously reported by CCR. The agency’s work with Al Jaber, who alongside his role as the UAE’s climate envoy now heads the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, dates back to the mid-2000s, DoJ filings show.Edelman’s work on Cop28 came after a period of intense scrutiny of the agency’s relationship with one of the world’s biggest oil producers, ExxonMobil, and other major fossil fuel companies.View image in fullscreenThe Cop28 summit in Dubai.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesA petition circulated at Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021 by campaign group Clean Creatives called on Edelman to cut its ties with the industry. But during a videoconference for employees that year to address the issue, Richard Edelman was reportedly resolute: the agency would not walk away from its fossil fuel clients, he told staff, according to aNew York Times reportat the time.Ina blogpost on the company’s websitereflecting on the summit in Glasgow, Edelman praised a number of “commendable” pledges including ones to end deforestation and cut methane emissions. The summit will “serve as an important milestone in the march towards progress”, it said.According to Clean Creatives, Edelman’s work with ExxonMobil has since ended butthe group claimsthat in recent years it has inked contracts with three more fossil fuel companies. An Edelman spokesperson said one of those three, the South African energy company Sasol, is no longer a client.Last year,the Guardian revealedthat the agency had also recently worked for the Charles Koch Foundation, which is part of the libertarian network of nonprofits funded by the billionaire Koch family that has pushed back against climate policies.“Edelman works with a wide range of companies, associations and organizations across every sector of the global energy industry,” astatement posted on the agency’s websitestates. “We are proud of the work we do to support our energy clients as they work to reduce emissions while continuing to provide reliable, affordable, and ever cleaner energy to meet the demands of a growing global population.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Amazon rainforestDeforestationTrees and forestsConservationClimate crisisBrazilnewsShareReuse this content"

Because he’s high on his own supply of fake news | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreThe body representing the world’s richest economies said recent higher levels of economic growth and progress to bring down inflation was being undermined by the fallout from higher trade barriers and mounting geopolitical uncertainty.Cutting its global growth forecast for this year from 3.3% to 3.1%, it said that significant risks still remained. The global economy grew by 3.2% in 2024.GDP growth projections chartHigher and broader increases in trade barriers would hit growth and add to inflation, while a climbdown would help reduce uncertainty and strengthen activity.“Significant risks remain. Further fragmentation of the global economy is a key concern. Higher and broader increases in trade barriers would hit growth around the world and add to inflation,” the OECD said in its interim economic outlook report.The OECD said: “Governments need to find ways of addressing their concerns together within the global trading system to avoid a significant ratcheting-up of retaliatory trade barriers between countries …“A broad-based further increase in trade restrictions would have significant negative impacts on living standards.”Trade policy uncertainty chartBasing its projections on the assumption that Trump pushes ahead with plans to impose25% tariffs on almost all merchandise imports from Canada and Mexico from April, the OECD said activity would be hit and inflation stoked across all three economies.It said Mexico would be pushed into a deep recession this year – with output shrinking by 1.3% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026 – and almost halved its forecasts for growth in Canada.It reduced its US growth forecasts from 2.5% to 2.2% for this year and from 2.1% to 1.6% in 2026. Growth in China is projected to slow from 4.8% this year to 4.4% in 2026.In its first report since Trump’s return to the White House in January, the OECD said a further escalation of trade tensions would cause significantly more damage for the world economy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US would be hit significantly, with output declining by 0.7% by the third year and inflation rising by an average 0.7 percentage points a year.Canada and Mexico would also be affected significantly, reflecting their comparatively open economies and high exposure to the downturn in demand in the US and elsewhere.With the UK government on the back foot on the economy before next week’s spring statement, Reeves said the OECD report showed the world was already changing in response to mounting trade uncertainty.“Increased global headwinds such as trade uncertainty are being felt across the board. A changing world means Britain must change too, and we are delivering a new era of stability, security and renewal, to protect working people and keep our country safe,” Reeves said.“This means we can better respond to global uncertainty, with the UK forecast to be Europe’s fastest-growing G7 economy over the coming years – second only to the US.”The downbeat OECD assessment comes before an expected UK growth downgrade from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent Treasury watchdog, due alongside next week’s spring statement.The OBR had previously expected growth of 2% this year and 1.8% in 2026, but official figures and business surveys have since shown output skirting close to zero amid weakness in business and consumer confidence.Highlighting the pressure on households and the challenge for the government and the Bank of England, the OECD held its predictions for UK inflation at 2.7% this year and 2.3% in 2026.Last month, the Bankhalvedits own UK growth forecast for 2025 – from 1.5% to 0.75% because of weakness in household and business confidence. On Friday, official figuresshowedthe UK economy contracted by 0.1% in January.Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyOECDEconomicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpInternational tradeInflationnewsShareReuse this content"

By 2016, it operated about 800 stores globally, of which 500 were in the US.But, the rise of e-commerce retailers and the slow death of the American mega mall hurt apparel companies such as Forever 21 and Bonobos-parent Express, which filed for bankruptcy last year.“Brick-and-mortar retailers like Forever 21 operate in a highly competitive environment where the cost of doing business is expensive and rising with inflation rates,” Sarah Foss, head of legal and restructuring at Debtwire, which provides data and analytics on leveraged loans.Theretailsector saw 20 bankruptcy filings since the start of 2024, while 25 retail chains have had at least two bankruptcy filings since 2016, according to Debtwire data.F21 OpCo is planning for liquidation sales at its US stores, while it goes through a court-supervised sale and marketing process for its assets, which it estimated to be worth around $100m to $500m.Its US stores and website will remain open through the process and its international stores remain unaffected.It has liabilities in the range of $1bn to $10bn, according to a filing with bankruptcy court in the district of Delaware.Forever 21 previouslyfiled for bankruptcyprotection in 2019 and was brought out of it by Sparc Group, a joint venture between label owner Authentic Brands Group and mall operators Simon Property and Brookfield Asset Management.It is now owned by Catalyst Brands, an entity formed on 8 January through the merger of Sparc and JC Penney, a department store chain owned since 2020 by mall operators and Simon Property Group.When Catalyst Brands was formed, it said it was “exploring strategic options” for Forever 21.Authentic Brands will continue to own Forever 21’s trademark and intellectual property, which could live on in some form. Its CEO, Jamie Salter, last year called acquiring Forever 21 “the biggest mistake I made”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsRetail industryBankruptcy and IVAsnewsShareReuse this content"

Having donated hundreds of millions to Trump’s election campaign, he has taken charge of the so-called “department of government efficiency” or Doge, an effort to slash federal budgets and staffing.Addressing Bondi and Behm, the Democrats said that as a special government employee, Musk should be “subject to federal conflict-of-interest rules” and “may be using his government role to benefit his own private company”.Citingthe Washington Post,Bloomberg News, andRolling Stone, the Democrats said: “Reports indicate that some personnel of SpaceX, Starlink’s parent company, have already begun working at the FAA.“Additionally, Starlink hasbegunshipping its hardware to the FAA, though the company has stated that it is providing satellite kits to the agency free of charge. However, sources suggest that the FAA is ordering staff to ‘begin finding tens of millions of dollars for a Starlink deal.’”SpaceX has called reports about its FAA dealings “false”, adding: “Starlink is a possible partial fix to an aging system. There is no effort or intent for Starlink to ‘take over’ any existing contract – that’s just FUD”, meaning “fear, uncertainty, and doubt”.In February, in a joint Oval Office appearance with Trump, Musk said: “All of our actions are fully public. So, if you see anything you say like, wait a second, hey, you know what … that seems like maybe that’s, you know, that there’s a conflict there, it’s not like people are going to be shy about saying that. They’ll say it immediately.”Trump said that if he thought Musk might have a conflict, “we would not let him do that segment or look in that area”.Allegations of corruption and conflicts of interest involving Trump are legion, ever since he entered politics in 2015.In their letter to Wiles, the Democrats said: “Despite President Trump’s promises to fight for working families, he has appointed a string of corporate billionaires and industry insiders, putting them in positions to enrich themselves at the expense of ordinary Americans.”Last week, Trump used the White House lawn to attempt to drive customers to a Musk business, Tesla, which has seen its share price slump amid unease over Musk’s cost-cutting and outrage over behavior including giving Nazi-style salutes and abusing US allies.Calling Musk Trump’s “unelected ‘co-president’”, the Democrats accused him of “relentlessly attacking and disarming federal agencies that regulate his companies, even as his companies have benefited from billions in federal contracts”.Saying “corruption scandals were a feature of President Trump’s first term”, the Democrats listed potential scandals in the second, including appointing lobbyists to roles overseeing their own industries and allowing other appointees to give investments in their own sectors to their adult children.”Instances cited included Trump boosting his own social media platform and ventures in cryptocurrency; continuing to seek expand his foreign and domestic real estate holdings, including an attempt to buy back the former Trump Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue; and using his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida as “a well-oiled pay-to-play machine”.The Democrats noted Trump’s firing of the director of the Office of Government Ethics, a first in US history, and his dismissal of “at least 17 inspectors general”, independent department watchdogs, without notifying Congress as required; and his attempt to fire the head of the Office of Special Counsel.But despite it all, the Democrats said, Trump’s decision to “cede power” to Musk remained his most concerning move.“Since President Trump took office,” the Democrats told Wiles, “at least 11 … agencies with ‘investigations, pending complaints or enforcement actions’ against Musk’s companies have been hamstrung, including through the firing of the agencies’ independent commissioners and rolling back the agencies’ independence.“Meanwhile, Musk’s companies – which have already received at least $38bn in federal funding – are vying for new federal contracts.”The letter also raised a mooted purchase of Tesla vehicles by the state department and Musk’s attempt to buy OpenAI while “insisting that agencies increase their reliance on artificial intelligence”.“Musk has done all of this without so much as disclosing his financial interests to the public,” the Democrats said.The Democrats said Trump could still take steps “to reverse course and put our national interests ahead of his personal dealings”. Such steps included reinstating fired watchdogs, vetting nominees for conflicts of interest, and revoking Musk’s “power to profit from his efforts to manipulate the executive branch for his own benefit”, while being required “to promptly release his financial disclosure form so that the public can understand his potential conflicts of interest”.Setting a deadline of 31 March, the Democrats asked Wiles to answer six questions.Will Trump, they asked, reinstate “all government watchdogs he has purportedly fired and … protect their independence from political interference”; commit not to “appoint additional officials [with] direct conflicts of interest that cannot be resolved … under existing ethics law”; “issue an ethics pledge” for new nominees; “commit to divest from his private business interests, as every prior president in the modern era has done”; “commit to disclose his tax returns from the past three years”; and require Musk “to publicly release his financial disclosure form”?Trump, Musk and Wiles did not immediately comment.Explore more on these topicsUS newsElon MuskSpaceXAir transportTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Its share price fell by 1.2% on Monday afternoon.AstraZeneca, Whitehall, and a failed £450m deal for the next generation in vaccines. What went wrong?Read moreEsoBiotec’s approach uses highly targeted lentiviruses to deliver genetic instructions to specific immune cells, such as T-cells, which program them to recognise and destroy tumour cells for cancer treatment, or tackle autoreactive cells (that target the body’s own tissues or cells) for potential use in autoimmune diseases. This means cell therapies can be given through a simple injection.The EsoBiotec chief executive, Jean-Pierre Latere, described them as “cost-effective, off-the-shelf therapies” that engineer immune cells within the patient’s body. “It’s super-effective. Effectively it turns the patient into a factory,” he said.Hefounded the business four years ago after serving as chief operating officer of the Belgian biotech company Celyad Oncology and working for the US chemical producer Dow Corning, having begun his career as a senior scientist at the US drugmaker Johnson & Johnson.EsoBiotec, which is based in Mont-Saint-Guibert in Walloon Brabant, is backed by Benelux investment groupsThuja Capital, UCB Ventures, Wallonie Entreprendre, Sambrinvest and Investsud, and Spain’s Invivo Partners.Thecompany’s approach is much quicker and less complicatedthan traditional cell therapies, where cells are taken from a patient, genetically modified outside the body, and then put back into the patient as a medicine after immune cell depletion. This can take three to five weeks and costs $450,000 to $500,00 for each treatment.Susan Galbraith, the executive vice-president of oncology research and development at AstraZeneca, said the company had been “looking for things out of the ordinary” and negotiated the deal quickly after seeing EsoBiotec present data from its first patient at JP Morgan’s healthcare conference in San Francisco in mid-January. In December, the Belgian group launched a clinical trial for its lead product for multiple myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer.Galbraith added: “We believe it has the potential to transform cell therapy and will enable us to scale these innovative treatments so that many more patients around the world can access them.”She said only 10% to 20% of people who could benefit from cell therapy can obtain it at the moment because clinics in many countries are not set up for the weeks-long process, whereas EsoBiotec’s technology means treatments can be given as a simple infusion “at a fraction” of the cost of traditional cures. If trials show it works, it could ease the pressure on health systems including the NHS.AstraZeneca, whichfended off a hostile £69bn takeover approach from the US drugmaker Pfizerin 2014, will pay $425m initially for the Belgian drug developer, and up to $575m based on development and regulatory milestones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Marc Dunoyer, who runs the division and is AstraZeneca’s chief strategy officer, defended the deal as a “fantastic acquisition” last month when the company took a $753m hit for scrapping one of the Alexion drugs, while two other medicines from the acquisition have also been abandoned.Separately, Britain’s biggest pharmaceutical company said on Monday that its Imfinzi treatment had been approved in the EU as the first and only immunotherapy for patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer, whose disease has not progressed after platinum-based chemoradiation therapy.AstraZeneca also announced that a drug for a rare endocrine disease, hypoparathyroidism, which can lead to bone density loss and osteoporosis, had met its goal of normalising calcium levels in the blood after 24 weeks. It was well tolerated by patients, and the trial continues as planned to 52 weeks. The company acquired the medicine along with the French rare disease specialist Amolyt Pharma in a deal worth more than $1bn a year ago.Explore more on these topicsAstraZenecaPharmaceuticals industryCancerHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

In Brooklyn, New York, about 50 people gathered outside a Tesla showroom on Saturday afternoon to loudly make their displeasure clear, the fourth such protest in the last four weeks.Other anti-Tesla actions have seen bullets fired through a dealership window and molotov cocktailsthrown at a charging station. But this was a rather more genteel protest, as evidenced by the signs on show. “Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,” read one, channeling a poem by the American poet James Russell Lowell.Elon Musk faces week of harsh setbacks amid Tesla selloff and Doge backlashRead moreOne banner said: “Musk is too brusque,” another: “Very uncool.” One sign, however, offered a more prosaic example of the anger on display, riffing on aDead Kennedys song: “Nazi trucks fuck off.”As protesters chanted: “Hands off our data,” and “ArrestElon Musk,” there certainly seemed to be plenty of support from passersby. People in cars and trucks repeatedly blasted their horns – including, at one point, a man driving a Tesla.“This is probably the most consequential moment in US history since, I don’t know, the civil war. I don’t know what to liken it to, but we’re on a precipice, and so I can’t actually concentrate on anything right now except protesting,” said Kirsten Hassenfeld, a 53-year-old artist and editor who lives inBrooklyn.“I think there are people that haven’t woken up to this yet, but I think that we’re sliding into a full-on authoritarian state. I’m terrified,” she said.Musk has witnesseda mass sell-offof Teslas in recent weeks, in protest against his unprecedented intrusion into the US government through the so-called “department of government efficiency”. Sales of new vehicles have declined around the world, with February sales in Australiadown about 72%compared with the same month in 2024; in Germany sales weredown 76%for the same period, while Tesla’s stock price has lost almost half its valuesince December.As protests have grown, the White House has rallied round Musk. Last week Donald Trump claimed the boycott was “illegal”, while Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said on Friday she would launch an investigation into vandalism againstTeslavehicles and showrooms.“If you’re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we’re coming after you. And if you’re funding this, we’re coming after you. We’re going to find out who you are,” Bondi told Fox Business.In Brooklyn, people were apparently undeterred by the threat. Teslas driving past the protest were treated to a volley of boos, and lusty chants of “Sell your Tesla”. The demonstration certainly appeared to have restricted the number of people entering the dealership: the Guardian counted three customers in the space of an hour and a half.Donna C, who asked not to give her last name, said it was her fourth time protesting at that dealership.“It’s important for me because Elon Musk has carte blanche to destroy our country, destroy our democracy, destroy the institutions that millions of New Yorkers and millions of Americans rely on. Donald Trump has allowed him to buy his way into the government with hundreds of millions of dollars of contributions,” Donna said.“I think what these protests are doing is opening the eyes of Americans in their millions across the US to what is actually going on,” she said. “My parents grew up in fascism in Italy under Mussolini. I’ve seen what can happen. We know the history, the same steps are being taken.”Nearly 20 Tesla showrooms and charging stations have seen deliberate fires set over the past few weeks, while dozens of owners have had their cars variously egged, used as receptacles for dog feces, or coated withKraft cheese singles. The protests on Saturday seem to have largely remained calm, however, despite the anger of those attending.“I’ve been pissed off and furious for a while, and a friend of mine told me, ‘If you want to come and scream and shout at Tesla, then show up on Saturday,’” said Yedon Thonden, 57.“Tesla is a good target. You know, their stock prices are sinking. Their leadership is cashing out their investments. And I think Elon is obviously worried about his company,” she said.“I think that this administration is going to realize pretty quickly that the economy is tanking. So the more we can highlight that, the better.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsProtestTeslaNew YorkElon MuskBrooklynfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Personal care items such as razors, deodorants and shampoo fall into this category. But shoppers may be less aware of “pink tariffs”, or taxes on imported goods labeled as “women’s items”.Pink tariffs are one reason women’s clothing tends to cost more than men’s at the checkout counter, and why some women might buy sweatpants or oversized sweaters technically made for “men” – it could save them some cash.As firstreported by the 19th, two Democratic House members, Lizzie Fletcher of Texas and Brittany Pettersen of Colorado, introduced a bill this session calling on the treasury department to study pink tariffs, and publish any findings on how these taxes might lead to a gender bias in retail.The move comes amid Donald Trump’s continuedtariff war, when more Americans are paying attention to how tariffs work and affect their day-to-day lives. (On TikTok, young people especiallybalkedat how the taxes on China-made goods might affect Temu or Shein fast-fashion prices.) Ed Gresser, vice-president and director for trade and global markets at the centrist thinkthank Progressive Policy Institute,said in a statementthat the bill “will help us design a better and fairer system”, noting that gender bias in clothing “likely costs women at least $2.5bn per year”.Fletcher noted that women pay 3% more in tariffs than men, though in some cases it could be more. Things don’t get easier if shoppers head to a genderless aisle: unisex clothing, the 19th also reported, gets taxed the same rate as womenswear. Pink tariffs can also apply to personal care items, sneakers and toys marketed toward young girls as opposed to boys.Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware, says the wide margin between tariffs on women’s and men’s clothing are “the results of decades-old negotiations” influenced by simple misogyny. “Men dominated these discussions, and women were not fully considered in these negotiations, and that’s a very important reason for the impact and legacy of the pink tariffs.”The first US tariff laws werewrittenin the 18th century and eased by the early 1900s with the implementation of income tax. After the 1929 stock market crash, President Herbert Hoover brought tariffs back, though those decreased after the second world war during the era of free trade agreements. Tariffs became a hot topic during Trump’s first presidency, when he proposed taxes intended to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US. (Fashion designerssaythat’s easier said than done, as China has become a world innovator in apparel manufacturing techniques.)Studies show that womendrive70-80% of all consumer spending, which is also an incentive for governments to set higher import taxes on their clothing. Onestudyfound that in 2015, the tariff burden for US households on women’s clothing was $2.77bn more than on men’s clothing.Tariffs make money in a way that voters don’t seeSusan ScafidiWomen’s clothing also tends to be made from human-made fibers such as polyester, which is taxed more than cotton, one of the US’s largest exports. “Fashion brands cannot totally absorb these tariffs by themselves, so they are eventually passed to consumers,” Lu said.TheUS Harmonized Tariff Schedule, a labyrinthian code which lays out set tariff rates for all categories of goods, contains what Susan Scafidi, director of Fordham’s Fashion Law Institute, calls “financial microaggressions”.One example: men’s silk brief underwear is taxed at 0.9%, while women’s silk underwear is taxed at 2.1%. Meanwhile, overcoats are taxed by a combination of price per kilogram plus an additional percentage; a wool blend overcoat for men has a tariff rate of 38.6 cents per kilogram plus an additional 10% of the value; a women’s wool overcoat is taxed 64.4 cents per kilogram, plus an additional 18.8%.You could make the argument that men’s clothing, which tends to be larger than women’s, weighs more, justifying the discrepancy – a higher tariff makes up for the difference in weight. But Scafidi doesn’t buy it. “The average women’s coat may be a little lighter than a man’s, but certainly many of the weights are similar or identical to each other, and that does not account for such a huge difference in tariffs,” she said.Though Scafidi would like to see the elimination of pink tariffs, she’s not confident that will happen anytime soon. “Tariffs make money in a way that voters don’t see,” she said. The actual markup of an item due to tariffs is hidden from customers, unlike a sales tax, which is printed on a receipt or shown online during checkout. “We can see a price tag, we can see sales tax, but we don’t see the tariffs right in front of our faces when we shop. Those are invisible to us, so there is no incentive for politicians to roll them back.”Still, the pink tariff’s cousin, the pink tax, is well known, partly due to a heavily covered 2015studyby the New York City department of consumer affairs that in turn inspired ad campaigns from companies including Burger King and the European Wax Center drawing attention to the issue. California and New York state have since enacted laws that prohibit businesses from charging different prices for “substantially similar” but gendered products.Scafidi imagines that if retailers were required to list out how tariffs affect prices, then people would be more likely to demand change. “Pink tariffs can add up a little bit at a time, drip by drip, like slow water torture,” she said. “It’s unfair at so many levels, but it’s unlikely to be corrected.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsGenderUS taxationManufacturing sectorConsumer spendingWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Carney spoke in French and English, and said it was important forCanadato strengthen ties with “reliable allies”.“I want to ensure that France and the whole of Europe work enthusiastically with Canada, the most European of non-European countries, determined like you to maintain the most positive possible relations with the United States,” he said.View image in fullscreenCarney and Macron embrace at the Élysée Palace on Monday.Photograph: Maya Vidon-White/UPI/Rex/ShutterstockA senior Canadian government official who briefed reporters on Carney’s plane said the purpose of the trip was to strengthen partnerships with Canada’s two founding countries. The official said Canada was a “good friend of the United States but we all know what is going on”.Carney, who turned 60 on Sunday, travelled later on Monday to London where he was received at Buckingham Palace by King Charles, Canada’s head of state. After a 30-minute private conversation with the king, he was greeted warmly byKeir Starmeron the doorstep of No 10.The UK prime minister said: “The relationship between our two countries has always been strong. Two sovereign allies, so much in common – a shared history, shared values, shared king.”Carney said the relationship between the two countries was “built on shared values” and that “we’re at a point in history where the world is being reordered”.The trip to London is something of a homecoming for Carney as a former governor of the Bank of England, the first non-citizen to be named to the role in its more than 300 years.View image in fullscreenMark Carney and his wife, Diana Fox Carney, visit Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.Photograph: Sean Kilpatrick/ReutersThe former economist is deliberately making his first foreign trip to the capital cities of the two countries that shaped Canada’s early existence. At his swearing-in ceremony on Friday, he noted the country was built on the bedrock of three peoples: Indigenous, French and British.He said Canada was fundamentally different from the US and would “never, ever, in any way shape or form, be part of the United States”.Carney also noted the US, France, UK and Canada are members of Nato and it would be “unthinkable” for the US to annex Canada through military means.Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, said: “The Trump factor is the reason for the trip. The Trump factor towers over everything else Carney must deal with.”On his trip home from Europe, Carney will travel to the edge of Canada’s Arctic to “reaffirm Canada’s Arctic security and sovereignty” before returning to Ottawa, where he is expected to call an election within days.Carney said he did not plan to visit Washington at the moment but hoped to have a phone call with the president soon.He added that Trump must stop making “disrespectful” comments about Canada before the two countries can start serious talks about future ties.2:05New prime minister says Canada will 'never be part of the US' – videoSweeping tariffs of 25% and Trump’stalk of making Canada the 51st US statehave infuriated Canadians, and many are avoiding buying American goods. Carney’s government is reviewing the purchase of US-made F-35 fighter jets in light of Trump’s trade war.The governing Liberal party had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared economic war. Now the party and its new leader, Carney, could come out on top.Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, said Carney was wise not to visit Trump. “There’s no point in going to Washington,” Bothwell said. “As [the former prime minister Justin] Trudeau’s treatment shows, all that results in is a crude attempt by Trump to humiliate his guests.”Bothwell said Trump demanded respect, “but it’s often a one-way street, asking others to set aside their self-respect to bend to his will”.Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said it was absolutely essential Canada diversified amid the trade war with the US. More than 75% of Canada’s exports go to the US.Béland said Arctic sovereignty was also a key issue for Canada. He said: “President Trump’s aggressive talk about both Canada and Greenland and the apparent rapprochement between Russia, a strong Arctic power, and the United States under Trump have increased anxieties about our control over this remote yet highly strategic region.”A No 10 spokesperson said Starmer “underlined that the UK and Canada are the closest of sovereign allies and friends” during their meeting.Carney praised Starmer’s “leadership on Ukraine”, they added, and the two leaders agreed to work together “to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position to see a just and lasting peace”.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyAmericasKeir StarmerForeign policyDonald TrumpInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The announcement came after data revealed consumer prices had dropped into deflation last month for the first time in a year.The fresh measures lifted many Asia-Pacific stock markets on Monday, and stocks in South Korea, Hong Kong and Australia closed higher. Mainland Chinese investors, however, were less enthusiastic, and the blue-chip CSI 300 closed 0.2% down.The plan came amid mixed domestic economic data from Beijing, as reports showed retail spending was up compared with last year, but unemployment had hit its highest level in two years and house prices had fallen in almost all medium and large cities.“In the first two months, with the sustained effects of macro policies, the national economy maintained the new and positive development,” the national bureau of statistics said, but it added that domestic effective demand was weak.“The foundation for sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough,” it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Will an All-Star Game help?Read moreDebate raged on Monday morning after the North Carolina Tar Heels were awarded a spot in the field of 68 instead of the Mountaineers. UNC received a No 11 seed and will play fellow No 11 San Diego State in a First Four game on Tuesday.West Virginia finished the season with a 19-13 record (10-10 Big 12); the Tar Heels were 22-13 (13-7 Atlantic Coast Conference). However, when usingthe metric of Quad 1 wins, North Carolina were 1-12 and West Virginia 6-10.“We keep hearing about the importance of these Quad 1 wins, but UNC couldn’t even get more than one,” the Republican governor said. “They also had the 25th-toughest schedule in America, right behind WVU.”Morrisey said he has directed state attorney general JB McCuskey to work with the NCAA to find out just what criteria the selection committee uses in picking the teams. McCuskey said that knowledge can help teams to build rosters and decide the best use of theirNIL funds.McCuskey also said that as theNCAA Tournamenthas evolved into a billion-dollar business, the selection process hasn’t kept up. An animated Morrisey also questioned what influence Bubba Cunningham, the chair of the selection committee, might have had over the process. Cunningham is the athletic director at North Carolina.“That’s being reported by a number of outlets that Cunningham had a significant bonus incentive, at least $70,000, for UNC making the tournament – arguably more if they advanced,” he said, adding the state’s investigation would look into whether “backroom deals, corruption, bribes or any nefarious activities occurred.”He added: “Any way you slice it, this thing reeks of corruption.”Morrisey has tangled with theNCAAbefore. In 2023, when he served as the state’s attorney general, he and a coalition of attorneys general in other states sued the NCAA over transfer eligibility and won.“Is this retribution? I don’t know. We’re going to have to get to the bottom of that,” he said.West Virginia declined to participate in the second-tier NIT.“I want to reiterate what I said on Sunday that I am incredibly proud of this team and what they accomplished this season,” WVU coach Darian DeVries said in a statement on Monday. “One of our team goals was making the NCAA Tournament and we had a resume worthy of an NCAA Tournament selection. Our guys poured their hearts into this season and all their collective efforts into making the NCAA tournament. I would like to thank all of Mountaineer Nation for their unwavering support of our team this season.”Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark told ESPN he thought the selection committee made the wrong decision.“I was surprised and disappointed to see West Virginia not receive a bid to the NCAA Tournament,” Yormark said. “In addition to their six Quad 1 wins, the Mountaineers won 10 conference games in one of the toughest leagues in the country.”Explore more on these topicsNCAA TournamentCollege basketballCollege sportsNCAAWest VirginiaUS sportsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Both things can be trueMon 17 Mar 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 19.21 EDTShareWell, that’s the nice bit done. Warm feelings, heritage bonds, a cocoon of distracting noise. Wembley is such a different place on these domestic cup days, certainly compared with the Cliff Richard concert vibe of a midweek international.And that feeling was there right from the start of the Carabao Cup final on Sunday as Newcastle were awarded their first corner, drawing the most extraordinary outburst of noise, static, shared energy from one end to the other, filling all that empty Wembley air.‘So proud’: Newcastle fans reflect on historic cup win after 70 years of hurtRead moreThere is no other human activity where this happens in the same way, an unchoreographed mass human theatre. But this is also power, and power is more than ever open to being used. So the nice bit is done. And maybe it is time now to look at this with a little more clarity.Two things can be true simultaneously.Newcastle United winning a first major domestic trophyin 70 years is a euphoric feelgood story for the fans. This is true. That same trophy is also a first significant victory for the Saudi Arabian regime harnessing all this untamed human feeling to wash the blood and cruelty from its hands. This is also true.Does it still feel OK? Is there an aftertaste? Perhaps something very slightly acid? This would be only human. That extraordinary outpouring around Wembley is also, like it or not, a piece of targeted public theatre, the good intertwined with the bad, that thing you love being piggybacked by dictator state ambition, a kind of BurnSaw/BoneSaw dynamic in action.It is important to recognise none of this is the fault of Newcastle’s supporters. The entire process is an act of macro-violence towards sport, clubs, leagues and fans, one in which the football authorities and UK government are complicit.When Tracey Crouch MP told a parliamentary committee that Newcastle’s owners were “a fund” and nothing more, she was making a misleading statement. A few months later the Saudi wealth fund would assert exactly the opposite in a US court, that the Saudi Private Investment Fund is a government arm, all the better to avoid the discovery process. Naturally Yasir al-Rumayyan, governor of the PIF and lieutenant to the crown prince, was present at Wembley to oversee victory on Sunday.And there are two points worth making now the fizz has subsided. The first is to accept the obvious truth, that football is being used to wash the blood from a hardline regime, treating its supporters like useful idiots in an economic and public relations war; and from there to acknowledge that we don’t actually have to acquiesce in this process.The effects are at least clearer now. One thing Wembley revealed is how thoroughly this has been normalised, to the extent apathy and acceptance can seem like the only options. There is an inescapable puzzle here. To celebrate unconditionally the triumphs of a state-owned propaganda team is to make yourself a conduit for state propaganda, emotions fully hijacked. To refuse to celebrate, to walk away and cede the ground, is to allow that propaganda state to take from you something vital and human, to say: yes, propaganda state, you have effectively won. Sport now belongs to you.Faced with this the easiest response is simply to retreat into cognitive dissonance, to give in to whatever line you’ve been fed. Not long ago Dan Burn said Newcastle’s players are motivated by a sense of outsiderdom. “In our pre-match huddles we’ve said: ‘It’s us against the world.’”This is such an absurd idea it deserves to be considered properly. The notion that a sporting arm of the world’s most persuasive carbon-bribery state, chief producer of economic crack cocaine, can consider itself outsiders, little guys, underdogs is so laughable it feels like it must have its roots in some kind of top‑down messaging. Only billionaire‑level entitlement, seeping through the ecosystem, could suggest this. It is just so much easier, after all, to agree with the people throwing the money around.Again, it is vital to restate the facts, and to be completely clear at this point who you’re embracing in that crowd. The list of human rights issues in Saudi is familiar. A booming execution rate. Dissolution of the rule of law. Accusations of arbitrary detention and torture. Migrant workers treated like human collateral damage. Prison terms for social media posts. Meanwhile, last week in New York there was outrage at the appointment of Saudi Arabia as chair of UN’s chief commission on women’s rights, described by Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, as “like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank”.What about modernism and reform and reaching out? These are certainly words, and sport is clearly key in giving the impression they might actually be real things, too. Football is the chief conduit for this. A trophy,warm feelings about Burn, blanket unquestioning coverage will naturally make this process more impactful and more obviously value for money. It represents an opportunity, too. This is not the moment to slide further into apathy, but a moment to question more thoroughly the means.The second point about Newcastle’s victory is what it says about regulation. Which is that regulation is good. The profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) may need some tinkering. But Newcastle winning a cup is the best argument the rules are working, the same rules some would see as unfair or geared solely towards holding back the oppressed billionaires of the sporting world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s there to stop you becoming a version of Chelsea or insanity-era Paris Saint-Germain. PSR are prompting Newcastle’s owners to push through plans for a new ground. Regulation helped Newcastle to build the current settled, well coached, high-functioning team. How much better to win a trophy by astute recruitment and improving players, as Eddie Howe has done.It is hardly a corset, either. Eight of the starting team at Wembley were bought in the Saudi era. Joelinton has been repurposed out of necessity into a seriously useful force in the central-shithousery role. Even Burn, the good news magnet on Sunday, might have been levered out by now if money were no object. Regulation helps to produce a robust league. Far from undermining international “competitiveness”, it may just save English football from the worst of itself.Again, football supporters are essentially bystanders in this, victims of the process, forced to make a series of impossible choices. The same cannot be said of those whose role involves reporting it, and who have a responsibility to do something other than jumping on the bus.Blindly cheerleading journalism is undoubtedly a route to popularity, clicks, affirmation. But it also represents complicity in the process. Perhaps the hoisting of a trophy will give some space for more measured analysis. It was notable on Sunday afternoon that Sky Sports made no mention of the issues around the Saudi ownership of Newcastle, and by implication of the way its broadcast was being piggybacked by a PR project.This is perhaps both a commercial and an editorial decision. Not just, do our viewers really want to hear this today, but also: do we really want to make an enemy of the sport’s great gushing money tap? Who knows, the current broadcast rights holders may feel the need to shift this position before long.Dazn, the loss-making streaming platform, is now part Saudi-owned, which means essentially limitless in its financial reach, which means Dazn may just be coming for your content before long. Either way the lesson remains the same. Take the warm feelings and the spectacle. But there has never been a greater need to enter this world disabused of all illusions, eyes wide open, and above all prepared to tell the truth.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedSaudi Arabia and sportcommentShareReuse this content"

During practice the field still looked close, indeed right through the first two sessions in qualifying but when it really mattered in Q3,McLarenwere off the leash. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri charged, the former almost four-tenths up on nearest challenger Max Verstappen and almost half a second from fourth-placed George Russell. An age. Perhaps we just removed more sandbags than everyone else was Piastri’s assessment. In which case the MCL39 must have been carrying a skip-load such was their advantage with the wick turned up.The race only confirmed what the rest of the paddock had already called:the McLaren is a fearsome beast. After what their team principal, Andrea Stella, called an innovative and aggressive winter development, the team have what is surely their best car for long over a decade. Moreover it has an advantage that will serve it well at every single track. In qualifying it was notably very strong in the final sector, indicating its tyres had not been overworked in the demanding first two, something no other team could manage. Stella confirmed as much after the race. They have a car which interacts exceptionally well with its rubber, on which the drivers can lean and exploit their ride’s inherent pace. Russell suggested they were already uncatchable. He may well be right.McLaren surprised by dominance in F1 opener but warn there is more to comeRead moreHamilton and Ferrari learning ‘bit by bit’Lewis Hamilton was realistic about what he might achieve on his first outing with Ferrari, even while romantics everywhere imagined he might pull out something special. However, what transpired must be viewed as disappointing for the team who have high hopes for the season. Hamilton was pragmatic that it could take time to come up to speed with a new team and a new car, but the SF-25 did not look enormously inspiring in Melbourne. He was nine-tenths of a second off Norris’s pole time and Charles Leclerc was only marginally quicker, almost seven-tenths back. The race was little better, Hamilton declaring it worse than he had expected and he finished 10th after an erroneous strategy call late on. Team principal Fred Vasseur insisted he did not believe the gap to McLaren (and Mercedes and Red Bull) was as great as it appeared and that Ferrari would still challenge.In the meantime Hamilton also clearly has some way to go to find the right groove with his race engineer Riccardo Adami, with whom he had several terse exchanges, notable given that Hamilton is very much in the “leave me alone I know what I am doing” camp. But the British driver was at least sanguine about the issue. “I think we’re learning about each other bit by bit,” he said. They will probably crack it. Last season Leclerc had to adapt to his new engineer Bryan Bozzi but now the pair have a well-attuned relationship. Indeed their exchange at Albert Park will doubtless be a standout of all team radio this season. “The seat is full of water,” a damp Leclerc reported in. “That must be the water,” replied a deadpan Bozzi. “Let’s add that to the words of wisdom …” quipped the Monégasque driver.Williams fulfil promiseHaving also indicated in testing they had a decent ride – potentially even the best of the rest –Williams, for so long slogging round in the lower echelons, also delivered. Considerations that their testing form might be based on low fuel, high engine modes and some glory runs were dismissed when they were consistently quick throughout the weekend in Melbourne. Alex Albon qualified in sixth and Carlos Sainz in 10th at Albert Park, putting them well in the mix with the big boys despite having put their efforts in practice into optimising race pace rather than the single lap. The race was marred when Sainz crashed out behind the safety car, caught out by a mechanical issue that gave him a huge torque kick during a gear change that he could do nothing about. He did, however, then go on to be vital in advising the pit wall about when Albon should stop when the late rain hit, a call they made perfectly and contributed to his strong finish.Albon’s Williams then, had undoubted pace and proved able to frustrate Hamilton’s efforts in aFerrarito pass him. Every element of which sentence would have sounded like the remnants of a fever dream just over 12 months ago. He went on to claim a superb fifth place and 10 points, more than half the tally Williams scored all of last season. The team have targeted 2026 as the time to reap the benefit of a complex reorganisation and restructuring by team principal James Vowles but his work, making consistent and incremental improvements as he goes, is already paying off. He deserves recognition and Williams have the enormously entertaining prospect this year of putting some of their better-resourced midfield rivals to the sword and maybe even grabbing an opportunistic podium.View image in fullscreenWilliams’s Alex Albon negotiates a corner on his way to a fifth-placed finish at Melbourne.Photograph: Christopher Khoury/APA/Zuma Press/ShutterstockRookies make mixed startOn the positive side Kimi Antonelli delivered in absolutely thrilling style in Melbourne. Always expected to be compelling to watch, the 18-year-old Mercedes driver hurled himself at the task with glorious abandon, putting his car on the limit from the off. This will doubtless bite him, as it did in qualifying when he took floor damage looking for an edge that knocked him out in Q3. However in the race he was outstanding, starting from 16thand carving through the field to finish in fourth. He made a series of incisive passes, each executed with the precision of a veteran, not a rookie in his first wet-dry race on a proper circuit and one that bites no less. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, who has shown great faith in Antonelli as Hamilton’s replacement, was understandably pleased, describing it as a “mega” run. His assessment was spot on.Elsewhere it was less edifying. Britain’s Ollie Bearman had a weekend to forget, crashing out in two practice sessions, including FP3, preventing him taking part in qualifying. The 19-year-old did at least keep it on the island in the race and finished, albeit last. Brazil’s Gabriel Bortoleto in contrast opened well, out-qualifying Sauber teammate Nico Hülkenberg at the first attempt but then crashed out late in the race. Isack Hadjar similarly started well for RB, qualifying 11th but then crashing on the formation lap, a mortifying error and exit that left him distraught and being comforted by Hamilton’s father, Anthony. Similarly fraught was Jack Doohan, the 22-year-old Australian whose seat at Alpine was under threat before the season even began and for whom crashing and retiring on lap one was not the way to make his case. Then there was Red Bull’s Liam Lawson, strictly speaking not a rookie with half a season under his belt. However he is rookie-adjacent and notably was very much on message with his fellow newbies: he qualified 18th and crashed out late in the race. “Must do better,” reads most report cards.Australia brings a spectacleView image in fullscreenWho run the world?Gulls.The meeting was further evidence, were it needed, that Melbourne is the perfect venue to kick off the season in style. The Albert Park circuit is a high-speed thrill ride, demanding, challenging and error-punishing as so many found to their cost. It’s a risk-reward, driver favourite that makes for compelling viewing and with a genuine sense of occasion, unmatched by empty grandstands disturbed only by desert sand. Moreover it has an atmosphere that a season-opening event deserves, to match the anticipation and excitement that builds up through the winter.The race, which looks brilliant on TV because of the track and the enormous crowds – 131,000 on race day – is also superbly run, packed with enthusiastic fans, colour, noise and character to a festival-like event. From fine support races and every level of engagement, music, an extraordinary range of food, car displays, to a pram parking area and baby changing facilities, it is well thought-out with an emphasis on making sure all the details are right to be inclusive and fan friendly. Right down, it transpires, to two characters wandering the fan zones dressed in full seagull costumes, making nothing but squawking noises and eagerly pecking at the food held by punters. If F1 wants a real showcase for every new season, Melbourne should be an open and shut case.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMcLarenLewis HamiltonFerrariWilliamsMotor sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

The prospect of Augusta National morphing into Rory Land in mid-April has intensified. Rory McIlroy’s second Players Championship victory suggests that maybe, just maybe, he has timed his Masters run perfectly this time. Never before has he landed at the first major of the year with two victories already banked.McIlroy laid down a marker on the course here on Monday before immediately making a similar statement off it. “I feel like I’m a better player now than I ever have been,” he said.Tiger Woods biopic in the works with the Obamas set to produceRead moreThis was the playoff McIlroy dare not lose. It was one he never looked like losing. By the time JJ Spaun found water on the 17th – the second of three aggregate extra holes – this contest was over. And yet, McIlroy endured a sleepless night as he contemplated his joust with an opponent who had entered the Players Championhip ranked 57th in the world.“Standing over that tee shot on 16 this morning is the most nervous I’ve been in a long time,” McIlroy said. “So feeling like that and being able to hit the shots that I needed, while your stomach is sort of not feeling great and your legs are a little shaky and your heart rate is racing … To have to go through that, it’s nice to have that in recent memory for some of the tournaments coming up.”Georgia is already on McIlroy’s mind. Here, he became the first European to win multiple Players Championship titles.From that 16th tee, he battered a drive almost 340 yards down the fairway. It was his flighted nine-iron into the 17th that was the most impressive shot of the day, though. Technical excellence combined with maturity. Spaun had been deceived; he had noticed what club McIlroy chose and looked on in disbelief as his own ball overshot the green before landing in alligator-infested waters. McIlroy was three clear with one hole to play; the fat lady had cleared her throat.View image in fullscreenRunner-up JJ Spaun congratulates Rory McIlroy.Photograph: Chris O’Meara/APSo why the earlier anxiety? “Back in 2019 [whenhe won his first Players] I maybe didn’t appreciate how big this tournament was and how much it meant,” McIlroy said.“Every time we come back to this tournament, it gets bigger and better each and every year, from the course to the facilities for the players, to the facilities for the fans. I don’t want to put any sort of label on it but it is one of the biggest championships in the world. That was part of the reason.“I didn’t get it done last nightand I really wanted to. And as well I’m going out there and I’m expected to win. That brings pressure in some way. I felt like I handled those nerves really well.“People say pressure is a privilege and it really is. You want to feel like that on the course. That’s why I spend the time that I do practising and trying to master my craft, that you get yourself in those positions to see what you’re made of.”Scottie Scheffler is scratching around for form. Xander Schauffele is battling back from injury. The competitive status of Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau is unclear as they play on the LIV circuit.

He will stick with pre-Players plan of adding one more event – probably the Houston Open – before Augusta.Spaun is due huge credit for forcing extra holes in the first place. He has onePGA Tourtitle to his name and a year ago was trying to halt a miserable run of missed cuts. There is a Masters berth for Spaun as Sawgrass consolation.“Every great athlete talks about being in the moment, having the opportunity to win and wanting the ball, to shoot the final shot, the final three or have the last pitch to win the World Series,” Spaun said. “Those guys want the ball. Even though I didn’t win, I want the ball.”This was, however, indisputably McIlroy’s day. He completed media duties alongside a flower, given to him by his daughter, Poppy, as recognition of a job well done. “I was always excited to sit down and watch this tournament as a kid,” he said.“To think I’ve won this now a couple of times and I’ve been coming here since 2009 … 10-year-old Rory would think this was really, really cool.”It is possible we ain’t seen nothing yet.

He has been one of the biggest stars of the UFC, which was founded by the Trump ally Dana White.In November McGregor was ordered by an Irish civil court to pay nearly €250,000 (£210,000) in damages to a woman who said he “brutally raped and battered” her in a hotel in Dublin in 2018. McGregor claimed they had consensual sex and is appealing against the verdict with a hearing in Dublin’s high court due later this week.The fighter has said he is considering running for president in Ireland later this year, a prospect some thought would be ruled out after the civil trial verdict.He has been supported by figures including the self-styled misogynist influencerAndrew Tate and anti-immigration campaigners in Ireland whose reach has been turbocharged by Elon Musk retweets.Immigration is a hot topic in Ireland with many arrivals entering Northern Ireland on ferries or planes and crossing the invisible border on the island to enter the Republic of Ireland.The justice minister, Jim O’Callaghan, has promised to clamp down on those who are not entitled to international protection.

But cracks are starting to emergeArne Slot’s team will almost certainly win the Premier League this season but there are welcome signs that talent in England may be becoming more dispersedSign up for Soccer with Jonathan Wilson hereJonathan WilsonMon 17 Mar 2025 10.33 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 14.17 EDTShareIt wasn’t supposed to be that straightforward.Newcastle Unitedhave suffered so much disappointment at Wembley that the assumption had been that the end of a domestic trophy drought that stretched back to 1955 would be fraught, that they’d have to drag themselves over the line, nails bitten to the quick, the countdown to the final whistle having to be earned second by painful second.As it was, although there was some anxiety after Federico Chiesa’s injury-time effort for Liverpool was ruled onside by VAR, Newcastle seemed to have the game under control from the start, and never really looked like surrendering the advantage given them by Dan Burn’s magnificent header.His story, the local lad rejected at the age of 11 by the club he supported, losing a finger, transforming himself from goalkeeper to defender, touring the country before returning aged 30 to Newcastle and then, a few days after he had been called to the England squad for the first time, scoring the winner with the sort of header, neck muscles thrusting, that wouldn’t have looked out of place when Newcastle last won at Wembley, is almost too perfect. Enough, certainly, to make people believe in the myth of football as a stage for dreams and fairytales, of heroes and emotion and yearning and fulfilment, and to forget, at least for a moment, how the whole sorry business is funded.Dan Burn’s odyssey grants Newcastle their own special slice of football history | Barney RonayRead moreBut beside Newcastle’s long-awaited success, there was another aspect of Sunday afternoon at Wembley, which is how poorLiverpoolwere. This is a great season for them. They will – surely – win the league and pull level with Manchester United on 20 titles. No season in which a side wins the championship is ever anything but a success, particularly for a club winning only its second title in 35 years, whose fans were denied the opportunity to celebrate the previous one in person by Covid and the lockdown. But, still, it can’t be denied that, in the space of five days, Liverpool have gone from potentially winning three trophies, from being hailed as perhaps the best side in the world, to being left with just one.There must be more paranoid fans wondering whether even the league is safe given how flat Liverpool lookedagainst both Paris Saint-Germainand Newcastle. But a 12-point lead with nine games to go, particularly when the chasing side is an out-of-sorts, injury-ravaged Arsenal, is surely enough. (Not for the first time this season, though, the thought occurs of how different this all might have been had Arsenal not frittered away so many cheap points; no side that wishes to be champions can make a habit of losing at home to West Ham). The international break offers respite and should be enough for Liverpool to reset for the run-in.Still, though, there are questions about Arne Slot that were not there a week ago. Why did he not rest more players against Southampton last Saturday? Why did eight of the players who started both legs against PSG play in that game? Had he perhaps underestimated the physical toll thePremier Leaguetakes? He would not be the first manager in their first season in England to be caught out in that way; the difference is that not many have a league title already effectively wrapped up by the time the realisation sets in.And there are questions too about the squad. It remains the case that, internal appointments excepted, very few managers have ever inherited a squad in quite such good shape as Jürgen Klopp left Slot, but equally any side that makes only one signing in a summer risks being left short. It’s now apparent Slot does not trust Darwin Núñez, while Diogo Jota is beginning to look his age. The midfield, such a strength earlier in the campaign, looks exhausted, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister in particular. Even Mohamed Salah has been so ineffective in the past week that Liverpool’s caution in offering him the new deal he wants has started to seem more understandable.Perceptions can change very quickly in football, often ridiculously so, but a team that was dominant six weeks ago now looks like it could do with five or six signings. And perhaps that isn’t so absurd: after only bringing in Chiesa last summer there is some catching up to be done.And there is a still a title to be sealed. Win that, and for Liverpool this season will have exceeded all expectations. And for all that there is an anti-climactic sense to this campaign, it has succeeded in one hugely important sense, which is that there will be three different winners of the three major domestic trophies, and it remains possible that an entirely different three English sides could all win European trophies. After years of talent becoming increasingly concentrated, it feels for once as though, in England at least, it is happily dispersed.Newcastle’s win and the almost disbelieving glee of their fans shows why that matters.Explore more on these topicsFootballSoccer with Jonathan WilsonUS sportsLiverpoolNewcastle UnitedPremier LeagueCarabao CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Try as Lionel Messi and Inter Miami might, they couldn’t equalize and were forced to watch as the clock ticked towards 90 minutes. Their record-breaking regular season had quickly turned into a different sort of record-breaking postseason: the 34-point gap between Miami and Atlanta at the end of the 34-game schedule made it thelargest upset in MLS playoff history.Inter Miami’s first full year with Messi hadended in undisputed failure. And for Messi and his longtime Barcelona teammates? Well, failure doesn’t tend to sit well. That’s why so many had Sunday night’s clash between Inter Miami and Atlanta United circled in red on the calendar.Despite a slow start that emphasized some of Miami’s defensive frailties on an early concession, Messi put his stamp on a 2-1 win later in the first half. Upon seeing none other than Slisz on the ball, the Argentinian sprinted to close down the midfielder (a rare sight for Messi these days) before picking his pocket, and, well, see for yourself:There was no need for a reminder, but Messi gaveAtlanta Unitedone anyway: he doesn’t like to lose. Through eight games across all competitions so far in 2025, Inter Miami still haven’t lost – and Messi has only just started scoring in league play. Their revenge tour has begun.JLNo masking Luna’s talentIn Real Salt Lake’s win over Houston, the mask finally came off.The mask in question, of course, was Diego Luna’s – the Real Salt Lake midfielder needed to wear it for the first few games of the season after breaking his nose in the US men’s national team’s January win over Costa Rica. Despite the injury, the mask carried positive connotations – it was a visual reminder of the impression Luna made on USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino by playing on andnotching an assistwith a broken nose.Tyler Adams, Gio Reyna return to USMNT squad for Concacaf Nations LeagueRead moreThat performance was surely one of the reasons Luna will join the full senior team in Los Angeles this week for the Concacaf Nations League finals. His play on Saturday was representative of another: Luna is one of the best young attacking players inMLS.With his nose healed enough to make the protective mask unnecessary, Luna showcased why so many believe he could be an important part of the national team’s evolution. He was irrepressible against the Houston Dynamo, scoring the winner by first scrapping for the ball at the byline and then firing a bullet header into the back of the net from a cross. It was Luna’s play for the first RSL goal, however, that should have USMNT fans most excited – an indication that he could be the No 10 they have been waiting for.Trapped out by the touchline, Luna first wriggled through two Houston players. He then continued his run into the half-space and slotted through a line-breaking pass for Emeka Eneli to square to Diogo Gonçalves for the simple finish. It was a moment that highlighted how Luna is flourishing in all areas of his game, having been hyped for years.Pochettino may resist the temptation to throw Luna into his starting lineup for Thursday’s Nations League semi-final against Panama, but the 21-year-old could still be a key figure. Under Gregg Berhalter, the USMNT frequently struggled to break down low defensive blocks. Panama could set up to exacerbate this weakness. Luna could be the solution, with or without the mask.GRskip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the current political climate, some may want to whisper this quietly, others may want to shout it out loud, but of the 30 teams in MLS, it is theVancouver Whitecapswho have made the most impressive start in continental and domestic play.There is an element of surprise to this given there is uncertainty off the field, as the Whitecaps ownership group is in the process of selling the club, and some disruption on the field as the team have missed key player Ryan Gauld through injury for the past two games. They also have a new head coach, Jesper Sørensen, and a series of ups and downs would normally be expected as players get used to new methods and tweaked tactics. The Whitecaps have skipped all that, and have gotten straight to winning.Vancouver achieved a historic Concacaf Champions Cup victory on away goals against Liga MX giant Monterrey last week, making the Whitecaps one of only three MLS teams to overcome Mexican opposition at that stage. After Saturday’s 1-0 win over FC Dallas, they stand as the only team in the league with a perfect record.A run in the Concacaf Champions Cup is supposed to hinder early-season MLS form, but the Whitecaps’ metrics in both attack and defense are among the best in the league. The defensive elements were on show this weekend as Sørensen’s team didn’t allow FC Dallas to muster a single shot on target through 90 minutes.The Whitecaps are unbeaten in seven games across the two competitions that have kicked off the new season, while 19 players have seen over 100 minutes of game time already as the Danish coach rotates his squad to great effect.There’s a long season ahead, and a big quarter-final tie against Pumas UNAM to come in the Champions Cup next month, but such an impressive start is worth shouting about.JNExplore more on these topicsMLSInter MiamiLionel MessiAtlanta UnitedReal Salt LakeVancouver WhitecapsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

United’s chief executive, Omar Berrada, said the increase in cost was “fair and reasonable”, ­arguing it was necessary while the club faces “financial issues”.Berrada said: “We understand that any price rise is unwelcome, especially during a period of underperformance on the pitch, and we listened carefully to the strong arguments put forward by the FAB [fans’ advisory board] in favour of a freeze. However, the club has decided that it would not be right to keep prices unchanged while costs rise and the club continues to face financial issues.Rasmus Højlund ends goal drought as Manchester United cruise past LeicesterRead more“We appreciate the loyal and patient support of our fans, and particularly our season-ticket holders who represent the core of our match‑going support base. We understand the importance of their backing for the team and have worked hard to come up with a pricing package that is fair and reasonable.“We have kept the increase to the lowest possible level and protected our ­youngest season‑ticket ­holders from any rises, while ensuring the club remains financially strong enough to invest in improving the team.”Alongside increased ticket prices, United announced other new revenue-generating measures. They said they would convert the areas adjacent to the managers’ ­dugouts into ­hospitality seating. This decision, the club said, reflected “the high value of this unique location” and fans who hold season tickets there will be forced to move.United also said fans would be charged £10 if they used the club’s official resale service within 14 days of a game.The announcements are the latest step in United’s attempts to cut costs and raise revenue. Last week the minority co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe warned that the club “would have run out of cash at Christmas” had action not been taken. He also said that the club would become “the most profitable” in the world in three years.The rises conform with prices announced by some of United’s top-flight rivals. Newcastle are also to raise season-ticket costs by 5% and Arsenal’s are to go up by 3%-5%. Liverpool and Tottenham are among clubs who have frozen prices.The club’s fan advisory board said they “strongly advocated for an across-the-board price freeze for 2025-26 season, one we felt was justified due to the current circumstances. While we did not get the freeze we argued for, we are relieved that the club was persuaded to limit the increases to the same percentage rise as recent seasons, and we are pleased they froze prices for our youngest fans.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We call for a strict cap on the number of games that will be placed in the higher price categories … [and] we fail to see any justification for the increase in season-ticket holder minimum usage requirement.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

Slot took over a group of players chiselled by Jürgen Klopp, used to working under him in a strategy befitting his heavy metal football. Only Federico Chiesa has joined over the past two windows and his consolation strikein the Carabao Cup finalwas his first notable contribution.Virgil van Dijk tells Liverpool ‘job is not done’ in Premier LeagueRead moreThere are the complications arising from those with contracts rapidly running down. Trent Alexander‑Arnold, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah are yet to put the rumour mill out of business, leaving questions for Slot and the sporting director, Richard Hughes. Alexander-Arnold is the homegrown hero capable of leading the club for years, Van Dijk the highly respected and commended captain, and Salah the Premier League’s most dominant player, who will need to apply for planning permission for a new mantelpiece in May.Although Slot is eager for all three to stay the ages of Van Dijk and Salah are a consideration: they will be 34 and 33 respectively by the time next season kicks off. They are still at the height of their powers, though. The centre-back recently said he felt in arguably the best shape of his career and the forward’s stats speak for themselves with 27 goals and 17 assists in 29 Premier League games this season. Mid-30s is no longer an age at which to consider which coaching badges to take or whether to become a pub landlord, because players have a greater understanding of what they need to remain healthy.Giorgi Mamardashvili will joinLiverpoolin the summer but goalkeeper is not Slot’s main area of concern after their past week. Physicality and aggression in midfield were key factors in both defeats because Liverpool could not cope with the stamina and relentlessness of PSG or Newcastle. Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister looked tired from the first whistle at Wembley and were pulverised by Bruno Guimarães and Joelinton.Gravenberch has started every Premier League game under Slot in a position that was new to him in August after two years of irregular football. The effect of being integral at the base of midfield is becoming obvious when no one else in the squad is capable of playing as a No 6 in the manner the coach desires. Slot wants someone better in possession than Wataru Endo, who is yet to start a league game this season and seems a prime candidate to be sold.For most of the season Liverpool have controlled games but on the occasions when they have not they have found it impossible to turn the tide. Finding someone able to do this should be an important objective because, even if Slot’s main ambition is to dominate possession, physicality is becoming a defining trait again. Football is a broad church of ideas and healthier for it, and Slot acknowledged Liverpool would lose nine times out of 10 if they allowed Newcastle to turn the fixture into a direct one where winning aerial duels was imperative. Knowing the issue is a start but solving it will come only by spending money.View image in fullscreenArne Slot was unable to inspire his side to take command at Wembley on Sunday.Photograph: Ian Stephen/Action Plus/ShutterstockComplaints have abounded about Salah offering next to nothing over the past two defeats but it is difficult to make an impact when his midfield colleagues do not have possession in the right places to find him. Salah was also afforded limited space by left-backs, making it harder for people to find him in the positions he desires.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has admitted he prefers to face a low block, which allows his players to have the vast majority of the ball and gives them every opportunity to pick holes in an opponent. Unfortunately for Slot possession is only nine-10ths of the law and the rich tapestry of tactics means not everyone takes that approach and others have seen what happens when a physical team go toe‑to‑toe with Liverpool. He needs to ensure his side can mix it up when required.Midfielders set the tone: if they are able to impose themselves, the team revolve around them. On Sunday the substitute Curtis Jones was the only Liverpool figurehead who offered anything akin to energy but his spark was too late to ignite everyone else into action after a demoralising hour.Liverpool cannot afford to be bitter about defeats; they need to use them as an inspiration. Losing two games will not define the club’s season but could help to shape the next one.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotCarabao CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The main question on everybody’s mind between now and the final in Lisbon on 24 May is: can anybody stop Barcelona?The defending champions are bidding to reach a fifth consecutive final and win the title for the third year in a row, but they did not complete the group stage with a perfect record – only Chelsea and Lyon did – and provided a rare glimpse of their mortality with an away defeat against Manchester City in October.Top women’s clubs to play in lucrative seven-a-side tournament in buildup to WCL finalRead moreWith that in mind, and in view of the relative strength of the teams in the last eight, the battle to reach Estádio José Alvalade has a wide-open feel to it, especially with both Chelsea and Lyon currently unbeaten in their domestic leagues. Throw into that mix the renewal of old rivalries, asWolfsburgmeetBarcelonain a repeat of the 2023 final, plus added elements for unpredictability after the appointment of Nick Cushing as Manchester City’s interim head coach, and it all adds to the recipe for four tantalisingly poised quarter-final ties.England is the first nation to have three clubs playing in the quarter‑finals of this competition in the same season, and at least one is guaranteed to progress, asManchester CityandChelseago head-to-head for Acts II and IV of their ongoing four-part drama. On Saturday they played the first of their four consecutive meetings across three competitions, when Chelsea were 2-1 winners to lift the English Women’s League Cup, and they also have a league meeting at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday sandwiched in between these two legs of their European quarter-final.Cushing, who led City to the semi-finals in back‑to‑back campaigns in 2016-17 and 2017‑18 in his previous spell in charge, has said his side’s display in their defeat on Saturday gave him belief that they can beat Sonia Bompastor’s team, who are yet to lose a game under her management. Both teams remain without long-term injury absentees, but City had a scare when their top scorer Khadija Shaw was substituted “feeling her hamstring”, while Chelsea’s big-money January signings, Naomi Girma and Keira Walsh, missed the game and are both doubts.Meanwhile, despite not having played a match since 2023 because of her anterior cruciate ligament injury, Sam Kerr was added to Chelsea’s Champions League squad for the knockout rounds, although it would be a surprise if she was deemed ready to feature.View image in fullscreenKerstin Casparij of Manchester City.Photograph: Barrington Coombs/Uefa/Getty ImagesArsenal, who are in the opposite half of the draw, will be hoping to join one of their WSL rivals in the semi-finals, but they do not face an easy task as they face aReal Madridside just seven points behind Barcelona at the top of the Spanish league. Real could field dangerous attacking-midfield weapons in the form of Linda Caicedo, Athenea del Castillo and the Scotland midfielder Caroline Weir, who played for Arsenal more than a decade ago as a teenager.Arsenal won the competition in 2007 while Real are yet to reach the semi-finals and the Madrid head coach, Alberto Toril, said on Monday: “I expect a close tie between two teams that are doing really well. My players will need to get to grips with the key moments of each leg. We have to take the game to where it suits us, starting with possession, being well positioned so as to not afford them too much space, stretching the game out and always being in it.”The winner of that Arsenal-Real tie will face eitherBayern Munichor the record eight-time championsLyonin the next round. Alexander Straus, Bayern’s head coach, hopes his team’s defensive record – conceding just 12 goals in 17 Frauen Bundesliga games this season – can get them over the line. “We have the best defensive record in the Bundesliga,” he said. “It is not going to be easy, they have very good individual players, [but] we will try to defend against them the best way we can and do what we believe will work.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But cracks are starting to emergeRead more“We’ll enjoy the occasion but the most important thing is that we’ve got 10 games left and we want to ­finish in the top four. You don’t want to get carried away. It’s all about building and we’ve got a big run-in ahead.”If, in one sense, the Wembley victory against Liverpool on Sunday altered everything, it also can be seen as changing nothing at all. Although the psychological boost for Newcastle of winning a major domestic trophy for the first time since the 1955 FA Cup is immense, an awful lot still hinges on Champions League qualification.Howe extended his contract to 2028 amidinterest from the Football Association regarding the England job last summerand it is believed a potentially significant pay rise and further lengthening of that deal are contingent on the team qualifying for Europe’s showpiece competition.The manager is understood to earn around£6m a year, excluding anyCarabao Cupbonus but, depending on league position, that sum could rise to nearer £10m in June.View image in fullscreenEddie Howe escorted the Carabao Cup back to Newcastle airport and is due to fly out to Dubai for the club’s warm-weather training.Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty ImagesHowe’s team are sixth, two points behind fourth-placed ­Chelsea with a game in hand. Fifth place isalmost certain to be enoughfor Champions League qualification. A place in the that ­competition would enable the Saudi Arabia-owned club constrained by Premier League spending rules to invest more extensively in a slender squad in need of refreshment. It could also help to persuade Alexander Isak, Howe’s much-coveted Sweden striker, to sign a contract extension.Howe, his staff and those players not on international duty fly to Dubai on Monday evening for a few days of rest and relaxation before some warm‑weather training.Earlier Howe had posed for pictures with the Carabao Cup on the tarmac at Newcastle airport after returning from London.

It is understood that he is poised to become sporting director of Al-Diriyah, who have been playing in Saudi Arabia’s second division but have been promoted as champions after the season finished at the weekend. Their ownership was transferred to Diriyah Company, owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) in July, with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman named as chair.Freedmanalmost left for Newcastle– who are part-owned by PIF – last year before being persuaded to stay at Selhurst Park by the club’s chair, Steve Parish. But despite being heavily involved in the appointment of manager Oliver Glasner last year, the 50-year-old is believed to have been frustrated with having a limited budget to work with during the January transfer window at the club, where he had two spells as a player before becoming manager in 2011. That spell ended in acrimonious circumstances a year later when he joined Bolton with Palace in contention for promotion – a decision he has said he has always regretted.Iain Moody, who was Palace’s sporting director for almost a year beforeresigningafter it was alleged that he shared racist, sexist and homophobic texts with Malky Mackay when they worked at Cardiff City, is understood to be in the frame to replace him.View image in fullscreenDougie Freedman helped to bring Adam Wharton to Crystal Palace from the Championship and the midfielder was soon picked for England.Photograph: Paul Phelan/ProSports/Shutterstock“Dougie has been instrumental in everything we have done over the past eight years and indeed had a huge impact before that as manager and, of course, as a player,” Parish said. “I have enjoyed working with him immensely and wish him every success for the future. Dougie leaves behind an excellent and well-structured sporting department that I’m sure will continue to go from strength to strength.”Freedman has been credited with scouting players such as Michael Olise, Eberechi Eze and Adam Wharton from the Championship after being appointed as sporting director in 2017.“I would like to extend my thanks to Steve Parish, the other owners and to all the staff, managers and players who have been at the club during my time here.

Tuchel’s side also face Serbia and Andorra in Group K of Uefa qualifying, with the group winners assured of a place at next year’s finals.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelArsenalWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersShareReuse this content"

Antonio can remember nothing from the accident, which occurred when he was driving home from training and crashed into a tree in Epping Forest on a stormy Saturday. The seriousness of it hit home when the forward saw the remains of the car at a scrapyard three weeks ago.Lucas Paquetá faces ‘biggest game of life’ as spot-fixing trial gets under wayRead more“It gave me a weird feeling in my stomach,” he said. “It just made me realise how close I was to dying. I had seen the pictures, but it was 10 times worse in person. The car was an absolute mess. It was difficult for me.”The Met Office had issued ­warnings for Storm Darragh on the day that Antonio’s ­family, friends, fans and colleagues were left fearing the worst. He said conditions were “wet, windy and horrific” and added that he was thinking of returning the car because of concerns over its safety, but he cannot remember anything else.“It’s weird, because the whole way through this I have been told that I was awake and was speaking to every­body – the police, the people and the person who found me. My leg was completely shattered and they got me out and put a splint on it by the side of the car. Everyone believed I got an air ambulance out, but the helicopter couldn’t get off the ground because of the storm so I was driven to the hospital.“I shattered my femur bone in four places. I had one single keyhole surgery. They put a pole in my thigh with four bolts, so screws and bolts to knit it back together. My first surgeon said he didn’t want me to put any weight on my leg for three months, which is around about now, and you can see I am walking.“We got a second specialist who said I needed to start putting weight on it, ­increasing from 10% up to 100% within three weeks. But I kept my crutches for a further two weeks. Overall, they say it will be between six and 12 months before my leg starts healing properly.”View image in fullscreenAn image showing Michail Antonio in hospital after his car accident.Photograph: BBCAntonio, who joined West Ham in 2015, is expected to be out for the rest of the season, but he has shown ­resilience and determination throughout his career – he started out in non-league and has grafted to reach the top – and is targeting a return. “One hundred per cent I will play again.”There have been challenging moments. Antonio was shaken by his physio recently asking whether he had career‑ending insurance. “I didn’t sleep a wink that night,” he said, but he believes he will be running soon.“I am working six days a week. I’ve always been positive from this situation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My body wasn’t the body of a 34-year-old before I had the accident anyway. I can still be sharp and still do the business. People have always doubted me. My mental strength is something I’ve always believed in. This is just another setback and it is not going to stop me.”Antonio, who was left with a sick feeling in his stomach when he thought about not being around for his six children any more, found it tough when West Ham replaced Julen Lopetegui with Graham Potter in January. “It was one of the hardest things, the fact a new manager came in and I wasn’t there to show what I can do, with my contract up at the end of the season,” he said.“The only thing I can focus on is me and making sure I am right.

But there is a school of thought that separate areas of concentrated visiting fans would lead to greater noise.Premiership Rugby announced in October that it was considering a trial and it is understood a number of clubs have expressed an interest. Organisers are keen to stress that visiting supporters can still watch elsewhere in the stadiums and mix with home fans if they wish.The Premiership has a target of 82% attendances across the season and this campaign is operating at an average of 81%, which represents an increase on recent years. It would be on track if Leicester, traditionally the best supported club in England, were not experiencing a worrying drop‑off. League officials, however, believe that away sections could help to meet targets.“Away fans can and will sit amongst the main crowd, this is just giving people a choice,” a source said.“This is not meant to be adversarial. It’ll be done in the right spirit. It’ll be enough fans to make a noise. The players say they feed off it, and it gets more out of the home fans as it creates a back and forth.”The concept is a polarising one but is something Harlequins fans have been doing unofficially for years, most notably at Ashton Gate fortheir 43-36 Premiership semi-final victory against Bristol.The club’s flanker Will Evans has been a vocal supporter of the idea, saying: “Rugby stadiums need a ­designated away fan area that stays the same year on year. We can’t continue to hold the game back any longer. It’s bor­dering on arrogance that we think we’re the only sport where people can sit together and not be violent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ll be honest, I was crying. They were tears of jubilation.”Wearmouth, a retired school caretaker, has been a fan ofNewcastle Unitedall his life and can tell you at length about how difficult a commitment that can be.View image in fullscreenPaul Wearmouth: ‘We will remember this day.’Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianPedants can say that it has been 56 years sinceNewcastlewon a major trophy. But that was the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup against Újpesti Dózsa of Hungary. The last real major trophy, in the eyes of Newcastle fans, was the 1955 FA Cup win against Manchester City.Which means Sunday’s Carabao Cup victory over Liverpool at Wembley ended 70 long – excruciatingly long – years of hurt.“We will remember this day,” said Wearmouth, who was thinking of departed relatives when he was watching at home, his bungalow in Bedlington, Northumberland. “When any of these players come back, if they are playing for different teams, they will get a hero’s welcome because that’s what we are. We recognise history. We don’t forget.“I’m so proud. All the players were up for it … they had fire in their bellies.”Wearmouth was soaking up the atmosphere outside the stadium where a stream of fans posed for photographs at statues of Alan Shearer and Sir Bobby Robson, Newcastle legends who, nevertheless, did not win a major trophy.View image in fullscreenNewcastle fans celebrate outside the St James’ Park ground.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianOne of them was travel agency owner David Carruthers, 63, a lifelong supporter who had travelled up from York to watch the match in a Newcastle pub with his wife Diane.“It’s not easy being a Newcastle fan,” he said. “It’s challenging. It’s easy being a fan of teams like Liverpool but you always support your team – and then you get days like this. We had an amazing, unbelievable night watching it and it is good for the city as well.”All clubs say they have the most passionate, committed fans but some would say Newcastle fans have that little bit more. The celebrations in both London and Newcastle were, to say the least, wild.LiveNewcastle United win Carabao Cup to end 70-year trophy drought – videoOn BBC Radio Newcastle, wall-to-wall football chat on Monday, one listener got in touch to say he was changing the name of his dog to Eddie Howe. “Let us know,” a hoarse-voiced breakfast host Matt Bailey asked listeners. “Are you renaming your pet?

His name is Dan Burn.”It was Burn, a one-time Asda trolley-pusher from Blyth, who achieved Newcastle immortality by scoring the first goal on Sunday and going on to be given the player of the match award.On Monday, many fans felt compelled to go to the Antony Gormley statue the Angel of the North,aptly adorned with a Newcastle shirt by persons unknown.View image in fullscreenThomas England and his daughter Amelia by the Angel of the North statue.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianThey included ThomasEngland, 33, who had travelled up from Merthyr Tydfil with his young daughter Amelia to watch the match in Newcastle. “The atmosphere was electric.

Last year the NFL made $132m last year from gambling related sponsorships. They also received an additional $120m from licensing data to help set odds.The phone apps have meant people are “constantly nudged to bet on everything” and “ordinary people are getting exposed to extreme levels of gambling they might never have otherwise encountered”.It’s mostly affected young men who are offered free money if they sign up yet with “tons of small print” meaning the deals are never quite as great as they sound.It’s also led to a rise in gambling related abuse woth players criticised online if people lose.Oliver said that 1% of US adults now have a severe gambling problem while 2-3% have a mild or moderate problem. That’s 7.5-10 million people.He said that it’s “not a tragic side effect of this industry, it’s based into the business model” and “betting until all your money has gone can be scarily easy to do when the casino is literally inside your pocket”.The industry also finds ways of “weeding out winning customers” but this same data “could presumably identify those with addiction problems and direct them toward help”.US gambling giants face scrutiny over VIP programs: ‘Profits take priority over people’Read moreHe added that “every part of this system is set up to reel gamblers in and keep them playing” and advertising connections have meant that “everyone in the sports world has now become compromised by an industry that is able to prey on its most vulnerable customers with incredible precision”.The ease of playing means that people can hemorrhage money throughout the day. “It shouldn’t be this easy to lose this much,” he said.But while some states have laws in place to protect people, they just don’t enforce them as much as they should, such as state programs where addicts sign up to block themselves from betting.“We can change the trajectory here, we did it with cigarette advertising,” he said before saying that the adverts “should have to be much more reflective of what these companies actually do to people”.Explore more on these topicsJohn OliverJohn Oliver recapUS televisionTV comedyGamblingComedyTelevisionUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Work is underway to open up the pathway to the prosStephanie KaloiMon 17 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 11.46 EDTShareIn the coming weeks, tens of thousands of people will attend the Final Four of the men’s and women’s NCAA Tournaments. They’ll pack into raucous arenas and argue with strangers about the merits of college basketball stars – and then celebrate victory or mourn defeat with those same strangers hours later. At the center of the commotion and excitement will be eight teams, young men and women who are among the best in their sport.But there will be another group of athletes in San Antonio at the same time as the men’s Final Four is played there, and it will include the best basketball players from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). The 48 players – 24 men and 24 women – are not going to be in Texas for the Final Four, but instead will compete in the2025 HBCU All-Star Game & Experience, a five-day event that culminates in back-to-back championship matches on 6 April.This year marks the fourth men’s HBCU All-Star Game and the first time organizers have added a game for women, something they said is “long overdue.” It’s also the first in San Antonio, a city that is “buzzing about this event,” says founder Travis L Williams, who coached for a combined 17 years at Tennessee State University and Fort Valley State University. The six-day event is about more than a basketball game; Williams and the event’s organizers also host a college and scholarship fair, a social justice and civil rights panel and a pro day combine and a fan fest. The event will also includeBAM testing, a performance evaluation service used by the NBA as part of the draft. The organizers enlisted the service to make sure HBCU athletes are evaluated in the same manner that potential NBA and WNBA draft picks are.“We want no excuses,” Williams says. “We want to level the playing field and provide these amazing opportunities for both our men and women in this space, and there’s not a better audience than college basketball’s biggest weekend.”Ukrainian basketball star Max Shulga: ‘The game is my getaway, my outlet’Read moreThat goal is admirable and ambitious, but is it enough? HBCU hoopers have long been ignored in America. The NBA has drafted 351 men from HBCUs into the league; the first was West Virginia State’s Earl Lloyd in 1950, and the most recent was Kyle O’Quinn in 2010. The WNBA, meanwhile, has drafted only seven women from HBCUs, and none are on team rosters this year.Those numbers and stats can start to feel like a lack of representation, something that could discourage other talented HBCU athletes from pursuing collegiate basketball seriously, says WNBA and NBA analyst Diamond Forrest. Forrest, who spent two seasons playing for HBCU Jackson State, pointed to the case of last year’s third-round pick Angel Jackson as an example.It’s not news that most third-round WNBA picks don’t usually end up playing in their rookie season, if ever – teams have limited roster space, so later draft picks are the most likely to be dropped – but Forrest was frustrated when Jackson was cut by the Las Vegas Aces. Before her dismissal, the Aces posted photos of Jackson in a jersey (a common practice after players are drafted), something Forrest found frustrating because she says it felt like a bait-and-switch.Teams like the Aces could do more than draft a player from an HBCU for a photo opportunity, she believes. “You could keep them on the roster and develop them,” Forrest says. “There’s no reason why Angel Jackson isn’t now on the Aces’ roster. She could learn from A’ja Wilson – they play the same position.”The reality is that it might not be that easy. It’s not as if NBA and WNBA scouts and teams aren’t aware of HBCU programs and events like the HBCU All-Star Game. As Williams notes, the 2024 HBCU combine was attended by 15 of the NBA’s 30 teams – but no one was picked up. And that’s partly due to structural reasons that mean HBCU programs find it tougher to attract the best high school players.-----Jim Crow America is an important starting point when attempting to understand some of the challenges HBCUs are up against. 1954’s Brown v the Board of Education, struck down racial segregation in the classroom. But the athletic departments at southern universities and colleges remained segregated by law, and those at their northern counterparts practiced “de facto segregation,” says Eric Moyen, assistant vice-president for student success at Mississippi State University.The situation began to change significantly after Kentucky’s all-white team lost to Texas Western’s all-Black starting five in the championship game of the 1966 NCAA Tournament. White colleges started to recruit Black players, and HBCUs – already underfunded – soon found they couldn’t compete with powerhouse programs like Alabama and Duke when it came to signing the best young talent. Those big programs could (and still can) offer Black athletes perks like television exposure and a degree of celebrity that HBCUs are unable to, Moyen says. “Does an 18-year-old want to fly on a chartered jet to his next game or take a 10-hour bus ride?”That lack of funding – a systematic issue that touches everything from state support to athlete lifestyle – has a massive ripple effect; if HBCUs can’t attract top talent, they won’t be able to take advantage of revenue from televised games, and they don’t benefit from payouts from participating in the NCAA Tournament. That lack of revenue means they are less attractive to the best high school players and the whole cycle starts again. And even if a less recruited players suddenly develops into a real talent at an HBCU, they are likely to be lured by a bigger program.“This year in the NCAA Tournament, there will be dozens of players who were overlooked in high school recruiting but became excellent players at ‘mid-majors,’” Moyen says. “Those players have jumped to big-time schools wherethey can get paid now, gain exposure, and face competition that will help prepare them for the NBA. There will be a limited number of universities that will be able to keep up with this model, and that is where the HBCU All-Star Game may be able to carve out a niche and strengthen HBCU schools and conferences.”Williams took 10 men’s players from the 2024 HBCU All-Star Game to Paris last summer to participate in Quai 54, the world’s biggest streetball tournament, against some of the top talent around the world. Williams wanted to “provide more opportunities on a global scale” and expand the athletes’ horizons. Approximately 50% of the athletes who have participated in past HBCU All-Star Games are now playing professionally overseas. In fact, providing opportunities to play professional basketball outside the US, with showcases such at Quai 54, could even be the kind of incentive that can help something like the HBCU All-Star Game continue to grow, and could encourage higher caliber athletes to attend HBCUs – even over powerhouse teams – in the first place.-----Each year’s HBCU All-Star Game has been built on the success of the previous year’s edition. Williams says the first three games, in 2022, 2023, and 2024, pulled in a combined 1.6 million viewers on CBS, the city of San Antonio has embraced an event previously enjoyed by Houston and New Orleans, and this year’s group of athletes will undoubtedly play their hearts out. But there is still some way to go.“To put it in perspective, there are 450 NBA players, 30 NBA teams, 156 WNBA players, and 13 WNBA teams,” Williams says. “[HBCUs] have zero representation in both. We are just not provided the same exposure and access.”But Williams believes this year’s HBCU’s All-Stars are among the best he has come across. “And so events like this, platforms like this are important to showcase the best in Black college basketball,” he says. “The game is continuing to grow, grow, grow, and folks really still don’t understand the magnitude of it because I feel like we haven’t scratched the surface.”For Williams and his team, this year’s HBCU All-Star event is about more than what happens on the court; it’s about bringing his athletes to college basketball’s biggest weekend and giving them the largest stage possible. And after that, it’s all out of his hands and into those of the powers that be.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Staley’s team are looking to be the first team to repeat as women’s champion since UConn won four straight from 2013-16. The Huskies, who are a two-seed, are looking to end that drought with star Paige Bueckers. They’ll have to go out west if they reach the Sweet 16 and a potential rematch with JuJu Watkins and the Trojans could be waiting in the Elite Eight.For the first time in NCAA history, there will be a financial incentive for women’s teams. They will finally paid for playing games in the NCAA Tournament just as the men have for years. So-called performance units, which represent revenue, will be given to women’s teams for each win they get. A team who reach the Final Four could bring their conference roughly $1.26 million over the next three years in financial performance rewards.This comes a year after the women’s championship game that saw South Carolina beat Caitlin Clark and Iowa pull in better TV ratings then the men’s title game.In the men’s Tournament Auburn are the top overall seed, with Duke, Houston and Florida joining the Tigers on the No 1 line.The NCAA selection committee favored the regular-season champs of the record-setting Southeastern Conference despite three losses in their last four games, along with a loss to Duke back in December in the season’s lone meeting between the teams.The Tigers (28-5) and Gators were two of the 14 SEC teams to make the field, which will be the most for a conference in the history of the tournament. In something of a surprise, both North Carolina and Texas slid in off the bubble.The 68-team bracket starts whittling down on Tuesday with preliminary games, and the main draw kicks off on Thursday and Friday, with 32 games at eight sites around the country.The selection show began with a heartfelt tribute to the late Greg Gumbel, the CBS stalwart who oversaw the bracket unveiling for decades.North Carolina looked all but out, a victim of a 1-12 record against so-called Quad 1 opponents and part of a conference (ACC) teetering on the verge of a historically bad season. But the Tar Heels made it, thanks maybe to a strong nonconference slate, while Texas were also in – their seven wins against Quad 1 teams outweighing their overall 15 losses.The SEC’s 14 teams were followed by the Big Ten with eight and Big 12 with seven. The ACC, meanwhile, ended up with four teams, barely avoiding its worst showing since 2000, back when the conference was half the size it is now.Even in a down cycle, the ACC has Duke, and Duke have arguably the best player in the country in freshman Cooper Flagg, a 19-point, 7.5-rebound-a-game freshman whose ankle injury, the school says, will not keep him out of March Madness.Elsewhere in the bracket, coach Rick Pitino leads his unprecedented sixth program into the tournament, and what a road he would have to take to get to the Final Four.First, he will travel to Providence, the same building where the coach led the Friars to a surprise Final Four trip back in 1987, to lead St John’s in a first-round game against Omaha. Pitino’s second game could come against Arkansas and John Calipari in what would be a titanic matchup between two of the game’s biggest coaching names.Another coaching legend, Tom Izzo, leads Michigan State to their 27th straight tournament. The Spartans are seeded second and will face America East champion Bryant in its opener. And Gonzaga are in for the 26th time, though extending their streak of making the second weekend to 10 years will be tough. The Bulldogs, after an “off” year in which they still won the West Coast Conference, are seeded eighth and could face Houston in the second round.Explore more on these topicsNCAA TournamentCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsBasketballnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.London-based Nothing has brought one of the last things setting top-level phones apart from cheaper mid-range models down to a more affordable price: high-quality camera zoom.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Cameras have long been the battleground of the most expensive phones, each vying for better quality, longer reach and multiple lenses. While much of this costly progress has trickled down to cheaper models, optical zoom cameras are few and far between below the £600 mark.The £449 (€459/$459/A$849) Nothing 3a Pro sets itself apart with the company’s trademark transparent, light-up design and a 50-megapixel 3x telephoto camera on the back that rivals phones costing twice as much.It builds on the excellentPhone 2awith a similar set of “glyph” LED strips on the back that light up in complex patterns for notifications, calls, timers, charging, the volume and other fun things.View image in fullscreenThe three glyph light strips around the camera bump are particularly useful if you place your phone screen-down when not in use.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe transparent glass back reveals an interesting design beneath, but the gigantic camera cluster is the standout element. It is huge and protrudes far enough for it to act like a grip for your finger on the back of the phone. The back and front of the 3a Pro are glass, while the sides are a high-quality plastic.The screen is a large and fast OLED, which looks really good and has fast optical fingerprint scanner under it towards the bottom.SpecificationsScreen:6.77in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (387ppi)Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3RAM:12GBStorage:256GBOperating system:Nothing OS 3.1 (Android 15)Camera:50MP main, 50MP 3x tele and 8MP ultrawide, 50MP selfieConnectivity:5G, eSIM, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4 and GNSSWater resistance:IP64 (spray resistant)Dimensions:163.5 x 77.5 x 8.4mmWeight:211gView image in fullscreenThe battery fully charges in 80 minutes, hitting 50% in 25 minutes using a 50W USB-C power adapter (not included).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 3a Pro has Qualcomm’s mid-range Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip, which can’t rival the top chips for raw power but is fast enough to make the phone feel snappy and responsive. It can handle most games fine without getting hot and is about 25% faster than the Phone 2a.The battery life is great, lasting about three days between charges with general use, including more than seven hours spent actively using the screen. Gaming and using the camera dents the battery, but even so most should only need to charge it every other day.NothingOSView image in fullscreenNothing’s monochrome options are novel, but you can have standard colour icons, too.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 3a Pro runs Nothing’s version of Android 15, which offers a relatively clutter-free, fast and unique experience filled with nice design touches based around dot-matrix art. There are plenty of customisation options to tailor the look and feel of the phone, including monochrome and distraction-free themes, but generally it is just a bit more fun than most version of Android.It has a few of Google’s AI tools, including Gemini, and various image editing tools in Google Photos. But the big new addition is Nothing’s Essential Space app, which acts like an AI-powered notebook capable of collecting and analysing various screenshots, text and voice notes.A dedicated button on the side of the phone captures what’s on screen, while pressing and holding records a quick voice note to go with it. The app analyses the content to create summaries, transcriptions and possible actions, such as reminders or to-do lists. Opening the app shows the various things you’ve captured sorted into collections, such as a cross between Pinterest and a note-taking app such as Evernote.View image in fullscreenPress the Essential key in the side of the phone to capture and summarise what’s on screen, then ask questions of it or use the app as a repository and reminder.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe app is a little basic at the moment and requires a connection to Nothing’s servers to work, but the idea is sound and it currently works well as a way of keeping screenshots and other data out of your gallery. The AI summaries, like all AI tools, are a bit hit and miss, and your various captures are stuck on your phone, but it has far more potential than a lot of gimmicky AI features currently being touted by various parties.Unfortunately, you can’t customise the side button to do something else, so if you don’t like Essential Space it is rendered useless, unlike rivals such as Apple’s action button. I also pressed it a lot, mistaking it for the power button, taking a fair number of accidental screenshots in the process.Nothing will support the 3a Pro with three years of Android updates and a total of six years of security updates. That is a year or so behind the best in the business but a lot longer than many rivals, which is good to see.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app is straightforward and has plenty of features including a macrophotography mode.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 3a Pro has three cameras on the back: an 8-megapixel ultrawide, a 50MP main and a 50MP 3x telephoto, the later of which is the standout feature for this price range of phone.The ultrawide camera is reasonable, if a little soft on detail. The main camera is pretty good all round with solid colour and dynamic range, making a decent job of most situations. The 3x zoom camera is arguably the best of the lot, producing nicely detailed images with reasonable reach. All three cameras suffer from a bit of overprocessing, which you can see when you zoom in on photos. The main and telephoto cameras offer an in-sensor zoom to 2x and 6x respectively, but they are not great showing obvious artefacts, while zooming beyond 10x the images start to look more like oil paintings than photos.Overall, the camera on the 3a Pro is one of the best for a mid-range phone and offers a real zoom, which is rare at this price. It won’t trouble the top Android or iPhones, however.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe Essential Key is immediately below the power button on the right side of the phone, and is easily pressed by accident.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianNothing says the battery maintains at least 90% of its original capacity for at least 1,200 full charge cycles. The Phone 2a is generally repairable in the UK. Screen replacements cost £89 or batteries cost £29 plus about £35 labour and shipping by Nothing.The device is made of recycled aluminium, copper, plastic, steel, tin and other materials. It has a carbon footprint of 51.3kg CO2 equivalent. The company publishessustainability reports.PriceThe Nothing Phone 3a Pro costs£449(€459/$459/A$849).For comparison, the Phone 3a costs£329, theGoogle Pixel 8acosts£499, the Samsung Galaxy A56 costs £499 and theiPhone 16ecosts£599.VerdictNothing hits the right notes with the Phone 3a Pro to make it one of the best mid-range phones you can buy.Very few rivals have a real zoom camera at this price, let alone one as good as on the back of the 3a Pro. It has a big, crisp and smooth display, solid mid-range performance and very long battery life. A standout design adds interest to the otherwise dull phone market, while good software with up to six years of support means it will go the distance.Nothing’s AI-powered screenshot and note-taking app shows potential, even if it is a bit basic at the moment. But giving it a dedicated button that can’t be used for anything else feels like a miss. I would rather choose which app or function to bind to the button.The mid-range smartphone market is rapidly becoming packed with very good options, but Nothing manages to stand out and is worth considering when your old phone gives up the ghost.Pros:good camera with 3x optical zoom, interesting design, great software with six years of support, good screen, solid performance, long battery life, good fingerprint scanner, splash resistant.Cons:AI features need work, extra button can’t be customised, only three years of Android version updates, enormous camera cluster protrudes from the back.View image in fullscreenA fast and accurate optical fingerprint scanner is in the bottom part of the screen, making unlocking the phone easy.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesAndroidMobile phonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

He was subsequently placedunder formal investigationand banned from leaving the country, where he holds citizenship.Durov said in a message on Telegram that he had returned to Dubai after spending several months inFrance“due to an investigation related to the activity of criminals on Telegram”.“The process is ongoing, but it feels great to be home,” he said. “I want to thank the investigative judges for letting this happen, as well as my lawyers and team for their relentless efforts in demonstrating that, when it comes to moderation, cooperation and fighting crime, for years Telegram not only met but exceeded its legal obligations.”Reports by Agence France-Presse suggest a judge had modified the conditions of his bail several days previously and authorised him to leave France for “several weeks”.Durov flew to Dubai on Saturday morning from the airport where he had been arrested. His lawyers have been approached by French media but have made no comment. Until his conditions were relaxed, he was required to report to a police station in France twice a week and had paid €5m (£4.2m) bail. The conditions were relaxed from 15 March until 7 April.Durov’s arrest last year was the first time the founder of a major social media company has been held over content on their platform. With more than 900 million active users, Telegram is one of the world’s top messaging apps. Durov, who launched the app in 2013, is worth more than $12bn, according to theBloomberg billionaires index.After days of questioning after his arrest, he was charged with several counts of failing to curb child sexual abuse images and other extreme material and released on bail.Durov is a self-avowed libertarian who has championed encrypted messaging. Telegram permits users to post video, pictures and comments on “channels”. Durov’s has just under 12 million subscribers. Telegram also supports “groups”, or communities with up to 200,000 members each.Talking to the US journalist Tucker Carlson last year, Durov said: “[People] love the independence. They also love the privacy, the freedom, [there are] a lot of reasons why somebody would switch to Telegram.”Durov holds Russian, French and United Arab Emirates passports. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, expressed surprise at his arrest last year, calling France’s actions “selective in nature”.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has defended a decision to grant French nationality to Durov in 2021, saying it was a strategy concerning those who “shine in the world”. Sources close to the investigation said Durov had emphasised his links to Macron during questioning.Telegram has also flagged attempts to clean up the platform since Durov’s arrest. According to the app’smoderation page, it has blocked more than 6.1m groups and channels in 2025, including 160,000 related to child sexual abuse material. Telegram also claims to have blocked 57,000 “terrorist related communities” this year.Durov has also received support from Elon Musk, who posted comments on his social network X under the hashtag FreePavel. The Kremlin has warned France against turning the case against Durov “into political persecution”.Durov initially criticised his arrest and extracts from his questioning, seen by AFP, show that he initially blamed French authorities for failing to alert Telegram to alleged criminal activity.But he also said that “it was while I was held in custody that I realised the seriousness of all the allegations”. Investigators have confronted him with more than a dozen specific cases, ranging from child abuse to drug trading, scams, arms sales and the hiring of hitmen.Explore more on these topicsTelegramFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

Our focus should be on helping people interpret information betterAdam KucharskiMon 17 Mar 2025 08.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 09.29 EDTShareOn 30 October 1938, a US radio station broadcast a dramatisation of HG Wells’s apocalyptic novel The War of the Worlds. Some listeners, so we’re told, failed to realise what they had tuned into; reports soon emerged of panicked audiences who had mistaken it for a news bulletin. A subsequent academic study estimated that more than a million people believed they were experiencing an actual Martian invasion.A startling example of how easily misinformation can take hold, perhaps. But the story is not all it appears to be. Despite oft-repeated claims, the mass panic almost certainlydidn’t happen. In national radio audience surveys, only 2% reported listening to anything resembling The War of the Worlds at the time of the broadcast. Those who did seemed to be aware that it was fiction. Many referred to “the play” or its narrator Orson Welles, with no mention of a news broadcast. It turned out that the academic analysis had misinterpreted listener accounts of being frightened by the drama as panic about a real-life invasion.Almost a century later, the idea of large-scale misinformation is, if anything, more salient. We regularly see headlines about the millions who have been exposed to falsehoods online. In a 2018Gallup surveyof Americans, respondents reckoned on average that two-thirds of the news they encountered on social media was misinformation. But, as with thatWar of the Worlds broadcast, misinformation isn’t necessarily the problem we think it is. As Covid spread during spring 2020, monthly visits to English-language news websites labelled “untrustworthy” by the rating service NewsGuard – such as Breitbart and the Daily Wire –increasedfrom 163m to 194m. But during the same period, visits to “trustworthy” sources, such as the BBC and the Guardian, grew from 5bn to 8bn. In other words, credible websites received 40times more visits in early 2020 than questionable ones.One of the things I’ve found surprising is how much of the evidence conspiracy theorists have to hand is technically trueOutright misinformation may be rarer than we think; it is also only part of the problem when it comes to navigating fact and fiction. There are two errors we must avoid if we want to get closer to the truth: we shouldn’t believe things that are false, and we shouldn’t discount things that are true. If we focus solely on reducing belief in false content, as current efforts tend to do, we risk targeting one error at the expense of the other. Clamping down on misinformation may have the effect of undermining belief in things that are true as well. After all, the easiest way to never fall for misinformation is to simply never believe anything.When I supervise students new to scientific research, I often see a change in their attitudes over time. Early on, they will treat papers in established academic journals as almost sacred. Because the paper has been published and peer-reviewed, goes the logic, it must be accurate. Then, as students realise these papers are often flawed, and occasionally outright fraudulent, doubt sets in. Everything could be wrong; nothing can be trusted.This is not a new problem. At the turn of the 20th century, the mathematician Henri Poincaré warned about the risks of too much trust or mistrust. “To doubt everything or to believe everything are two equally convenient solutions; both dispense with the necessity of reflection,” hewarned.Rather than either embracing or shunning all that we see, we must instead find ways to manage the risk that comes with trusting that something is correct. For example, in medicine, we typically design clinical trials in a way that reduces both the risk of concluding something works when it doesn’t, and the risk of concluding something doesn’t work when it does. We can never have total certainty in a result, but we can still build enough confidence in what we uncover for it to be useful.The damaging effects of overscepticism has made it a popular tool for those looking to undermine common knowledge. In 1969, with concerns about the harms of smoking on the increase, a tobacco industry memostated: “Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the ‘body of fact’ that exists in the minds of the general public.” They weren’t trying to get people to believe different facts; they were trying to undermine the idea there could ever be enough evidence to act.Often, it is not outright falsehoods that sow doubt online. Last year astudyfound that, among vaccine-related links viewed on Facebook during the spring 2021 Covid vaccine rollout, only 0.3% were flagged as false or out-of-context by factcheckers. Crucially, the posts that had the biggest overall impact on vaccine confidence were factually accurate, but potentially open to misinterpretation. For example, the most viewed link – which reached seven times more people thanallthe fact-checked misinformation combined – was this Chicago Tribune headline: “A Healthy Doctor Died Two Weeks After Getting a Covid vaccine; CDC [Centers for Disease Control] Is Investigating Why”. Strictly speaking, all of this was true. But it didn’t provide enough information to draw meaningful conclusions about the safety of vaccines or their relative risk compared to Covid.When I’ve encountered conspiracy theorists, one of the things I’ve found surprising is how much of the evidence they have to hand is technically true. In other words, it’s not always the underlying facts that are false, but the beliefs that have been derived from them. Sure enough, there will be a logical fallacy or out-of-context interpretation propping them up somewhere. But it’s made me realise that it’s not enough to brand something “misinformation”: more important is the ability to find and address the flawed assumptions hiding among voluminous facts. We must give people the conceptual tools they need in order to spot skewed framing, sleight of hand, cherry-picked data, or muddled claims of cause and effect.That means moving away from the idea that people are threatened by a tsunami of falsehoods. Calling information that is technically accurate untrue merely undermines trust. And if we issue warnings that most of the content you find on the internet is made up, it will distract from the bigger challenge of ensuring that technically accurate information is correctly interpreted.To borrow from Poincaré, believing that falsehoods are widespread and easily identified, or believing that most content is accurate and hence requires no further thought, are two equally convenient solutions. Both could harm our ability to tackle the much thornier reality of mistaken beliefs and misplaced trust online.Adam Kucharski is a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and author ofProof: The Uncertain Science of Certainty(Profile).Further readingMisbelief: What Makes Rational People Believe Irrational Things by Dan Ariely (Heligo, £10.99)The Age of Magical Overthinkingby Amanda Montell (Atria, £10.99)The Art of Uncertaintyby David Spiegelhalter: How to Navigate Chance, Ignorance, Risk and Luck (Pelican, £12.99)Explore more on these topicsTechnologyThe big ideafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Set inJapanin 1579, a time of intense civil war dominated by the feudal lord Oda Nobunaga, it follows two characters navigating their way through the bloody chaos: a female shinobi named Fujibayashi Naoe, and Yasuke, an African slave turned samurai. Japan has been the series’ most-requested setting for years, Ubisoft says.\"I've been on [this] franchise for 16 years and I think every time we start a new game, Japan comes up and we ask, is this the time?” says executive producer Marc-Alexis Coté. “We've never pushed beyond the conception phase with Japan until this one.\"The game comes ata crucial time for Ubisoftafter the disappointing performance of last year’s titles Star Wars Outlaws, Skull and Bones and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and the expensive closure of live service shooter XDefiant. There has also been afurore over the game’s Black and female protagonists, with the usual rightwing YouTuberscriticising them as “woke”and historically inaccurate, despite the fact that female warriors fought throughout the feudal period, and that Yasuke, the game’s Black samurai, is a historical figure.It is something the team is keen to address. “In-house historians were some of the first people to get staffed on the production team,” says creative director Jonathan Dumont. “A huge data bank is continually fed. As we get a sense of the era, the research effort then requires the help of specialists from around the world, including Japan, to narrow down details or understand finer cultural points.”View image in fullscreenThe game features advancements in lighting on landscapes.Photograph: UbisoftThere were also field trips to the game’s key locations of Kyoto and Osaka, which revealed elements the team hadn’t thought of. Coté recalls travelling to Japan to show local colleagues some technological breakthroughs the development team had made with lighting on landscapes. But they all shook their heads and said it wasn’t working. “I was like, ‘Why?!’” he says. “And they just replied: ‘That’s not how light falls on the mountains in Japan.’ So when our art director was there I asked him specifically to go look at the mountains. He went, took reference photos, and now we’ve captured it.”The team also had to render individual characters’ socks, because they are always depicted removing their footwear when entering a building. “The expectations have been this high throughout. It’s been a challenge.”Like all the previous Assassin’s Creed titles before it, Shadows uses authentic locations and historical figures to seat the game’s time-hopping narrative. Takeda, Fukuchiyama and Himeji castles are all replicated along with the villages, ports and rural landscapes of Central Japan. But as ever, this is first and foremost a game about sneaking over rooftops and skilfully taking down enemies. In a demo we played just before release, the lead characters are assaulting Himeji castle, and you can choose to play either as Naoe, skulking in the shadows using smoke bombs and silent attacks to escape detection, or Yasuke, running in with his sword and lopping off limbs. While Ubisoft has put immense effort into capturing the Azuchi-Momoyama period and the nature of the Iga peasant class (the possible origin of the modern ninja archetype), what matters equally is how good it feels to leap off a rooftop and decapitate a passing enemy.View image in fullscreen‘Incredibly bloody combat.’Photograph: UbisoftIn many ways, it seems the game draws as much from modern cultural depictions of the period and its warriors as from history. “Japanese storytelling has been very influential to the development of the game and to all occidental arts in general,” says Dumont. “Kagemusha from Kurosawa, 13 Assassins, Zatoichi, Sekigahara, The Tale of Genji or Musashi from Eiji Yoshikawa, to name the more obvious, have [all] helped shape our vision for the game. Even Studio Ghibli movies such as My Neighbour Totoro have helped us understand the countryside and vegetation.”It’s certainly an interesting time for Shadows to release. Multiple high-profile failures of recent live service games have left players yearning for the era of big single-player adventures, with decent sales reported for Obsidian’s recent RPG Avowed. Meanwhile, the huge success of FX/Hulu’sShōgunseries has brought feudal Japan back into the cultural spotlight, and its story of stranded English navigator John Blackthorne becoming a high ranking samurai somewhat reflects that of Yasuke.The game does look beautiful, with intricate environments, a dramatic weather system and incredibly bloody combat. Ubisoft has survived a difficult period; a lot now rests on its most treasured possession.Assassin’s Creed Shadows is released on 20 March for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox.

After an initial ban on weekends, he decided to introduce laptop restrictions across branches during the week. The London Fields branch operates a policy restricting laptops to high tables and windows.“I’d walk in some days, and there were laptops everywhere and I thought: let’s rewind to why we created this business, to create a community to make people come in and chat, whether with your partner, whether with your family, whether your friends. We don’t want laptops everywhere because it completely changes the energy and atmosphere of a location.”Chris Chaplin, owner of Milk and Bean in Newbury, was also disappointed when the dream to open a cafe that “felt like home” instead began to feel like running a co-working space.“We’ve had a few people who will come, work as a group, and then they’ll kind of huddle around one laptop, and brand us as like their office, and I really disagreed with it.”As a result they decided to restrict laptop use to one hour a day and enforce a total ban on weekends, a compromise they felt was fair given the small size of the cafe. The ban, encouraged by a friendly label in the cafe stating “we would rather the tables were reserved for laughter, flirting and conversation”, has mostly been received well by customers.View image in fullscreenA table sign at Milk and Bean in Newbury.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianGrounded, in Bow, London, which introduced a laptop ban from 11am to 3pm on weekdays, has faced mixed reactions from customers.“Some people are like: ‘Oh yeah, I’m so sorry, like I didn’t know,’” said Vestina Pranaityte, Grounded’s general manager. But others take issue. “We had a regular who used to come in literally when we open, around half seven, and stayed with her laptop ordering one long black till three o’clock. She wasn’t happy with the laptop policy and unfortunately she left us,” Pranaityte added.More than a quarter of adults worked part-time from home last autumn,according to the Office for National Statistics. Ed Fisher, a university student and customer at Grounded, says allowing laptops in cafes can benefit younger people who are less likely to have the space at home to work and study.“Housing in London can be quite cramped. I live in a flat with four blokes ... Not everyone’s got a massive place so if people want to get some work done, a cafe is a good spot to come,” he said.Chains in the UK including Costa, Caffè Nero and Starbucks have yet to join the flurry of independent cafes clamping down on laptop usage, although Starbucks in the US and Canadarecently ended its open-door policythat allowed customers to sit in and use facilities without making a purchase.A representative from Black Sheep Coffee, which has more than 100 branches worldwide, said: “How customers want to spend their time while drinking is totally up to them. We welcome everyone at Black Sheep, with or without a laptop: students and seniors, young professionals and stay-at-home parents. Whether you come alone, with a date, or with your entire family, whether you come to read a book or to have a meeting, we’re here to serve and make you feel welcome.”Explore more on these topicsLaptopsHospitality industryWorking from homeRestaurantsCoffeefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The letter lays out new conditions for institutions to receive federal funding, including in the form of student loans or scientific and medical research.Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in federally assisted programs or activities. The education department’s “Dear Colleagues” letter redefines the central targets of Title VI to centrally include supposed discrimination against whites. The letter was followed, on 28 February, witha set of guidelinesfor its interpretation. The novel understanding of anti-white discrimination in these documents is a chilling manifestation of educational authoritarianism.The novel understanding of anti-white discrimination in these documents is a chilling manifestation of educational authoritarianismIn the letter, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, Craig Trainor, writes:Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices. Proponents of these discriminatory practices have attempted to further justify them – particularly during the last four years – under the banner of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (‘DEI’), smuggling racial stereotypes and explicit race-consciousness into everyday training, programming, and discipline.However,the United States pretty clearly is built upon systematic and structural racism.US history shows that slavery was acentral factorin US wealth. The US was built on Indigenous genocide and colonialism, asseizing Indigenous landwas one of the reasons for seeking independence from England and is, in any case, foundational to the country’s formation. Structural racism also persists; for example, cities are segregated because of structural injustice in housing and mortgage law.The ways in which the US was built on racism, against Black Americans and Indigenous Americans, is central both to the study of its history and its present structure. If Americans do not have an understanding of this topic, they will not be well informed.The guidelines for what would count as a Title VI violation are vague. From the guidelines:a racially-oriented vision of social justice, or similar goals will be probative in OCR’s analysis of the facts and circumstances of an individual case.The most straightforward way to read the letter and the guidelines is as defining “school-on-student harassment” as including Black history. The letter treats teaching large swaths of Black and Indigenous history as akin to a white professor consistently referring to all of their Black students with a terrible racial slur.The “more extreme practices at a university” that “could create a hostile environment under Title VI” include “pressuring them to participate in protests or take certain positions on racially charged issues”. But reason, rationality and morality are sources of “pressure”. How does one distinguish the pressure placed on people by moral arguments for racially charged issues from other kinds of pressure?The guidelines create a culture of fear and intimidation around history. If one discusses Black history, one immediately risks endorsing the view that the United States “is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’”. The guidelines invite students to report their teachers and their school administrators for not adhering to a state-imposed ideology about history, as well as state-imposed ideology about gender, which threatens to make teaching critically about gender identity, or including trans perspectives, into school-on-student harassment. Failure to adhere to state ideologies about history and gender fits this new definition of “school-on-student harassment”. Billions in federal funding is at stake.View image in fullscreen‘By executive order, Trump is trying to dismantle the Department of Education.’Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/APThe guidelines are not just vague, they areintentionallyvague, in a way that would make it difficult for even a diligent administrator to interpret. They therefore allow maximum latitude for abuse. As the influential pro-Trump intellectual Jonathan Keepermanexplainedin the New York Times, referring to theTrump administration’swar on language:The things they’re attacking in these executive orders are sort of loose concepts. By focusing on these key terms that the left has grabbed on to, you can, without knowing much else about what you’re doing, at the scale of the entirety of the federal budget, basically remove a lot of the rot.The state of Florida has been a model of this strategy, leading to books being removed from school libraries because they normalize LGBTQ+ relationships, for example, and an unprecedented level of widespread fear among Florida’sprofessorsandteachers. But it has spread to other states. The state of Tennessee has an online“divisive concepts reporting tracker”form for students who wish to report professors whose teachingcan be seen as“promoting division between, or resentment of, a race, sex, religion, creed, nonviolent political affiliation, social class, or class of people”.The Dear Colleague letter and its attendant guidelines are easily read as banning teaching the idea that many Americans have racist attitudes. But understanding that many Americans have racist attitudes is central to understandingUS politics.For example,the Republican Southern Strategyinvolved exploiting racist attitudes against government programs they ideologically opposed, by using the term “welfare” as a dog whistle for these attitudes. We have strong evidence from social science to explain the mechanisms here. There isa large group of white Americanswho agree with racist stereotypes. Among these Americans, calling a program “welfare” decreases its support dramatically.The letter also appeals to another racist dogwhistle, “DEI”, which is employed in a similar way to justify banning classroom discussion of a range of concepts (including, it appears, discussion of the use of dog whistles in American politics).The guidelines are easily read as banning teaching the idea that many Americans have racist attitudesBy executive order,Donald Trumpis trying to dismantle the Department of Education. Following Project 2025’s recommendation, he appears also to be seeking to eliminate funding for Title 1, which provides crucial federal support for students in under-resourced schools in urban and rural areas, special education for disabled students and a range of other educational programs. The abolition of the education department would mean no federal oversight of drastically widening educational inequalities facing millions of students (and threatens to undermine tracking of data on racial disparities in educational resources, which could be used to substantiate the official state ideology that there are no structural disparities).Linda McMahon, the new education secretary,issued a statemententitled “Our Department’s Final Mission” on 3 March. In it, she wrote about the motivation for this final mission:After President Trump’s inauguration last month, he steadily signed a slate of executive orders to keep his promises: combatting critical race theory, DEI, gender ideology, discrimination in admissions, promoting school choice for every child, and restoring patriotic education and civics. He has also been focused on eliminating waste, red tape, and harmful programs in the federal government. The Department of Education’s role in this new era of accountability is to restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington.From now on, the education department’s main function appears to be targeting “critical race theory”, DEI and “gender ideology”. The final mission of the education department also includes the imposition of “patriotic education”, as if the United States were trying to imitate North Korea.Since McMahon’s announcement, the education department has launched a broad investigation into “antisemitism” at the nation’s colleges and universities. The first target was Columbia University, whose student body is over 20% Jewish; as well aspressuring Columbiato fire a distinguished law professor for pro-Palestinian statements andarresting one of the university’s studentsfor constitutionally protected speech, on 7 March, the education departmentcut $400m dollars in funding for Columbiafor allowing “harassment of Jewish students”. On 10 March, the civil rights office of the education departmentannouncedit was sending letters warning of potential enforcement actions to 60 universities under investigation for antisemitic discrimination and harassment, who will presumably face similar jaw-dropping cuts, under the guise of protecting Jewish students and faculty.Universities are among the most Jewish institutions in American life, in fact and in their resonance. As the historian Tim Snyder drylynoted:History teaches clear lessons about breakdowns in the rule of law and about campaigns against cities and universities. These are very often associated with antisemitism. It is very hard, for me at least, to think of historical examples of campaigns against universities and freedom of expression that were intended to benefit Jews.As the US watchesvideosof the regime’s police handcuffing and arresting student protesters in front of their families, as well as the destruction of the world’s greatest system of higher education, all supposedly in the service of “protecting” Jewish Americans, it is past time to note: this can’t be good for the Jews.As I have long warned, the media have been useful dupes for fascism. After years and years ofvilifyingacademia, first byraisinghysteriaabout “wokeness” andtoolittlefree speech(about eg race), and then by raising hysteria abouttoomuchfree speech (about Israel), the mainstream media has smoothly paved the path for educational authoritarianism. No one should be surprised by its arrival.Jason Stanley is Jacob Urowsky professor of philosophy at Yale University.

But his achievements will need to be safeguarded in an inevitable power struggle to comeMon 17 Mar 2025 14.25 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 14.49 EDTShareThe release on Sunday of the firstphotographof Pope Francis since his admission to the Gemelli hospital in Rome was an uplifting moment for the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics. In a messagepublishedby the Vatican, he said that he continued to feel “fragile” and was “facing a period of trial”. But after battling pneumonia in both lungs for more than a month, he is now off the critical list.How long the 88-year-old pontiff is able to carry on in St Peter’s chair, though, is another matter. Rumours have inevitably swirled regarding a possible resignation – following theprecedentset by his predecessor, Benedict XVI. Though he has overcome multiple health issues to pursue an active and dynamic papacy, a prolonged period of illness may lead him to contemplate stepping down if he can no longer carry out a pastoral role effectively.Progressives both inside and outside the church must hope that he is able to continue for a good while yet. The pope’s enforced absence from the world stage has served as a reminder of his importance, as universal values are repudiated and cast aside in the name of a narrow and aggressive national self-interest.The weaponisation of Christianity as a means of cultural exclusion, and as a justification for illiberal policymaking, has been a key feature of this shift in the zeitgeist. The latest egregious example is JD Vance, the US vice-president andCatholic convert, who on Sunday reportedlyattended massin Washington with the visiting British foreign secretary, David Lammy.In February, Mr Vancedefendedthe Trump administration’s mass deportations and savage cuts to international aid by recasting the Catholic idea of ordo amoris, or the right ordering of one’s love, as a justification for nativism. Just prior to falling ill, the pope sent an extraordinary and excoriatingresponseto US bishops. Citing the parable of the good samaritan, he described the “true” ordo amoris as the love that “builds a fraternity open to all, without exception”. Focusing solely on family, community or national identity, he added, “introduces an ideological criterion that distorts social life and imposes the will of the strongest”.It is something of a paradox that the head of the Catholic church – a deeply hierarchical institution that the pope has striven to reform – has become one of the west’s most combative defenders of liberal democratic values. But in relation to migration, theclimate emergencyand the rise of the oppressive form of rightwing communitarianism espoused by Mr Vance, Francis has been an influential and often lonely progressive voice.As that witness nears its end – although hopefully not imminently – the pope has wisely been making moves to protect his legacy. The likelihood of a traditionalist counter-revolution has been diminished by the energetic creation of new “cardinal electors” – almost three-quarters of the cardinals who will vote in the next conclave were his choices. Last month heappointedan Italian nun as the first female governor of Vatican City, and there have been other moves to safeguard the modernising spirit of his papacy.An eventualpower struggleis inevitable, in which Mr Vance and Washington’s other high-profile Maga Catholic, Steve Bannon, may try to bring a Trumpian influence to bear. For now though, it is good to see the vice-president’s arch-antagonist in the Vatican apparently on the mend. Hisadvocacyon behalf of “the global common good” has never been more relevant.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Because he’s high on his own supply of fake news | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreStill in its infancy, This Is Gavin Newsom has hosted several rightwing media figures including Michael Savage, Charlie Kirk and –almost unbelievably – Steve Bannon, one of the most regrettable people to emerge into public life in decades. This is the guy who trashes the reality-based press as the “opposition party”, and who believes in bamboozling the American people into submission by “flooding the zone with shit”.If you had to name the five people most responsible for Trump’s still-shocking rise to power, Bannon’s name would belong on that list. Don’t forget that he was sent to prison forcriminal contempt of Congressafter refusing to cooperate with the House of Representatives investigation of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.But Newsom found Bannon worthy of a cordial chat blasted out to his growing podcast audience.For some, it boggles the mind.“I know whatSteve Bannongot out of that interview – his fringe views were elevated and validated,” one prominent Democratic member of Congress told the journalist Oliver Darcy. “I don’t know what Gavin or Democrats got out of it.” Those “views”, naturally, included the repeated lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.AsMartin Pengelly reportedin the Guardian, one red-state Democrat – someone who knows a lot about bridging the gap in American politics – heartily disapproves.Anybody who’s paying close attention should know what he’s doing is deeply cynical and, ultimately, counterproductive“We shouldn’t be afraid to talk and to debate just about anyone,” said Andy Beshear, the Kentucky governor, “but Steve Bannon espouses hatred and anger, and even at some points violence, and I don’t think we should give him oxygen on any platform, ever, anywhere.” (Beshear, it should be noted, may also be looking at a presidential run, andwas considered asHarris’s running mate last year.)So what the heck is Newsom’s strategy, exactly?If you ask one of his podcast guests – Kirk, the pro-Trump extremist and podcaster – it’s simple enough.In an opinion piece on the Fox News website that followed his podcast appearance, Kirk called theCaliforniagovernor savvy and charming, but most of all ambitious. Newsom, Kirk quipped, wanted to be president more than any other person alive – and maybe dead, too.“He has a shark’s instincts and is hoping the voters will have a goldfish’s memory,” he posited.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Margaret SullivanFree newsletterSign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But don’t underestimate incremental change | Michael BrownsteinRead moreDemocrats are justifiably searching for a way to reach that wide swath of voters who seem permanently turned off to their party.And whatever one’s politics or affiliation, we all know that the US is terribly and destructively polarized. We must find a way to talk to each other across the great divide. We really do need to seek common ground.But the way to do it is not to normalize conspiracy theorists who have already done so much damage. It’s not to offer chummy chats – with little or no pushback – to those who want to trash vulnerable people, including transgender individuals and immigrants, or to repeat lies about a stolen election.This “rebrand” may help Newsom’s efforts to present himself as a healer or a centrist as he prepares to run for president in 2028.But anybody who’s paying close attention should know that what he’s doing is deeply cynical and ultimately counterproductive.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsGavin NewsomOpinionSteve BannonDemocratsUS politicsCaliforniaRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

But Trump’s habit iscosting US taxpayerstens of millions of dollars – even as he decries fraud and claims to slash waste in federal spending.Since he took office, Trumphas firedtens of thousands of federal workers and tried to shut down agencies, part of his effort to unilaterally dismantle the government.He has also made seven trips to Florida and the golf courses he owns there.This weekend, Trump made hisseventh visit to Florida and his sixth to his waterfront mansionand private club at Mar-a-Lago since his inauguration on 20 January. As Richard Luscombenotedin the Guardian last week, Trump’s frequent trips to his own properties not only cost taxpayer funds, but they benefit him directly – his businesses havecharged the US governmentto house Secret Service agents and other White House staff. In other words, American taxpayers pay the Trump Organization for the right to protect Trump and his family.During Trump’s first term, his properties had a history ofovercharging the Secret Service, by as much as 300% beyond the authorized government hotel rates, according to a report issued by Democrats in Congress last year. The report found that the Trump Organization charged the Secret Service as much as$1,815 a roomper night to stay at the Trump International hotel in Washington DC – billing the US governmentsignificantly morethan the hotel did for “rooms rented by the Qatari royal family and Chinese business interests”.Trump is using the presidency to seek golf deals – hardly anyone’s paying attention | Mohamad BazziRead moreIt’s difficult to gauge exactly how much the Secret Service and other agencies spent at Trump properties, since various reports and audits focus on specific time periods instead of his full four years in office. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) estimated that the Secret Servicepaid nearly $2mto Trump-owned properties. Trump visited his properties an astounding 547 times during his first term, according toan analysis by Crew. That included 145 trips to Mar-a-Lago, 328 visits to Trump’s various golf courses and 33 visits to the Trump hotel in Washington, which his company sold in 2022 but is nownegotiating to buy back.The cost to US taxpayers for Trump’s jaunts to Mar-a-Lago, which he calls his “winter White House”, far exceeds renting rooms for the president’s security entourage. A2019 reportby the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which examined four trips that Trump took to his Palm Beach resort during his first term, put thetotal cost at $13.6m, or about $3.4m for each visit. That includes flying Air Force One, along with a separate cargo plane that carries the presidential motorcade, between Washington and the Palm Beach international airport. With seven trips so far into his current term, the US government has likely already spent more than $23m on Trump’s golf outings.In other words, American taxpayers pay the Trump Organization for the right to protect Trump and his familyAnd that estimate doesn’t capture the full costs to taxpayers. The GAO report does not account for additional federal funds to reimburse local law enforcement agencies for protecting Trump while he’s in Florida. The Palm Beach county sheriff, Ric Bradshaw, has said that his department spends$240,000 a dayto help the Secret Service protect Trump. Bradshaw recently asked county commissioners for $45m in additional funds to provide security for Trump’s visits through the rest of this year – and the county is asking Congress to reimburse those costs.Trump often conducted official business and brought other senior US officials on his golf-focused trips to his properties – and he is repeating this pattern early in his second term, when he has visited Mar-a-Lago nearly every weekend. Trump’s frequent trips to his golf clubs send the message to foreign leaders, business executives, lobbyists, Republicans in Congress, and others who want to curry favor with the Trump administration that his properties are open for business. Throughout his first term, Trump dodged accusations that he was violating the US constitution’semoluments clauseas his businesses accepted money from foreign governments or lobbyists connected to them. Trump’s businesses received $7.8m from at least 20 foreign governments during his first administration,according to a reportissued by congressional Democrats last year, although a later analysis by Crew estimated that payments from foreign governmentsreached $13.6m.At Mar-a-Lago, business leaders wererecently offeredone-on-one meetings with Trump for $5m, while others paid $1m a seat for a small-group candlelight dinner with the president. Those funds seem to be going to Make America Great Again Inc, a Super Pac that spentmore than $450mon Trump’s presidential campaign last year, and is now expected to raise funds for a presidential library that would be built after Trump leaves office.Previous US presidents enjoyed playing golf, including Barack Obama and George W Bush. In fact, as a private citizen, Trumpmocked Obamadozens of times for leaving Washington to play golf during his presidency. In August 2016, during his first presidential campaign, Trump pledged he wouldn’t have much time to hit the greens. “I’m going to be working for you,”he told a rallyin Virginia. “I’m not going to have time to go play golf.”Of course, Trump ended upspending far moreof his first term as president playing golf than Obama had. And Trump’s problem is not how often he plays or how many weekends he takes off. Because Trump refuses to divest from ownership of his family business, his frequent golf outings go beyond questionable government spending – the president is enriching himself through payments that US agencies make to Mar-a-Lago and other Trump properties.Why is Donald Trump crashing the US economy? Because he’s high on his own supply of fake news | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreThe president is exempt from conflict of interest laws that ban federal employees from taking actions that would directly benefit them. Since the 1970s, US presidentshave voluntarily abidedby these laws, and put their financial holdings in a blind trust. But Trump refused to divest from his extensive business interests during his first term, creating aweb of conflictsand potential corruption. Today, Trump is more emboldened to ignore US laws and norms set by past presidents, partly thanks to last year’ssupreme court rulingthat concluded that Trump has “presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts”.Since taking office in January, Trump and his allies, especially the billionaireElon Musk, rushed to dismantle many of the safeguards put in place after the Watergate scandal to monitor government corruption and punish officials involved in ethics violations. Trump fired17 inspectors generalwho served as watchdogs over federal agencies, and he gutted aunit at the justice departmentthat was created in 1976, after Watergate, to prosecute public corruption cases.In his first term, Trump did not suffer any consequences forplaying a lot of golf– and using the presidency to enrich himself and his family. Now, he seems determined to spend even more time shuttling back and forth to his golf courses at taxpayer expense, with a chunk of that money going to his businesses.Mohamad Bazzi is the director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern studies, and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionGolfMar-a-LagoSecret ServiceUS politicsUS taxationcommentShareReuse this content"

Mass deportations don’t make us saferVeronica CardenasUS immigration has become a machine of surveillance and fear. We’re already seeing the consequencesMon 17 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTShareThis month marks 22 years since the creation of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).Created in the wake of 9/11 under the guise of national security, Ice was supposed to target real threats. Instead, it has become a machine of mass surveillance, indiscriminate arrests and fear-based enforcement that does little to keep us safer. Over the years, the harshest post-9/11 policies were rolled back after proving ineffective. But today, we are watching history repeat itself.The resurgence of Donald Trump’s immigration policies signals a dangerous return to a failed strategy – one that prioritizes public spectacle over public safety, conflates civil violations with criminal threats, and emboldens vigilantes to police immigration status as if it were their duty.I saw this firsthand in my 13 years as an assistant chief counsel for Ice. TheUS immigrationsystem was not designed to grant due process or ensure fairness; instead, it was built to prioritize deportation as a fallback when criminal prosecutions weren’t politically desirable or feasible.History has shown us that mass immigration enforcement does not make us safer. The George W Bush administration’s post-9/11 surveillance programs, such as the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS), failed to prevent terrorism and instead fueled racial profiling. The Bush administration implementedOperation Streamlineto criminally prosecute border crossers en masse and clogged federal courts with non-violent immigration cases. It wasted resources on prosecuting asylum seekers instead of targeting real security threats. These policies were ultimately scrapped because they didn’t work. Yet today, we see them creeping back to “Make America Safe Again”.The government is sanctioning a culture of fear where teachers, neighbors, and even classmates feel justified in weaponizing deportationIce has used social media to turn non-citizens’ arrests into entertainment. Mugshot-style images of detained immigrants flood Ice’sfeeds, lumping civil violators like visa overstays alongside serious offenders like drug smugglers. The message is clear: to Ice, all non-citizens are criminals. But this isn’t law enforcement – it’s propaganda designed to stoke fear and justify an indiscriminate dragnet that ensnares even those with no criminal record at all. By deliberately blurring the lines between civil and criminal violations, Ice fuels the false narrative that non-citizens are inherently dangerous. In reality,nearly halfof those arrested have no criminal record – but Ice is betting the public won’t care to check the facts.Beyond social media theatrics, Trump’s decision to rescind the2011 Sensitive Locations Memorandummarks a dangerous return to unchecked immigration enforcement. The memorandum required supervisory approval or pressing circumstances before authorities conducted arrests, searches, or surveillance in schools, hospitals, places of worship, and other locations. It was implemented to balance immigration enforcement with basic human rights – ensuring that fear of deportation wouldn’t prevent people from seeking medical care, sending their children to school, or practicing their faith. But now, with the border czar, Tom Homan, openly declaring that non-citizens “should be afraid”, immigration has strayed from recognizing those human rights – shifting instead to a strategy of fear in every aspect of daily life, pushing non-citizens into the shadows and leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. And we’re already seeing the consequences.‘Baby jails’ and first steps behind bars: Trump’s immigration agenda embraces family detention againRead moreTake the case of 11-year-oldJocelynn Rojo Carranza, who died by suicide after classmates threatened to report her family to Ice. Her death is a reminder that Trump’s immigration agenda doesn’t just empower officers to enforce the law – it emboldens ordinary people to act as enforcers themselves. By stripping away critical safeguards like the Sensitive Locations Memorandum, the government is sanctioning a culture of fear where teachers, neighbors and even classmates feel justified in weaponizing deportation. This turns immigration status into a tool of exclusion – one that doesn’t just separate families but erodes the very institutions meant to serve and protect communities.This reckless, fear-based approach isn’t just emboldening vigilantes in our communities – it’s dismantling federal law enforcement as we know it.Trump’s executive order Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats claims to bolster security, yet in reality, it guts agencies like the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). It pulls resources away fromcritical missionsand redirects them towards sweeping immigration crackdowns. Studies show precision-based enforcement effectively removes threats, while blanket policing wastes resources and weakens public safety. Instead of strengthening national security, Trump’s order scatters critical law enforcement assets, pulling them away from counter-terrorism, drug trafficking and violent crimes. By casting an indiscriminate net, his approach makes it harder, not easier, to catch real threats, like searching for a needle in a haystack while torching the entire field.We’ve seen this playbook before: policies that dehumanize, divide and erode public trust. But history doesn’t have to repeat itself. We know these policies don’t work. The question now isn’t just how much damage they will do – it’s whether we will stop them before it’s too late.Veronica Cardenas is a former assistant chief counsel with the Department of Homeland Security, immigration attorney and founder of HumanigrationExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionMigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Time for a dose of realismMon 17 Mar 2025 11.53 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 14.03 EDTShareWhat’s in a name? With T-levels, quite a lot. By choosing a title that sounded a lot like A-levels – with T for technical – the reformers behind England’s latest post-16 qualification sent a message that the days of vocational education’s second-class status were over. The two-year courses, launched in 2020 (and not adopted in the rest of the UK), were supposed to boost applied learning and the prospects of the more than 50% of young people whodon’t study for A-levelsfollowed by a degree.There are more than 20T-level options, ranging from early years education to engineering, with each student choosing only one. But nearly five years on, the courses haven’t caught on.Fewer than 3%of 16-year-olds enrol for a T-level, with the vast majority preferring either A-levels, older “applied general” qualifications (which include BTecs), or some combination.Last year, about7,000 students gained a T-level. The dropout rate is higher than for other 16-18 courses, with almost a third of those enrolled in 2022 giving up. The figures for a T-level foundation course, intended as a stepping stone, are even worse. In 2021-22, only8% progressed as intended. The picture is incomplete partly because ministers decided, in January,to postpone adding T-level datato performance tables.Behind the scenes, a row is raging over what happens next. The original plan was to scrap other vocational qualifications once T-levels were up and running. Further education and sixth-form colleges soon realised this was a terrible idea. In 2021, aProtect Student Choicecampaign was launched with a warning that if BTecs were axed, 155,000 teenagers would be leftwithout any options at all.You would think rising concern about young people not in education or work, and particularly the growing number of teenagers and young adults on disability benefits, would make post-16 education a priority. Last week, Keir Starmer spoke of a“wasted generation”. But Labour’s policy in opposition, which was to “pause and review” the situation, was ditched after the election. Instead the skills minister, Jacqui Smith, postponed the defunding of older qualifications and relaxed the rules around the T-level’s compulsory45-day work placement.But the central problem remains: T-levels are narrower and harder than the courses they are meant to replace, making them unsuitable for students without a specific job in mind, and also for those who passed GCSEs with grade 4s or 5s rather than 6s or higher. College leaders have repeatedly challenged ministers over which courses they think such students should take. They are waiting for an answer.It is not an accident that faith in T-levels transcends party loyalties. The commission that came up with them was appointed by a Conservative, Philip Hammond. But its leading figure, David Sainsbury, is an influential Labour donor (and the chancellor of Cambridge University). A non-partisan approach to curriculum reform is, generally, a good thing. The danger otherwise is that each new government rips up the efforts of the one before.But in this case the problem appears to be the reverse: groupthink. Even the education select committee failed to break the spell. Its chair, Robin Walker MP,accused Rishi Sunak’s governmentof “prioritising saving face over … the interests of young people” after a report highlighted evidence that T-levels do not balance “rigour and accessibility” and noted that more than £1bn had been spent. Another review, from the charitableEducation Policy Institute, proposed breaking down T-levels into smaller components. It also pointed out that economically disadvantaged pupils, and the growing number with special needs and disabilities, would be disproportionately affected by the removal of more accessible alternatives.T-levels will be examined by MPs again as part of a new inquiry into further education, and also inProf Becky Francis’s curriculum review. The danger is that the issue doesn’t gain the kind of traction that would force a proper rethink. That’s because aside from A-levels, sixth-form studies are seen as a niche subject. Arguably, this attitude is the most elitist thing about education in England – more than the role of private and grammar schools, more than the dominance of a handful of highly selective universities.It also helps explain why the reforms haven’t worked. The experts commissioned to reshape the curriculum were clever people with good intentions. But in a democratic society, where a high premium is placed upon personal choice, more attention should have been paid to what teenagers want and are capable of. Because in the end, that is the test: no one can force them.What happens now will depend partly on campaigners. Sainsbury continues to be active on the pro-T-level side. A charity he founded, theGatsby Foundation, told MPs that rival qualifications must be defunded to ensure T-levels’ success. Last year, Gordon Brown wasenlisted in support. But the Protect Student Choice campaign has backers too, including hundreds of college principals, MPs with colleges in their constituencies, and peers who care about further education.To put things right, it will be necessary to admit what went wrong. Far from sorting out vocational education, the T-level saga has turned into the latest illustration of a longstanding problem, namely the poor treatment of colleges by the educational powers that be. Anyone seeking further proof only needs to consider the decision not to give college teachers in England the same5.5% pay rise as school teacherslast year – a disgraceful choice by a Labour government that ought to be trying to narrow the school-college gap.As one college principal told me, it is as if the highly able people in charge of education don’t fully grasp that the 155,000 pupils that the sector is most concerned about really exist – or think that if they and their teachers only tried harder, their grades could be nudged up. The reality, it is worth remembering, is that fewer than a quarter of GCSEs in England are gradedhigher than a 6.Of course ambition is vital, but any teacher will tell you that realism matters too: students who lose confidence in their ability quickly lose interest. All young people need courses, pitched at a level they can manage, to provide them with knowledge and interests to support and enrich their lives – as well as helping them find jobs later on. It’s time to tell the truth: T-levels don’t fit the bill.Susanna Rustin is a Guardian journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But deteriorating reflexes, slowly progressing Parkinson’s disease (that he hadn’t disclosed to us), and general wear and tear had made him gradually less so.We, his children, had urged him to reconsider driving. No way. Mum had always been a far worse driver than him (we’d been reluctant to get in a car with her since she was in her 50s!). He did the driving. For both of them, living unsupported in the family home into their final years, the car remained their key to independence.The alternative, understandably, terrified them. So Dad insisted on continuing to drive. Never far. But far enough. To the supermarket. To the newsagent. To their local doctor.One day, a few streets from home, he hit the accelerator instead of the brake. The car shot through a T-intersection, collided with a moving tram, did a 360-degree spin, careened through the brick fence of a house, crossed the yard and only stopped when it smashed through the front veranda.The car was a write-off. The damage to the house extensive. Dad escaped injury. Unfathomably, nobody else was hurt.Not surprisingly, Dad’s licence was suspended. He wasn’t drunk (he rarely drank) or drug affected. Just old.He tried twice to get his licence back. To no avail. His wheels were gone (thankfully). But to my parents the end of his driving marked a dramatic transformation to their lives. Their independence was on the line. And so they had to move from the family home into a smaller place, walking distance from shops. They had to adapt to family taking them grocery shopping, to occasional deliveries, and to catching taxis (which they’d always considered a frivolous indulgence) to various appointments and for rare social outings.‘Be careful’ was the mantra of our parents as we set out to roam the neighbourhood as teens. We never were | Paul DaleyRead moreDad didn’t drive again (he died three years later). Our mother kept a car until her death a few years after that (but was self-aware enough to rarely drive). I lived interstate, so could help little day-to-day. But there’s no doubt that, if not for my sister and her family who drove them around and helped them with essentials, they both would have otherwise spent their final years in aged care (Dad had five months in a nursing home, our mother lived the final few weeks of her life in respite care).So many friends in my cohort (late gen X-ers) have elderly parents who live independently and still drive. While they have many concerns about their folks (the myriad health problems too often associated with ageing, their negotiation of stairs and bathtubs, and their maintenance of old family homes falling down around them), the thought that usually worries them most is of their parents on the road.Australia has an ageing population. Medical interventions (surgery and medication) mean we are living healthier for longer.Research shows thatmore older Australians are continuing to drive. For example, 71% of people aged 80-plus were still on the road in 2019, compared with 59% a decade earlier. Australian governmentdata from October 2024also showed that more than a fifth of the 1,295 people killed on the roads in the previous year were aged 65 and above.Older, more experienced drivers tend to be more cautious than those in their late teens and early 20s. But statistically, drivers aged over 70 had road death ratesabout the sameas those aged 17 to 25. They were also at significantly higher risk of serious injury if involved in collisions. This had nothing to do with the way they drove. Rather, it indicated their susceptibility to injury due to greater physical frailty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Something to do with our vast expanses and wide-open roads, perhaps.But the truth is we spend far more time equipping young people (technically, physically and emotionally) to drive than we do to ensuring their continued safety (and privileges) as road users when they age.While we nationalise the so-called “road toll”, the rules governing who gets to keep driving in old age vary greatly across the nation. Annual medical assessments for older drivers, for example, are mandatory in some states and not others.More recent familial experience has illustrated just how devastating a blow to personal dignity and independence is the suspension of a driving licence due to impairment associated with ageing. It is emotionally charged and very fraught, like so many decisions about how families deal with the cognitive and physical challenges of old age.Those moments when it is evident that we’ve switched roles, from the recipients of sage advice from our elders to our dispensing of it to parents, are painful and sobering.But some of them, like when our loved ones should permanently vacate the driver’s seat, are also freighted with community responsibility – while also standing to save those who gave us life.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsAgeingOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

The Dutch are asking the questionMark SmithIn our rainbow family, there are two dads and a mum – but the law in the Netherlands only recognises two of usMon 17 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 09.23 EDTShareOur daughter is very much on board with the idea that, unlike her, many other five-year-olds don’t have two fathers and a mum. “Only has one dad,” she’ll remark in a confidential tone of a newly made friend at the trampoline park or the swimming pool.My husband and I live in Amsterdam, a short cycle from our daughter’s mum, who is a longstanding mutual friend. Our daughter’s time is split between the two households. We are just one of many rainbow families in theNetherlands, where parents (often, a gay male couple and a single woman, or a lesbian couple) choose to have and raise children in constellations of more than two adults. The Dutch have a proud history of championing gay rights – it was back in 2001 that Amsterdam’s then-mayor presided over the world’s first same-sex marriages – and families such as ours have long been embraced here. And yet, from a legal point of view, we are unseen and, consequently, disadvantaged.Before my daughter’s conception, the three of us drew up a co-parenting agreement in the presence of a notary, planning for her arrival in (I dare say) more detail than most parents-in-waiting, affirming our shared desire for a three-way split in terms of responsibilities, and noting our collective attitudes to topics of consequence, from education to vaccination.But this kind of document is not legally binding because the Netherlands, in common with – well – everywhere, has no national legal provision for families such as ours. Most egregiously, the rights and responsibilities of the “non-biological” parent are unrecognised: only two names can be registered on a birth certificate.This disparity is a situation that Dutch lawmakers have been promising to rectify since 2016, when a government commission – with the support of gay rights organisations and the rainbow parenting foundation Meer dan Gewenst – firstadvised the governmentto recalibrate the definition of parenthood to reflect and recognise the way that children are increasingly being raised in a country that has long prided itself on progressiveness, pragmatism and tolerance.New researchcarried out by Ipsoson behalf of the independent research institute WODC suggests that between 1,700 and 9,200 “intentional multiparent families” exist in the Netherlands today – in a small country of 18 million inhabitants, that’s a whopping margin of error. But – paradox klaxon – how do you accurately quantify an invisible cohort?In our case, this political sloth affects the non-biological father most. While it might not affect us day-to-day, he is forbidden, for example, from making medical decisions on our daughter’s behalf, or travelling with her internationally without written permission from “the other two”. Our daughter may not discriminate between us as fathers, but the law certainly does. As a fellow gay dad told the Economist in 2019: “Legally I’m nothing to [my daughter]; emotionally I’m everything to her …”On 12 March, Teun Struycken, the state secretary for legal protection, attended a parliamentary debate to defend his decision to torpedo the latest attempt at “recalibrating the family” on budgetary grounds. While Struycken (who, ironically, is an appointee of the New Social Contract party) was at pains to signal that some of his best friends were in rainbow families, he said he wouldn’t be granting them legitimacy in law because the cost of implementing the proposed change, with its associated adjustments to the Netherlands’ tax and welfare systems, would be unjustifiably high.Struycken is part of the most rightwing Dutch government in years, a fact that led critics such as Michiel van Nispen of the Socialist party to ponder whether his decision was a lack of political will dressed up as parsimony – that other famed Dutch characteristic.It’s a shame. Even if you regard the scenario with extreme cynicism, the lowest estimate for activation (€11m) seems like a small price to pay for some very eye-catching pinkwashing, restoring the Netherlands back to its halcyon days, when it was regarded as the progressive capital ofEurope.Our hard-won rights are being erased one letter at a time | Eva WisemanRead moreA matchmaking service for “queer platonic coparenting” in the UK recently advertised a guest seminar by the Dutch author Sara Coster, whose speed-meeting events for prospective co-parents attract hundreds. She has even developed a set of discussion-provoking flash cards to that end (sample question: “Your child is ill and it’s changeover day. Will you bring your child to the other household, or let them recover first?”). Couldn’t “Dutch coparenting advocate” be a new kind of prestige cultural attaché, like a French sommelier, or a Japanese organising consultant?At the annual gay pride parade on Amsterdam’s canals, the number of revellers aboard the rainbow family-themed vessel grows visibly with each passing year. My two cents? We’re going to need a bigger boat.Mark Smith is an Amsterdam-based writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We’re citizens too: we all want improvementMon 17 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 12.57 EDTShareVery uncertain times for the nation’s civil servants. Last week, we werepublicly fat-shamedby the prime minister ahead of hislandmark speechat healthcare company Reckitt Benckiser’scampus in Kingston upon Hull. No, I’d never heard of it either, but it turns out to be a UK manufacturer of a number of brands responsible for just about holding austerity Britain together: Durex, Nurofen and Dettol.The thrusting symbolism of this choice of venue takes some beating. After all, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden – employing the regretful tones of an obstetrics consultant who’s seen it all – had on 9 March foreshadowed Keir Starmer’sfree-verse soliloquyby explaining how the civil servicewould be shaftedto get “more bang for our buck”.This cleared the way for state sex therapist Starmer to explain to acreepily enthusiasticHull audience exactly why we should all lie back and just let “project chainsaw” do its thing. Don’t worry, madam, with some painkillers and a bit of disinfectant, this won’t take long. Just askNHS England.If you think I’m overdoing the symbolism, you’re probably right. But this is, increasingly, the world we now live in, and when it comes to establishing his own personal brand, Starmer seems to be, at least at first glance, a master of metaphor. From theditching of his tiein the run-up to last year’s election, to thelocation of his first speechas PM, to thechoreographed theatricalityof his recent meeting with Trump, it should be no surprise that Starmer’s current vision for the British state is a reflection of how he sees himself. Check out his interview with theNews Agents podcastlast week, where he said: “I believe in the state. I think it should be active. I think it should be sleeves rolled up. It should be on the pitch, making a difference.”L’État, c’est moi.Problem is, this approach to communicating about this stuff is so last season. Most civil servants with a front-row seat at the recent jamboree of political messaging don’t disagree with the principles being proposed by Starmer, McFadden and Wes “I don’t feel the need to come inand make my mark with a top-down reorganisation of the NHS” Streeting. Why would we? As civil service union boss Dave Penman wrote in his gentle butnot entirely undeserved slapdownof my piece aboutStarmer’s aid cutsthe other week, it’s not really for civil servants to publicly question ministerial policy.Memo to Keir Starmer and co: we are civil servants – not the enemy | The civil servantRead moreBut in this case, it isn’t the message. It’s the delivery. Starmer has fallen into a bad habit of attempting to channel the Orange One when trying to get things done, from “build, baby, build” to the unedifying spectacle of his going full Doge on the civil service. That approach might work across the Atlantic, but as my civil service godfather Penman haspointed out, “scapegoating civil servants might generate headlines, but it’s not a strategy for effective reform”.Starmer, to his credit, seems to be coming to this realisation already, afterbeing warnedby former cabinet secretary Gus O’Donnell and the Institute for Government that an adversarial approach will probably spell disaster. Even the most gimlet-eyed civil servants among us shed a tear overhis beautiful letter to uson 10 March that gushed: “Your talent has been constrained for too long … we are proud of what you do and thank you for your continued dedication.”Very touching, but having seen first-hand every leader since Tony Blair have a go at overhauling the machinery of government, my hope is that this is a lesson Starmer won’t have to keep relearning. Because when it comes to civil service reform, what goes around, comes around.That’s because, simply, it’sbloody hard work. Maybe the hardest thing of all in public service. In fact, despite Starmer’s reforming zeal, in its short time in office, his own government has been unable to resist the temptation to create quangos and arm’s-length bodies –more than 20 of themhave been created since Labour came to power, including, perhaps ironically, Rachel Reeves’Office for Value for Money.Politicians also sometimes choose to forget that reform is already happening: the civil service is a very different animal than the one I first encountered in the early 2000s. It’s more diverse (though not yetdiverse enough), it’s far more decentralised (most UK civil servants work outside London), and it already spends£26bn a yearon digital technology and employs more than 100,000 digital and data professionals. Yes, every day, HMRC still takes 100,000 calls, and the Department for Work and Pensions still opens 45,000 envelopes, but don’t fall for the rightwing trope that we’re flabby, tepid, recalcitrant losersintent on destroying democracy.Above all, the prime minister needs to remember that civil servants are up for reforming the state. Not only do we have to work inside it, we, too, are trying to get that appointment with a GP. We know what it’s like to bein receiptof the very benefits we administrate. And we, too, feel deepfrustration with the bureaucracyand – as I wrote at the end of last year –want to work with the PMto improve how public services are delivered. While the prime minister’s language has beenhurting civil service moralefor quite some time now, we aren’t afraid of getting our hands dirty to make change happen.

It will be a crucial election for the people of Cymru, where Welsh Labour has been in charge for a quarter of a century. We have Britain’slongest NHS waiting listand the UK’sworst school-test resultsranking.Wales is desperate for a grown-up discussion about how to fix these problems, and for political parties that have the drive, vision and competency to make it happen. But what they are likely to get, the polls show, is a big dose ofReform UK, with the party polling at around 23%. This means it could become the largest party.Make no mistake, the answer to none of Wales’s complex and deeply rooted challenges is Nigel Farage and his former company, now party. Since the general election, Reform has made its stance onWalesvery clear. As Maya Angelou said: “When someone shows you who they are, believe them.” So who has Reform shown itself to be regarding Wales?Let’s start with its rationale for running in Wales. At itsfirst Welsh conference, at the Celtic Manor hotel near Newport back in November, I had a conversation with one of its MPs, Lee Anderson. When I asked where he stood on devolution, he said it had been a “disaster”, but from his party’s point of view it had “benefits” because Reform could “win lots of seats that they can use to their advantage”.So let’s be clear. Its aim in running for the Welsh parliament is not to improve the lives of people in Cymru, but to gain the resources that come with elected members to position the party for a run at the next general election. Time and again at that conference, Reform staff and politicians told me the Senedd was a convenient staging post for gains elsewhere in the UK. The disdain for Welsh democracy, and therefore the Welsh people, is plain.Additionally, neither Farage nor Anderson could give one specific policy that Reform had for Wales, and clearly neither knew really basic information about the country, such as the fact that our largest public sector organisation – Betsi Cadwaladr health board – has been in special measures for the past decade. Add to this the fact that the party is saying it believes it will form the next Welsh government while simultaneously refusing to name a Welsh leader. Welsh voters, therefore, will be offered a “mystery box” for the identity of their nextfirst minister. The contempt in which Reform holds Wales is clear.If you want a flavour of what Reform politicians could look like in Wales, you need look no further than when they have previously been elected (though under other guises). Former Ukip member of the Senedd Gareth Bennett spent almost£10,000 of taxpayers’ moneyin rent and other costs for a constituency office that never opened. Last month, a Reform councillor in Torfaen posted an image of himself“officially” cutting a ribbonat the opening of a Lidl despite the supermarket saying there had been no such ceremony. Oh, and climate change denier andbrown-envelope enthusiast Neil Hamiltonwas also a member of the Senedd for Ukip …The door for Reform to make inroads in Wales has been left wide open by the Welsh Conservative party, whose actions as the largest opposition have been so incalculably pathetic that it’s hard to see how they could be worse. Think I am exaggerating? Let me give you an example.For the past six months, the WelshLabourparty, which is one short of a majority, has been desperately trying to work out how to pass its budget. There was an indicative vote inside the Senedd in February. The night before, the Welsh Tory press office emailed journalists a release titled “Labour deserve to lose vote on woeful budget”.The very next day, it turned out that the government was set to win the vote by default because – wait for it – the Welsh Conservative leader, Darren Millar, was going to miss it in order to fly to Washington DC for aprayer breakfast that Donald Trumpwas attending. To be clear, we are talking about the official leader of the opposition inside the Senedd. Imagine if before the general election, Keir Starmer had allowed a Tory budget vote to pass because he was praying with a foreign leader. Not to cast further aspersions on Millar’s commitment to challenge Welsh Labour in the Senedd, but he also ran to be an MP last summer.The latest polls suggest that the WelshConservativeswill be fourth at the next Senedd election. Wales is desperate for a sensible voice on the centre-right of our politics, but instead is left with a Welsh Conservative party in which the “Welsh” identity part is conspicuous by its absence. People in the party have told me they are “excited” at the prospect of Reform doing well, because it means it could join them in government as a junior partner. Their only real policy seems to be: become a Reform tribute act and hope to retain some seats through voter muscle memory. Though perhaps praying now constitutes a big part of their election strategy?Ultimately, it is obvious for anyone willing to pay attention that Reform is not the answer to Wales’s challenges. But it has been offered fertile ground in which to make gains by a Welsh Labour government unable to manage public services, and a Welsh Conservative opposition so lacking in talent and ambition that it would rather ride Farage’s coattails than put forward its own credible plan.What no one outside Wales seems to have noticed is that it is actually not Reform, the Tories or Labour that the latest polls have forecast to be the largest party – it is, narrowly, the Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru. Welsh politics is fragmenting, with vastly different visions for Cymru’s future being put forward.Wales has been absolutely hamstrung by Brexit, from our farmers to our industry to our communities which once received huge amounts of EU cash. It is clear that we can’t keep buying snake oil just because the seller has changed its logo.Will Hayward is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionWalesLabourConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

You wouldn’t know itMon 17 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 07.31 EDTShareImagine a disease that can render its sufferers bedbound for years. One that could take a marathon runner and leave them unable to walk to the toilet. Imagine that at least2 million peoplein England and Scotland alone were affected to some degree, each with a mix of debilitating symptoms, from breathlessness to brain fog to multi-organ damage.Then imagine that there were no proven treatments for this life-changing illness, let alone a cure. In fact, patients areoften toldit’sall in their heads. Now imagine that more people are falling ill every day with the virus that causes this devastating disability – and that successive governments have abandoned almost every strategy to try to get to grips with it.There is no need to conjure up such a nightmare, of course – it is already real.Five yearsafter the first coronavirus lockdown, long Covid is in many ways the pandemic’s shadow. While the era of news banners flashing up weekly death tolls on our phones is thankfully a distant memory, vast swathes of people are still living with chronic symptoms years after they were first infected with the virus.And yet you’d be forgiven for thinking long Covid was old news, a relic of the pandemic past alongside banana bread and clapping for theNHS. When was the last time you heard a politician utter the words “long Covid”? Or saw calls for research or support for sufferers make the front pages? In 2025, long Covid is the public health crisis no one wants to talk about, taking a wrecking ball to people’s lives, the economy and the health service while those with power pretend there’s nothing to see here.Take treatment. Back in 2020, Boris Johnson’s governmentpromised, to much fanfare, that long Covid patients would receive specialist help at clinics, supported by an additional £10m in local NHS funding. Five years on, there are now more than90 adult post-Covid servicesacross England to provide diagnosis and rehabilitation for those with long-term symptoms. Butdata showsonly a “fraction” of people with long Covid have actually received help, with a third of them waiting more than three months to be assessed after a GP referral. Recent months have seen long Covid clinics across the countryclose their doors; NHS Cheshire and Merseyside is the latest to be under threat,with reportsit is “no longer financially viable”. It’s no wonder some patients are turning tocostly and unproven remedies. When the NHS isn’t helping, desperate people drain their life savings togo abroad for “blood washing”.Or consider access to disability benefits. A study in theLancet in 2021found that 22% of respondents with long Covid were too sick to be in employment, and 45% were on reduced hours. And yet, read news coverage of the growing number of people off work due to long-term illness and you’re lucky to even see a mention of coronavirus – just a cruel complaint about the “soaring welfare bill” and plans to further cut disability benefits.‘We’re losing decades of our life to this illness’: long Covid patients on the fear of being forgottenRead moreIt’s not like people with long Covid who have kept their jobs are treated any better by the benefits system. In 2023, just 5,224 personal independence payment claimants (paid to those in or out of work)listed long Covidas their main disabling condition – a minuscule amount compared with how many have the condition. That doctors and nurses who developed long Covid saving our lives during lockdown are nowreportedlybeing denied disability benefitsgives an insight into how much the state can be trusted to be there in our time of need. Calls for acompensation schemefor key workers with long Covid, you may not be surprised to hear, have alsorepeatedly been ignored.Even children are being left to suffer alone. In 2024, more than 110,000 minors aged three to 17 in England and Scotlandwere estimated to have long Covid, with more than 20,000 of them severely affected. At a time in their lives when they should be running around the playground, these children can barely make it out of bed. Not that you ever hear about coronavirus in the school absence debate. Instead, parents of children with long Covid are threatened with beingtaken to court for truancy.The human cost of all this is palpable, of course, but there is a financial toll for the country too. One study estimated long Covidcost the UK economyat least £5.7bn in lost productivity from 2022 to 2023, while some economists calculate that theannual healthcare billfrom the disease could be as much as £4.2bn by 2030.Against this backdrop, you would think ministers would want to curb the spread of coronavirus. After all, the best – and probably, cheapest – way to tackle long Covid is to not catch the virus in the first place. But in 2022, the last official Covid protections were removed, including theend of most free testing. By 2024, thevaccine was severely restrictedto only a tiny proportion of the public. That’s despite the fact studies show that if a person has been fully vaccinated and is up to date with their boosters, theirrisk of long Covid is much lower. This decision has had two major consequences: it has become normalised for the public to be repeatedly infected with Covid and, as such, to increasingly be put in danger oflong-term health complications.When the pandemic rules were lifted, many spoke excitedly of a “return to normal”. The millions of people with long Covid have not had that privilege. While the fortunate recover with time, the worst affected are stuck in their own perpetual lockdown: too sick to go to the pub with a mate or sit in the office for a career they had to quit. As you read this column, more people will be falling ill with an exhaustion and pain that won’t go away. If the dice lands wrong and it is you or someone you love next, you will hope – at the very least – there will be help on the way. That long Covid sufferers know there won’t is not simply the pandemic’s dark shadow, but its mark of shame.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The threat to freeze personal independence payment (Pip) disability benefits shows that the fears voiced in the run-up to the general election were well founded. Keir Starmer’s government,cratering in the polls, with Reform snapping at its heels, is in serious trouble. Weekend reports suggested the latest cutsare being reconsideredafter a backlash fromLabour’s own MPs, charities and campaigners. It’s all vintage Labour, swinging between collected callousness and then flustered chaos.Prior to the election, sceptics were told to keep the faith. Focus on the prize of getting the Tories out. It’s all three-dimensional chess, to whisper to rightwing voters. Starmer’s caution and inconsistency is only pragmatism, which couldturn to radicalism in office.But you don’t hear that much any more. The radicalism not only has not transpired, but something else, something cold and stomach-sinking, has emerged: a government clear in its intent on making savings bytargeting the most vulnerablein society – the sick, disabled people, mentally ill people. This isn’t simply a locking in of the austerity state Labour inherited, but an extension of it.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: The ObserverCuts from those who need it most have been rebranded as “fairness”, in a sort of performative determination to show that this government is not a soft touch, no siree. It is a movethat has pushed1 million older people into skipping meals after their winter fuel benefit was cut. One that has maintained thetwo-child limit. And one whereimmigration raidsclosely resembling those carried out at the height of the Tory crackdowns are the norm. A choice has been made to not launch a more fair and progressive tax system, but to ringfence the rentier class instead – as everyone downstream from asset-rich capital is pummelled. AsDavid Edgerton noted, the “party hates Tories, but it seems to love Tory panaceas”.And on that,Wes Streeting recently calledLabour’s record so far a “painful” watch for the Conservative party, as the government is doing all the things the Tories “only ever talked about”. “What is the point of the Conservative party?” he said the public must be asking. The corollary of that question is: if the government is doing work the Conservatives could only dream of, then what is the point of the Labour party?Well, the point, it seems, is to be as not-Labour as possible, and that purpose was fashioned in a battle against those on the left of the party, rather than its desire to be the canny custodian of leftwing politics once in power. It is as simple as that. The argument that the party shields its passion for equality and redistributive politics no longer holds when there is no election to fight, and when all the signs and sounds coming from the government strongly suggest a self-congratulatory steeliness. “Pearl clutching” is how one government insider issaid to have describedsome MPs’ concerns about cuts (with echoes of the“shaking off the fleas” commentfrom another insider in 2023). You could try to divine what is in the party leadership’s soul and still hope against hope that there are some residual values that are being thwarted by poor formulation of solutions. But does it really matter any more? Thepurpose of a system is what it does, not what it claims to do.There is another, not mutually exclusive, explanation for the party’s troubles – those in charge are arrogant and just not very good. The “freebies” scandalis a clear example of this exceptionalism and a poor ability to read the room. For a government that came to power in a nation traumatised by Tory corruption,refusing to apologisebecause actions were technically not illegal does not exactly signal the arrival of an administration that isn’t just as out of touch – cutting benefits while going to concerts and receiving nice clothes. And now, with spectacular timing, it emerges that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,reportedly accepted free ticketsto a Sabrina Carpenter concert earlier this month.View image in fullscreen‘Prior to the election, sceptics were told to keep the faith. Focus on the prize of getting the Tories out.’ An exit poll is projected on to Broadcasting House, London, 4 July 2024.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesBeyond that, there is in Starmer particularly an almost eerie vacancy – not so much not reading the room as not being in the room at all. He squares up to crises by offering up yet more “sleeves rolled up” platitudes. And yet, despite Labour’s poor performance, the party still seems to benefit from what is a defining feature of English political culture – memory holing, where facts from the past are suppressed, erased or forgotten. The goalposts shift, again and again. Expectations diminish, again and again. Hopes for a renaissance rise, again and again. Maybeanother “reset”will turn things around.Perhaps we can look away from domestic trials and hail in Starmer, finally, a statesman on the global stage who can keep Donald Trump on side while supporting Ukraine. Starmer has “found purpose abroad” that could unlock the purpose he needs at home, too.He could even“use his new foreign policy to kindle radical domestic reform”. This Starmer has been right there, for months, years now, yet still attempts are made to conjure up another Starmer around him. The fact that he is a leaderdescribed in a damning bookas a passenger by some in his own party – remote and broadly a vehicle for the ambitions of others – was explosive ordnance that just didn’t go off.The price of maintaining the illusion that the penny will finally drop, that leaders will come good, is high – and is never paid by the failures who flee the scene then reappear with lucrative columns, podcasts and consultancies. It is paid by the citizens who inherit the consequences of political failure, and cannot escape them. Today, with Reform waiting in the wings, the price of not raising the alarm on aLabourparty that will not change course will be nothing short of catastrophic.Benefits cuts now? What’s the point of a Labour MP who votes for something so cruel, tin-eared and short-sighted? | John McDonnellRead moreI am reminded of a saying I first heard on the radio after Trump’s 2016 presidential victory, and which has since become a slogan among young activists: “You get to die of old age, but I’ll die of climate change.” The worst that can happen to Labour is that it succumbs to electoral defeat, while the worst for everyone else is having to battle with an extreme rightwing movement that, with the implosion of the Tory party, is a historically new, poisonous and advancing force.There is unlikely to be a continuation of the cycle, where Labour hands over to Tories and we begin again, hoping that this time the status quo can be managed with whatever new cast of characters, with the illusion of salvation on the horizon. Brexit, “growth”, “securonomics” – the tricks are running out. The cycle was always a spiral. After this there is only the abyss. This is it.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourWelfareDisabilityWes StreetingConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

But fat people aren’t going anywhereRebecca ShawIt’s time to open up your big fat mouths and push back against fatphobiaSun 16 Mar 2025 21.27 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 07.53 EDTShareAstrange paradox about being fat is how, at the same time as people can’t seem to see past your fatness, you can also somehow be invisible. For some, your fatness becomes the only thing about you, the only quality you have. My fatness causes adults to laugh or sneer or hurl abuse in the street, or to say horrible depraved things online. Strangers hate my extra flesh so much that they can’t help but regularly inform me about it as I’m tweeting, walking home, standing in a mall, ordering a drink at a bar – or once, entering my own front door.I can’t remember every one of the numerous public incidents but I do remember the first time it happened. I was a (lonely) 14-year-old waiting for the bus with a bunch of other kids at 8:30am, and men drove past and shouted “WHALE” at me. It was humiliating, it was stupid (I am clearly a land animal), and in my memory it was the sharp beginning of my life in a fatphobic world. It was the beginning of fatphobia fundamentally changing who I was, who I was growing into, planting seeds that would affect me for decades. Shortly after that, I stopped being able to do public speaking, and even now I have to drug myself, my body going into flight mode when I put her in front of a crowd.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsYet even with all this painfulvisibility, invisibility is equally bad. A small amount is self-inflicted – the tactics you teach yourself, trying to shrink yourself in spaces and not alert people to the existence of your body. But invisibility is also constantly dished out to us by other people. It’s from those who won’t say something mean, but will pretend not to see you. So many people don’t see you as someone worth engaging with. It is not just personal, it’s societal too. The rise of Ozempic in combination with an already extremely thin-obsessed world means that there are almost no fat – or even kind-of-fat – people on any sort of screen.View image in fullscreenA screenshot of Vogue’s video of Gigi Hadid singing You Can’t Stop the Beat from the Hairspray musicalPhotograph: Vogue/You TubeThis week, Vogue and Gigi Hadid – obviously not people I would rely on for body inclusivity – went a step further in the wrong directionby doing a Hairspray-themed cover and spread, including posting a full lip-sync of the song ‘You Can’t Stop the Beat’ online. If you aren’t familiar with Hairspray, it’s one of the only musicals in existence featuring fat leads, and a big part of the story is fatness being spotlighted. Vogue’s cover and lip-sync featured only thin people. The fat characters were played by Gigi Hadid, Cole Escola (love) and Laverne Cox (love), and everyone else involved was also thin. To be completely and utterly cut out of one of the only fat-focused stories is not just disappointing; it’s a really bad sign. It seems like any acknowledgment that fat people exist in the world, and that it’s OK for us to exist, is sliding back to nil.All kinds of people hate fatness. I have been prepared for that; I expect it. What I was less prepared for was a world where normal, nice, thoughtful, politically aware, outspoken people seem to care about inclusivity in all areas – except this one. Non-thin people are everywhere, our experiences are real and important, and yet, flicking through programmes for writers’ festivals, women’s festivals, arts festivals, I notice a consistent distinct lack of opportunities to discuss fatness or body image – in a time when it is increasingly necessary to address. These aren’t men on the street flicking a lit cigarette at me for walking near them (real story). It’s people who are otherwise kind and empathetic and knowledgable and politically aware, who aren’t engaged with this issue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Should I modify my look to fit in? | Leading questionsRead moreAt the moment it feels like we have lost every step of the hard-won progress of the fat movement, like chubby Sisyphus watching the rock roll back down. If you spend any time on TikTok or social media now, you’ll see disgusting, awful, hateful, fatphobic comments on every post from a woman over size 12. Fatphobia is an ugly, blunt weapon wielded against people of all sizes. Almost every woman I know has had issues with hating her body, at literally every size and every age. There’s been a recent rise on TikTok of young fat girls doing videos crying about how much they hate their life, alongside a very scary rise of pro-anorexia accounts, girls obsessed with being as thin as possible. It’s a throwback to the heroin chic, deathly anti-fat era of the 90s and 00s, and it’s dangerous for everyone. These teenage girls are at no risk of ever actually getting fat, yet the conditions of our world have made them dread it to the point of already starving themselves.The thin-obsessed world is growing more unflinchingly vicious to fat people again, while others stand by and do nothing to stall it. When you hate our bodies, you are teaching everyone to hate theirs. I implore people to start thinking about this, both broadly and specifically. We need people carefully considering how we portray and include different kinds of bodies – and what we are saying when we don’t. If you are someone who cares about us as people, equal to others – now is the time to prove it. We may be big, we may be numerous, but we desperately need allies.Fat people aren’t going anywhere; we’re not going to stop existing because you abuse us or exclude us. It’s just going to make everything worse, for everyone. We need you to make yourselves bigger with us, to take up space with us. It’s time to open up your big fat mouths.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsBody imageOpinionHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

The great pop-pioneer looks back on an extraordinary career, from getting thrown out of art school to covering Kate Moss in fibreglassZoe WilliamsMon 17 Mar 2025 11.01 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 12.22 EDTShareAllen Jones, painter, sculptor and print-maker – he calls himself a painter who sculpts – is arguably the first, debatably the most famous British pop artist. I meet him in the studio he built 20 years ago, when he moved out of London to the Cotswolds, the kind of chocolate-box surroundings where they’ll only let you build something if it looks like a barn. “But a barn is designed specifically to keep light out!” he says in amused frustration, and huh, yes, sounds obvious when you say it. An architect found his way round that, and the place is swimming in light.Against one wall of the studio are five of the fibreglass female figures he made as an ongoing series between the early 80s and 2015. At 5ft 2in, they are slightly smaller than lifesize mannequins. The critic Mark Hudson has described them as having “a faintly unnerving quality, with something of the doll, something of the surrealist totem and the automaton, like Coppélia”. In the facing corner is Hatstand, part of the fetish furniture series that inflamed the feminists of the second wave. Steps – comprising Hatstand, Chair and Table – have the distinction of having been controversial in pretty much every decade since the creation of the first, in 1969.I filtered it all through my interest in pop culture and fetish magazines – and also memories of going to Madame TussaudsYou’d recognise these sculptures immediately – Hatstand is a woman in thigh-high maroon leather lace-up boots. The model-maker’s “first question,” Jones recalls, “was, ‘What’s she doing?’ and I said, ‘Well, she’s standing. In this ancient gesture of “Here I am”.’ I’m drawn to that hieratic figure, the ultimate notion of the figure.”Table is a woman with her breasts exposed, wearing long black gloves and a waspie corset – that old-school porn effect of clothes that accentuate nakedness – on all fours, with a pane of glass on her back. Chair is a woman lying on her back with a cushion on the backs of her thighs, so that you could sit on her. For 50 years now, critics and thinkers have been arguing about whether these represented a critique of the patriarchy, or were, themselves, patriarchal oppression. “I think it hampered my career,” he says quietly. “I’ve never said that to anybody.”View image in fullscreenImmediately recognisable … Green Table, 1972.Photograph: The artistThere are layers to this, the topsoil being discursive: for sure, and for years, the Step figures were all anyone wanted to talk about. When Jones was interviewed in Hamburg in 2016, that was the first time a journalist had ever not brought up Hatstand, “and then she rang up, later in the evening, and said, ‘My editor said, yeah, but what about the women?’”Beneath that, there’s that sharp disappointment of feeling that you’ve been misconstrued. “Militant feminism was a reaction to the same society I was living in. If they’d asked me to illustrate their manifesto, you’d think that was the perfect image: a woman on all fours, being made into an object.” And beneaththatwas his true intention, which has got entirely lost in the sound and fury, and while the intellectual in him gets that even “when people look at a Turner, they’re bringing their experience and perception to it. They’re not interested in why that was painted like that”, the artist in him was trying to have a different conversation altogether.View image in fullscreen‘Objectification rendered as object’ … Hatstand, 1969.Photograph: The artist“During the 60s,” he says, “the figurative artists in New York, who were working in sculpture, [George] Segal for example, there were echoes of surrealism, so it might be a real bicycle, but the figure was always in plaster. There was always this signal – it might look weird, but it’s art. And I thought, ‘How do you do it so that you remove that safety valve?’ And then I filtered that through my interest in pop culture, in fetish magazines, and memories as a child of going to Madame Tussauds.”He removed the safety valve, all right. Then it blew up. Turns out those things are there for a reason. “Depending on your point of view, this sounds like an excuse or an apology,” he says. I actually never thought the Step sculptures were misogynistic, I always saw them more as a gauntlet, and fascinating – objectification rendered as object. But then, I’m just one feminist, and like so many of us, I disagree with half the others.Allen Jones was born in 1937 and grew up in Ealing, London with a dad who loved to paint at weekends but was miles from any contemporary art scene, and who worked in a canning factory. Jones remembers seeing the Hoover building, “of course, in those days, it stood out like the Taj Mahal”. He remembers visits to Southampton, after the war, when the Queen Mary or Queen Elizabeth were in dock, “this illuminated ship, towering above the town”. His parents loved spectacle, the Lord Mayor’s Show, trooping the colour, “that thing, getting on the underground at Ealing Broadway, and 20 minutes later, arriving at Marble Arch, the beginning of the city. That idea of the glamour of the city stuck with me.”He went to the Royal College ofArt, and as a result of some incredibly 60s clash over who controlled the academy – the tutors or the students – he got kicked out, a random choice by all accounts,pour encourager les autres. He had expected the education to be more discursive and open to challenge than it was. “They’d say, ‘You can experiment in your third year. For now, look at nature.’ And you’d sit there thinking, ‘Is this a joke?’ We were working our arses off. I was in the life room pretty well every day, so was Hockney, so was Derek Boshier.”Jones, exiled, did a teacher training course, but the Royal College accidentally crowned him winner of their young contemporaries mural competition the same year he got kicked out, and this launched him. The teaching qualification, meanwhile, came in useful when he got a teaching gig in the late 60s in America.He went to New York in his mid-20s, newly married, moved in to the Chelsea Hotel, which was rammed with other artists and people giving cello recitals, naked. “It wasn’t group sex or anything, with us. We lived a very correct existence, and my wife [Janet, his first] became pregnant, as it happened, with twins.” (One daughter now works in arts administration, the other at law firm Clifford Chance).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I thought that I was inviting the viewer to go into the space. But by the end of the 60s, after I’d done about four or five of these paintings, I realised that actually I was inviting the figure to come out.”View image in fullscreenCritical confusion … Body Armour (Kate Moss).Photograph: The artistThat spurred him towards sculpture, and – skipping a number of years, here – another hot-button piece, Kate Moss in her sculpted fibreglass, leather and stainless steel suit, Body Armour, in 2013. It wasn’t controversial, as such. It generated more of a kind of critical confusion. Was this high brow or low, or no-brow, or what the hell?“Over the years, I’d occasionally been invited to do a portrait. And I’ve never quite squared the circle of a commissioned portrait, where I feel that the obligation is to record the person, as opposed to the person as an artist’s model, giving themselves to the artist. The one that I liked is when Picasso painted Gertrude Stein, who then said, ‘It doesn’t look anything like me’, and he said, ‘Give it time.’”I asked him which period of his life he felt most centre-stage – in the late 70s, when there were retrospectives at the ICA and the Serpentine, or maybe a decade ago,when the Royal Academy had one. Or perhaps in the mid-60s, when he went to America and doors swung open for him, as both visionary and interlocutor, cross-pollinating European upheavals in contemporary art and American iconoclasm.“I’ll be very pleased if I think I’ve had my foot on the stage,” he says, modestly. “I don’t take any of that for granted at all. I think I’m sufficiently a realist to know …” he says tentatively, then starts again. “It might turn out that you put more on the stage than your foot. I do feel that I was part of the contemporary dialogue.” This is literally as well as creatively true: he has a searching openness that feels much closer to the beginning of a career than the end, not just about his own work, but about everything he’s ever seen.Allen Jones Moves by Mark Hudson is published by Unicorn, £45Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtSculpturePaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was the most incredible thing I’d ever filmed but the bouncer took the tapes. It took me years to get them back’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 17 Mar 2025 10.32 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 10.46 EDTShareOndi Timoner, directorI wanted to make a documentary about 10 bands on the verge of getting signed by record companies, to see what would happen to them. When I first heardthe Brian Jonestown Massacre, I thought they were some lost band from the 1960s. But a friend told me they were alive and well – and that every label wanted to sign them. I filmed them soundchecking for an industry showcase gig at the Viper Room in Los Angeles, then they came over to my house, which is the backyard scene in Dig!They were on the verge of getting signed, but had spent all their money on sitars and were taking the record companies off the guest list because they didn’t want to “give away” tickets. The gig itself ended up with fights on stage. It was the most incredible thing I’d ever filmed, but I ended up crying on Sunset Boulevard because the bouncer took the tapes, which took me years to get back. Outside the club, singer Anton Newcombe told me he was covered in “blood from people’s faces”.The next day he told me: “Forget those other bands. Go meet theDandy Warhols. Together we’re going to change the record business for ever and you can film us.” Within 10 minutes of meeting Dandy Warhols singer Courtney Taylor-Taylor, he told me: “I sneeze and hits come out.”Dig! looks at art versus commerce, friendship, collaboration and madness through the eyes of two lead singers who each possess what the other has not. Anton can live on the edge and make records for the price of a six-pack of beer. Courtney needs stability. I filmed the Jonestowns in Super 8 and the Dandys in 16mm and 35mm because they made it commercially. It made for a contrast: I wanted the footage to reflect the diverging fortunes of what Courtney calls the “most well-adjusted band in America” – the Dandys – and the least well-adjusted.I recently lost my house in the California fires. I found my Sundance award in the rubbleWhen I started filming I was 23 and had no idea if it would see the light of day. Between 1996 and 2003, I shot 2,500 hours of footage. My child’s birth prompted me to finish editing, so when I won the Sundance grand jury prize in 2004, I thanked him for the deadline.Dig! is Romeo and Juliet, or the real-life Spinal Tap. The new cut – Dig! XX – brings the story up to date. Them becoming friends again and playing together is the last thing you’d imagine happening at the end of the original film. I recently lost my house in theCalifornia fires, but the raw footage was at my office and so survived. I found my Sundance award in the rubble.Joel Gion, tambourine, the Brian Jonestown MassacreIf Ondi and Anton had discussed filming, the rest of us weren’t privy to it. Suddenly we were outside the club, pissed off, with cameras in our faces. The gig had blown up but being in a film was a consolation prize. I thought: “We’ll blow all those other bands in the documentary away.” At first I was hamming it up for the camera, but later, when everything started sinking, the camera became a coping mechanism, or confessional friend.I’d wink at the camera as if to say, ‘Don’t worry folks, everybody’s fine, even though there’s chaos reigning’Dig! was intended to be a celebration of scrappy artists socking it to the man, but turned into a film about the Dandys becoming a pop band and living the MTV life while everything fucked up around the Brian Jonestown Massacre. We had even more fights than are shown in the film but they were still relatively rare and they weren’t all started by Anton. In the early days Anton had been a super-driven songwriter, but we were all a bunch of fuck-ups by then, at the end of the filming. I’d wink at the camera as if to say: “Don’t worry folks, everybody’s fine, even though there’s chaos reigning.” But I’d hate to be typecast as the party guy or court jester.Dig! review – a hilarious, heartbreaking battle of the bandsRead moreI lucked out at the end of the movie when I quit before things went full-metal blotto [he rejoined the band in 2006]. But when I see the original film now, I have no regrets. We had so much belief in ourselves, which wasn’t blind illusion. Twenty years on, we’re much mellower – most of the time. There haven’t been any fights on the current tour, and we’ve got the place in pop culture we always imagined. In a way, it took everything we went through in Dig! to get to where we are.The 20th anniversary expanded documentaryDig!

The drama dropped on Netflix just as it emerged that crossbow killer Kyle Clifford had searched online for misogynistic podcasts andwatched Andrew Tate videoshours before murdering threefemale members of the Hunt family. Then again, such stories hit headlines with depressing regularity. Perhaps Adolescence would have felt unnervingly on-the-nose whenever it launched.The initial idea came to its star,Stephen Graham, after a spate of distressing violent crimes. In 2021, 12-year-old Ava White was fatally stabbed by a 14-year-old boy in Graham’s home city of Liverpool. In 2023, 15-year-old Elianne Andam was attacked with a kitchen knife by 17-year-old Hassan Sentamu outside a Croydon shopping centre.“It really hit my heart,” Graham said at the show’s premiere. “I just thought: ‘What’s happening? How have we come to this? What’s going on with our society?’” The actor roped in his regular collaborator, top-tier screenwriterJack Thorne, to create a hard-hitting drama interrogating why boys are committing such extreme acts against girls.The result is the harrowing but heartfeltAdolescence, a four-parter that follows the Miller family, whose lives are blown apart when 13-year-old schoolboy Jamie is arrested in a dawn raid for killing a female classmate called Katie.On a street level, it’s about knife crime. Over the past decade, the number of UK teenagers killed with a blade or sharp object has risen by 240%. On a cultural level, it’s about cyberbullying, the malign influence of social media and the unfathomable pressures faced by boys in Britain today. Male rage, toxic masculinity, online misogyny. This isn’t just all-too-plausible fiction. It’s unavoidable fact.View image in fullscreenFlat-out phenomenal … Owen Cooper as Jamie.Photograph: NetflixAs the boy’s father, Eddie, a self-employed plumber in an unspecified Yorkshire town, Graham spends the opening hour shell-shocked. He is inclined to believe his son’s protestations of innocence, as any parent would. That is, until he is poleaxed by chilling footage of the frenzied multiple stabbing.It might be a masterclass from the best actor working today but Graham leaves room for his castmates to shine. Ashley Walters delivers a career-best turn as lead investigator DI Luke Bascombe. Walters was considering quitting acting and moving behind the camera but Adolescence changed his mind, not least because it resonated personally with a man who, in his own teens, was sentenced to 18 months for gun possession. He has admitted to “crying most nights” while learning the script.Erin Dohertydrops in for a blistering head-to-head as clinical psychologist Briony. Christine Tremarco is heartbreaking in the finale as Jamie’s mother, Manda. And then come the kids. Newcomer Owen Cooper – incredibly, it’s the 15-year-old’s acting debut – is flat-out phenomenal as Jamie. He goes from sympathetic to scary, lost little boy to angry young man, often within the same breath, announcing himself as a major talent in the process. Fatima Bojang is movingly raw as Katie’s bereaved best friend Jade. Amélie Pease excels as Jamie’s elder sister Lisa, whose low-key wisdom becomes the glue holding her fractured family together.The story is brought to life by telling details. The way that Jamie still has space-themed wallpaper in his bedroom and wets himself when armed police burst in, reminding us of the “gormless little boy” behind the shocking violence. The way the secure training centre where he awaits trial is populated by youngsters with radiator burns who yell at Coronation Street. The way incidental characters – the creepy CCTV guy, the DIY store conspiracy theorist – warn us that adult males can be equally threatening. The way nonsensical graffiti and a nosy neighbour are what finally tip Eddie over the edge.This authentic naturalism can also be seen in the recurring motif of food. Teenagers are permanently hungry, after all. When Jamie is offered a bowl of cornflakes in his holding cell, his dad repeatedly nudges him to “eat your cornies”. DI Bascombe reaches out to his own son by taking him for “chips and a Coke”. Briony bonds with Jamie by sprinkling marshmallows in his hot chocolate. Like a typical vegetable-averse kid, he expresses horror at the idea of salad in a sandwich. The Miller family maintain a veneer of normality via a full English breakfast (complete with black pudding) and a Chinese takeaway (complete with prawn crackers).View image in fullscreenCareer-best turn … Ashley Walters as lead investigator DI Luke Bascombe.Photograph: NetflixAdolescence reunites Graham with Boiling Point director Philip Barantini, who’s clearly a glutton for single-shot punishment. The 2021 chef drama was filmed in one continuous take. Each episode of Adolescence is shot in the same seamless style, without a single edit. It’s not only a stunning technical accomplishment – exactly how does it flow from overhead crane shot to in-your-face closeup, from corridor to car interior to play park, without us seeing the joins? – but it lends an immersive, unflinching immediacy to proceedings.The camera never leaves the action. Neither can we. It’s no flashy gimmick but a way of ratcheting up the thrumming real-time tension. Rarely has a state secondary school been so vividly portrayed as in episode two. It’s Grange Hill with smartphones and security lanyards. When Bascombe and his sidekick DS Misha Frank (Faye Marsay) complain about the stink, noise and claustrophobic chaos, the audience feel it too.Adolescence review – the closest thing to TV perfection in decadesRead moreIt’s refreshing that Adolescence comes from Netflix, a platform not exactly known for quintessentially British drama. Nor indeed self-contained stories told over a punchy four episodes. In many ways, this feels like a BBC or Channel 4 project. Instead, the streamer’s deeper pockets are partly what enabled Barantini to be so technically ambitious.Adolescence lays bare how an outwardly normal but inwardly self-loathing and susceptible youngster can be radicalised without anyone noticing. His parents recall Jamie coming home from school, heading straight upstairs, slamming his bedroom door and spending hours at his computer. They thought he was safe. They thought they were doing the right thing. It’s a scenario which will ring bells with many parents. Some will be alarm bells.View image in fullscreenA blistering head-to-head … Owen Cooper and Erin Doherty.Photograph: NetflixWe take pains to teach them how to cross roads and not talk to strangers. We rarely teach them how to navigate the internet. There is often a glaring gap between parents’ blissfully ignorant image of their children’s lives and the truth of what they get up to online. We think they’re playing Roblox but they’re actually on Reddit. We think they’re doing homework or innocently texting mates. They are watching pornography or, as DS Frank pithily puts it, “that Andrew Tate shite”.Jamie’s plight becomes a poignant study of the nightmarish influence of the so-called manosphere – that pernicious online world of “red pills”, “truth groups” and the 80-20 rule (which posits that 80% of women are attracted to 20% of men). It’s a shadowy sphere populated by alphas, “incels”, MRAs (men’s rights activists) and PUAs (pickup artists), whose fragile egos turn into entitled fury. From mocking emojis on Instagram to the dark web and deepfakes, it’s another country to anyone over 40. No wonder parents are, as Bascombe’s son points out, “blundering around, not getting it”.The fourth and final episode is where the reliably superb Graham reduces viewers to rubble. Eddie turns from a combustible ball of anger into a hollowed-out husk of grief, guilt and regret. The climactic scene of him tearfully tucking Jamie’s childhood teddy bear into his bed and apologising to it (“Sorry, son, I should’ve done better”) is devastating.Is this the most terrifying TV show of our times? Adolescence, the drama that will horrify all parentsRead moreAs unanimous five-star reviews attest, Adolescence is the best drama of 2025 so far. We’re less than a quarter of the way through, admittedly, but the rest of the year’s TV will have to go some to beat it. This is old-fashioned, issue-led, socially conscious television – and all the better for it. It might not be as overtly political as Thorne’sToxic Townbut in terms of its potential to kickstart real world change, it’s the most rousing TV since Mr Bates vs the Post Office.It’s a cautionary tale about getting teenagers off screens and engaging with real life again. A reminder that human contact and family time might help save them. A plea to support, talk and listen, not let them fall through the cracks and disappear down the digital rabbit hole. It will open conversations that desperately need to be had.With its killer combination of artistic virtuosity, startling performances and gut-punch power, Adolescence is a howl of despair and a call to action. It will resonate with troubled teens, terrify their parents and linger with viewers. The questions it poses are urgent and vital. Providing answers? Well, that’s the hard part. But it’s up to us to solve this pressing issue before many more people die.Adolescence is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionStephen GrahamViolence against women and girlsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Does every toy movie need to be an Oscar-worthy social commentary?Stuart HeritageMon 17 Mar 2025 12.01 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 12.17 EDTShareThis Easter, a new movie based on Sylvanian Families will be released into cinemas. If you’ve been keeping up with films based on toys for the last decade or so, then you’ll be forgiven for feeling a modicum of dread upon hearing this news. Because ever sinceBarbietook a billion dollars and found itself nominated for a bunch of Oscars, a toy movie isn’t allowed to be a toy movie any more. It has to be an auteur-driven toy movie; one that also functions as a commentary about the capitalist machinations that drive the toy industry.It’s everywhere. In 2022, Emily V Gordon and Jon M Chu announced that they were making a Play-Doh movie that would be about “creativity, imagination, and the purpose of art”. JJ Abrams is making a film based on Hot Wheels that he describes as “emotional and grounded and gritty”. A24 is making a Barney the Dinosaur film said to be heavily influenced by the work of Charlie Kaufman. These are all real things that are actually happening.And so, given all this, your stomach probably lurched at the prospect of something similar happening to Sylvanian Families. After all, very few things are quite as pure as Sylvanian Families. For the uninitiated, these are small toys made out of flocked plastic. Each toy is of a different woodland creature, prim and conservatively dressed. They are dainty and timeless and easy to love. When the UK’s only dedicated Sylvanian Families shop closed down in 2023, it felt like nothing but the death of innocence itself.The last thing that any of us needed was a film about Sylvanian Families that offered viewers a meta-critique of the Sylvanian Families brand. No edgy jokes about their lack of genitals. No social commentary about the toys being shaken out of their pristine comfort by class war or looming environmental disaster or the rise of rightwing populism. The only thing that anyone really wants from a Sylvanian Families movie is a lot of scenes of the Sylvanian Families acting like the Sylvanian Families.Reader, they understood the assignment. “Will Freya find a lovely birthday gift for her mummy?” asks the recently released trailer, “And will she succeed in choosing the tree of the year?” And that’s it. That’s the entire film. A little girl has to buy a birthday present for her mother, and then adequately judge a tree competition. Read that again. Doesn’t it feel nice?True, there are moments in the Sylvanian Families trailer that flirt with the kind of subversion we’ve grown used to. In one scene a young rabbit is about to bring a hammer down on a nail she’s holding in her other hand. In any other toy film, you could put money on her smashing her fingers up. But not here. Also, there’s a sequence where a character plays the saxophone, an instrument that brings dangerous connotations of jazz and sex. And yet she plays it, and it sounds nice, and nothing bad happens.View image in fullscreenNothing dangerous is about to happen … Sylvanian Families: the MovieIn fact, aside from a relatively loud noise that plays 28 seconds in, the trailer is as peaceful and charming as the toy itself. It’s so faithful to the source material, in fact, that at times it seems like the entire film was made by people just moving some Sylvanian Families toys around with their hands, as a child might. Honestly, given everything happening in the world, the trailer feels like a warm 70-second bath for your brain.Then again, perhaps it’s easy to overstate the influence of auteur toy films on the wide market. The sincere Sylvanian Families-style films are still out there, just not usually on theatrical release.For example, Netflix has put out a new non-Gerwig Barbie film at a rate of one or two every year since the start of the decade. Since Barbie was released, in fact, we’ve had Barbie: Skipper and the Big Babysitting Adventure (Barbie’s little sister successfully starts her own company), Barbie and Stacie to the Rescue (Barbie and her friend make new friends at a hot air balloon festival) and Barbie and Teresa: Recipe for Friendship (Barbie and her friends make food for a restaurant). Similarly, Netflix has an array of My Little Pony shows and films, none of which attempt to do anything but tell stories about My Little Ponies. The same goes for Thomas the Tank Engine.None of these have made a billion dollars. You don’t have to be a financial expert to assume that the Sylvanian Families film won’t either. But that isn’t the point. The point is that Freya needs to find a lovely birthday present for her mummy. Really, isn’t that enough?Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmBarbieToysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, writes theauthor of an acclaimed new book, fresh discoveries challenge this view of the artist – and even show him as a heroSue PrideauxMon 17 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 06.16 EDTShareIn 2019, the National Gallery held an exhibition of Paul Gauguin’s portraits that provoked uproar. Was Gauguin not a French colonialist who spread syphilis to underage girls throughout the islands of the South Seas? The London show was caught in the crosshairs of cancel culture and there were calls for his paintings to be burned.I have always loved Gauguin’s pictures. Having just writtenI Am Dynamite!,a biography of controversial philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche,and feeling a strong sympathy with #MeToo, I couldn’t live in the dishonest and hypocritical position of loving the paintings and hating the man. I embarked on research.My purpose was simply to discover the facts so I could measure my feelings against the truth. But my research turned up so many new sides to the story that this private project turned into a book, which I titled Wild Thing, as that is what Gauguin called himself. His first seven years were spent in Peru, but they ended when he was brought back toFranceto go to school. He hated it: fitting in was never Gauguin’s forte. He put up his fists and snarled: “I am a wild thing from Peru.” Schoolmates quailed.He discovered a law that helped get island children out of having to attend French Catholic boarding schoolDid he have syphilis? Gauguin, who died in 1903 at the age of 54, spent his last three years on the tiny island of Hiva Oa inFrench Polynesia. In 2000, its mayor decided to restore his hut on its original site in time for the centenary of the artist’s death. Excavations discovered a glass jar containing four human teeth. Examined by the Human Genome Project in Cambridge, they proved to be Gauguin’s. Further tests were carried out for cadmium, mercury and arsenic – standard treatments for syphilis at the time. No trace was found. This was written up in the scientific journal Anthropology in 2018.But I wanted to know more. Syphilis was widespread in the islands in Gauguin’s time. I discovered that his doctor in Tahiti, the largest of the French Polynesian islands, knew the disease well and concluded that the painter did not have syphilis, but rather eczema and erysipelas, aggravated by infected bites of theSimulium buissonifly. The two doctors who later treated him on Hiva Oa were of the same opinion.View image in fullscreenIn the crosshairs of cancel culture … Gauguin in the mid-1880s.Photograph: adoc-photos/Corbis/Getty ImagesNext, the question of underage girls. The age of consent in France and the colonies was 13. This was not untypical of the world at the time. In the US, it varied between 10 and 12. As I finished the book in 2023, Japan raised the age from 13 to 16. These facts horrify and disgust me. However, within the context of the time, Gauguin’s Polynesian lovers were without exception “of age”. Revolting as it is, he was doing nothing illegal or even unusual for that time.Gauguin had three serious relationships. Tehamana, the best known partner, had been supposed to be 13 but a recently discovered birth certificate shows her to have been 15. Within these relationships, Gauguin followed local custom. Sexually experienced girls were offered by their families. No money changed hands. After a couple of weeks, the girl went home to her family for a period, to decide if she then wanted to go back to her new husband. Tehamana returned to Gauguin. There was no coercion. She, like Gauguin’s later lovers, was free to come and go, to return home for good if she liked, and to take other lovers.There was no financial advantage in staying: Gauguin in his beach hut was no richer than the average villager. When he went back to Paris for a couple of years to sell his paintings, Tehamana remarried. On his return, she went to live with him for a couple of weeks for old times’ sake. It argues affection.Wild Thing is the first full biography of Gauguin for 30 years. It has been shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford prize and won the Duff Cooper award.I feel particularly proud to be on the longlist of the Women’s prize for nonfiction, too. Let’s face it, given Gauguin’s historic reputation, it would have been much easier for them to leave it off.The book is based on the discovery of much new information: not only the teeth and Tehamana’s birth certificate, but also a crucial new literary source that emerged as I started writing. In 2020, the manuscript of Gauguin’s most important written work – Avant et Après, or Before and After – reappeared. Missing for a century,it contains 200 handwritten pages of Gauguin’s thoughts on life, art, religion and everything. Then, a year later, the Catalogue Raisonné was completed. This is like the official bible of the artist, gathering every bit of information on all the verified works.I discovered a great-great-granddaughter, too, with family stories, papers and letters. Gauguin had a Danish wife and a son who lived in Norway. There are letters in both languages and a lengthy untranslated family memoir by the son. Norwegian is my mother tongue and I can read Danish, too. One of the most surprising things I discovered was Gauguin’s strong belief in equality between the sexes. His grandmother, Flora Tristan, was a fierce fighter for women’s rights and much admired by Karl Marx. Gauguin cherished her published writings. He actively encouraged the women in his circle, including his wife, to find fulfilment through independence.View image in fullscreenControversial … Manao Tupapau, or Spirit of the Dead Watching.Photograph: SJArt/AlamyThis sheds new light on Gauguin’s complex relationship with Tehamana, who appears in several paintings. Tehamana Has Many Parents, completed in 1893, is a portrait of an individual, but also a portrait of a culture in flux. Tehamana wears a missionary dress but carries a Polynesian fan. On a wall behind her, a line of mysterious hieroglyphs reference the ancient island culture, much of which was destroyed by missionaries. Below them stands Hina, the Polynesian goddess of the moon and creation. Gauguin shows Tehamana as a synthesis of many cultures and many bloodlines, as Gauguin believed we all are.But Manao Tupapau, or Spirit of the Dead Watching, is the picture that has done greatest damage to Gauguin’s reputation. I can easily see why. The 1892 painting, showing Tehamana naked and face down on a bed, can be seen as misogynistic, exploitative and colonialist. But there are other ways of viewing it, which suggest a more sympathetic, caring Gauguin.For Tehamana, as for most Polynesians, Christianity was a veneer – she believed intupapau,malign spirits who stole your spirit in the dark. For that reason, she always kept an oil lamp burning in their hut. One evening, the lamp had gone out and Gauguin found her terrified by the dark. He embodies her fear in the figure of the old woman, symbolising thetupapau, standing at the foot of the bed for our benefit. But what he wanted to capture, he said, was Tehamana’s terror of the unseen.When Gauguin sent the picture back to his wife, Mette, to exhibit and sell in Denmark, she was not offended by it. Rather, she thought it “wonderful”. Mette herself was also frightened of the dark, always keeping a lamp burning.Gauguin believed in cultural synthesis, which today is often condemned as cultural appropriation. He saw the human race as a great synthesis of race, creed and colour. One of the first pictures he painted in Tahiti wasIa Orana Maria, or Hail Mary. This 1891 workdepicts a Polynesian Mary carrying the Polynesian Christ Child on her shoulder. Exhibited in Paris, the picture caused a scandal. A non-white holy family! It was not until 1951 that a papal encyclical made it permissible to represent such a thing.View image in fullscreenA non-white holy family … Ia Orana Maria, or Hail Mary.Photograph: Antiquarian Images/AlamyHorrified by Tahiti’s oppressive and exploitative French colonial regime, Gauguin took up political journalism. He wrote articles for a local newspaper and later started his own paper exposing the corruption and injustice of French officials. He also wrote to the government in Paris pleading for fairer taxation and treatment. Tahiti’s governor brought a libel suit against him but there wasn’t a chance Gauguin would get justice in the corrupt French colonial court, so he fled 500 miles to Hiva Oa, also a French colony. On arrival, he was surprised to be mobbed like a celebrity – not, he discovered, for his painting, but for his journalism.Hiva Oa was run by Bishop Martin, a fearsome puritan who had forbidden nudity, polyandry, the sacred art of tattooing, and any performance of the erotic Upa Upa dance. Bishop Martin compelled all Indigenous children to attend French Catholic boarding school until the age of 14. They were taught the French curriculum and allowed to speak only French, the aim being to erase the Polynesian language, culture, family structure and national identity in one generation.The children’s families were distraught. But Gauguin discovered a minor French law stating that only children living within two milesof a school need attend it. Mass relocation to the countryside ensued. Language, culture and family unity survived on the island and Gauguin became more popular than ever. He was asked to exchange names. When you did this, it was believed, you exchanged souls and had all your property in common, including wives. It was the greatest honour you could confer, the equivalent of becoming a blood brother.On Hiva Oa, Gauguin continued to petition Paris for fairer treatment of Indigenous people and to act as their lawyer in the local court. The Polynesians loved him, the French hated him. The governor reported back to Paris that Gauguin was “a defender of native vices. A subverter of the rule of law and a dangerous anarchist.”He was a marked man. When he accused a gendarme on a nearby island of accepting bribes, the governor responded with a charge of libel. The case was heard by the local French magistrate and Gauguin was found guilty, fined 500 francs and sentenced to three months in prison. Barely a year later, the case would be re-examined and Gauguin’s accusations found to be correct. But by that time, the artist was dead.Wild Thing was driven by all the new material that began appearing in 2019, which coincided with the reopening of the debate about Gauguin’s troubling reputation. It seemed important to re-examine his life: not to condemn, not to excuse, but simply to shed new light on the man and the myth.Wild Thing by Sue Prideaux (Faber & Faber, £30).

Set inJapanin 1579, a time of intense civil war dominated by the feudal lord Oda Nobunaga, it follows two characters navigating their way through the bloody chaos: a female shinobi named Fujibayashi Naoe, and Yasuke, an African slave turned samurai. Japan has been the series’ most-requested setting for years, Ubisoft says.\"I've been on [this] franchise for 16 years and I think every time we start a new game, Japan comes up and we ask, is this the time?” says executive producer Marc-Alexis Coté. “We've never pushed beyond the conception phase with Japan until this one.\"The game comes ata crucial time for Ubisoftafter the disappointing performance of last year’s titles Star Wars Outlaws, Skull and Bones and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and the expensive closure of live service shooter XDefiant. There has also been afurore over the game’s Black and female protagonists, with the usual rightwing YouTuberscriticising them as “woke”and historically inaccurate, despite the fact that female warriors fought throughout the feudal period, and that Yasuke, the game’s Black samurai, is a historical figure.It is something the team is keen to address. “In-house historians were some of the first people to get staffed on the production team,” says creative director Jonathan Dumont. “A huge data bank is continually fed. As we get a sense of the era, the research effort then requires the help of specialists from around the world, including Japan, to narrow down details or understand finer cultural points.”View image in fullscreenThe game features advancements in lighting on landscapes.Photograph: UbisoftThere were also field trips to the game’s key locations of Kyoto and Osaka, which revealed elements the team hadn’t thought of. Coté recalls travelling to Japan to show local colleagues some technological breakthroughs the development team had made with lighting on landscapes. But they all shook their heads and said it wasn’t working. “I was like, ‘Why?!’” he says. “And they just replied: ‘That’s not how light falls on the mountains in Japan.’ So when our art director was there I asked him specifically to go look at the mountains. He went, took reference photos, and now we’ve captured it.”The team also had to render individual characters’ socks, because they are always depicted removing their footwear when entering a building. “The expectations have been this high throughout. It’s been a challenge.”Like all the previous Assassin’s Creed titles before it, Shadows uses authentic locations and historical figures to seat the game’s time-hopping narrative. Takeda, Fukuchiyama and Himeji castles are all replicated along with the villages, ports and rural landscapes of Central Japan. But as ever, this is first and foremost a game about sneaking over rooftops and skilfully taking down enemies. In a demo we played just before release, the lead characters are assaulting Himeji castle, and you can choose to play either as Naoe, skulking in the shadows using smoke bombs and silent attacks to escape detection, or Yasuke, running in with his sword and lopping off limbs. While Ubisoft has put immense effort into capturing the Azuchi-Momoyama period and the nature of the Iga peasant class (the possible origin of the modern ninja archetype), what matters equally is how good it feels to leap off a rooftop and decapitate a passing enemy.View image in fullscreen‘Incredibly bloody combat.’Photograph: UbisoftIn many ways, it seems the game draws as much from modern cultural depictions of the period and its warriors as from history. “Japanese storytelling has been very influential to the development of the game and to all occidental arts in general,” says Dumont. “Kagemusha from Kurosawa, 13 Assassins, Zatoichi, Sekigahara, The Tale of Genji or Musashi from Eiji Yoshikawa, to name the more obvious, have [all] helped shape our vision for the game. Even Studio Ghibli movies such as My Neighbour Totoro have helped us understand the countryside and vegetation.”It’s certainly an interesting time for Shadows to release. Multiple high-profile failures of recent live service games have left players yearning for the era of big single-player adventures, with decent sales reported for Obsidian’s recent RPG Avowed. Meanwhile, the huge success of FX/Hulu’sShōgunseries has brought feudal Japan back into the cultural spotlight, and its story of stranded English navigator John Blackthorne becoming a high ranking samurai somewhat reflects that of Yasuke.The game does look beautiful, with intricate environments, a dramatic weather system and incredibly bloody combat. Ubisoft has survived a difficult period; a lot now rests on its most treasured possession.Assassin’s Creed Shadows is released on 20 March for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox.

Then it made her a star. She talks about her childhood in South Africa, life in Britain, and the ‘full-on’ training for her new tourByEmine SanerMon 17 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 08.19 EDTShareIn news that should gladden the nation, Oti Mabuse – beloved dancer, grafter and bringer of joy – has just become a British citizen. My own feeling is that Mabuse should have received instant citizenship along with her national treasure status, thanks to her work on Strictly Come Dancing, on which she competed for seven years. At least, thanks to theLife in the UKtest, she knows all about our mountains, parliaments and islands, she says with a laugh.No time to celebrate – Mabuse is in the middle of preparing for her new dance tour, Viva Carnival, which opens this summer. Her previous show, I Am Here, “was very personal, aboutSouth Africaand growing up, and everything that happened there, and the reasons why I am the way I am. I wanted a slight continuation of that – not where I come from, but where I would love to go.” She loves travelling, she says, and connecting with people, and she wanted to explore the world’s festivals, from Brazil’s carnival to Glastonbury. The idea was “to kind of create my own dance carnival”.For the past three weeks, Mabuse has been back in the gym for two hours a day, “getting the knees not to crack, and getting that flexibility where I would love it to be, creating stamina and strength to be able to dance a two-hour show every night”. Then she’s in the dance studio for another three hours. “So it is full-on,” says Mabuse, with some understatement when we meet in a central London hotel bar during a rare window in her schedule.Just 16 months ago, Mabuse gave birth to her daughter, 10 weeks early. The baby was in neonatal intensive care for six weeks, and Mabuse had to overcome sepsis and gestational diabetes. In the past year, she has somehow still found the time to reprise her role as a judge on ITV’s skating showDancing on Ice, appear on I’m a Celebrity and write her first romance novel.. And now there’s this new tour, which she is creating with her husband, the dancer Marius Iepure. They run a dance studio and have toured together before. Working with him is “so much fun,” she says. They can irritate each other in their married life, like any couple, but “when we dance, it’s magic”.View image in fullscreen‘She watches and hears everything that I say’ … Mabuse with her daughter.Photograph: Oti Mabuse/PAHaving a baby, she says, has made her more motivated than ever, “because I want to create something that she could look back at and watch mommy and daddy on stage”. Her body is not the same – she is less flexible and not as strong as she was – but that’s only because she stopped for a while. She’ll get it all back, she says.I always think that for athletes, and I include dancers, something as big as pregnancy, or even just ageing (Mabuse is 34) and the physical changes it brings, must bring a sense of loss or grief – but it’s not really like that for her, she says. She was always very critical of her body. She pulls out her phone and finds a picture, taken around 10 years ago, that a friend sent her recently. “I remember being on this shoot and feeling like I was overweight. I was so stressed about what I looked like and feeling like it wasn’t thin enough.” She was tiny but she never thought that was good enough. “Now I look at my body, although a completely different size, as a tool of strength.”There are still times she catches herself being self-critical, often when she’s teaching in her studio. “But now, I think because I’ve created a whole human being, I can look at my daughter and I go, my body is amazing, and what it produced is incredible. The confidence that I have in my body now has totally increased. I have to love my body, and it’s the only one that I have, and unlearn all these toxic things that I learned from a young age because of the world that I grew up in.”View image in fullscreenWith fans at the Brit awards in London this month.Photograph: JMEnternational/Getty ImagesIt was inevitable that Mabuse, who grew up in Pretoria, would become a dancer. Both her older sisters danced – the eldest,Motsi, is a Latin dance champion and judge on Strictly Come Dancing – and their mother, a teacher, also ran dance classes. “I don’t think I had a choice,” says Mabuse, who started when she was around four. “It was in our family from long before I was born, and I think South Africa as a culture, we’re quite a vibrant, dancing country. We dance all the time.”There was also a serious reason for her mother’s interest in dance. Mabuse was two when her older brother, Neo, died by suicide, aged 18. “I think it formulated my mom’s way of parenting,” says Mabuse. “That’s why she put us in dancing, in this world where we would be focused, and we would not have outside influences. We grew up in an area that was full of drugs and violence, so she gave us dance to keep us focused.” Mabuse thinks dance also allowed them to express their grief, “to be kids and to feel happy. I think, as a family, that’s why we would deeply need to dance.”I used to tell my first dance partner: ‘You’re not practising hard enough. I want to win. Let’s go!’As a child, she would compete, which brought her to Blackpool for competitions, which she loved. Her memories seem to revolve mainly around food – fish and chips, pick’n’mix, and “lots of sandwiches. You guys love sandwiches,” she says, a little bemused. Was she always competitive and determined? “Oh my God, my first partner will tell you. I was just like: ‘You’re not practising hard enough. I want to win. We can do this. Let’s go!’”Mabuse says that comes from her parents. “They both had to come out of really bad situations, from poor South Africa, and you have to be determined to make it, you have to be ambitious.” Her mother was a teacher, and her father was a lawyer and is now a high court judge. “He decided to study law because of the injustice and because more people needed defence, and they need to know their rights,” she says of the apartheid era in which he fought to train and work, and of the inequality of South Africa today.View image in fullscreenWith her husband, Marius Iepure, at the London Coliseum in 2020.Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty ImagesHer parents weren’t wealthy by white South African standards, but their education meant they were in situations – in schools, or invited to social gatherings – where they would often be the only Black family. Mabuse remembers just joining in with the other children, but “you can feel that something is going on with the adults in the room. My dad wanted us to be in these spaces because he wanted to let us know, as three young girls, that we belong in South Africa, in all spaces, and all spaces are free. So we grew up with this mentality of, ‘Of course I’m here – why wouldn’t I be?’ But also being used to being the only Black person in that space and having to be confident.”As an adult, she says, “I think I’m comfortable in spaces where people don’t look like me.” Both she and Motsi later moved to Germany to dance.Mabuse was three when Nelson Mandela became president. She says she didn’t grow up with a feeling of pressure that she had to make the most of her dreams because the older women in her family weren’t able to. That might have been the case for Motsi, who is 10 years older, she says. But watching Motsi pursue her love of dance was inspirational, and fuelled Mabuse’s determination and the entrepreneurialism she thinks her own generation identified with. “Create your own businesses, your own opportunities, your own dance schools, your own dance competitions. It was, just, think of other ways. We were let free.”View image in fullscreenMabuse backstage in Birmingham for Strictly Come Dancing dress rehearsals in 2017.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianMabuse’s parents, though, were not too pleased when she abandoned her engineering degree to dance professionally. When Mabuse’s mother saw her in the Australian jungle in last year’s I’m aCelebrity, “she was like, ‘Did you train as an engineer to do this?’” Mabuse laughs. “And then at the end, she was like, ‘I’m proud of you. You’ve done so well.’”Mabuse loved dance, but it was tough. In ballroom, the people who were winning the competitions and getting to compete abroad, she says, “were not of African descent, so they did not have the hips, the belly, the bums and the curves. What we saw was people who didn’t look like us, but had a certain shape, and they were doing well.” It was something she had been aware of, at first subconsciously, since she was four. “Every dancer will tell you that they have such a bad relationship with their body and how they see themselves.”If you’re African and you’re tiny, people think there’s something wrong with youThe people she looked up to, “the people who win, they look this way, this size, this hair. And when you sign contracts as a professional dancer, whether you’re dancing in a theatre or on a [cruise] ship, you get weighed. You get told that if you look a certain way, you dance better. If you weigh a certain amount, you’re not heavy to lift. No one ever told me I was fat – everyone was like, ‘You’re amazing’ – but I didn’t believe that. I think that came from my own insecurity, and growing up and seeing people being smaller than me.”‘I come from a country of strong women’: Oti Mabuse on fame, family, Strictly – and that sambaRead moreHer mother made her eat, she says. “You grow up in this dance world where you need to look a certain way, but if you’re African and you’re tiny, people think there’s something wrong with you. My mom was like, ‘I’m not going to be going to the family meeting and have people think there’s something wrong with my child.’ So we ate – and I love food.” But she tried to stay slim with a lot of training, and “stupid yo-yo diets”. She remembers training while wearing special plastic trousers, in the belief she could sweat herself smaller. “Now, when I look back at it, I’m just like, that was crazy.”Mabuse only really started being kinder to herself since the birth of her daughter. “I had to relearn that relationship [with my body], because she watches and hears everything that I say. She’s going to hear that and talk about her body that way. I’m still learning, and I’m still trying to get to a point where I look at myself and I go, ‘Good girl! You’ve done really well, you’re amazing.’”View image in fullscreen‘Strictly brought me to that audience that had never seen anyone who looked like me’ … Mabuse and Bill Bailey in 2020.Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PASurely Mabuse – twice Strictly champion, inspirer of generations of children, speaker of six languages and (almost) an engineering graduate – deserves to say that to herself every day? “I think everyone deserves to say that. I wonder, why don’t we as women? Then, if you do think that you’re amazing, it’s like, oh my gosh, you think so highly of yourself. You’re seen as overconfident or egoistic.”Mabuse became South African dance champion eight times, and after moving in 2012 to Germany, where ballroom is taken seriously, and looking for a new dance partner, she met Iepure and they married in 2014. The following year, Mabuse appeared on the German version of Strictly, and on the UK original. She won in 2019 with actor Kelvin Fletcher, and again the following year with comedian Bill Bailey. Mabuse’s energy, joy and work ethic made her a fan favourite (she left after the 2021 series, and I don’t think it’s been the same without her). She says early on that many women told her, “‘If I had seen a woman like you, who was your colour or had your [body] or your hair, I probably would have never stopped dancing.’ I think Strictly brought me to that audience that had never seen anyone who looked like me. People felt OK in being themselves, because they saw that.”She realised, she says, that on such a mainstream show, “I represent not just women, or Black women, I represent African women, and I represent African women who come over from Africa to Europe.”View image in fullscreenWith Iepure and their new baby in 2023.Photograph: Oti MabuseShe loved her time on the show – she still works behind the scenes on choreography for it – but over the past year, Strictly has been rocked by allegations of bullying. Although she doesn’t know about the individual dancers involved, she says that if there is pressure on the pros, it’s not created by the producers. “It’s something that comes from us, and that’s something that we have to own up to.”In her experience, Mabuse says, she was reminded that it was ultimately an entertainment show “and your job is to give joy to people. Anything else, I think would be a personal desire, and how you work is how you work, and also how you’ve been brought up.”Mabuse certainly put pressure on herself. Last year, she told the podcastWe Need to Talkthat at one point in one series, when she was paired with a celebrity who “I just couldn’t get to love the job as much as I wanted,” her husband found her on the floor of the shower, fully clothed, in tears because of the stress.She always wanted to do well on Strictly, she says. “I had a lot on my shoulders, like I said. I don’t just represent myself – I stand for something as well, in terms of who is watching me and what it implies.” She wouldn’t have taken her dance partners to the finals without motivating herself to put the work in. “I needed the, ‘Oti, maybe you’re not pushing yourself hard enough. You’ve got to push yourself a little harder.’ When I pushed myself the hardest, I won twice.”Dance has given her everything – a life, a family. It makes her happy. “It’s a dopamine hit, it takes away the negative feelings, any frustrations that you’re feeling.” In the moment when she’s dancing, whether in a studio or on stage, with her husband or working out a little TikTok routine, “anything that is wrong with the world does not exist”.Oti Mabuse – Viva Carnival UK tour starts on 12 JuneExplore more on these topicsThe G2 interviewOti MabuseDanceBody imageEntertainment TVWomenStrictly Come DancinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

What about a gynaecological exam performed by identical twins, or a man’s transmogrification into a grotesque human-insectoid hybrid? These are just some of the challenges faced, over more than 40 years and upwards of a dozen films, by the composer Howard Shore as part of his long collaboration with the director David Cronenberg. Shore, 78, may have won three Oscars for the magisterial sweep of his Lord of the Rings score, but it is his work on the 81-year-old Cronenberg’s notorious body-horror movies, from The Fly to Dead Ringers and Crash, that is most indelible. Those last two films will be screening this month as part of a wider tribute to Shore’s work at the London Soundtrack festival, where the composer will appear with his director-collaborator for an onstage conversation. Ahead of that encounter and the release of their next collaboration,The Shrouds, the pair sat down to talk about their long, bloody body of work.You’re both from Toronto, but how did your paths first cross?Howard ShoreWe had multiple friends in common, and we were introduced by [artist] Stephen Zeifman, another one of us Toronto men. But I’d already seen David around town on his motorcycle, a gorgeous Ducati. I’d see him driving around in this beautiful leather motorcycle outfit. As a kid, 15 or 16, you’d notice someone like that rolling around your neighbourhood.David CronenbergI used to race motorcycles while wearing a one-piece red and white leather jumpsuit. This was in the 80s. I’ve got photos.View image in fullscreenBlood brothers … David Cronenberg and Howard Shore.Composite: Julien de Rosa/AFP/Getty Images; Christophe AbramowitzDid you feel an instant connection on your first encounter?DCAbsolutely not. [Chuckles] No, we were friends right away. Howard and I mixed together very naturally. We were local, we knew each other, we were making inroads into film. It doesn’t always work, coming from similar backgrounds, but it did for us. The rest is history.HSI knew David’s films from midnight screenings, underground film festivals I’d go to around this time. I’d scored one film, and then I worked up the guts to ask him if I could work on The Brood. He was generous, as he’s always been. He took on a young composer without a lot of experience.How do you two get on the same page, creatively? After so much work together, is there a close alignment from the start in your early meetings, or are you still finding the vision together each time?DCWe don’t really talk a lot! We’ve got a shorthand, maybe it’s telepathy. On The Shrouds, we barely talked at all. We didn’t see each other. And yet what Howard did for the movie was perfect, so beautiful. And I’m lazy enough to be happy with this system. Movies are collaborative, which means that the more geniuses you surround yourself with, the less work you have to do.HSWe talk mostly before the recordings, then a little more afterward. Sometimes, we’ll create things in the overdub. We did that on Naked Lunch, overlaying two pieces just to see what it would sound like and going: “Hey, that’s interesting, what just happened?” After the fact, some of those surprises give you the best results.Mark Kermode on… David Cronenberg, master of gore as a metaphor for our deepest anxietiesRead moreView image in fullscreenAuto fiction … James Spader and Holly Hunter in Crash.Photograph: Columbia Tristar/AllstarDCEarly on, we developed this idea that a music track can do more than emphasise what’s already there. I’m seeing so many Netflix series, for example, where the music is just pounding, pounding, pounding all the time, telling you what to feel. People might just be having lunch, and it’s pounding in the background. We felt that you can do more than say: “This is a scary scene, so we’ll play scary music.”HSYou play to the subtext of the story. You need to broaden the frame. What you want isn’t just in the middle, it’s on the margins, in the fringes, all around the frame. Once I see a cut, it becomes intuitive. I feel what I need to create, really.You both stuck together after you started working together, right up until The Dead Zone. Was there a reason that you went in another direction, David?DCThis all had to do with one guy in the music department at Dino De Laurentiis’s organisation [which produced the film]. He felt that Michael Kamen was a lovely guy, and because he had some connections with Pink Floyd [Kamen oversaw the orchestral arrangements on Pink Floyd’s The Wall], the guy was mesmerised by that. He believed that would be good for the movie – which it turned out not to be, at least not the Pink Floyd connection. It didn’t make much sense. This was one of the few times I’ve been muscled out of my first choice. I’ve evaded it for most of my career, but every now and then, influences creep in from the outside. Michael was great, he did a great score, but I still wonder how you would’ve done it, Howard.And Howard, yourfirst film scored without David was Martin Scorsese’s After Hours. Howdid that come about? Was it difficult to work without the collaborator who’d been a constant for you?HSDavid actually introduced me to Martin Scorsese. Marty was interested in David’s films, knew his work really well, and they’d started corresponding. Marty invited you to New York just to talk and spend some time together, right?DCHis mother made dinner for us.HSWe had pasta with Mama and Papa Scorsese, and that’s how I met him. Though I guess the story really goes back to the Brill Building. Marty was cutting there with [his longtime editor] Thelma Schoonmaker while I had a studio in the Brill Building, and I met the film’s star, Griffin Dunne, in the elevator. Suddenly, next thing I know, I’ve agreed to work on the film.View image in fullscreenBug in the system … Peter Weller in Naked Lunch.Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/ShutterstockHoward, do you have a favourite of David’s films?

Those are my favourites, too. I’d add Naked Lunch and The Fly, because The Fly was our first symphonic score, and Naked Lunch because we got to work with Ornette Coleman.DCI’ve told this story before, but there’s a scene in The Fly where Jeff Goldblum’s walking down Yonge Street, about to go do the arm-wrestling bit, and the music is huge, orchestral. And Mel Brooks, who produced it, asked: “It’s just a guy walking down the street, why’s it got to sound like this?” And I said: “Mel, this is a man going to meet his destiny.” And he accepted that we were right.On Dead Ringers, I remember listening to the tape Howard sent me in the car on a drive from Toronto out to my place in the countryside, and I was almost in tears by the time I arrived. It was so emotional, so overwhelming. I remember that so clearly. And this was only a preliminary version!View image in fullscreenSend in the swat team … Jeff Goldblum in The Fly.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockHSI’m interested in this dark emotional world.

I’m comfortable there.DCIt must have to do with our upbringing in Toronto. It must’ve been terrifying.HSSomething must have gone wrong with us.You know, when [Life Is Beautiful director] Roberto Benigni came to Toronto, he said that coming to the film festival here was very frightening to him, because he only knew the city from my movies. He figured it must be a scary place. Howard’s a big part of that.The inauguralLondon Soundtrack Festival (19-26 March), features Shore and Cronenberg in conversation and a Gala concert at Royal Festival Hall on 22 March.

The London-born rapper and actor said that the debt left her unable to pay her full tax liability in January 2024.Inflo had worked with Simz, born Simbiatu Ajikawo, since her third album, 2019’s Grey Area, as well as producing for Adele, Michael Kiwanuka, Tyler, the Creator, and Inflo’s wife, soul singer Cleo Sol.The rapper filed her claim in January, alleging that Inflo held on to loans for more than a year and that his company provided improper accounting to her for funds that Sony supplied to cover recording,Law360 reports.Inflo has not yet filed a defence to the claim. Representatives for Simz offered no comment. The Guardian has contacted representatives for Inflo.In April 2022, Simz left her previous manager to work with an employee of Inflo’s company, Forever Living Originals. When her publishing contract with Universal Music Publishing ended, Inflo advised her to self-publish her music, the claim states.Simz then worked with Artists Without a Label (AWAL), a label services company for independent artists, owned by Sony. In November 2022, she entered a three-album deal with a total advance of £2m, as well as £625,000 to cover the costs of recording the third album.Prior to receiving the costs payment, Simz made two separate payments of £350,000 and £275,000 to Inflo to cover the costs of that record with AWAL. In October 2024, a letter sent by Inflo’s solicitors stated that the total costs only came to £524,436. Her claim states that she was under the impression any remaining funds would be returned to her on completion of the album.Simz lent Inflo the money on 1 December 2023 to cover the Drumsheds show on the condition that he repay her by 4 December. The claim states that he failed to do so, saying he was “still getting [his] deal over the line” and would send the money “back as soon as it lands”. Tickets for the event cost £99 each.Simz lent Inflo further sums of £500,000 and £200,000 in December 2023, but she claims he failed to repay them in 2024 despite repeated requests.

They all know. If they say they do not, they’re either fucking stupid or lying. It’s just driven by greed.”Writing on his website, Young linked to a story about Smith’s stance, saying: “Try to read [this] story about Robert Smith, the Cure and what they did. I think it was right.” Young called dynamic pricing a “bad thing that has happened to concerts worldwide”, and said Smith “really helped me to realise I have a choice to make and can make a difference to my music-loving friends”.He elaborated on his own position:My management and agent have always tried to cover my back on the road, getting me the best deals they could. They have tried to protect me and the fans from scalpers who buy the best tickets and resell them at huge increases for their own profits. Ticketmaster’s high-priced Platinum tickets were introduced to the areas where scalpers were buying the most tickets for resale. The money went to me. That did not feel right. Very soon, Platinum tickets will no longer be available for my shows. I have decided to let the people work this out. Buy aggressively when the tickets come out or tickets will cost a lot more in a secondary market.When asked for comment, Ticketmaster said: “Ticketmaster is a marketplace that sells tickets on behalf of event organisers including sports teams, artist teams, theatre producers and so on. We respect their decisions to price their tickets how they see fit.”Young, 79, is preparing for his Love Earth tour with his band the Chrome Hearts, with performances across Europe and north America between April and August. Young will play two concerts in the UK, headlining Glastonbury festival on 28 June and BST Hyde Park on 11 July.The most notorious recent example of dynamic pricing was for Oasis’s UK tour: the huge demand meant that tickets that were originally £148.50rose to £355.20. Fans were outraged and culture secretary Lisa Nandy called out the practice, saying it was “incredibly depressing”.Bands urged to oppose dynamic pricing of concert tickets after Oasis ‘fiasco’Read moreLiam Gallagher was initially unrepentant,telling a fan to “shut up”after they complained about the prices, but the band later distanced themselves from the issue, saying: “Oasis leave decisions on ticketing and pricing entirely to their promoters and management”. While calling dynamic pricing “a useful tool” they also acknowledged its use in the UK ticket sales resulted in “an unacceptable experience for fans”, and did not use dynamic pricing for other territories on their world tour.Not only have the Cure banned dynamic pricing for their tours, they also set ticket prices low and have confronted Ticketmaster over other fees. In 2023, after seeing that US fans were being charged service fees that were sometimes greater than the face-value cost of the tickets, Smith took the company to task, saying he was “sickened” by the fees. Ticketmaster backed down and offered a $10 refund on the affected tickets.Explore more on these topicsNeil YoungThe CureMusic industryTicketmasterCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

In anessay for the Paris Review, Damion Searls likened Solstad to the John Lennon of Norwegian letters: “the experimentalist, the ideas man.”Born in the Sandefjord municipality in south-easternNorwayin 1941, Solstad began his writing career as a journalist for a local newspaper, before taking up short fiction aged 23.A former member of the Maoist Communist party of Norway, he described himself in recent years as a “political amateur”, but also stated on his 80th birthday that he would like to be remembered as a communist.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Now, there is no life here at all and anyone who comes is sad. They can remember what it once was,” the 40-year-old museum director says.There is little left of the palace – a mansion and fortress during Mamluk and Ottoman rule over Gaza and where Napoleon Bonaparte once spent several nights. Israeli bombardment and fighting in Gaza City during late 2023 and early 2024 left just a few sections of wall and an arch standing. Almost nothing remains of the museum.For Dahda, the loss is personal too. He had not wanted to leave the palace and so did not join hundreds of thousands of others fleeing to the south of Gaza when war broke out. In December 2023, he was staying with his wife and three daughters nearby when there was a huge explosion.“All my close family members were pulled out from under the rubble injured, except for my daughter Mervat, 12 years old, who was pulled out as a lifeless body. May God have mercy on her,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe Pasha Palace seen in 2022 and again on 5 January last year.Photograph: Getty ImagesPasha Palace is one of dozens of major heritage sites destroyed or badly damaged in the war in Gaza, which was triggered by a Hamas surprise raid into southern Israel in October 2023 in which 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and 251 abducted. The death toll from the Israeli offensive that followed reached more than 48,000 people, also mostly civilians, before a fragile ceasefire came into effect in January 2025.The offensive devastated Gaza, leaving fewer thana 10th of homes untouched, and destroying sanitation systems, health facilities, schools, universities, roads and much else.Palestinian experts working with British archaeologistsestimate that more than two-thirdsof heritage, cultural and archaeological sites in Gaza have been damaged, often very badly.Many appear to have been directly targeted by Israeli forces in attacks that could constitute war crimes in some circumstances. Israeli officials have said cultural monuments such as the Pasha Palace were only ever attacked if used by Hamas for military purposes and deny accusations that such sites were deliberately targeted for destruction.Close to Pasha Palace is Hamam al-Samara, a 700-year-old bath house that was among the most important of Gaza’s monuments. Its guardian was Salim al-Wazir, 74, who spent the war in southern Gaza living in tents.View image in fullscreenSalim al-Wazir, 74, guardian of Hamam al-Samara.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianAl-Wazir took over management of the bath house in 1970 from his father, whose own father had rented it from a famous family of Gaza notables during the era of Ottoman rule.“On the first day we could return to the north of Gaza from where we had been sheltering, I didn’t go to my home but instead came first to check on the hamam,” he says.Wazir was stunned. The hamam had been almost entirely destroyed.“I lost a place that meant a lot to me, a place that gathered people and provided them with comfort and relaxation. I also lost a part of my family’s history and of course of Gaza’s collective memory,” he says.View image in fullscreenMen relaxing in Hamam al-Samara in 2021 and a view of the destroyed bath house in January 2024.Photograph: Getty ImagesA recent reportby Palestinian conservation expertsin the occupied West Bank and UK-based archaeologists estimated that just protecting historical sites from further damage in Gaza – if the current ceasefire holds – will cost about $33m and take up to 18 months. Full reconstruction could cost almost 10 times more and take up to eight years.Competing proposals for the reconstruction of Gaza have paid little attention to historical sites. Donald Trump proposed levelling the territory after displacing its inhabitantsto build a “Riviera of the Middle East”. Others look to cities such as Dubai for inspiration, with a focus on towering hotels and malls, not heritage.But many in Gaza City want a different future for even the most badly damaged historical buildings, calling for their protection and eventual reconstruction.“If no one else takes on the task, I will spend the rest of my life rebuilding [the Hamam al-Samara] myself,” says Wazir. “I think we can reconstruct it exactly as it was, using the same stones and design. That way we can restore its former spirit.”Experts also point to bombed Roman and Greek remains, as well as bulldozed historical cemeteries, to underline the cultural richness that is still potentially at risk of further damage – either from a return to war or clumsy reconstruction.Many residents see theal-Omari mosque, the oldest and largest in the territory, as the greatest potential loss. The building was originally a Byzantine church, then was converted into a mosque after the Islamic conquest of Palestine almost 1,400 years ago. It was expanded over the centuries and rebuilt once after being almost destroyed by British artillery targeting an Ottoman ammunition dump there.View image in fullscreenAl-Omari mosque seen in 2013 and again in January last year after Israeli bombardment.Photograph: Getty ImagesHistorians point to the mosque, along with a Roman port and other sites, as evidence of the importance of Gaza as athriving trading centrefor 2,000 years.Tarek Haniya, 60, had been working at the mosque as a tour guide since his youth.“I have lived my life in Gaza, next to the mosque. The war was harsh in every sense of the word. Every day felt like a new nightmare. I lost my friends, I lost family members, I lost my home that had sheltered me for decades, and I lost the Omari mosque as I knew it too,” he says.View image in fullscreenTarek Haniya, the guide at the mosque.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianThough the mosque’s famous Mamluk-era wooden pulpit has survived almost undamaged, much of its roof is gone, most walls are in ruins and the minaret partly toppled.“It will definitely be restored. In fact, we are already working on that. There is a team collecting the broken stones of the mosque to restore it as soon as possible. True, the old mosque held irreplaceable history within its walls, but we will rebuild it.”Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warHeritageArchaeologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She was to discover that it was the very same painting by the 17th-century Flemish court painter to King Charles I, stolen from them.Now, 35 years after his death, the culprit has been exposed as that expert, LGG Ramsey, according to investigative work by Dr Meredith Hale, a senior lecturer in art history at the University of Exeter.Ramsey, having been the editor of a leading art journal,the Connoisseur,at the time was the picture of respectability. But Hale has uncovered evidence that he was a “gentleman thief” who, on visitingBoughton House, stole The Portrait of Wolfgang Wilhelm of Pfalz-Neuburg.View image in fullscreenRamsey claimed he bought the painting from a market stall in Hemel Hempstead.Photograph: Buccleuch Living Heritage TrustPerhaps he assumed no one would notice the absence of a small painting from “the English Versailles”, which was filled with pictures, furniture and tapestries.In a paper to be published this month by the BritishArtJournal, Hale writes of a “remarkable theft”.The portrait is one of 37 oil sketches byVan Dyckand his studio for his Iconography print series.The unique group of grisailles – paintings in monochrome – was bought in 1682 by Ralph, Earl of Montagu. All the panels, circa 22cm x 16.5cm, remained with his descendants, the Dukes of Buccleuch and Queensberry, until the 1951 visit by Leonard Gerald Gwynne Ramsey.At the time, Ramsey was preparing the 1952 edition of The Connoisseur’s Year Book, which was tofeature seven pages on Boughton House.Hale said: “Oddly, but significantly … the Van Dyck sketches were not mentioned in the article.”She unearthed a 1953 letter from another expert, Ludwig Goldscheider, who authenticated the picture at Ramsey’s request and provided a certificate on the back of the portrait’s photograph.In 1954, the painting was sold by Christie’s London, which highlighted Goldscheider’s certificate. While the seller was anonymous, Hale discovered it had been consigned by the Bond Street dealer Eugene Slatter on Ramsey’s behalf.Each was linked through The Connoisseur, Hale realised. Ramsey edited the journal, Goldscheider published scholarly articles there and Slatter’s exhibitions were routinely praised.A collector, who bought the Van Dyck at Christie’s for £189, sold it to a dealer, who sold it in 1955 for $2,700 to a New York collector, Lillian Malcove, who loaned it in 1957 to the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University.Hale said the provenance was challenged after “the extraordinary chance visit” to the Fogg by the Duchess of Buccleuch in 1957. A memo in Boughton’s archive informed her: “Ours is missing.”Her husband, the 8th Duke of Buccleuch, wrote to the Fogg, requesting its return “to its rightful home”.View image in fullscreenBoughton House in Northamptonshire.Photograph: Sophie-Ann Steers/AlamyThe museum’s director, John Coolidge, replied: “We are all anxious to clear up this distressing affair.”A notebook of Sir Oliver Millar, the then deputy surveyor of the Royal Collection, reveals that he examined the sketches in 1950. Yet Christie’s told the duke and Coolidge: “The owner says that he bought the picture in January, 1950, at a [market] stall in … Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire … He is unable to get into touch with the stallholder … I am afraid, therefore, that it is impossible to trace the history of the picture farther back.”Ramsey wrote to Christie’s: “I have not at all clear recollections of what the man looked like.”Goldscheider insisted he had given only an “opinion” rather than a “certificate”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He must have known that he would be found out.”Clark was also unimpressed by a Christie’s executive: “When he speaks about … Goldscheider changing his mind, he is trying to excuse the most bare-faced falsification.”The correspondence shows that Ramsey claimed he had never been to Boughton, before admitting: “I was privileged to visit … [in 1951].”The Fogg returned the portrait to Malcove in 1960. Hale writes: “It must have seemed impossible to prove Ramsey’s involvement, however strong the circumstantial evidence … For the duke’s part … there could be no absolute proof.”It was eventually bequeathed to the University of Toronto, whose executive committee voted to return it to the Duke of Buccleuch, and it recently went back to Boughton House.Asked how convinced she is of the two experts’ guilt, Hale told the Guardian: “Absolutely and completely convinced.”She added: “My research led to it being returned. I negotiated with Toronto, all the way through, right until the end, when we got lawyers involved. So it was my restitution.”The editor of the British Art Journal, Prof Robin Simon, said the experts were unquestionably “crooks”.He said: “I shall never know how the owners managed to remain so patient and polite over so many years, not only in trying to deal with the thief – whom they had allowed into their house in good faith – but also faced with the snail-like process of getting their painting back.“It makes uncomfortable reading for me since I have been editor of Apollo magazine, the great rival of The Connoisseurat the time. Our work depends upon trust. And we have to be scrupulous in scholarship and provenance. Which makes the involvement of a legendary art historian such as Goldscheider – co-founder of Phaidon Press – all the more shocking. I’m afraid he was in it up to his neck, both the sale and the cover-up.”The University of Toronto said: “The painting became part of the University of Toronto’s art collection in 1981 as a result of a bequest. At that time, the university had no reason to believe there were any issues with its provenance. After becoming aware of new evidence about the history of the painting, the university immediately initiated discussions to return the work to its owner, a process that was completed in 2022.”Hale’s research will be published inthe British Art Journal,which relaunches online on 18 March.Explore more on these topicsArt theftVan DyckArtPaintingNetherlandsCanadaNorthamptonshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The harsh, extreme-bass sound of his second, 2020’s Whole Lotta Red, took him to a new level of fame and acclaim – it was canonised as the second best album this decade by Pitchfork (beaten only by Fiona Apple) and a massive influence on a whole generation of rage-rap from Yeat to Ken Carson, OsamaSon and numerous other noisy young MCs. Carti initially announced Whole Lotta Red’s follow-up just three months after its release. Instead, it’s been – cue Titanic grandma voice – over four years, with Pitchfork recently issuing a 34-entry breakdown of all the false dawns and teased info that Carti has drip-fed his starving fans in that time.It looked like Music (renamed from I Am Music) would finally arrive on Friday, but the promised release time was moved back by three hours. When that time arrived, no album appeared. “My bones are weak, my soul is drained, and my will to live is hanging by a thread” was one typical reaction in the Instagram comments; the danger was that the wait was so long it could never be worth it. But Music is easily good enough to sweep any embitterment away and could come to be seen as a trap classic.This is not a forum for politically conscious lyrics or scrupulously tailored ethics, nor is it aiming to be (though the latter are complicated in Carti’s case by allegations around his own behaviour: his ex-partner, rapper Iggy Azalea, claimed he was absent from their son’s birth in 2020, and he was arrested in 2023 for allegedly assaulting his pregnant girlfriend, which he denied). Instead it’s a litany of boasts, threats, consumption (material and chemical) and reports of sexual congress that range from coldly efficient to outright demeaning: I winced at “spit on a bitch like Pac”.But for the most part, Carti’s nihilism is riveting, partly because of what he says (“I put your ass in the food chain” is a Sopranos-worthy threat) but mostly because of how he says it. You can certainly spot the MCs that have inspired him, from Lil Wayne’s gnarled croak to Future’s narcotised mantras, but Carti, a self-styled “emo thug”, subsumes them into his own bizarre and massively varied diction. On I Seeeeee You Baby Boi he babbles in a downy-soft high register, on Evil J0rdan he uses a hoarse, jaded mid-range and on Mojo Jojo there are deep pronouncements like a vocal-fried wizard: his delivery of the phrase “he a goon” is worth the price of admission alone. While many MCs dutifully work their lyrics to the beat, Carti makes the beat for work for him, adding little bursts of chatter or slurred words outside it while maintaining a core rhythm. It makes freestyle tracks like HBA especially involving.The beats themselves are just as varied, from classic Atlantan trap to a Hungarian psych sample underpinning the superb Philly, dainty chipmunk-soul on Backd00r, bright R&B on We Need All Da Vibes and some mechanistic ragers such as Pop Out and Cocaine Nose, the latter sampling the sensuously heavy guitar from Ashanti’s Only U.The frequent interjections of DJ Swamp Izzo, admiring Carti or simply shouting his own name at maximum volume, helps to glue these styles together, and nicely offsets the grandeur of this most lofty and long-awaited album project, making it feel more like a mixtape or radio session. But the guest rappers clearly sense the history being made here. Future’s triplet flow is fearsome and relentless on Trim, as if putting his nose to your face and backing you towards a ledge, while Travis Scott subtly moves his lines on Philly up and down in pitch to make cleverly minimalist hooks.Like Carti himself, Kendrick Lamar bends his voice into various forms, from Mojo Jojo – where he’s a trickster-god capering on Carti’s shoulder, throwing mischievous ad-libs in his ear – to Backd00r, with the doleful melodic style he recently used on SZA’s 30 for 30, to the crotchety-uncle voice he used all over his album GNX which reappears here on Good Credit. And the Weeknd is on top form on Rather Lie, a cloud-rap track of chest-clutching beauty that will probably become the big pop hit in the ensuing weeks – though everything on Music is already proving massively popular, becoming Spotify’s most streamed album in a single day this year.Across 30 tracks there are some lapses – Dis 1 Got It and Walk can’t break out of Future cosplay, Twin Trim is a witless Lil Uzi Vert showcase, and Munyun is rather tepid and polite for a blown-out speaker-botherer. But for most of the 77-minute running time, Carti meets the expectations he made so high for himself.Explore more on these topicsRapalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, it lands on Netflix – and all this week, influencers (plus a legendary footballer) will have to deplete their prize pot to survive. Oh, and everything costs through the roofStuart HeritageMon 17 Mar 2025 10.42 EDTLast modified on Mon 17 Mar 2025 10.45 EDTShareAt the end of last year, MrBeast – an unfathomably successful YouTuber who revels in obnoxious demonstrations of wealth – went mainstream. He launchedBeast Gameson Prime Video, a sort of cloth-eared, Squid Game-style elimination show that entirely failed to twig that Squid Game was a satire. I gave it a pasting, but it went on to become Prime’s second biggest series debut of 2024.As such, we now find ourselves in a weird new world. Streamers have realised that the only way they can compete with YouTube is to open the cheque book for its content and run it on their own platforms. It’s what Amazon did with Beast Games, and it’s whatNetflixhas done with Inside. The latter is a British reality show that premiered on YouTube last year. Every episode got more viewers than anything shown on BBC One, so Netflix quickly snapped up the rights to the second season. Inside will be watched by so many people that it’s almost pointless for me to tell you whether it’s any good or not.I can tell you, at least, that it isn’t particularly original. The central conceit of Inside is that a bunch of people have to live in a house together, which makes it largely indistinguishable from Big Brother. There’s a room where everyone hangs out, and a shared bedroom, and a room with a chair where everyone can directly address the camera, almost as if it were some kind of diary. The contestants must also intermittently submit to challenges, which seem to primarily involve being covered in rats and spiders, which may raise eyebrows in the I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! legal department.View image in fullscreenFull of spider- and rat-based challenges … Percy Kiangebeni (PK Humble) on Inside.Photograph: NetflixHowever, two things separate Inside from generic reality mush. The first is that it only lasts for a week, with a new episode every day, so it won’t run the risk of wearing out its own novelty. The second, and by far the most interesting, is that the contestants have to deplete their own prize to survive. They start with a million pounds and, aside from basic nutrition, have to buy everything else at comically jacked up prices. Want a cup of tea? That’s £400. A packet of crisps? £500. Fancy a Pot Noodle? That will set you back a grand.From this, it will be perfectly clear to everyone reading that the point of Inside is impulse control. By depriving yourself of unnecessary luxury for a very short amount of time, you have more chance of winning a life-changing sum of money. Anyone with even a shred of common sense could understand that.However, the contestants on Inside do not have a shred of common sense between them, because the contestants on Inside are all influencers. They’re streamers and TikTokers and online rappers and – in a genuinely baffling turn of events – legendary former footballer Patrice Evra. One of them calls himself “News Daddy”. They’re all punishingly difficult to like.View image in fullscreenDifficult to like … Mya Mills on Inside.Photograph: NetflixBefore the first day has ended, these dimwits have blown through tens of thousands of pounds. And that is before the Sidemen start selling them miserable little cups of prosecco at £1,000 a pop, which sets off a firesale of unregulated spending. I’m tempted to keep watching purely to see if it becomes the first reality show in history where the contestants end up owing the producers money.So it’s all a bit naff, but at least Inside benefits from being more watchable thanBeast Games.That show was self-aggrandising to the point of psychosis, whereas this is slightly more British and low-key about things. The narration is a little bit sarcastic and Come Dine With Me – “Let’s see which influencers are having tax issues this time,” it sniffs, by way of introduction – which helps to undercut some of the shrill, full-volume attention-seeking elsewhere on the show.Plus, it’s never a good thing to judge a show like this on its first episode. Like Big Brother, The Traitors and I’m a Celebrity before it, there are simply too many big personalities trying to make a splash at the same time. Once the herd has been thinned a bit, it should gain a bit more breathing room. Who knows, with time and familiarity, it might even end up becoming a bit compelling.Inside is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewNetflixReality TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

With sublime patience and care, Guillaume Cailleau and Ben Russell’s immersive documentary takes us into the day-to-day life of this extraordinary commune, where more than 150 people live, work and organise for change.The popular image of the militant activist in mainstream media is generally reduced to one of joyless aggression and childish petulance; what makes Direct Action particularly invigorating is how it diverges from such sensationalist reporting. While the film briefly begins with videos of violent clashes between police and protesters, much of its 212-minute runtime is dedicated to the unseen pleasures and hardships of collective action. Rendered tactile on textured 16mm film, quotidian routines of kneading bread, cultivating vegetables or tool-making merge into a hypnotic stream of images. Labour emerges not merely as a chore but as the glue that holds the whole community together.During these lengthy scenes, the camera rarely focuses on individual faces, lingering instead on the members’ hands as they work on their various tasks. Their actions are, in other words, the limbs of this collective body. This sense of togetherness is expressed aurally as well, with the sounds of manual work cohering into a choral hymn of resistance.This utopia, however, is constantly under threat. When the storm of state brutality finally encroaches on to the screen, the ensuing rupture of calm is startling. The extended nature of the film thus becomes a message of hope; activism is powered, not by overnight victories, but by rituals that persevere against all odds.Direct Action is at theICA, London, from 21 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsProtestActivismFranceEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

This mostly ludicrous but fitfully enjoyable entry plays like a Donald Trump meat-fever dream; after DEA agents bust a Louisiana everglades drug factory, the Ribena-coloured run-off leaks into the waterways, creating a strain of super-aggressive alligators.Lead prospective morsel in the human chum bucket is biology student Kyle (Athena Strates), who’s heading into the wilderness to scatter her brother’s ashes. Her obnoxious pal Malika (Elisha Applebaum) – a female Steven Stifler – books them on a light aircraft, despite Kyle’s fear of flying. With everyone oblivious to wingnut pilot Frank (Andonis Anthony) essentially being Quint from Jaws, the flight nosedives into the bayou. And with Frank’s operation unchartered, no mobile phone coverage and a swamp teeming with reptiles, they are fresh out of gator aid.From the sun-baked old-timer round the back of the 7/11 crowing over a super-sized saurian, Gator Creek has reptilian-cortex bloodlust switched on from the get-go. Too much, to be honest; on the evidence of the film’s spasmodic plotting, it seems like writers Ashley Holberry and Gavin Cosmo Mehrtens have been sipping the purple run-off themselves. A spat over a mobile phone with a cartoon financial trader improbably causes the plane to crash. With Kyle’s bestie Alice (Madalena Aragão) filching a batch of lizard eggs, the film appears to give the slaughter a behavioural explanation. But it’s completely forgotten until the drug-den finale when, with Kyle in her singlet facing down angry mama gator, the film suddenly seems to think it’s Aliens.Without a sensible guiding hand, a punch-drunk dissonance takes hold of proceedings. Kyle tries to dispense zoological knowledge as a way out of their predicament, which becomes superfluous when events boil down to a rabid reptile rugby scrum. Directors Taneli Mustonen and Brad Watson show bursts of proficiency, with drone shots of metallic-looking glades and interesting tilt-shift effects for the plane crash. But they are alongside some of the most laughable practical effects imaginable: such as the man-trap gator jaws someone unwittingly sticks their head into. Of course there are the copious gorehound kills to latch on to, but Gator Creek is liable to leave you, like its cast, with an unsavoury residue on your hands.Gator Creek is on digital platforms from 24 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersAnimalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

While the meeting was recorded, the tapes only emerged in recent years. João Pedro Bim’s documentary overlays contemporaneous propaganda newsreels with these damning recordings to create an intriguing juxtaposition that reveals the covert machinations of dictatorial rule.Roused from their archival slumber, the newsreel images conjure a mirage of prosperity and unity. In these state-produced materials, marching soldiers, modernist new-builds and flag-waving patriots are ubiquitous. The recorded statements made by high-ranking officials at the infamous meeting accompany these signposts of social harmony, as the plan to restrict democratic freedoms is laid out clinically and methodically. Cast in a new light, the smiling faces that populate the jingoistic films turn eerily grotesque.If propaganda functions as a kind of intellectual opium, Behind Closed Doors provides a rigorous detox through its contrasting of official narratives and concealed abuses of power. Bim accentuates this distancing effect on a visual level by adding freeze frames, time lapse and jump cuts to the existing footage. Such manipulation of continuity pokes holes in the facade of collectivity projected by the state.Though fascinating in their way, these stylistic devices become repetitive. As the film progresses, the various pairings of sounds and images offer fewer and fewer surprises. Moreover, considering how similar some of the past authoritarian tactics are to the strategies enforced by Jair Bolsonaro’s recent government, it is perhaps a missed opportunity that the film didn’t make a more explicit link to current politics.Behind Closed Doors is on True Story from 21 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBrazilCivil liberties - internationalAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

A couple is in crisis; one half is musician Zofia Chabiera who is making her confident acting debut as Wanda, bored and aimless, feeling those first intimations of mortality as people in their late 30s tend to; her unused and thwarted passion is beginning to curdle within her.Wanda is in a stagnant relationship with Jan, played by Marcin Sztabinski, a heavy-set guy who maybe wasn’t quite as heavy-set when they first got together; he runs a bike repair shop, a situation to which he has dwindled having once dreamed of biking around the world. Wanda is irritated beyond endurance at the way Jan does nothing but doom scroll. (Rather shrewdly, she points out that people who spend their time knitting at least have a scarf to show for it.)But it is Jan who has had the imagination to dream up a plan to challenge them both: they will hike along the remote and icy Baltic coastline, sleeping in a tent and generally braving the terrible cold. If they stay the course, they will stay together – but if either loses heart and leaves the sandy shore, then they are finished as a couple.Well, perhaps there are no prizes for guessing whether they have cathartic rows and revelations and quirky serendipitous encounters with unusual people along the way. But the relationship between Jan and Wanda looks very real as they trudge along the vast and freezing seascape, like an ice-cold version of David Lean’s desert. And what does it all add up to? Perhaps not all that much: but it’s a charming and plausible relationship drama featuring people who look as if they might actually be in a relationship.It’s Not My Film is at Hull Independent Cinema on 20 March, then tours, as part of the Kinoteka Polish film festival, and onKlassiki from 21 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPolandEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Despite the smooth, slim, cross-sections we see on the walls of GP surgeries, each of us has this imaginary space that is of interest not only in its deviation from textbook “truth”, but because the idea of our innards affects how we feel about ourselves and what we think our bodies can do for us. This might explain why I chose to become a psychiatrist rather than a surgeon.‘I am changed in every cell of my body’: what surgeon Gabriel Weston learned when she faced serious illness at homeRead moreAs Gabriel Weston writes inAlive, surgeons tend to think they “own anatomy”. Weston is herself a rare breed of surgeon, having read English at Edinburgh University before reckoning with her single biology O-level to join a new course for humanities students who wanted to become doctors. This made her “the least qualified medical student in the country”. Her “soft, arts-loving brain” had to pass as a scientist – an outsider status I share – which got easier once Weston became fascinated by the operating theatre and the “peachy slit” of the scalpel’s opening incision. It’s an obsession that is still evident everywhere in her writing. But she never lost her belief that medicine is dangerously resistant to seeing the body as more than mechanism, the person as more than a case.After becoming an ENT (ear, nose and throat) specialist, Weston stepped out of full-time practice to present BBC Two’sTrust Me, I’m a Doctorand wrote an acclaimed memoir,Direct Red: A Surgeon’s Story(2009), as well as a novel,Dirty Work(2013).Alivehas been a decade in the making, shaped by the “human prism” of ageing, giving birth to and raising twins at 43, a sudden bleed in her son’s brain and a heart condition of her own, first detected as a murmur by her medical student boyfriend in their 20s (peer diagnosis while practising with stethoscopes is not uncommon).Compared with the dynamism and pace of discovery in physiology and pharmacology, anatomy can seem inert, bloodless, settled. It’s a subject that tends to be taught through tatty dissected specimens and bones smoothed by hundreds of hands. Anatomy literally means “to cut up” the body, andAlive’s chapters do so organ by organ, challenging each’s inherited wisdom with a feminist eye. Weston reminds us that awe is surely the correct response when considering the gut as “the largest sensory organ” in constant communion with the microbiota living within it, the kidneys flushed through with 200 litres of fluid in one turn of the Earth’s axis and a girl infant’s nipples able to produce milk in response to maternal oestrogen from her first moments in the world.Half of Britons can’t label or describe female genitaliaBodies become more alive to us as they go wrong. “Health is life lived in the silence of the organs,” wrote the French vascular surgeon René Leriche in 1936; if lucky enough to be free of pain and other disabling symptoms, our bodies can feel oddly dead to us. Reading Weston is like a series of jolts back to life: subcutaneous fat is “custard yellow”, the brain is a “soft organ inside a tight box” and her dodgy mitral valve is “like the swinging doors in a saloon bar after a cowboy has made his showy entrance”. Her prose is admirably clean and smart, though not at the expense of tenderness, and thankfully avoids the sentimentality that too often seeps into medical nonfiction.“Why are we so ready to squander pleasure in the way we teach anatomy?” Weston asks, an approach that especially short-changes women. Knowledge about genitals needs a “rewrite”, she says: the clitoris, rather than the “conduit” of the vagina, is the penis’s true counterpart, but as female desire became pathologised by the Victorians, the clitoris was rubbed out. We haveAustralian urologist Helen O’Connellto thank for finally mapping the extensive innervation of the clitoris in 2005 (!) to help surgeons preserve its sensitivity. Many are deceived by the small size of the visible clitoral hood, and Weston despairs that we’re all too hung up on what our bodies look like, rather than how they feel. Silicone breast implants undermine their erogenous surroundings, and thefirst breast enlargement in 1962was performed on an indifferent woman in exchange for the surgeon pinning back her ears.Half of Britons can’t label or describe female genitalia. You could argue – and Weston does – that expertise about the body’s sensations from within and under our fingertips is a more important form of knowledge. But high rates of sexual dissatisfaction reported by women suggest no greater levels of expertise here either.Clinical practice is stubbornly loyal to the familiar. “In a learned sphere like medicine, it’s easy to assume that false ideas will swiftly be replaced by true ones,” Weston writes, but this is far from true. Doctors’ conformity – hello, rule followers and guideline enthusiasts – is essential to make healthcare reliable and safe. But it carries risks too. The chance of surviving a cardiac arrest in the community, getting gold-standard treatment and being discharged home alive is half as likely for women than for men.This is partly because of a remarkable lack of curiosity and awareness about the biological differences of the female heart and the cardiological impact of circulating hormones, but also thanks to the ways women are primed to think about themselves (“Isn’t it mainly middle-aged men who get heart attacks?”), which delay care, as well as the prejudices of healthcare professionals (“This looks more like a panic attack than a heart attack to me”).Weston rightly loses patience with “protocols that claim to suit all bodies, when most of the data they’re based on is taken from white male patients”. Change relies on people pushing against the heavy door of tradition – whichAlivebrilliantly persuades us all to do more forcefully – finding new ways to imagine and inhabit the space beneath our skin.Kate Womersleyis a doctor and academic specialising in psychiatryAlive: An Alternative Anatomyby Gabriel Weston is published by Jonathan Cape (£20).

I was only two or three, so I couldn’t read but I could use the record player. Sometimes when I wanted Strawberry Fields Forever, I’d get Turn! Turn! Turn! by Mary Hopkin and wonder why it didn’t sound like the Beatles.The first single I boughtRoxanne by the Police, from Lion Records in Colchester.The song I do at karaokeBlue Eyes by Elton John. I saw a clip of Robbie Williams and Danny Dyer doing Parklife. It’s flipping bizarre, although I do like Danny Dyer. That song is overplayed now. People want to have a knees-up, like Knees Up Mother Brown or Roll Out the Barrel.The song I inexplicably know every lyric toBat Out of Hell by Meat Loaf. Come to think of it, I’ve probably done that more times at karaoke than I have Blue Eyes.The best song to play at a partyI recently rediscovered New Frontier by Don Fagan after finding it confusing the 80s. Now I have to have it on four times in a row. It’s got sinister, sarcastic lyrics and an amazing groove.The song I can no longer listen toAnything by the Carpenters, apart from Goodbye to Love. The rest makes me feel as if I’ve injected acid and sugar, which makes me sad because of the tragedy of the Carpenters.The song I secretly like but everyone I hateI don’t really admit to liking Barbra Streisand, even though Evergreen is beautiful. I’ve also only recently been able to palate Abba and got obsessed by Lay All Your Love on Me.The song that changed my lifeWhen I was teenager, getting into Van der Graaf Generator, Caravan, Matching Mole and Robert Wyatt, Ladies of the Road by King Crimson changed my life, because it was so odd. I was learning the sax, as well as the guitar, and it’s got the filthiest tenor saxophone solo ever.The song that gets me up in the morningMy dad had Blow By Blow by Duke Ellington on vinyl. Paul Gonsalves’s sax solo cuts across the rest of the album. I thought it was so out there, like free bebop getting freer. I still listen to it every morning.The song that makes me cryI’ve got three. I tested them this morning. If You Go Away by Scott Walker. The Way Love Used to Be, and Moments, both by the Kinks. When I listened to The Way Love Used to Be, the lump in my throat was pretty hefty. So I think that has to win.The song I’d like played at my funeralIt was going to be I’m Your Man by Wham! but I don’t want people chuckling at my funeral. I want them to be in emotional agony. So Inheritance by Talk Talk.The Waeveare on tourto 21 March.The band’s new EP,Eternal, is out now.

The sky is a pink-and-gold blur, and the breeze is invigorating. It’s a perfect day to walk from my London home to the source of the River Thames. I’m travelling light – phone, sandwich, water bottle – so I need nothing but a pair of capacious pockets. I have been walking the 185-mileThames Path National Trail, with my friend Rhiannon, for more than four years. We do it bit by bit, a section at a time. No need to carry a heavy backpack. No need to book a hotel or pitch a tent. No need to use up weeks of precious holiday. No need to fret about whether we may fall out, or whether one of us will prove more ruggedly resilient than the other; nor any of the myriad factors that must be considered when planning a long-distance hike with a companion. And yes, we’re always back in time for a night in our own beds.These are just some of the practical benefits of hiking a long-distance trail in bite-size chunks, which compensate for the extra time we spend on travelling and logistics. This morning, for example, I must catch a bus, a tube and then a train to get to the point where we finished six months previously. But by 9am I’m at Henley on-Thames, almost exactly as Rhiannon arrives from her Surrey home. We will walk for just over 12 miles, stopping anywhere we fancy – theStanley Spencer Galleryin Cookham and a Marlow church distracted us on the last stretch – eventually reaching Tilehurst, where we’ll catch different trains home.View image in fullscreenAnnabel Abbs, right, and her friend on the Thames Path.Photograph: Annabel AbbsRhiannon and I can go for months without seeing each other, but our Thames walking days are sacrosanct: an opportunity to walk and talk that no other outing offers. On these days, we catch up on all that has happened during the intervening time – births, deaths, marriages, career changes, world affairs; all the “big” topics are picked over, alongside the purging flow of the river.The appeal of a long-distance trail or a pilgrimage is often said to lie in its sense of immersion, its soothing day-after-day rhythm and the escape this offers from our humdrum lives. Holiday companies and guidebooks encourage us to walk a trail in a single time period, at the weather-appropriate time of year. In fairness, I love walking like this. But, like most people, I have to accommodate work and family commitments that make it difficult to disappear for days (or even weeks) on end. For me, bit-by-bit hikes have been the solution, enabling me to explore dozens of routes, with different people, throughout the year.Work and family make it difficult to disappear for days, but bit-by-bit hikes have enabled me to explore dozens of routes, with different people, throughout the yearI am currently mid-trail on theSouth Downs Waywith my husband, thanks to a year of sporadic daylong walks, often grabbed at the last minute. The 100-mile route from Winchester to Eastbourne follows old routes anddrovewaysalong the chalk escarpment and ridges of the South Downs: having started in Eastbourne, East Sussex, we have finally reached Cocking in West Sussex. We’ve loved watching the landscape respond to each season: scoured by spring rain, basking in summer sunshine, aflame with autumn colour and, more recently, glittering beneath winter frost. All this, not to mention the very different views and wildlife, would have been missed had we walked the route in the traditional eight or nine continuous days.We have yet to spend a night away from our own beds. But as we approach Winchester this may be inevitable, so we’ve earmarked a couple of quirky pubs along the way (micro-hikes lend themselves just as successfully to weekends, but booking places to stay in advance rather dents the spontaneous feel). For now, we’re revelling in the memories of chalk cliffs, fields of orchids, the tiny medieval churches we keep stumbling across and excellent pubs along the way. Walkers need feeding andthe Ram Inn at Firleand theBlack Horse in Amberleyfed us exceptionally well.View image in fullscreenThe South Downs Way, a 100-mile route from Winchester to Eastbourne.Photograph: AlamyI am also halfway along the 28-mileMedway Valley walk, alone, where the constant companionship of the river and the rich array of history – fromTonbridge Castleto ancient bridges – seems to reflect my own journey through life, while reminding me that we’re never truly alone. River routes do this. Not only do they provide a steady supply of people to greet – dog walkers, anglers, kayakers – but the river itself becomes a companion of sorts.Finally, I’m four days into the KingCharles III England Coast Pathwith my daughter, Saskia, who, as a busy medical student, can rarely manage more than two days at a time. When it’s completed, this path will be 2,700 miles long, and I fully expect it to take the rest of my life: days and weekends snatched from my daughter’s schedule to suit not only her career but my inevitably ageing muscles. As she is studying in Liverpool, we’ve hiked from there to Southport, as well as the sections between Pevensey Bay in East Sussex and Dungeness in Kent that are reachable from London. One day, all being well, we will join them together to make the full coastal path.In the UK, we have hundreds of distance trails, and none require a backpack, a place to sleep, an ultra-fit companion or time off workAnd herein lies the true joy of the micro-hike approach to trail-walking with a companion: it binds a relationship over time. The Thames Path typically takes three weeks to walk, but my version with Rhiannon will take more than a decade, becoming part of our ongoing lived experience, a process during which we bring our changed selves repeatedly back to the river, further cementing a lifelong friendship with each section. This also brings a sense of perpetual purpose: we must both remain fit enough to reach the end.The bit-by-bit method of course presents a few logistical challenges: a couple of preparatory hours spent poring over maps and online timetables, plotting out routes, stations, bus stops and pubs where we can wait if need be. But I treat the ever-longer travel to and from the path as part of the adventure, and the logistical challenges as brain-fuel.View image in fullscreenThe Ram Inn in Firle on the South Downs Way.Photograph: Peter FludeThe devil waits at every crossroads: a walk between darkness and light on DartmoorRead moreOf course, the most effective brain fuel is the actual walking. Arecent studyfound that people who logged more than 7,500 steps a day were 42% less likely to suffer depressive symptoms. Nor is it just our mental health that benefits from a good yomp: otherrecent researchfound that for each additional hour walked, life expectancy can increase by up to 6.3 hours. My calculations suggest, on this basis, that every day I walk might just give me an extra day and a half in which to finish the England Coast Path with my daughter. Either way, there really is no better pastime.In the UK, we are spoiled for choice with hundreds of distance trails crisscrossing the land. The big hitters are among the best in the world, but let’s not forget the lesser-known routes. From my London desk, and thanks to myGo Jauntlywalking app, I already have my eye on theLondon Outer Orbital Path(Loop), theWealdway, theVanguard Way, theGrand Union Canal path, theGreen Chain Walkand theGreensand Way. None of these require a backpack, a place to sleep, an ultra-fit companion or extended time off work.It is a few months later and my phone flashes. It’s a message from Rhiannon, pointing out that the sun is shining and the River Thames is calling. Our next “leg” of the trail will take us to Goring. Or to Pangbourne, if winter has depleted our fitness. I check my map, then the weather forecast (another benefit of spontaneity), before sending my reply: “Tomorrow?”Annabel Abbs is the author of Windswept: Why Women Walk, which is published by John Murray Press (£10.99).

You get an incredible flavour from the onion, which are slowly melted in butter with cloves, cardamom and my addition of a handful of flaked almonds, plus a fried egg on top for balance. If your house is anything like mine, there are always peas in the freezer, rice in the cupboard and eggs on the counter, so this is the perfect store-cupboard meal.Green pea pulao with cardamom and almondsPrep10 minCook25 minServes2130g white basmati rice1tbsp neutral oil,plus extra for frying the eggs (or use extra butter)25g salted butter4 green cardamom pods, bashed to release the seeds1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped50g flaked almonds150g frozenpeas, defrosted1tsp sea salt flakes2free-range eggsPut the rice and 275ml boiling water in a microwaveable bowl with a lid (I use a Pyrex one with a snugly fitting plate on top). Microwave on a medium setting (ie, 600W on a 800W microwave) for nine minutes, then leave the rice to stand for 10 minutes. If you don’t have a microwave, put the rice and 275ml boiling water in a saucepan with a tightly fitting lid, bring to a boil on the hob, then cover, turn down the heat to very low and cook for 10 minutes without lifting the lid (this is important!). Fluff the rice with a fork and, if you want, spread it out on a plate to help it dry out.Meanwhile, put the oil and butter in a large frying pan on a medium heat, then add the bashed cardamom pods and fry for 30 seconds. Add the onion, turn down the heat and slowly melt them down, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes – you want just a very light colour on them.Add the flaked almonds, stir-fry for three to four minutes, then add the peas and salt, and cook for another two minutes.Tip the cooked rice into the pan and stir gently so as not to break it up too much. Taste and adjust the salt as needed, add more butter if you’re feeling decadent, then take off the heat and cover while in a separate pan you fry the eggs in oil or butter to your liking – I do mine for two to three minutes on a high heat, until the whites start to crisp at the edges, but the yolk is runny. Season with salt.Divide the rice between two bowls, and serve each topped with an egg.Explore more on these topicsRiceQuick and easyFoodNuts and seedsVegetablesVegetarian food and drinkEggsMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

It is in relation to the cultivated mushrooms readily available in greengrocers and supermarkets, the controlled development of which she reveals to be as every bit as fascinating as the mysterious appearance of wild ones. Grigson reminds us that small button mushrooms are exactly that: small and immature. And, having just formed, they haven’t had the chance to develop flavour, which is why it’s advisable to buy medium-sized mushrooms or, even better, large, open or flat mushrooms that have been given the time to develop real flavour. “Left undisturbed in mushroom caves,” Grigson notes, “cultivated mushrooms can swell to a pound in weight and develop a flavour equal to field mushrooms.”While out mushroom hunting in the velvet cool of my local supermarket the other day, I was delighted to come across not just one, but several packets of open-faced mushrooms with white caps and delicate brown gills. I might be a novice, but I do know to move slowly and quietly when mushrooms appear, so as not to draw attention, or to give away the spot to other mushroom hunters. Keeping my eyes low, I picked the packets off the shelf, put them in my basket, paid and walked home, making sure to disturb as few leaves as possible. I suspect a neighbour might have been watching me.Another point Grigson makes is how helpful it is to recognise the role shallots and garlic stewed in butter play in bringing out the flavour of cultivated mushrooms, making them taste like mushrooms, and the kitchen smell good. The Mushroom Feast has also provided this week’s recipe forfunghiripieni(stuffed mushrooms), which is adapted from Ada Boni’s bible of Italian cookery, Il Talismano della Felicità. Like so many stuffed mushroom recipes, it utilises the finely diced stalks in the stuffing, along with onion, garlic, butter, a few minced anchovies, plenty of parsley, soft breadcrumbs and egg, which is vital for binding and also makes the stuffing slightly puffy. If you are lucky enough to find 12 fat-stemmed and bulbous ceps under a tree, they are ideal here; otherwise, eight large or 12 medium flat mushrooms will work almost as well.While stuffed mushrooms can be eaten at room temperature – or cold, even – they are best when served piping hot, or at least warm enough that the filling is still tender and the mushroom caps velvety and glistening with melted butter. They can be served as an accompaniment to meat or fish, but they are also chief characters that make a satisfying meal with salad alongside – my choice would be the soft middle leaves of a butterhead lettuce dressed with olive oil, red-wine vinegar and mustard. Alternatively, and based on Grigson’s observation of how surprisingly compatible mushroom and cucumber are, you could pair the hot stuffed mushrooms with a cold cucumber, dill and soured cream salad.Mushrooms stuffed with anchovies, breadcrumbs and herbsServes412 medium-sized or 8 large flat mushroomsA knob of butter,plus extra for greasing and dotting3 tbsp olive oil2 shallots or1 small onion, peeled and finely diced1garlic clove, peeled and minced4 anchovy fillets in oil, drained and minced1 heaped tbsp minced parsley50g soft white breadcrumbs1 egg, lightly beaten1tbspfine, dry breadcrumbsRemove the mushroom stalks and chop them very finely; set the caps aside. In a frying pan, melt the butter and olive oil, then gently stew the shallot/onion and garlic until translucent. Add the mushroom stalks and cook, stirring, for about five minutes. Season then add the anchovies and parsley, cook for a minute more, then pull the pan off the heat and stir in the breadcrumbs and beaten egg.Arrange the mushrooms cap side down in a well-buttered oven dish, then divide the stuffing between the undersides, pressing it down so it fills evenly. Sprinkle the stuffing with the dry breadcrumbs and put a dot of butter on each mushroom.Bake in a fairly hot oven – about 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 – for 15-20 minutes, or until the filling is firm and sizzling gently.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodVegetablesMain courseSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"
