It prompted calls for the UK’s laws on gender recognition to be rewritten.The UK government said the ruling brought “clarity and confidence” for women and those who run hospitals, sports clubs and women’s refuges.A spokesperson said: “We have always supported the protection of single-sex spaces based on biological sex. Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government.”The case was brought to the supreme court by the gender-critical campaign group For Women Scotland, which is backed financially byJK Rowling, after two Scottish courts rejected its arguments that the Equality Act’s definition of a woman was limited to people born biologically female.Lord Hodge, the deputy president of the court, said the Equality Act was very clear that its provisions dealt with biological sex at birth, and not with a person’s acquired gender, regardless of whether they held a gender recognition certificate.That affected policymaking on gender in sports and the armed services, hospitals, as well as women-only charities, and access to changing rooms and women-only spaces, he said. However, trans women still have equal pay rights as women, and could have the right to be treated as women in some situations.In its 88-page judgment, the court said that while the word “biological” did not appear in the definition of man or woman in the Equality Act, “the ordinary meaning of those plain and unambiguous words corresponds with the biological characteristics that make an individual a man or a woman”.If “sex” did not only mean biological sex in the 2010 legislation, providers of single-sex spaces including changing rooms, homeless hostels and medical services would face “practical difficulties”, it said.The justices added: “Read fairly and in context, the provisions relating to single-sex services can only be interpreted by reference to biological sex.”The ruling represents a significant defeat for the Scottish government. For WomenScotlandhad initially challenged legislation that allowed trans women with a GRC to sit on public boards in posts reserved for women.Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, said his government accepted the court’s judgment. He said it clarified the limits of theGenderRecognition Act 2004, which introduced gender recognition certificates for trans people.“We will now engage on the implications of the ruling,” he said. “Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions.”The Scottish government defended its actions in the case, which it said were always guided by the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s advice. It said it would now engage with UK ministers and with the EHRC to look at the ruling’s implications, since the legislation involved was passed by Westminster.Trans rights campaigners urged trans people and their supporters to remain calm about the decision.The campaign group Scottish Trans said: “We are really shocked by today’s supreme court decision, which reverses 20 years of understanding of how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates.“We will continue working for a world in which trans people can get on with their lives with privacy, dignity and safety. That is something we all deserve.”Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of the human rights group Amnesty International UK, which joined with the Scottish government in the supreme court case, said the decision was “clearly disappointing”.“There are potentially concerning consequences for trans people, but it is important to stress that the court has been clear that trans people are protected under the Equality Act against discrimination and harassment,” he said.“The ruling does not change the protection trans people are afforded under the protected characteristic of ‘gender reassignment’, as well as other provisions under the Equality Act.”Susan Smith, a co-founder of ForWomenScotland, said the legal action had been “a really, really long road”. “Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex,” she said.“Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the supreme court for this ruling.”In a social media post, JK Rowling said: “It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the supreme court,” adding: “I’m so proud to know you.”Hodge, the deputy president of the court, said it believed the position taken by the Scottish government and the EHRC that people with gender recognition certificates did qualify as women, while those without did not, created “two sub-groups”.This would confuse any organisations they were involved with. A public body could not know whether a trans woman did or did not have that certificate because the information was private and confidential.And allowing trans women the same legal status as biological women could also affect spaces and services designed specifically for lesbians, who had also suffered historical discrimination and abuse.Kishwer Falkner, the chair of the EHRC, said it was pleased the ruling had dealt with its concerns about the lack of clarity around single-sex and lesbian-only spaces, but would need time to fully understand its implications.“We are pleased that this judgment addresses several of the difficulties we highlighted in our submission to the court, including the challenges faced by those seeking to maintain single-sex spaces, and the rights of same-sex attracted persons to form associations.”Explore more on these topicsGenderTransgenderEquality Act 2010JK RowlingWomenUK supreme courtScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

I think there’s a good chance that, yes, we’ll come to a great agreement that’s in the best interest of both countries.”However, behind the scenes concern is growing over the vulnerability of UK industries and companies to Trump’s “America first” agenda.Before Trump’s inauguration, UK trade documents related to US talks were generally marked “Official – sensitive (UK eyes only)”, according to examples seen by the Guardian, and officials were allowed to share these on internal email chains. This classification stood while British officials attempted to negotiate with Joe Biden’s administration, even after a full-blown trade deal was ruled out by the White House.Now, a far greater proportion of documents and correspondence detailing the negotiating positions being discussed by officials from No 10, the Foreign Office and the Department for Business and Trade come with additional handling instructions to avoid US interception, with some classified as “secret” and “top secret”, sources said. These classifications also carry different guidance on how documents may be shared digitally, in order to avoid interception.Companies with commercial interests in the UK have also been told to take additional precautions in how they share information with the trade department and No 10, senior business sources said. These include large pharmaceutical companies with operations in the UK and EU.A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said: “The US is an indispensable ally and negotiations on an economic prosperity deal that strengthens our existing trading relationship continue.”Wider questions have been asked about whether the special relationship between the UK and US can withstand increasingly divergent policies on Russian hostility, as well as deep criticisms of Nato and defence collaboration. On trade, pressures are mounting in sensitive areas such as car manufacturing and pharmaceuticals.Other reports suggest the European Commission has also changed its perspective on the risks of sensitive or secret information being intercepted by the US. Commission employeeshave been issued with burner phonesif they are visiting the US, the Financial Times has reported.So close has the UK and US position been on defence and security in recent years that secure government material is sometimes marked “UK/US only”, or given a “Five Eyes” marking, in reference to the intelligence-sharing collective made up of the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. So far, the Guardian has only established a change in document-handling related to trade discussions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU would also delay its response to US tariffs.Until July, the EU will face a 10% duty on exports to the US, rather than the 20% “reciprocal tariff” rate that was in force for a matter of hours, until Trump’s reversal last Wednesday. US duties of 25% tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars are still in place, however.Despite suggestions that Trump may be chastened by the markets’ volatile response to his trade policies, the president’s incremental steps have increased duties on Chinese imports to 145%. China responded on Friday by announcingit would increase tariffs on US goods to 125%. The announcement from the Chinese commerce ministry also suggested that it would not pursue higher tariffs in any further retaliatory steps against the US, adding that “at the current tariff level, there is no market acceptance for US goods exported to China”.“If the US continues to impose tariffs on Chinese goods exported to the US, China will ignore it,” it said, flagging that there were other countermeasures to come. Xi, meanwhile,urged the EU to resist Trump’s “bullying”.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyTrump tariffsCivil serviceGlobal economyEconomicsTariffsEuropean CommissionnewsShareReuse this content"

Andthatwas pretty special, Arsenal’s own story written as Mikel Arteta had asked and given a scene they will remember for a long time, a coming of age.The goal that finally confirmed that they were heading into their third European Cup semi-final was a portrait of the way Arsenal had played here: an exercise in patience, control, and maturity.‘Massive step’: Arteta praises Arsenal’s character in statement Real Madrid winRead morePrecision, timing and courage, too. Saka had missed a first-half penalty that might have set up their passage sooner, that could have felt like a catastrophe then amidst the noise of the lion’s den into which they had stepped, but he was not sunk, nor scared. None of them were: not by the legend, the atmosphere, the history, not by the players before them. There was none of the fatalism or the fear that left so many others crumbled and fallen here, none of Madrid’s mystique. Instead, the Bernabéu spell was broken,Real Madrideliminated and deservedly so.At no point wasArsenal’s 3-0 first‑leg leadin real danger, not even when they gifted Madrid an absurd equaliser immediately after Saka’s goal. The kind of moment that usually sparks madness, a sense of impending doom, did not; the men in black ensured as much.And then, as if to underline their superiority – and make no mistake, over these two legs they have been far, far superior to Madrid – Gabriel Martinelli escaped through the middle of what little was left of the home defence in the last minute and slotted past Thibaut Courtois.Arsenal had not just beaten the European championsacrosstwo games, winning 5-1 on aggregate, they had beaten themintwo games. High in the stands above, fans sang long into perhaps the greatest night in their European history, completed on its grandest stage and in grand style.They blew Madrid away a week ago; now they managed them, Declan Rice, Martin Ødegaard and Thomas Partey dominating midfield, taking control before clinically finishing the task. For all the comeback narrative that had been built against them, there was no sign of nerves and only one bit of bad news – a late yellow card that means Partey will miss the first leg against PSG.View image in fullscreenGabriel Martinelli slots home Arsenal’s winning goal past Thibaut Courtois.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersArsenal had started well and might have started perfectly. Saka flashed a shot past the post and saw another pushed away by Courtois before he passed up a glorious opportunity to make this an even more comfortable night. Twelve minutes had gone when François Letexier was called to the VAR screen where, in slow motion, he saw Raúl Asencio pull down Mikel Merino. Saka clipped the penalty too low and too soft, allowing Courtois to reach up a right hand to palm it away, this place erupting.If that seemed like the spark Madrid needed, the fatalism flooding through Arsenal, it was quickly followed by another. Or so, at least, it seemed when Letexier gave a penalty for a tug on Kylian Mbappé. Rice, though, protested his innocence and although it took a good five minutes to go and look, the referee eventually agreed.Relief reinforced the plan. Arteta’s team managed the tempo, slowing down when it suited and occasionally stepping out. He had talked about the value of frustrating Madrid, turning that expectation against them, and that was a fairly accurate description of what was happening. David Raya was booked for time-wasting but not called on to make a save in the first half. Courtois had made three, the last a sharp stop from Rice.Madrid lacked structure and ideas, a Lucas Vázquez cross that curled all the way through proving to be about the best they could offer and an indication of their limitations. Nor did they really have the energy to create the chaos they sought. There was a tiredness about them, little spark.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The goalkeeper’s long ball was nodded on by Rice. Saka came inside, went to Ødegaard, who slowed, waited and chose judiciously as ever. Merino was the next man introduced to the move, slipping a clever ball through the gap. And there was Saka, dinking it coolly, gently over Courtois.This was not the way visitors are supposed to behave here; what came next was a goal gifted out of nowhere when William Saliba, looking away, lost possession. Vinícius smashed the ball into an empty net, suddenly there was a roar, a flicker of hope, a reaction to something so ridiculous that for a moment Madrid thought that maybe, maybe, it could be the start of something even more ridiculous.Arsenal, though, were not going to let that happen: not now, not ever, Martinelli adding the final line of the story they will tell for a long time.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueReal MadridArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

After digging up the bodies days later,the UN claimed they had been executed “one by one”.Ahmed Dhair, the forensic pathologist in Gaza who carried out autopsies on 14 out of the 15 victims, told the Guardian he had found “lacerations, entry wounds from bullets, and wounds resulting from explosive injuries. These were mostly concentrated in the torso area – the chest, abdomen, back, and head.”Most had died from gunshot wounds, including what Dhair said was evidence of “explosive bullets”, otherwise known as “butterfly bullets”, which explode in the body upon impact, ripping apart flesh and bone.“We found remains of explosive bullets,” said Dhair. “In one case, the bullet head had exploded in the chest, and the rest of the bullet fragments were found within the body. There were also remnants or shrapnel from bullets scattered on the back of one of the victims.”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not immediately respond to allegations that these bullets had been used in the attack.Details of the incident have remained disputed. Video footage that emerged from the beginning of the attack shows the convoy of ambulances coming under fire, but the subsequent events that led to the bodies of 15 workers being buried in a mass grave are still unclear.Israel’s military admitted carrying out the killings but wasforced to change its version of events after evidence emerged that contradicted its accountthat the vehicles had been “moving suspiciously” without lights.Israel has claimed, without publicly presenting evidence, that six of the unarmed workers killed were Hamas operatives, which has been denied by Red Crescent.IDF unit involved in Gaza paramedics’ killing was under command of brigade led by notorious Israeli generalRead moreDhair said his findings did not suggest the paramedics had been shot at close range, but emphasised he was not a munitions expert. He said the shrapnel found in the bodies also suggested they had been hit with some form of explosive devices. “In some cases, the injuries seemed to be a mix of explosive and regular gunfire wounds,” he said.Responding to the allegations that some of the bodies had been dug up with their hands tied, suggesting they were captured or held before they were killed, Dhair said he had not seen visible signs of restraint.“Only in one case, there were discoloration and bruising on the wrists that could possibly be due to restraints,” he said. All the men were clearly in their work uniforms and their bodies had begun to decompose.The findings are likely to increase pressure on Israel to give a full account of the incident amid accusations of a war crime. Israel has said it is still under investigation.This week it emerged that one of the two paramedics who survived the incident, Assad al-Nsasrah – whose whereabouts had been unknown since – was being held in Israeli detention.The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières said on Wednesday that Gaza was becoming a “mass grave for Palestinians”.Aid supplies including food, fuel, water and medicine have been blocked by Israel from entering Gaza since 2 March, more than two weeks before the collapse of the ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group with a return to air and ground attacks on the territory.Israel has said it will keep blocking humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, as it vowed to force Hamas into releasing the remaining hostages from the 7 October 2023 attacks.The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said: “Israel’s policy is clear: no humanitarian aid will enter Gaza, and blocking this aid is one of the main pressure levers preventing Hamas from using it as a tool with the population.”“No one is currently planning to allow any humanitarian aid into Gaza, and there are no preparations to enable such aid,” said Katz, who threatened to escalate the conflict with “tremendous force” if Hamas did not return the hostages.Amnesty International is among the aid agencies that have described Israel’s blockade on all supplies going into Gaza as a crime against humanity and a violation of international humanitarian law. Israel has denied any violations.More than 51,000 Palestinians have died in Gaza since the conflict began, including more than 1,600 since Israel resumed airstrikes and ground operations on 18 March. The Gaza health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians but has said more than half of those dead were women and children.Another 13 people were killed in airstrikes overnight, with a well-known photographer, Fatema Hassouna, among those reported dead in the northern area of the strip.Doctors and aid groups on the ground said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was becoming graver by the day.“The situation is the worst it has been in 18 months in terms of being deprived of your basic necessities and the resumption of hostilities and attacks against Palestinians in all of Gaza,” said Mahmoud Shalabi, a director atMedical Aid for Palestinians, a British charity.Israel has been accused of worsening the humanitarian situation by targeting hospitals and medical personnel working in Gaza, with two hospitals struck and debilitated by airstrikes this week. Israel has claimed Hamas has used medical facilities as a cover for terrorist operations.The resumption of aid into Gaza has become a highly inflammatory political issue in Israel. There are 58 hostages still in Gaza, who were taken captive after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel in October 2023, with 24 believed to still be alive.Far-right figures in prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government have said no aid should be restored to the civilians of Gaza until Hamas agrees to the hostages’ release.“As long as our hostages are languishing in the tunnels, there is no reason for a single gram of food or any aid to enter Gaza,” the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said on Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

We have to question ourselves both on whether the signal is real and what it means.”He added: “Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach. This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we’re alone in the universe is one we’re capable of answering.”Others are more sceptical, with questions remaining about whether the overall conditions on K2-18 b, are favourable to life and whether DMS and DMDS, which are largely produced by marine phytoplankton on Earth, can be reliably regarded as biosignatures.K2-18 b, which sits in the Leo constellation, is nearly nine times as massive as the Earth and 2.6 times as large and orbits in the habitable zone of its star, a cool red dwarf less than half the size of the sun. When the Hubble space telescope appeared to spotwater vapour in its atmosphere in 2019, scientists declared it “the most habitable known world” beyond the solar system.The supposed water signal was shown to be methane in follow-up observations by Madhusudhan’s team in 2023. But, they argued, K2-18 b’s profile was consistent with a habitable world, covered in a vast, deep ocean – a view that remains contentious. More provocatively, the Cambridge team reporteda tentative hint of DMS.Astronomers find signal that gives ‘unexpected’ insight into early universeRead morePlanets beyond our solar system are too distant to photograph or reach with robotic spacecraft. But scientists can estimate their size, density and temperature and probe their chemical makeup by tracking the exoplanet as it passes across the face of its host star and measuring starlight that has been filtered through its atmosphere. In the latest observations, wavelengths that are absorbed by DMS and DMDS, were seen to suddenly drop off as K2-18 b wandered in front of the red dwarf.“The signal came through strong and clear,” said Madhusudhan. “If we can detect these molecules on habitable planets, this is the first time we’ve been able to do that as a species … it’s mind-boggling that this is possible.”The findings, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, suggest concentrations of DMS, DMDS or both (their signatures overlap) thousands of times stronger than the levels on Earth. The results are reported with a “three-sigma” level of statistical significance (a 0.3% probability that they occurred by chance) although this falls short of the gold standard for discoveries in physics.“There may be processes that we don’t know about that are producing these molecules,” Madhusudhan said. “But I don’t think there is any known process that can explain this without biology.”A challenge in identifying potential other processes is that the conditions on K2-18 b remain disputed. While the Cambridge team favour an ocean scenario, others say the data is suggestive of a gas planet or one withoceans made of magma, not water.There is a question of whether DMS could have been brought to the planet by comets – this would require an intensity of bombardment that seems improbable – or produced in hydrothermal vents, volcanoes or lightning storms through exotic chemical processes.“Life is one of the options, but it’s one among many,” said Dr Nora Hänni, a chemist at the Physics Institute of the University of Berne, whose research revealed thatDMS was present on an icy, lifeless comet. “We would have to strictly rule out all the other options before claiming life.”Others say that measuring planetary atmospheres may never yield a smoking gun for life. “It’s under-appreciated in the field, but technosignatures, such as an intercepted message from an advanced civilisation, could be better smoking guns, despite the unlikelihood of finding such a signal,” said Dr Caroline Morley, an astrophysicist at the University of Texas, Austin, adding that the findings were, nonetheless, an important advance.Dr Jo Barstow, a planetary scientist at the Open University, also viewed the detection as significant, but said: “My scepticism dial for any claim relating to evidence of life is permanently turned up to 11, not because I don’t think that other life is out there, but because I feel that for such a profound and significant discovery the burden of proof must be very, very high. I don’t think this latest work crosses that threshold.”At 120 light years away, there is no prospect of resolving the debate through closeup observations, but Madhusudhan notes that this has not been a barrier to the discovery of black holes or other cosmic phenomena.“In astronomy, the question is never about going there,” he said. “We’re trying to establish if the laws of biology are universal in nature. I don’t see it as: ‘We have to go and swim in the water to catch the fish.’”Explore more on these topicsJames Webb space telescopeSpaceAstronomyUniversity of CambridgenewsShareReuse this content"

Speaking to Entertainment Tonight in 2021, Trachtenbergsaid: “There was a lot required of me … I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity.”Other projects Trachtenberg starred in include the teen comedy EuroTrip, as well as the critically acclaimed drama Mysterious Skin by Gregg Araki.Reflecting on her experience with Mysterious Skin, Trachtenbergsaid: “I was this girl who had done glitzy, PG-themed stuff and here’s Gregg Araki, director of Doom Generation, and we sat down and had a cup of coffee and I said: ‘You’re probably not gonna hire me but this is what I got, this is what I feel. If you’re willing to take the chance, I’m willing to go there with you.’ It was the most exhilarating experience I’ve had as an actress.”Following her death, Trachtenberg’s various cast memberspaid tributesto her, with her Gossip Girl co-star Blake Lively writing: “She was electricity … You knew when she entered a room because the vibration changed. Everything she did, she did 200%.”Similarly, Smith-Cameron wrote: “She was always very warm toward me. I feel very shocked and unsettled to hear of her passing.”Meanwhile, the Buffy the Vampire lead, Sarah Michelle Gellar, said: “Michelle, listen to me … Listen. I love you. I will always love you. The hardest thing in this world, is to live in it. I will be brave. I will live … for you.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsBuffy the Vampire SlayerNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

National Trust rangers now fear this rare, protected moorland bird may have been lost to the area entirely.Chris Smith, the National Trust’s countryside manager for Mid and South Wales, said: “The impacts on wildlife are widespread, with birds’ nests, insects, amphibians and reptiles all scorched by fire.“Whole ecosystems have been decimated and will remain altered well into the future.“Alongside this, the huge loss of surface vegetation leaves the peat bogs we have been working hard to restore ... vulnerable to erosion and at further risk of fire and carbon loss.“Where the flames burnt down to the peat soils, they will take hundreds of years to recover.”In 2024, South Wales fire and rescue service responded to 34 wildfire callouts between 1 January and 10 April. This year, it has faced 445 over the same period – a 1,200% increase.In total, Wales’s three fire services have reported responding to more than 1,300 grass fires so far this year.InNorthern Ireland, recent fires on the Mourne Mountains have scorched land used by an array of wildlife including small heath butterflies, rove beetles, skylarks and peregrine falcons.Small birds such as skylarks rely on insects and beetles for food, and in turn provide a food source for birds of prey.In the Peak District, the National Trust said a recent fire on Howden Moor that stretched for 2km had caused £30,000-worth of damage, ruining years’ worth of conservation efforts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Starbucks dropped its vegan milk surcharge in the UK in 2022. Leon and Joe and the Juice do not charge extra for any standard dairy-free milk alternatives.Costa Coffee and Caffè Nero do not charge for soya milk, but oat and coconut milk are an additional 45p at both. Costa also has an “ultimate blend” plant-based milk alternative at some coffee shops for 35p.A spokesperson for Gail’s said: “We understand choice is important, which is why we’re proud to offer British-grown oat milk and soya as dairy alternatives. From 21 May, there will be no additional charge for soya milk in our bakeries.“We want to make it easier for everyone to enjoy their coffee or tea the way they like it, while remaining dedicated to sourcing high-quality ingredients that are both delicious and sustainable.”Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkFoodFood & drink industryHospitality industryVeganismnewsShareReuse this content"

The Treasury forecasts it will reach 2.4% of GDP by 2027–28.For Australia, 3.5% of GDP would be more than A$90bn ($54.3), about 75% more than the actual defence budget.Much of Australia’s focus is on long-range deterrence, particularly submarines and missile defences.Since 1951, Australia and the US have been enjoined by the Anzus treaty (along with New Zealand), an agreement often discussed in terms akin to the Nato alliance – but which is, in reality, much weaker.There is no equivalent to Nato’s Article V in the Anzus agreement – it commits parties only to “consult together” whenever the security of one is “threatened in the Pacific”.View image in fullscreenThen US president Joe Biden meets Australian PM Anthony Albanese and British PM Rishi Sunak at Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego, California, in March 2023 to announce the Aukus partnership.Photograph: Leah Millis/ReutersIncreased co-operation – and “interoperability” – between the US and Australian militaries is a common refrain from ministers on both sides of the alliance. Its most significant manifestation is the Aukus agreement (forecast to cost Australia up to A$368bn ($221.9) by the mid-2050s), under which the US is proposing to sell between three and five nuclear powered submarines to Australia early next decade, before a specifically built Aukus submarine will be in the water by the early 2040s.Australia has long been regarded as an unswerving US ally, “with us even in our less-advisable wars”, as senior Pentagon nominee Elbridge Colby told the Senate in March. But Australia has flagged one potential point of departure: while not ruling out involvement, deputy prime minister Richard Marles has said Australia has “absolutely not” given the US any guarantees of assistance in a war between America andChinaover the status of Taiwan.ChinaThe chaos of Trump is either a dangerous precipice or agolden opportunityfor China. It could well be both.The US’s decision to impose tariffs on China’s neighbours makes it harder for Chinese companies to circumvent the duties by offshoring their supply chains. But it also could have the unintended effect of undermining the US’s attempts to galvanise the region to unite against China’s military buildup.View image in fullscreenContainer ships at the port in Qingdao, in China’s eastern Shandong province. Trump’s tariff war risks pushing some countries towards China.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesIn March, US defence secretary Pete Hegseth conducted a multi-stop tour across Asia,promising to shift US focus to the Indo-Pacificin “in the face of Communist China’s aggression in the region”. Hegseth made his comments in the Philippines, a key US security ally. He also described Japan as a “warrior country” that is “indispensable” to tackling China. But shortly after his trip, the US announced tariffs of 17% on imports from the Philippines and 24% on Japan.China reacted angrily to Hegseth’s comments on Japan, accusing the US of “instigating ideological antagonism”.But rhetoric aside, China is using the retreat of the US as a stable economic partner as an opportunity tobolster its relations with its neighbours. It has eased trade restrictions on Japan and sought agreements with India over the disputed border territory of Ladakh.This diplomatic push will make it harder for the US to lean on allies in Asia to unite against China. In the meantime, China’s rapid military buildup continues apace. This year it will increase defence spending by 7.2%, continuing its trend of increasing defence spending faster than GDP growth, which last year was 5%. The US defence department estimates that China’s true military spending is 40-90% more than its public budget.TaiwanThe rising threat posed by China is felt more deeply in Taiwan than anywhere else. Xi’s overhaul and revamp of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is primarily geared towards being able toannex Taiwan by forceif Beijing can’t bully it into accepting Chinese rule. Resources and leadership have shifted eastward, favouring the navy, and joint operations now include the increasingly militarised Coast Guard, and China’s paramilitary fleet ofmaritime militia fishing boats.Taiwan, which can’t hope to match the PLA militarily, has been preparing. But it has also had to respond to Trump’s second term, which has demonstrated something of a souring on Taiwan: the US is Taiwan’s most significant security partner, bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.But during his campaign and since taking office,Trump has questioned the worth of US support for Taiwan, and suggested it pay for protection. His administration has also called for major increases in Taiwan’s defence spending from the current rate of below 3% to as much as 10% of GDP. Taiwan’s government says that’s impossible, and would involve spending almost as much as the central government’s entire annual operating budget of NT$3tn ($92bn).View image in fullscreenA satellite image from March 2025 showing three Chinese barges connected via extendable bridges in waters off Zhanjiang city, in southern China’s Guangdong province. The new barges could be used to land heavy equipment and thousands of personnel in a possible invasion of Taiwan, defence experts say.Photograph: Planet Labs PBC/AFP/Getty ImagesInstead, Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, has pledged an increase in overall defence spending to more than 3% of GDP – as long as it can get past a highly obstructionist, opposition-controlled legislature. He has also noted that Taiwan’s GDP has grown in the past eight years, so while the percentage remained low, in real terms Taiwan’s national defence budget increased by 80%.Taiwan buys billions of dollars in weapons from the US. Among its efforts to appease Trump’s trade imbalance rhetoric, Taiwan has pledged to buy more.President Lai has ramped up security measures to counter China, and launched a major program to boost Taiwan’ssocial and defensive resilience, bringing government and public sector groups together to boost protections of Taiwan’s energy, communication and other critical infrastructure, and to better prepare its 24 million people for a crisis.PhilippinesUnder President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, thePhilippineshas taken a tougher stance against China, and moved closer to the US, with which it has a mutual defence treaty. The US has been granted expanded access to Philippine military bases, and the two countries have also agreed to increase the sharing of intelligence and technology to allow the sale of weaponry by the US to the Philippines.Washington itself has highlighted the mutual defence treaty with Manila. Last month, Hegseth met Marcos in Manila, and stated the two countries must stand “shoulder to shoulder” in the face of the threat represented by China.View image in fullscreenUS defence secretary Pete Hegseth inspects an honour guard during his arrival in Manila, Philippines, on 28 March.Photograph: Lisa Marie David/ReutersThe Philippines is modernising its armed forces – earmarking $35bn this year alone – and strengthening partnerships with allies as it struggles against Chinese assertiveness in the region, particularly in thedisputed South China Sea.Later this month the US and Philippines will conduct annual military drills known as the Balikatan exercise. Troops from Australia – as well as observers from Japan and, for the first time, Poland and the Czech Republic – will also participate.VietnamVietnam, like many countries in south-east Asia, has always tried to avoid taking sides in the rivalry between the US and China. As tensions have soared under the newTrump administration, which recently announced a punishing 46% tariff on Vietnam, this balancing act has become especially challenging.When China’s president, Xi Jinping, visited Hanoi shortly after the tariff announcement, Trump suggested the two sides were discussinghow to “screw” the US. His comments underline the juggling act that Hanoi is trying to maintain.Vietnam is seeking to appease Washington to reduce its tariff. It is reportedly preparing to crack down on Chinese goods shipped from its territory and tighten controls on sensitive exports to China. It is also promising to buy more US goods, including in defence and security products.Vietnam counts both the US and China as important economic partners. Washington is also a helpful counterbalance to Beijing’s assertiveness in the South China Sea, where China’s claims overlap with those of Vietnam.View image in fullscreenCustomers shop for shoes at a Nike shop in Hanoi, Vietnam. The country faces a juggling act in maintaining economic ties with both the US and China.Photograph: Hau Dinh/APLast year was a record year for island building by Vietnam in the South China Sea. In February, China’s foreign ministry criticised construction work by Vietnam to build an airstrip on the Barque Canada Reef, in the Spratly chain. Beijing claims the islands are “illegally occupied” by Vietnam.As it completes such landfill activities, the defence capabilities it plans to build on the reclaimed land will become clear – and likely antagonise China.Vietnam is also seeking to strengthen its military capacity, including by developing its own defence industry.JapanTrump’s language on his return to the White House triggered a sense of déjà vu in Japan andSouth Korea, the US’s two main allies in north-east Asia. Echoing his criticisms during his first term, Trump recently complained that the US-Japan security treaty was “so one-sided” – a reference, in Trump’s view, to the cost borne by Washington of stationing about 50,000 troops in Japan.Japan contributes $2bn towards the cost of hosting US troops, who under the treaty’s terms are committed to come to Japan’s defence if it is attacked.Under hawkish prime minister – and Trump ally – Shinzo Abe, Japan began beefing up its defence posture in 2022, including promises to buy more weapons from the US. Subsequent prime ministers have followed suit, vowing to double defence spending by 2027 so that it accounts for 2% of GDP.Defence spending by Japan is expected to reach ¥9.9tn ($70bn) in the year to March 2026, according to the defence ministry, equivalent to 1.8% of gross domestic product.The defence minister, Gen Nakatani, recently referenced growing pressure from Washington to shoulder more of the cost of their defence and hosting US troops. The latest spending projection “show that our efforts to strengthen our defence capabilities are steadily progressing”, he said. But Tokyo’s arms build-up may still not be enough. Elbridge Colby, Trump’s Pentagon policy chief, recently demanded that Japan raise military spending to 3% of GDP.View image in fullscreenJet fighters and ships are seen from the bridge of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier during a three-day maritime exercise between the US and Japan in the Philippine Sea in January 2024.Photograph: Richard A Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesHigher spending has been matched by stronger capabilities, including plans todeploy long-range missilescapable of striking China and North Korea, and the adoption of a position that would allow Japan to strike enemy bases first if it believed an attack was imminent – a posture critics say violates the country’s purely defensive “pacifist” constitution.South KoreaThe domestic political turmoil of the past five months has caused alarm in the US and Japan over South Korea’s commitments to regional security. Theimpeachment of Yoon Suk Yeolmeans the country will elect a new leader on 10 June, with polls suggesting that Lee Jae-myung, a liberal, is favourite to replace Yoon, a pro-US conservative.While it attempts to overcome the trauma of Yoon’s impeachment trial, there is little indication of how far a new president would go in resisting Washington’s demands to spend more on its defence and the deployment of about 28,000 troops.The US military presence in the South has long been vital to Seoul’s ability to deter a potential attack by nuclear-armed North Korea.Tensions between the two Koreas grew under Yoon. . As Trump focuses on the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, there is concern that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, could feel empowered to behave more provocatively.View image in fullscreenNorth Korea’s Kim Jong-un visits military hardware in March 2023.Photograph: 朝鮮通信社/APSome lawmakers were disturbed by Trump’s dismissive treatment of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in the Oval Office in February. That has sown seeds of doubt in Seoul about the strength of Washington’s commitment to South Korea’s security – a bedrock of bilateral ties since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war.While the North continues to develop weapons of mass destruction, its neighbour is also broaching the sensitive subject of having its own nuclear deterrent, independent of the US nuclear umbrella. Once the preserve of conservative hawks, now progressive commentators are calling on the South to have the capacity to turn fissile material into nuclear weapons.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationChinaTaiwanPhilippinesVietnamJapanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last year she quit her job as a judge, saying her position had become “untenable” because her trans identity was viewed as a “lifestyle choice or an ideology”. She now lives in the Republic of Ireland.McCloud said the supreme court ruling came in the midst of “a scary time” for trans people in the UK and would mark the start of a more intense fight for rights. “The rest has been phoney war. The real issues now start,” she said.“If I was a trans person in the UK today, I would steer clear of using any loo in a public space unless it was a single-sex or combined-sex loo, because I personally cannot, as of this moment, judge whether I should use the male loo or the female loo,” she said.“I haven’t got my head around the complexities of the judgment and its repercussions will be ongoing for some time. But I’m happy I live in the Republic of Ireland, where this problem is not an issue. They know where I’m allowed to pee here.”Outside the supreme court on Wednesday morning, Susan Smith, a co-director of the gender-critical campaign group ForWomenScotland, which brought the appeal, was one of a number of women jubilantly celebrating the result.View image in fullscreenSusan Smith welcomed the verdict.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press/Rex/Shutterstock“It was quite something to walk out into banks of photographers and loads of people cheering and clapping. It was very emotional,” Smith said. “We’ve all given up a lot to fight this and we’ve all had to put up with a lot of abuse, a lot of misrepresentation of our motives and our position and our beliefs.“We’ve finally got clarity on the law, and we know now that when spaces and services are provided under the Equality Act and they’re single-sex, it means exactly that. That feels like a massive relief.”Smith said the ruling would help women feel safe if there was a male in a female-only space: “They will know that they are well within their rights to object to that.”She added: “Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic, and it is still protected. But saying that women were just some amorphous collection of people and it was an identity anyone could have, it was really downplaying the very real and different issues that affect men and women.”Maya Forstater, who founded the campaign group Sex Matters after she won an employment tribunal that found she had beenunfairly discriminated againstbecause of her gender-critical beliefs, said the ruling brought “relief, vindication, happiness and pride”.“This judgment has been so clear and it’s from the highest court in the land,” she said. “There are dozens and dozens of women who have had to bring employment tribunal cases because they’ve been victimised for just saying what they think the law says. Now we know that we were right.”She said the court judgment was about “recognising rules and reality”. “If you’re a man, you can call yourself what you like, you can dress how you like, but you cannot work in a rape crisis centre, you cannot go into a woman’s changing room,” she said.McCloud said she also shared concerns about protecting women’s spaces – “I don’t want men in the women’s loos myself, thank you”. But she said people with extreme views “regard someone like me as dangerous” simply because of her trans identity.“Gender-critical ideology is on the ascendancy, and this is obviously a success for them,” she said. “But the struggle starts now, both for them and for us, because they are going to want to enhance this success and we are going to want to clarify and protect the rights that we thought we had.”View image in fullscreenEllie Gomersall called the verdict ‘yet another attack on the rights of trans people’.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianEllie Gomersall, a trans woman and Scottish Green party activist, said she was “gutted” when she saw the news and described it as “yet another attack on the rights of trans people to live our lives in peace”.“This will only impact trans people who have got a gender recognition certificate (GRC), which actually the vast majority of trans people don’t. But I don’t want to underplay how damaging it is,” she said.“It sets the idea that even if you jump through all of the hoops, you go through that really dehumanising and stigmatising process to get a GRC, you’ll still never be recognised in law for who you truly are.”She added: “Some individuals and organisations will see this result and use it as justification or vindication to discriminate further against trans people, and that makes me really worried for my community.”Explore more on these topicsGenderTransgenderEquality Act 2010UK supreme courtWomenanalysisShareReuse this content"

Eight months on, Farage was at pains to praise trade unions, saying his party had “a good partnership” with them. So which one is it?There are two broad answers. The first is that, as with most politicians but particularly Farage, there is an element of saying two contradictory things at once. But also, in the era of British Steelreturning to state controland Reform pursuing votes in Labour heartlands, the political landscape has changed.It was the latter that led Farage to choose a working men’s club in County Durham as thelocation for a speechon Tuesday in which he talked up Reform as the successor to Labour as the voice of the ordinary working man and woman.In a lengthy post-speech Q&A, Farage did lash out at the National Education Union after itformally labelledReform as “far-right and racist”, but he was at pains to stress his desire for a “sensible relationship” with unions and company managers. Asked about thebin workers’ strikein Birmingham, he avoided condemnation of Unite, the union involved, focusing his fire on the Labour-run council.This incarnation of Farage-the-comrade was not entirely new. A week earlier, he visited the stricken British Steel plant in Scunthorpe – some days before the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, made the same trip – to call for the company to be nationalised.It is fair to note that this is not your everyday industrial crisis. Aside from steel’s totemic status in the British political consciousness, the fact the Scunthorpe site needed rescuing from seemingly neglectful Chinese owners made this a political no-brainer for all parties.View image in fullscreenRichard Tice and Farage speaking to journalists outside the British Steel plant in ScunthorpePhotograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty ImagesBut for Farage and his party there is a broader path to tread – as next month’s local elections approach – with the message that Reform’s tanks are on Labour’s lawn in post-industrial heartlands in the north of England and Midlands, bringing into play a new pool of potential voters with interests beyond immigration, culture wars and metric measurements.In February, apoll ledby the Trades Union Congress (TUC) found that about two-thirds of Reform voters support key measures in the government’s employment rights bill such as banning zero-hours contracts and giving staff the right to sick pay from the start of employment.This is where the saying-two-things-at-once idea comes in: as pointed out repeatedly by Labour, every single one of Reform’s MPs voted against the employment rights bill at its second reading, while Farage was the only party representative to turn up to oppose the third reading.Whatever the warm words for unions, this is still where Reform largely faces trouble. When asked after Tuesday’s speech how Reform planned to finance many billions of pounds of tax cuts, Farage gave a vague answer but one heavily focused on cutting business regulation, a move that has not traditionally been helpful for workers’ rights.It is fair to say that most unions are wary of Farage. “We’ve got a job to do pointing out his hypocrisy on all this,” one union source said. “He’s not on the side of workers but on the side of exploitative bosses.”An official was more blunt: “Reform are part of this wider rise of populist, extreme-right groups across Europe, and anyone who thinks otherwise is kidding themselves.”There is, however, an extent to which this is all less contradictory than it may seem. Gawain Towler, who was Farage’s longtime press officer, said his former boss had always been supportive of union members – just not necessarily their leaders.He said: “We are fully in favour of things like collective bargaining and the right of unions to fight their corner. That’s what unions should be about, not the middle-class capture of union management that we now see.”Towler said a more explicit shift towards things like steel began under Richard Tice, Reform’s former leader who is now the party’s deputy leader, who held the party’s 2024 Welsh conference in Port Talbot, the site of another threatened – and now defunct – steelworks.Members may not even agree with union condemnations of Reform, Towler added. “I remember a survey of Unison members back in 2015 which said that 30% supported Ukip. I wrote a letter to the leaders suggesting they might want to move their political donations from Labour to us. I didn’t get a reply.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageTrade unionsLocal electionsanalysisShareReuse this content"

And its youthful cast are exceptionalLucy ManganWed 16 Apr 2025 16.35 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareTen-year-old Tanika (Kaydrah Walker-Wilkie) is encouraging her depressed older brother Tionne (Akins Subair) to get out of bed after their mother’s disappearance, lest social services notice something is wrong with the family and put them into care. “I’ll get adopted, because I’m young and pretty,” she says gently. “They’ll keep you in a home because you look like you’ve got problems.” Baby sisters – always keeping it real.The BBC’s new six-part comedy drama Just Act Normal is the creation of Janice Okoh, based on her 2011 play Three Birds. With their mother gone, the children are trying to fly under the radar of the authorities until the oldest, Tiana (Chenée Taylor), turns 18 and can officially look after them all. So far, the optimism and energy of youth has seen them – or at least the girls – through, and they are keeping Tionne braced between them. While Tanika gives pep talks, Tiana and her best friend, Shanice (Kelise Gordon-Harrison), are out stealing him the live chicken he apparently needs for an experiment.Once her poultry duties are discharged, Tiana must deal with the daily grind of meeting all the other domestic responsibilities that an eldest female sibling is heir to: breakfast; bills; barricading the door against her mother’s drug dealer, Dr Feelgood (Sam Buchanan), who is owed £200; and so on. Plus, she has to go to college, tout for business as a mobile manicurist, do her job as a cleaner (where she is stiffed on minimum wage because she needs to work cash-in-hand), cope with Shanice’s excesses (“I feel like I’ve been manifesting for two lately,” complains her friend) and perhaps also embark on a new romance with Jamie (Adam Little), whose potential has Shanice – and indeed us all – squealing in approval.But from the off – despite the comedy that runs from chicken-based slapstick to Tanika’s mordant wit, via Tiana’s teenage ability to find a laugh or snark in everything – there is the sense of tragedy pulsing at the heart of the children’s story. There is a creeping dread, once we know the truth of their mother’s absence, working its way through every scene as the net starts to close around them and their misery becomes more palpable. When Tionne’s mood briefly lifts after he gets a girlfriend (he has the chicken to thank for this, too), you want to stand up and cheer – and also sacrifice the bird if it would ensure a permanent happy ending for all the siblings.But danger lurks on every side. Not least from Tanika’s needy, overeager and overfond teacher, Miss Jenkins (Romola Garai), whose emotional maturity is several degrees lower than her charge’s but who nevertheless fills something of the maternal void in Tanika’s life in a way that is quite heartbreaking to watch. Indicative of the show’s endless subtleties and layered complexities, at one point the headteacher, Mrs Kitley (Penelope Freeman), tells Miss Jenkins that the phrase “inappropriate relationship” is not solely the preserve of “paedophiles and gym knickers”. Just Act Normal is very good at suddenly twisting the viewfinder.At home, Dr Feelgood moves in after his own mum throws him out. The sweetness of his and Tanika’s growing attachment to one another – while Tionne’s resentment of the man he blames for their situation festers away – is equally pulverising to the viewer, who by this point is prepared to storm the barricades to make sure these kids are not torn asunder by the state.The publicity material accompanying Just Act Normal describes it as “a celebration” of Black, working-class Birmingham life. Which would be true if the word didn’t carry a suggestion of artificial cheer and selection when what it feels most like is an authentic and unapologetic representation of the family’s life in the round. It incorporates racial differences (from Miss Jenkins’ stumbling over the children’s names, to Shanice’s joke about kissing white boy Jamie), mental health issues, class inequities (from Tiana’s careful tracking of every pound earned and spent, to Shanice – child of a rich and generous dad – not understanding what it is to live on an economic knife-edge, to the children sitting on a park bench and dreaming of living in one of the very ordinary houses on the edge of their estate). It rejects the notion that any person is just one thing and never another – Dr Feelgood is a refuge for Tanika; the children’s absent father is not evil or abusive, just “shit” and rueful – and much more.It is also, within each episode and over the entire series, beautifully structured and holds its many strands in perfect tension. Okoh’s work is done full justice by three extraordinary young actors – we are surely watching stars being born – and just as strong a supporting cast. It is altogether a wonderful thing.Just Act Normal aired on BBC3 and is available on iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

When Wellington teacher Huirangi Waikerepuru received his group’s share, he used it to challenge the government.He took his complaint to a relatively new body called the Waitangi Tribunal. Formed in 1975 amid a wave of protest, it was designed to addressMāorigrievances by determining whether the meaning of the country’s founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi, was being adhered to.‘Grubby’ treaty principles bill voted down in New Zealand parliamentRead moreWaikerepuru’s claim was ambitious. He wanted Māori to have equal status to English. He launched his claim on behalf of all Māori against all branches of government, over more than a century of laws and policies. Waikerepuru argued that every lever of government had a case to answer for the language’s marginalisation – from the education department that discouraged it, to the state-owned radio that refused to broadcast it and a civil service that refused to use it.“Every government department had hired a QC,” recalls treaty lawyer Annette Sykes, who was involved with the case. “We had no money but were armed with self-belief and the knowledge we were right.”Over weeks of hearings, busloads of people told their stories – from elders who had been caned for speaking Māori at school, to young activists who said their language was a birthright. The language, they argued, was a treasure protected by the treaty.View image in fullscreenAmbitious aims: Huirangi Waikerepuru in 2003.Photograph: Rob Tucker/Getty ImagesWaikerepuru’s claim prompted the government to act and was defining for the revitalisation of the language. It highlights the impact the tribunal has had on Indigenous rights and policy.Now, as it marks its 50th anniversary this year, the role the tribunal should play in the future is being questioned. The coalition government wants to review the tribunal, to “refocus” the scope of its inquiries, sparking fears from critics that a key outlet for Indigenous policy concerns could be silenced.New Zealand’s divisive treaty principles bill has been defeated – but the fight against populism isn’t over | Chris FinlaysonRead moreThe NZ First minister and spokesperson for Māori affairs, Shane Jones, tells the Guardian the tribunal is becoming “an unnecessary impediment” to lawmaking.“The Waitangi Tribunal can still fulfil an important role, but whether or not it needs to be a legalistic, highly litigious adversarial system – which it has morphed into now – we don’t accept that should be the case,” he said.How the tribunal worksThe tribunal holds inquiries and investigations, led by a judge and a panel of Māori and non-Māori experts. It then provides lengthy reports and non-binding recommendations. The government is able to ignore it, and often does.Over the past five decades, issues considered by the tribunal have ranged from detailed accounts of land theft to examinations of intellectual property rights. It has revealed deep inequities in health and education, and forced rethinks of fisheries and environmental regulations.In 1977, Māori tribe Ngāti Whātua protested against a government plan to sell Takaparawhau/Bastion Point by occupying the site for 506 days, before police moved in. In 1988, the Waitangi Tribunal found the tribe had been wronged and the government eventually returned the site with compensation.Since the government was elected in 2023, Māori groups have filed a record number of claimswith the tribunal over its policies, including the abolition of a Māori health authority, the removal of Māori constituencies on local councils, and a bill to redefine the principles of the treaty. Earlier this month,the bill was voted down in parliament.Despite its recommendations being non-binding, the tribunal has had a significant effect – most notably, through historical inquiries that forced successive governments into negotiations and settlements with iwi (tribes).View image in fullscreenJudge Sir Edward Taihakurei Durie (standing) was the chair of the Waitangi Tribunal from 1980- 2004, presiding over some of its most groundbreaking claims. Here, he speaks at Auckland’s Ōrākei marae (meeting house) in 1985 during hearings into how one of the tribes in New Zealand’s biggest city became landless.Photograph: Gil HanlyIn 1986, it published a 56-page report into Waikerepuru’s language claim, agreeing the language was a treasure the government had an obligation to foster and protect. The government made te reo Māori an official language, established a language commission and funded Māori broadcasting.“I don’t think many had envisaged how that claim became a beacon for the Māori language revitalisation movement,” says Sykes. “But it did.”The tribunal emerged after decades of calls by Māori for the government to honour the Treaty of Waitangi. The treaty is a relatively simple document, with only three clauses that allow for a government, while also guaranteeing Māori self-determination.But problems arose as soon as it was hurriedly drawn up in 1840, with four English versions and a Māori version that matched none of them. It didn’t take long for the Crown to ignore it, with war and rampant land speculation in the 19th century.By the 1970s, New Zealand saw an eruption of Māori protest, with petitions, land marches, sit-ins and occupations. Fitzmaurice-Brown says that at this time, pressure was building to a point the government could no longer ignore.View image in fullscreenThe Waitangi Sheet of the Treaty of Waitangi, signed between the British Crown and various Māori chiefs in 1840.Photograph: Public DomainIn 1975, Labour MP Matiu Rata passed a bill writing the treaty into legislation for the first time. Rata had wanted to make the treaty legally enforceable, but settled for a permanent commission of inquiry where Māori could file a claim if they believed the government had breached the “principles” of the treaty, either through “law, policy, act or omission”.Sykes says it was “not just some magnanimous move by the Crown” but “a minimalist response to growing activism in an increasingly political decade”.Tribunal under reviewThe role the tribunal will play in the years ahead is not clear. Jones insists his party does not want to abolish the tribunal, but the terms of a review are being developed and are likely to be introduced this year.“The Waitangi Tribunal for the last 30-odd years has been regarded as the tip of the taiaha [spear],” Jones says. “It needs to act more like a forum or an assembly where advocates can come together with the government.”With most of the tribunal’s historical inquiries completed, much of its time is spent on modern policy. It also considers constitutional issues, such as a 2015 determination that Māori never ceded sovereignty.Jones says the tribunal has “largely fulfilled its historical mission, which was to enable the modern generation to meet the debts of history, and now it’s focusing on public policy”.Yet withMāori-Crown relations at a low after historic protests last year, many are suspicious of change, says Victoria University law lecturer Luke Fitzmaurice-Brown.“There’s been such a unified response from Māori and that will emerge again in relation to the tribunal,” he says. “People would rally around that.”View image in fullscreenIn November 2024, protests were held outside parliament against government policy proposals that were perceived to roll back Māori rights.Photograph: Mark Tantrum/APFitzmaurice-Brown argues any suggestion the tribunal has strayed from its original purpose is misleading, as it has always investigated contemporary government policies. He says the push to return the tribunal to its original purpose is “thinly-veiled criticism of the existence of the tribunal in general”.“We’ve never seen any government fully uphold te tiriti [the treaty], and until that happens the tribunal will continue to have a role.”The flurry of inquiries in the past 18 months has shown many Māori still see it as a crucial lever. Forty years after she first appeared in the language claim, Sykes still regularly represents claimants in the tribunal.“By the treaty they made with the colonising English, they and their culture were given promises in writing that they expect and demand to be kept.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandNew Zealand politicsMāoriAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But not a unique one – Brine has made 21 such confections as part of his Living Record Collection project, which now brings These Are the Contents of My Head (TheAnnie LennoxShow) to Soho. If I found this one less remarkable an achievement, the feeling was offset by admiration that Brine’s Smiths show was clearly no fluke; that he’s created a striking and confident collage-cabaret genre all of his own.Maybethat last oneworked so well because Frankenstein described the form as well as the content. The fit is less neat here, as our drag-queen host splicesAnnie Lennox’s album Diva, a recording of Judy Garland at Carnegie Hall,Kate Chopin’s feminist novel The Awakeningand (I’m almost done …) tales from his own mother’s failed marriage. In this telling, both the novel’s heroine and Brine’s mum are women struggling to free themselves from marriage and societal convention. Tripping in and out of song, family anecdote and scenes from Chopin’s southern gothic, with additional characters played by scene-stealing pianist Ben Langhorst, Brine’s gumbo doesn’t stint on rich ingredients.The results can feel overcooked, the individual flavours hard to distinguish. In a show that trucks exclusively in big emotion, Brine’s mother’s experience (and his own, navigating his parents’ divorce and coming out) is rendered every bit as melodramatic as Edna Pontellier’s. The songs of Lennox and Garland sometimes illuminate those stories, and sometimes don’t. But they’re always delivered with limpid loveliness by our host, or with hella pizzazz should the moment require.That roof-raising voice of his, not to mention the sexual frankness, as Brine drapes himself over this audience member or that, may not be the perfect match for Chopin’s tale of clipped and frustrated womanhood. But why quibble, when it’s easier to be swept along by the bravura of the enterprise, a lush hymn to dreams of freedom and a feat of idiosyncratic connection-making to put Adam Curtis in the shade.Salty Brine: These Are The Contents of My Head (The Annie Lennox Show) is atSoho theatre, London, until 26 AprilExplore more on these topicsCabaretDragComedySoho theatreAnnie LennoxTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

My father Klaas Roemers was 90, my mother Fenny Roemers-Visser was 86.They had a good life and a very happy marriage, but the last years were difficult. They were both sick and exhausted. Both had heart failure, my mother had a lot of pain. Both were in a really bad shape. They still lived in their own house but life was getting harder and harder, even with help. They did not want to go to a nursing home and neither wanted to live without the other – they wanted to step out of life together. They were afraid one would die naturally and the other would be left behind. They were very close, and did everything together, really everything – so it made sense they would leave this life together.My father was visibly enjoying his last dinner – that was goodIn the Netherlands, whereassisted dyingis legal, this is possible if you have a very good reason. My mother always said: ”We will stay with you as long as we can, until we can see no other way out.” Physicians have to be convinced that the patient is suffering unbearably and has no chance of recovery. My parents were independently evaluated by different doctors, and it was granted to both of them.It’s a very long process but once the decision was made, it all happened very fast. They picked a date, and it was a week later – much sooner than I had thought. My father wanted to go out to dinner somewhere, and on the last evening before they would die, we were able to do that. My father was a very optimistic and worry-free person who would always laugh at our jokes, until the end. He was visibly enjoying his dinner that evening – that was good.My parents were very involved with my work, and would come to my openings. This is an atypical portrait for me; I work on the boundary of documentary and art, photographing the changes in society. My current projectHomo Mobilisis about the intricate relationship between humans and their vehicles – I examine how mobility shapes our identities and societies. My parents were very much looking forward to the exhibition and book of this project. Sadly they will never see it. The presentation is at the end of this year.I had told them a few days before that I was thinking about making a portrait of them after they died, and that I might also bring it into the public space, and asked what they thought about it. They said immediately, yes, you should do it. I didn’t know at first what to do with it, as it is a very personal and private picture. This is the first time I have published it.All our family photographs were around them on the bed, at my mother's requestIn the Netherlands we are very liberal when it comes to assisted dying but in countries where it doesn’t work like that, I thought a photograph like this could be helpful, to illustrate what it means and to contribute to the debate. When I show it to friends they usually respond that it’s beautiful. I understand that, but I don’t see any beauty in it at all. For me it means loss. But I understand that reaction – if it wasn’t my parents perhaps I would see it that way too.This was a very sad event, but when people don’t want to live any more, I believe they should have the possibility to do this. My brother and I had the same feeling – we understood their decision and respected and accepted it. We did not try to stop them or delay it. From then on, we tried to make everything as comfortable as we could for them. I was with them as often as I could be, and importantly, I was able to say everything I wanted to say to them.“Duo euthanasia” is very rare. My brother, my wife and I were present in the room when it happened – our parents wanted us to be there. All our family photographs were around them on the bed, at my mother’s request. They lay on the bed, holding hands. The doctors gave them an injection to go to sleep, and after that the lethal injection. It is very strange and sad to see your parents lying there like that.I took several photographs. Strangely, at that moment, I acted as the professional that I am, making a composition, checking the light and so on. When I was done I looked at them for some time, kissed them each on the forehead and left the room.They died like they lived, hand in hand.Martin Roemers’ CVView image in fullscreenMartin Roemers.Photograph: Koos BreukelBorn:Oldehove, Netherlands, 1962Trained:AKI, Academy of Fine Arts, Enschede, NetherlandsInfluences:“Years ago, I was walking through Mumbai and enjoyed the chaos and hustle and bustle in that town – thousands of people who seemed not to be bothered by the noise, exhaust fumes and lack of personal space. I was wondering how to encapsulate all this energy and chaos in a single photograph. That was my first inspiration forMetropolis, my project about the world’s megacities. I can also be inspired by a conversation I have with someone, a book or a photo. My favourite photographer isAugust Sander, who in the early 20th century made a comprehensive photographic document of German people.”High point:“Having my work included in collections of museums and institutes around the world. I’m excited to present later this year my new bookHomo Mobilis, about the symbiotic relationship between individuals and their vehicles.”Low point:“I was a photography student when the Berlin Wall fell. I should have dropped everything and headed to Berlin, but I didn’t because of my part-time job. Although I made up for it later, it still frustrates me.”Top tip:“I see so many young photographers who work on projects about their own identity.

On Monday, Nikkei Asia reported on analysis from a major electronics supplier suggesting that the Nintendo Switch 2will be subject toTrump’s 145% tariff on goods imported to the US from China, despite his apparent decision to exempt smartphones and computers.This came after Nintendo announcedit would delayUS pre-orders on the console, “in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.” Meanwhile, the Guardian has reported onSony’s plans to increase the price of the PS5by 25% in the UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, citing “a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates.”The games industry is already struggling with the punishing economics of triple-A game development. The past two years has seen a slew of studio closures, mass layoffs and project cancellations; the traditional revenue model of premium priced games, sequels and downloadable content has been torn apart by the huge success of live service games such as Fortnite and Valorant, which are free to play and which generate revenue through cosmetic purchases (like fancy weapons skins and limited-edition costumes) and “battle pass” subscriptions.There is also controversy over the price of premium games. Nintendo’s decision to charge £74.99 and $79.99 for the Switch 2 launch game Mario Kart World is expected to set a new benchmark for other game publishers and has led to much handwringing. All eyes will be on the price of Grand Theft Auto VI when it launches later this year, with one reliable industry analyst, Matthew Ball of investment strategy firm Epyllion, predicting that other publisherswill follow suitif Rockstar opens the door to $80-$100 retail price points.View image in fullscreenGames like Grand Theft Auto VI and Mario Kart World may cost more than the going rate.Photograph: Rockstar GamesBeneath all of these epic financial tumults, however, is something much more important: the personal economic decisions all gamers make.PC Gamer recently reportedona Reddit threadwhere readers had discovered a little known feature of the dominant digital game store, Steam. By navigating to a section of the Help menu entitled “External funds used” you can see exactly how much you’ve spent on games since you started purchasing. The originator of the thread was in shock, realising they had spent $35,000. One member of PC Gamer’s staff discovered their total was $16,000 – “Oh god,” was their reported response.Here’s the thing: cost is relatively easy to calculate, but value isn’t – and value is what’s really important on an individual level. In the mid-90s, when people like me were buying imported games for the Neo-Geo and PC Engine consoles, we were paying between £80 and £120 for new titles – but then I got to play an arcade perfect version of R-Type in my own home, which was valuable tome. When I look at games in my collection, such as Minecraft, Mario Kart 8, Elden Ring and Call of Duty (sorry), I can’t even calculate how much joy they’ve brought me. We’re told these days to spend our moneyon experiences, not things, but video games awkwardly straddle those two concepts – they are consumer products that lead to stories and experiences that we couldn’t have predicted and that we can recall for years.It’s going to be sensible over the next few years to rethink our relationship with the mainstream games industry. To pick very carefully which triple-A titles we buy immediately at full price; to take a chance on a wider range of smaller independent titles that will offer very different experiences at much lower price points. Most open world titles are designed for many months of exploration, yet many players only see a fraction of the content laid out for them before they move on. In the past, when games were physical objects (remember manuals?), we had software clubs and games rentals; public libraries used to lend games. The industry hated all of these – but it survived.As a consumer and a player, I know I need to manage my own economy of fun. At times, that will mean divesting from the pipeline of big game and console purchases and speculating on more exotic markets such asItch.ioandPico8; it might mean retro gaming, going back to rinse old favourites. It’s OK to step off the treadmill. Sony and Nintendohaveto react to the whims of mad kings and markets, but we don’t. We can play a different game.What to playView image in fullscreenOriginal fun … Call of Duty WarzonePhotograph: ActivisionOK, I know, we usually like to highlight smaller indie titles and innovative newcomers in this section – but Call of Duty has always been my guiltiest of pleasures, so here we are.The new season of its Warzone battle royale mode brings back the game’s original Verdansk map, a sprawling killzone of high rise blocks, the legendary superstore and that old labyrinthine prison complex. A number of intricate changes have been made, but this feels like a return to what made Warzone interesting, in that it’s almost a survival game first and shooter second, with lots of exploring and looting between skirmishes.

But socializing can be hard, even for social creatures. Especially the first part: starting a conversation.“It can feel daunting to go up to a stranger and start a conversation because in some instances, we are not sure how we will be received,” says Elaine Swann, a lifestyle and etiquette expert, and founder of the Swann School of Protocol. Will the other person be friendly or standoffish? Will they try to pull you into a multilevel marketing scheme? Will it simply be awkward?If you feel nervous about starting a conversation with a stranger, here are some tips from experts.Don’t assume it will be awkwardHumans tend to do a bad job of predicting how awkward – or not – a conversation will be.“We tend to think a conversation might be burdensome, or that it might not be fun, or that it will be hard to extricate ourselves,” says Charles Duhigg, author of the bookSupercommunicators. “But what we find is that people really enjoy having conversations.”Indeed, studies have shown that even small interactions with people around us can make us feelhappierand more connected.Act confident, even if you don’t feel itAlthough chatting with a stranger may make you feel nervous, don’t let the other person know that.Take good pictures and embrace the apps: how to start datingRead more“There’s a difference between appearing confident and being comfortable,” says Swann.To appear more confident, Swann suggests maintaining good eye contact. This doesn’t mean staring into the depths of a person’s soul – “you can look at someone’s forehead, eyebrows, nose or chin,” says Swann.Thinking of possible conversation topics beforehand can also help you feel more at ease, says Duhigg. Even if you don’t end up talking about any of those topics, knowing you have them in your back pocket might make it easier to have a good conversation because you won’t fear getting trapped in an awkward silence.And don’t worry about seeming cool. A casual social conversation is “not about showing off how clever or witty you are”, says Rob Kendall, author of Watch Your Language: Why Conversations Go Wrong and How to Fix Them. “It’s simply about making a connection and finding common ground.”Ask questionsAs anyone who has been on a bad date knows, carrying on a conversation with someone who doesn’t ask questions is exhausting and unpleasant.“When we’re having a conversation with someone, one of the best things we can do is ask questions,” says Duhigg. According to Duhigg, people who can connect deeply with almost anyone – he calls them supercommunicators – ask 10 to 20 times more questions than the average person.Not all of these questions have to be unique and incisive. Some of them might not even register as questions, Duhigg says. They might just be invitations for the other person to share more, like “And then what did you say?” or “What did you think about that?”People love to talk about themselves, says Kendall, so create opportunities for them to do so. “This is a subject they are an expert on!” he says.And when you ask questions, make sure to seem interested in the answers. “Offer your undivided attention,” says Kendall. “Showing an interest makes people feel good.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionSmall talk is finePeople love to complain about small talk and how boring it is. But big things can come from small talk, says Kendall. “Meeting your partner or your closest friends probably started with small talk, so you never know what might happen,” he says.Small talk can help you figure out what you have in common with the other person. If you meet someone at an event, Swann suggests asking them how they know the hosts, or how long they have been a member of the organization. “Some folks try to get super creative, but I think it’s fine to start with very standard questions,” she says.Steer away from topics that might be too personal or controversial, says Swann. Think of the classic taboos: politics, religion, sex.But just because you’re keeping a conversation light doesn’t mean it has to be boring. Ask “deep questions” that prompt more interesting conversations, says Duhigg. For example, if someone tells you they’re a doctor, instead of asking them at which hospital they work, ask what made them decide to go to medical school. “The second question is just as easy as the first, but it invites that person to tell you who they are,” says Duhigg.Practice!Conversation, like any other skill, can be practiced.It’s “like a muscle”, says Swann. “The more you practice, the better you will become at it.”You can practice conversation pretty much anywhere; Swann says “any line” you’re waiting in will do. When you’re queued up at the grocery store, the bank or a coffee shop, resist the urge to check your phone and instead turn to a person next to you and ask them how they’re doing today. They might blow you off, but they might have something interesting to say.Know when to make an exitOne of the most important conversational skills is knowing when to end a conversation.Pay attention to the other person’s body language, says Swann. “If they’re averting their eyes from you more often than they were in the beginning, that means they’re looking for an exit,” she says. They might also turn away from you – subtly but noticeably, says Swann. Maybe they take a step back or turn slightly to the side.And notice if you’re the only one who seems interested in the conversation any more. “If you’re doing all the work to keep the conversation flowing, it might be a signal that the other person would rather stop the interaction,” says Kendall.More from How to start:How to start meditatingHow to start weightliftingHow to start budgetingHow to start runningExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyHow to startfeaturesShareReuse this content"

According to research by skincare brand No7, 51% of women like to go to bed early after a night out, 65% would rather have an evening at home and just 5% claimed that their perfect night involves going dancing with friends.You young people are such wimps.There’s probably more to it than that.

His name was Luca Prodan, a Scottish-Italian rocker, and he had just finished the last of his methadone on the flight over. His arrival would soon send shockwaves throughArgentinawhen he started a band called Sumo, acquainted the country with post-punk, and became a national legend who lives on, his music still earning hundreds of millions of streams. “When I saw Sumo in 1982,” says Prodan’s younger brother Andrea, “I thought, ‘This is more than just a band. This is like the Velvet Underground.’”But, despite Prodan’s strong ties to Europe and his high esteem in Argentina, he is barely known outside of the country. That looks set to change – thanks to a forthcoming biopic called Time Fate Love, produced by Birdman co-writer Armando Bo. “Luca changed music history,” Bo says. “Here, he’s a god.”He sold a rifle to fund an escape from Gordonstoun – then evaded police across Europe for two and a half monthsProdan was like a grenade thrown into the stuffy Buenos Aires music scene, where musicians tended to wear their hair long and often noodled through adept but derivative jazz fusion or rock. “People were hungry for change,” says Sumo’s first drummer, Stephanie Nuttal. “And they loved Sumo. It was different. They were ready for it. And they took punk on board – big style.”Fronted by Prodan with his Ian Curtis-like crooning, idiosyncratic stage presence and completely shaven head, Sumo were dizzyingly funky and unbounded, playing not just post-punk but deftly hopping between new wave, reggae and cumbia. But, less than a decade after he arrived, and not long after the fall of the military junta, Prodan died at the age of just 34.View image in fullscreenRemembered … a mural dedicated to Prodan in Buenos Aires.Photograph: Prodan family archiveHe had already led a tumultuous life even before he landed in Argentina, bouncing nomadically around Europe. “An Italian guy reborn in England and reborn again in Argentina,” says Peter Lanzani, the zeitgeisty Argentinian actor who will play Prodan in the biopic, which he will also direct.Prodan’s wealthy parents met in pre-revolutionary China: his mother Cecilia Pollock was heir to Shanghai’s main tram company, while his father Mario was a well-known art dealer. In 1943, the two were imprisoned by the Japanese army in the Weixian internment camp before eventually fleeing to Italy, where Prodan was born in 1953. Younger brother Andrea – a musician and actor – says the children lived the high life in Rome, sailing the Mediterranean on the family yacht. But their aristocratic ways also meant that Luca was packed off aged 11 to the prestigious Scottish public schoolGordonstoun, where the future King Charles was a pupil at the time. “My parents wanted us to have a good education,” says Andrea. For Luca, this backfired. “He was unlucky – Gordonstoun was horrible.”At 17, Luca took up the family talent for escapology – and, according to popular mythology, sold a rifle to fund his getaway, heading back to Italy and sparking an international search by Interpol. “We had the police looking for him all over Europe for two and a half months,” says the younger Prodan. “He was a real rebel. Apparently, he had a fist fight with King Charles. I don’t know if this is just part of the myth, but I could see it happening.”View image in fullscreenRebel … Prodan, seated front right, with the Gordonstoun Pipe Band.Photograph: Prodan family archiveAfter Luca was located, he was then conscripted into, and deserted from, the Italian army. “He was always running away,” Andrea says. So his parents bought him a house in Chiswick, London, hoping he’d settle down. This also backfired: by now it was the punk era and Prodan became addicted to heroin. In 1977, he started his first band, the New Clear Heads, while working the singles section at London’s first Virgin Megastore, where, according to Andrea, Luca was fired by Richard Branson for stealing records.It was at this Chiswick house – where fans are campaigningfor a blue plaqueto commemorate the musician – that Prodan first met Stephanie Nuttal, who had been active in the Manchester post-punk scene with Manicured Noise. When bandmate Steve Walsh left Manchester for London, he encouraged Nuttal to move too. There, she was introduced to Prodan and moved into his place.“He was flighty,” says Nuttal. She didn’t see Prodan often, though he occasionally baffled her colleagues by turning up at her workplace to collect rent from her, so he could buy heroin. Nuttal says she couldn’t be in the same room as him when he was shooting up. “He was tall and well-built but was emaciated and literally yellow,” she says. “But he had so much creative energy, when he wasn’t completely under the influence.”Prodan’s addiction worsened when his sister Claudia killed herself. In despair, Prodan overdosed, fell into a coma and was briefly presumed dead. After recovering, he visited the mother of his former Gordonstoun roommate Timmy McKern, a Scottish-Argentine, and saw a photo of the Córdoba hills in Argentina, where his old friend was living with his family. This idyllic postcard, combined with the fact there was very little heroin in the South American country at the time, convinced Prodan to leave for Argentina, where he hoped to get clean.Beginnings … from left, Alejandro Sokol, Prodan and Stephanie Nuttal in 1981, on their way to Córdoba.Photograph: Courtesy: Stephanie Nuttal“He looked at that picture and saw hope in life,” says McKern. But he was in a bad state when he arrived, suffering from withdrawals, fevers, and sleeping all day. The two struggled to make a living on McKern’s family farm – they drank instead, and listened to Joy Division LPs that Prodan had brought with him, possibly the only such records in the country. “Luca said, ‘I’ve studied the Argentine music scene,’” recalls McKern, who would go on to manage Sumo. “‘Let’s start a band and get some money. It’ll be easy.’”With McKern’s brother-in-law, Germán Daffunchio, and his friend Alejandro Sokol,they almost had a group – but they needed a drummer. So on a return visit to London to buy instruments, Prodan decided to recruit Nuttal, who was unhappily ticking by in a haberdashery.With four pence in her pocket and a Gretsch snare drum, Nuttal arrived in Argentina, to the horror of her parents, who objected to its military government. The group settled in Hurlingham, the English quarter on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, and rehearsed on McKern’s farm in Córdoba, which Prodan called Happy Valley. “We rehearsed all night because it was cooler,” says Nuttal. “We got very drunk and when the sun came up, we’d go outside, get into the pool, and go to bed.”This chaotic energy fed into Sumo’s early songs. They quickly earned a reputation, performing in Buenos Aires pubs and bars such as Café Einstein, which Andrea describes as “the place where all the freaks hid from the dictatorship to freak out”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

And there’s Luca singing anything he wantsLife was hard in Argentina. Under the dictatorship, tens of thousands of political opponents were killed in clandestine “disappearances”. LGBTQ people were jailed and tortured in their masses. Inflation was so severe that products were listed with colour codes rather than price tags, because they could change so drastically from morning to afternoon. “It was a heavy scene with lots of people disappearing every day,” says McKern. “Then this guy arrived, Luca, who hadn’t lived under that – he was completely free.”Andrea adds: “Imagine, when he came to Argentina, he was singing in English during one of the most terrible repressions. People were being killed for being suspected of being anti-military. And there’s Luca singing anything he wants. He was so weird, the military didn’t know what to do with him.”Authorities sometimes detained entire audiences – but, risking their freedom and even their lives, fans turned up to Sumo shows anyway. Once, when the police had arrested everyone and asked who Luca Prodan was, the crowd defiantly burst into cheers, Spartacus-style. Prodan was briefly jailed, writing to McKern from prison: “He said, ‘It’s the same as being in Gordonstoun, but they don’t ask you to do anything.’”But whenthe Falklands war kicked off in 1982, Nuttal felt she had to return to the UK. Singing in English was forbidden. Her presence had caused locals to nickname Sumo “the English band”. The tabloids, she says, published stories about then PM Margaret Thatcher eating babies. “She may have done,” Nuttal laughs, but it was emblematic of the tension in the country.View image in fullscreen‘They put me in prison again’ … Prodan.Photograph: Prodan family archiveNuttal thought she might wait things out in neighbouring Uruguay, but returned to the UK, where she says people treated her like a traitor. She gave up music and becomes emotional when she describes how Argentinians still visit her to this day, thanks to her role in their country’s music history. “They won’t let go and I don’t want them to,” she says, “but I find it quite extraordinary because I was only there for a short time – I didn’t even record anything.”Sokol replaced Nuttal on drums and a bass player and saxophonist were added. The band put out their first record, Corpiños en la Madrugada (Bras at Dawn), in 1983. That same year, the military government fell. But just as Argentina started to open up, Luca was becoming disillusioned with music.He briefly returned to Europe, and visited his brother Andrea in Italy, where he played a small part in a biblical TV drama, Anno Domini, with none other than Ava Gardner. “I played Britannicus but they made him a jailer,” says Andrea. “I remember Luca said, ‘I came here on holiday and they put me in prison again!’”While Prodan’s European influences had given birth to punk rock in Argentina, the continent had changed while he was away. Yuppiedom was taking hold in the UK – and Italy, Prodan thought, was even worse. So he decided to return to Argentina and throw all his energy back into the band. They signed with CBS, now a Sony subsidiary, to release their first proper album in 1985 – Divididos por la Felicidad (Divided By Happiness), a Spanish-language homage to Joy Division. “All of a sudden, Sumo just exploded,” says Andrea. “It was amazing.”The band had complete artistic control. They played larger venues and their fame snowballed. Two more records, Llegando los Monos (Here Come the Monkeys) and After Chabon, were released in the following two years. Yet, while Sumo had this artistic freedom and Argentina had regained its liberty, Prodan’s alcoholism worsened. He was carrying a bottle of gin with him everywhere.La Rubia Tarada by Sumo, from album Divididos por la Felicidad“We tried to get Luca clean,” says McKern. “But you always had this feeling that this was going to end. In the beginning, Luca directed everything – all the music. In the final recordings, the band more or less presented him with the music, and asked him to sing on it.”In 1987, Prodan told a radio journalist that he expected to die soon. And just before Christmas, on 22 December, days after what would turn out to be Sumo’s final show, Luca was found dead at his home in Buenos Aires’ San Telmo neighbourhood, having suffered a heart attack. Sumo split into two bands, Divididos and Las Pelotas (the Bollocks), who became important for Argentina’srock nacionalin their own right.“He was bigger than life,” says Nuttal. Lanzani agrees: “We hope to get to the soul, the essence of Luca,” he says. He wants the biopic, which is still being filmed, to bring belated international exposure to Prodan. A documentary is also in the works by Italian film-maker and journalist Luca Lancise, to be released next year.But whether or not international awareness grows, Prodan will always be a hero in Argentina. “In only six years, Argentina accepted him as one of its own,” says Andrea. “I think about it every day. He had the strength to break into the Argentine myth machine. And he got in there – alongside Maradona and Evita Perón.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockArgentinaIndieBiopicsActivismPunkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it must be remembered this is not an abstract debate; it concerns real peopleSam Fowles is a barristerWed 16 Apr 2025 12.50 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe supreme court, headlines say, has ruled on “the definition of a woman”. Except it hasn’t. As the court says, in paragraph 2 of itsjudgment: “It is not the role of the court to adjudicate on the arguments in the public domain on the meaning of gender or sex, nor is it to define the meaning of the word ‘woman’ other than when it is used in the provisions of the [Equality Act] 2010.”So what is the court’s decision actually about? In 2018, the Scottish parliament passed a law encouraging public boards to have 50% representation for women. For Women Scotland, a group thatdescribes itselfas “working to protect women’s rights”, asked the court to strike the law down because it included transgender women. There followed a series of legal challenges which eventually made their way to the supreme court.The essence of the court’s decision is (in broad strokes) as follows: a) the Gender Recognition Act 2004 states that a person with a GRC [gender recognition certificate] is to be treated as the sex stated in the GRC “for all purposes” unless a statute provides otherwise; b) although theEquality Act 2010doesn’t explicitly state otherwise, it contains various references to the word “woman” in contexts where it makes more sense if it is read as “biological woman”; c) the Equality Act therefore rebuts the presumption in the GRA and, for its purposes, “woman” means “biological” (“cis”) woman and, accordingly, the 2018 act must be read as excluding trans women from the class of “woman”.For Women Scotlandraisednearly £250,000 to fund its case. Yet the decision leaves the legal rights of cis women untouched. What it does do, however, is make the legal equalities landscape significantly more complex. Previously, the Equality Act was interpreted quite simply: people who were born women or had a GRC were women for the purposes of the act. Another section of the act provided protections for those undergoing “gender reassignment” (whether or not they had a GRC).The court’s decision means there are now multiple legal classes of “woman” and “man”, each of which invites a different interpretation of the act: cis women, trans women with a GRC, trans women without a GRC, cis men, trans men with a GRC, trans men without a GRC. The court acknowledged that, should a trans woman be discriminated against because someone thinks she is a cis woman, then she will still be entitled to make a claim for sex discrimination in the same way as a cis woman.And what of the practical impacts of the decision? As of 2020,there were reportedly no trans women serving on public boards. Trans people make up around 0.44% of the over-16 population in Scotland. The chances of a cis woman losing a public board position to an equally qualified trans woman are vanishingly small. The 2018 act will still permit the appointment of a trans woman ahead of an equally qualified biological woman if the appointment can be justified on the basis of their “particular characteristics or situation”.In terms of the broader effects of the decision, there is some suggestion that this might affect women-only groups that wish to exclude trans women. It won’t. The law permitted such exclusions already. (Although it may be that some groups would feel more confident in using them after this decision.)The court was clear that trans people (regardless of whether they have a GRC) remain entitled to protection under the Equality Act (generally the same as conferred on biological women). Some sections of the act, which refer explicitly to “women”, will now be confined to cis women. The vast majority of these, however, are either unlikely to affect trans people or else the protections are replicated elsewhere in the act. Section 17 of the act, for example, explicitly refers to “treating a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding” as an example of discrimination against women on the basis of sex. The court’s decision suggests that a trans woman is not protected by section 17. Such discrimination is still, however, probably prohibited by sections 7 and 13 (which prohibit discrimination against trans people).No trans people were represented during the case – and retired judge Victoria McCloudwas refused permissionto join the litigation. Yet despite the limited reach of the decision itself, it will no doubt have other effects.The court asked politicians and activists not to weaponise its decision for political gain. Moments after it was published, however, some politicians and activists did exactly that.It must be remembered that this is not an abstract debate – it involves real people. Trans people, for example, are nowtwice as likelyas cis people to be the victim of violent crime;62%-73% reportbeing harassed.That isn’t the supreme court’s fault. All the court can do is interpret the law set down by parliament. The judges’ analysis is forensic, balanced and rational. Their decision shows, however, that parliament urgently needs to look again at the Equality Act. If politicians focused more on legislating, and less on making cheap political capital, this case may never have been necessary.Sam Fowles is a barrister, author and broadcasterDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s a puzzler, because if she wants to praise Donald Trump and Elon Musk,peddle dark conspiracy theoriesand give the fullest possible account of her grandiose self-belief, she’d be in great company on X. But that wouldn’t be thinking big enough – she wants to create an entirely new network, “uncensored and uncancellable”, which will grow a grassroots movement of Trussites.So often, Truss appears as a pioneer, whether that’s of free-market fundamentalism so radical as to give all markets a nervous breakdown, or of free-speech fundamentalism so trenchant that it needs its own domain. But she’s actually not the first Tory to try this. Matt Hancock launched his own app in 2018, when he was the culture secretary. His intention was completely opaque –he described itas “a chance for you to tell me what you think, and to engage with others on issues that matter to you”. You can lose hours wondering how he arrived at the conclusion that anyone wanted to tell him what they thought, before you get to the hard stop: if you wanted to engage with others who shared your views, and could find no space in the modern media landscape to do that, who would you choose as your conduit? Would it be Hancock, or would it be literally anybody else? What even were his views?When the app closed five years later, it had reportedly been downloaded 5,000 times on Google Play,with an average user rating of 2.7. It is impossible to guess, I’m afraid, what those users were looking for, and how they came to be so disappointed. No, wait, I can guess. There were 4,999 journalists, looking for something juicy and coming away empty, plus Hancock’s mum.The stranger experiment was Louise Mensch’s in 2012, when she launched Menshn, describing it as “Twitter for topics”. Menschfell out with her co-founderand closed the site before anyone figured out what that meant. She had a lot in common with Truss, in fact – a quality of self-aggrandisement, a love of publicity – but what they didn’t share was context.Back then, “freedom of speech” was already a dog-whistle for “why isn’t a decent person like me allowed to say offensive things?”, but there was noconcerted attempt by the USto get Britain to repeal our laws on hate speech. And this was partly because there was no threat of tariffs and therefore nothing to leverage, but mainly because Barack Obama wasn’t trying to create an authoritarian state by radically circumventing allowable opinion, then accusing opponents of doing exactly that.JD Vance, by contrast, finds any state measure to limit bile – particularly, at the moment, when directed at LGBTQ+ groups – to be a threat to freedom, and by extension, to western civilisation. He can square this with the fact that it’s now possible in the US to be arrested forattending a pro-Gaza protest. Truss’s project has a similar upside-down-world quality; in her telling, the noisiest of the rightwing are those living in perpetual fear of cancellation, and all legislative measures designed to preserve civility are actually acts of control and hostility to free citizens.The similarity between her case and that of the Trumpians might not even register – you can easily imagine that administration having forgotten she was ever prime minister, and never clocking her fearless unilateral attempts to take the brakes off our hate speech legislation by creating the space to say hateful things. Nevertheless, you can see her taking heart from the company.Furthermore, the “freedom of speech” debate has changed shape over the past decade: pre-Brexit, it was mainly a shortcut to negative attention. Going back to Michael Howard’s “Are you thinking what we’re thinking?” 2005election slogan, if you flagged that you might be prepared to say something bigoted, that was catnip to a bored media. Post-Brexit, “freedom of speech” became a code for announcing which side you were on. If you wanted to talk about the customs union and the leaky Irish border, you were most likely a remainer. If you wanted to talk about freedom of speech, you were most likely a Brexiter.Now its use has changed again: everyone knows it has nothing to do with censorship. Everyone knows that the same people who will fight to the death for their right to attack transgender kids are happy to ban books and close down political demonstrations. Everyone knows that “cancelled” means “except for the newspaper column and the show on GB News”. The use of the term is a straight bid to overwrite observable reality, until none of us know which way is up.Does this make Truss’s enterprise more of a threat, since she’s singing from a global hymn sheet with a lot of reach and power? Or less of a threat, since she’s such an insignificant figure among people much louder and better resourced? It’s hard to tell at this distance, particularly since we don’t know how much cash is behind her, or who’s supplying it. But I feel sure this problem would go away if someone would just do the decent thing and give her a column in the Daily Mail.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLiz TrussOpinionTrump administrationSocial mediaConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

It’s not coming from the place you might thinkWed 16 Apr 2025 10.28 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 14.01 EDTShareFor all its talk of free speech, the Trump administration seems remarkably comfortable with censorship. Earlier this year, children studying at Pentagon schools (serving US military families) were prevented from accessing libraries for a week while officialsreviewed their shelvesfor titles that might be “related to gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology topics”. Trump’s presidency has injected new energy into the book-banning movement that has been simmering for years on the US right. You might think that censoring school libraries would be totally unimaginable in Britain. You’d be wrong.I worked as a librarian for 10 years, and now I teach on the library and information studies master’s programme at UCL. After the pandemic, I began noticing signs of an eerily similar trend. It erupted in the spring of 2022, when a Catholic school in Croydon invitedSimon James Green, a prominent gay children’s author, to give a talk. The US anti-LGBT website Catholic Truth ran a campaign encouraging readers to contact the school and protest against the event (one reader said, somewhat implausibly, that Green’s visit to the school was “100% as much of an issue as the ongoing war in Ukraine”). The commission responsible for the school released a statement suggesting the event should be cancelled, teachers went on strike, and thestory reached the national press.It got me thinking: how many school librarians had come under pressure to remove books from their shelves? Onesurvey conductedlater that year found 26% of librarians had “occasionally” been asked to censor materials. In 2024, meanwhile, Index on Censorshipsurveyed 53 school librarians, more than half of whom had been asked to remove books. I was keen to hear from librarians about where these requests were coming from, and how they were dealing with them, so I decided to do my own study. I interviewed 10 school librarians across the UK about the challenges they had faced. Their responses were interesting – and alarming.Most of the requests to remove books came from parents, and almost all of these requests related to books that explored LGBT+ themes. Some books came up repeatedly: Alice Oseman’s series of Heartstoppergraphicnovels, which centre on a relationship between two schoolboys; Billy’s Braveryby Tom Percival, about a boy who dresses up as his favourite superhero, Nature Girl, for World Book Day; and This Book Is Gayby Juno Dawson. Some librarians had received signed letters from parents asking them to remove particular books. Other times, the letters had been sent anonymously. One librarian told me they had found a leaflet produced by a rightwing religious American group, not dissimilar to Catholic Truth, on one of the desks in their library.Based on what I’ve seen and heard, it seems there has been an increase in these requests since the pandemic. Perhaps that’s because parents became more aware of what their children were reading during the intense period of home schooling. Perhaps it’s also a symptom of our febrile political culture. Over the last three years, drag queen story events – a popular format involving considerable amounts of glitter and storytelling aimed at children – have beentargeted by protestsorganised by Turning Point UK, a British offshoot of the far-right US political organisation, and by the white nationalist groupPatriotic Alternative. Would it be so surprising if the huge amount of coverage the British press has devoted to culture war subjects spilled over into some parents asking for certain books to be removed from school libraries?I find it hard not to see these requests as an insult to school librarians. These professionals undertake years of training and devote a huge amount of time and care to curating a selection of books that will enrich children’s learning and expand their horizons. They’re also careful about ensuring books are age-appropriate and respond to the curriculum (LGBTQ+ content is included as a statutory part of relationships and sex education teaching). Unfortunately, librarians are often at the lowest end of the school hierarchy. They’remostly women, and mostly on very low salaries. Their sector is vulnerable: some secondary schools haveclosed their librariesdue to funding pressures. A quarter of schools in Wales don’t have a library, while two-thirds of school libraries in Scotland have no library budget at all.It’s far easier to write a letter to a librarian asking them to remove a book than it is to address the truly inappropriate and harmful material that children are exposed to (which, by the way, has nothing to do with books such as Billy’s Bravery).Social media platforms have been blamed for encouraging bullying andeating disorders, and promoting influencers whodrive misogyny. Banning books will only drive young people online for answers, where they are more likely to encounter content produced by people who have no interest in equipping them with the information and skills they need to navigate the world. In this age of digital exposure and misinformation, librarians play a more vital role than ever. We should trust them to do their jobs.Alison Hicks is a lecturer in library and information studies at UCLExplore more on these topicsCensorshipOpinionLibrariesSchoolscommentShareReuse this content"

It lifts the heart as much as any spring flowerWed 16 Apr 2025 11.08 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareI’ve always thought seasonal affective disorder, what with its convenient acronym and all, to be a load of tosh. But that’s because I don’t live with Sad. It’s shamefully easy to dismiss something when you don’t feel it in your own bones. Sad, me? No, I can be grumpy whatever the weather. Also, just as without despair there is no joy, the staggering beauty of a blue sky over the British Isles would be less staggeringly beautiful if it was always there. Blue skies all year round? Nah, not for me.In fact, I find dismal winter weather somewhat liberating. When the weather’s good, the opportunities it presents are overwhelming. A paralysis of choice takes hold. So many places to go and things to do with the sun on your back. That urgent need to be out there. Every sunny day leaves me with this feeling that I haven’t quite made the most of it. And much as I love my job, being in an office or a studio, I love it a little bit less when the sun is shining outside. In a way, life is more straightforward when it’s grey, windy and wet, as then I can forgive myself for staying at home and being still and calm, essentially doing bugger all for a bit without feeling bad about it.Still, while winter is fine, spring is finer. Seeing so many people of my acquaintance – especially older people – perk up no end these last couple of weeks, I am now quite sure that Sad is a thing after all. My mum’s a changed woman – and why wouldn’t she be after a long, dark, wet winter sitting in front of the fire watching endless quizshows, cooking contests and Michael Portillo pottering here, there and everywhere? The lifting of the health and spirits of her and those around her is as brightening as any spring flower.I spoke to Michael Morpurgo regarding the book he’s written about spring. “There’s something about spring that makes you deal with what’s difficult better,” he says. Nicely put. I asked him what writing about it had taught him that hadn’t occurred to him before. “I suppose the thing I’ve learned most is – it sounds rather dreadful – that if you’re really concentrating on spring, you know it might be your last one. You get the wrong side of 80 and that thought does occur to you from time to time.”It wasn’t his intention to strike any kind of morbid note, but there’s surely something in this. If I throw myself backwards or forwards to last autumn or next, lurking somewhere deep down is the hope that I’ll be around to see the leaves appear back on those trees.It says something positive about Morpurgo that it’s taken more than 80 springs for this idea to strike him. It’s been on my mind since I was a teenager. I used to look at the horse chestnut tree out the back of our house and fret a little that I’d not see it turn green again. I don’t know what this negativity was all about. I suppose I could put it down to the football team I support, and also to reading more Thomas Hardy than was good for me.Daft, really. Back then, any bookmaker would have given me short odds indeed on making it safely through to the other side of winter. But perhaps this is the point – year upon year, those odds lengthen. So why wouldn’t the coming of spring be so special? I’ll come back to this idea in the autumn, by which time I hope to have found a way of putting a more positive spin on the falling of the leaves.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSpringOpinionWinterAgeingUK weatherHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

But the solution is pragmatism, not prohibitionWed 16 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 13.55 EDTShareThe latest hitNetflixshow hassurpassed 100m viewsand cracked the top five of the platform’s all-time biggest English-language series – without CGI monsters, ornate gowns or Jenna Ortega. Instead, Adolescence is a four-episode limited series about a 13-year-old British boy accused of stabbing his female classmate to death. And as the story unfolds, the pernicious influence of cyberbullying and social media radicalization on the main character comes into focus.The show has sparked conversations about the much-discussed male loneliness epidemic and the pervasive influence of hypermasculine online personalities. It has set off public debate fromIndiatoAustraliato theUnited Statesabout how we raise boys in an era when social media increasingly serves as an endless trough of misogynist messaging. In the UK, where the series became the firststreaming showto top the country’s TV ratings, it has stirred intense conversations on news panels and in parliament. Even the prime ministerjumped into the frayafter watching the show with his teenage children.But whileAdolescencehas become a lightning rod for these debates, the show itself takes a nuanced approach to topical themes of male isolation, vulnerability and violence. Adolescence never lectures its audience, and it is not prescriptive; instead, it leaves viewers with more questions than answers. And the popularity of the show could help foster meaningful conversations about a healthier approach to media consumption and participation for all.Adolescence’s protagonist, Jamie, is far from alone in his loneliness. In the last few years, writing about the post-Covid escalation in isolation has become something of a cottage industry. From Jonathan Haidt’sThe Anxious Generationto Jean Twenge’sGenerations, youthful despair is the issue that has launched a thousand podcast appearances. Despite this abundance of coverage, the problem persists that young people remain lonely: in the UK, 16- to 29-year-olds arethe loneliest age group, and in the US, 40% of teensreport feeling chronically hopeless. Youth suicide rates haveincreased by almost two-thirdssince 2007.More than half of US teens have come to spendalmost five hourson social media every day, on platforms that can not only exacerbate loneliness, but encourage antisocial behavior. The two most popular platforms among 13- to 17-year-oldsare YouTube and TikTok, both of whichuse algorithmsthat are aspowerful as they are dangerous. YouTube, for example,recommends right-leaning videoseven to viewers who haven’t interacted with that type of content. The Department of Homeland Security has also reported that TikTokpromotes extremist discourse, including “tactical guidance” from the January 6 insurrectionists.The results have been tragic. Last July, a 26-year-old man in Englandmurdered his ex-girlfriend, Louise Hunt, along with her sister Hannah, and her mother, Carol. Prosecutors later revealed that he hadbinge-watched videos of Andrew Tate, a kickboxerfacing rape allegations in the UKand a criminal investigation in Romania over alleged human trafficking. Crimes like this one bring Adolescence disturbingly close to the threshold of documentary.But what is too easily missed is that it’s not only young men being manipulated and radicalized online. More than a decade ago, a 12-year-old girlstabbed her friendin tribute to a fictional online character called Slender Man. While girlsare far less likely to commit acts of violenceagainst others, they are more likely to adopt self-harming behaviors such asself-injury,eating disordersandsuicide attempts, all of whichare inflamed by YouTube algorithms.Now, Adolescence’s creator is offering a well-intentioned solution:banning access to social mediafor teenagers. Australia has alreadypassed such an embargofor anyone under 16, and though it won’t take effect until later this year, it still exemplifies the idea’s unfeasibility. The law will enforce restrictions through age-verification technology, which the platforms will have to implement themselves, a bit like asking Al Capone to enforce temperance.Even if they do, patronizing young people by telling them they can’t be trusted with a technology they’ve been using their whole lives is unlikely to work. Those who want to keep using social media will find a way to do so. VPNs can easily circumvent regional barriers,as Russians discoveredwhen Vladimir Putin banned Facebook and Instagram in 2022. And websites like YouTube don’t require an account to view videos,granting theman almost uncloseable loophole.That’s why this crisis seems better addressed through pragmatism than prohibitionism. After all, teenagers themselves recognize the harm that social media can pose – perhaps better than anyone – and94% of them saythey want their schools to offer instruction in media literacy. The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, intends to kickstart that education byscreening Adolescence in secondary schoolsnationwide. But in the US, our official head of stateowns a multibillion-dollar social media company– as does ourunofficial head of state– so a similar move seems unlikely.Then again, if there is going to be a cultural shift toward mitigating the risks of social media, it will probably not come from senators hectoring parents and their children about screen time. Instead, it will take more delicate, patient, thoughtful conversations like the kind organically taking place in response to Adolescence. And in the classroom, there may not be a one-size-fits-all approach, butMedia Literacy Now’s database of more than 130 lesson plans – on everything fromdigital citizenshiptodetoxing your feed– could be a good start. (And to be clear: adults would benefit just as much, if not more, from brushing up on these topics.)Adolescence has resonated so deeply with so many by presenting a complex, human story that defies simple answers. In that spirit, it seems unlikely that anything would be solved by trying to get young people to quit algorithms cold turkey. But perhaps with enough empathy, respect and humility, we could all help each other scroll responsibly.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineat 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

Why does this keep happening?Wed 16 Apr 2025 07.03 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 09.53 EDTShareIf you threw Blind Date, the opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan and the auction block into a blender, what you’d get isPop the Balloon or Find Love, a weekly hour-long Black dating show on YouTube.The show was created byArlette Amuli, an African American of Congolese origins, and her husband,Bolia “BM” Matundu, a Black Brit also of Congolese descent (he had a previous life as aUK rapperand then as aNdombolo musician). It has become an international sensation in an age where our fried attention spans have us addicted to short videos. The format is minimalist to the point of brilliance: each week, a line of eight or so balloon-clutching love hunters line up to court and be courted by a singleton of the opposite sex they have never met before.Should they not be interested, or be put off by anything – looks, values, religion, skin tone, children from previous relationships or lack thereof, economic status, tattoos, eyebrow shape – they pop their balloon. Expressing attraction, rejecting someone or being rejected in private is crushingly intimidating enough (to me at least). Immortalised rejection to the sound of an unexpected loud bang, followed by a full rationale and a right of reply? Utter genius TV.And then the inevitable happened:Netflixcame knocking. Fans of the show showered Amuli and Matundu with congratulations, excitement and absolute trepidation. Would Netflix ruin a beloved, groundbreaking and independent Black show by tampering with a winning formula, or would they make a few nips and tucks to elevate it to another level?Well, they did worse. They gentrified it.In the original Pop the Balloon or Find Love, Amuli (who also presents the show) and Matundu created a very modern dating show that is the perfect balance of righteousness and ratchetness, while simultaneously being a classy, funny, furious, flirtatious and sometimes intellectually curious affair. It reveals more than it might appear to about the psychology, values, methods and mannerisms of Black courtship within the confines of the west. Each of the 50 episodes posted to date has attracted more than a million views on YouTube, short clips from the show are social media dynamite, and it has spawned stars, at leastone marriage proposal, countless rip-offs, and parodies bySaturday Night Liveandpopular sports TVshows. An African American and Black British (via the Democratic Republic of the Congo) independent media dynasty is born.Based on the avalanche of disapproval for Netflix’s version (”or Find Love” was dropped from the title), fans’ worst nightmares came true. Gone was the wholesome insight into Black dating and love patterns; in stepped swearing, twerking, needless disrobing and even what many thought wasracism. Gone were the class, the intellectual insights and the Black “civilians” (of all shades) looking for love; in came a diverse (all of the “contestants” on the first episode of the Netflix show were either white or light-skinned), drink-sodden, rowdy affair including influencers and washed-up reality TV stars. Pop the Balloon or Find Love seemingly became Pop the Balloon and Find Clout. Despite the efforts of the new presenter, the comedian and actor Yvonne Orji (of HBO’s Insecure fame), it was genuinely painful to watch.On the bright side of things, for all it lacked, the Netflix version offered an inadvertent insight into the plight of Black creatives – especially upstarts – in predominantly white spaces.It’s hard, if not impossible, to nail down how the rot set in, but there are many other such instances of cultural upscaling or migration that fit this sorry pattern. No matter how much leverage you have as a cultural originator, the power (and money) in creative decision-making remains firmly in the hands of the organisations that, sadly, far too often just don’t get the culture they’re buying into. These organisations are also often not humble, introspective or honest enough to recognise this fact.But should you stand your ground too strongly, it could cost you your deal – or, even worse, it could unjustly earn you a bad reputation that could cost you your career. If you don’t stand your ground, your reputation could be attached to a project that will damage you as a creative. Importantly, as a Black creative who operates with a consciousness of the history of Black people in popular visual entertainment – much of it rooted in minstrelsy – the burden of representation rests massively on your shoulders. This catch-22 quite literally keeps Black creatives up (and tearfully panic-calling confidants) at night.Amuli and Matundu, a proudly Christian couple, were retained as executive producers of the Netflix version. Yet, given the nature of the original, it’s hard to see how they could be happy with this incarnation. This was not their warm, funny show; this was its more sensational viral clips re-imagined by veterans of the shock and awe world of reality TV. If those veterans really understood what made Pop the Balloon or Find Love such a sensation, they would have tried to replicate its knowing way of merging intellectual nourishment with fast-paced entertainment. What we have seen instead is the nutrition-free, social-media-virality-driven nature of influencers, reality TV stars and smut, which – in many circumstances – is a winner, if not a creative success.It’s not all about Netflix. The channel is usually a good partner for Black creatives; in fact, it’s one of the best in the business. But have Amuli and Matundu, or anyone who loved what they did, gained from the Netflix-isation of Pop the Balloon or Find Love?The second episode of the Netflix version airs on Thursday (Friday morning in the UK), and here’s a prediction: in our millions, we original devotees will stick with the original (ungentrified) YouTube version.

Must be all those ‘hamberders’Wed 16 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 06.27 EDTShareForget yoga, pilates or eating leafy greens. If you want to improve your health, just look to Donald “My Body Is a Temple” Trump for pointers. The US president just had his annual checkup and emerged with flying colours. “President Trump remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function,” White House physician Sean Barbella said in areport released on Sunday.How does the 78-year-old, who is the oldest person in history to be inaugurated US president, stay in such great shape? The report cited an active lifestyle, noting Trump’s many speeches and “frequent victories in golf events”. But if you’re not a golfer, don’t worry. I have put together a four-point Donald John Trump Wellness Plan so that you can be as perky as the president.1. Don’t rundown your battery with too much exerciseAccording to a2017 New Yorker profile, the president’s views on exercise – like his views on everything else – seem to have emerged from Victorian Britain. “Other than golf, [Trump] considers exercise misguided, arguing that a person, like a battery, is born with a finite amount of energy,” the article notes. Sounds bonkers, I know. But look at the speed with which Trump is dismantling democracy! Maybe he’s on to something.2. Sleep as little as possible“Don’t sleep any more than you have to,”Trump advisedin his 2004 book Trump: Think Like a Billionaire. “I usually sleep about four hours per night.” He expounded on this on the campaign trail. “I’m not a big sleeper. I like three hours, four hours, I toss, I turn, I beep-de-beep, I want to find out what’s going on,” Trumpsaid in 2015. For most people, anxiety and aweakened immune systemis what’s going on after chronic sleep deprivation. But, clearly, it’s working out for Donald.3. Repeat after me: person, woman, man, camera, TV“They said nobody gets it in order – it’s actually not that easy,” Trump said after taking a cognitive test in 2020 thatinvolved repeating those words.4. Inhale Diet Cokes and “hamberders”Trump doesn’t drink alcohol and, in a rare moment of self-awareness, noted that never drinking is one of his “only good traits”. Instead of boozing, however, he throws back so many fizzy drinks that he’s installed a Diet Coke button on the Oval Office desk. He’s also a big fan of fast food and loveswhat he calls “hamberders.”Again, inhaling junk food is unorthodox wellness advice, but you can’t argue with the healthiest president the US has ever seen, can you?Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There has always been common wariness of Beijing as a commercial rival and potential security threat. But for hawks in Washington the idea of an alternative superpower closing in on economic and technological parity feels existential. More dovish Europeans have been readier to leaven caution with engagement.Britain has veered between the two poles. In 2015, David Cameron promised a “golden era” of open trade with China. In 2020, under pressure from the US, Boris Johnson banned Huawei, a Chinese telecoms company, from UK 5G infrastructure.In opposition, Conservatives have become increasingly hawkish against Beijing. Keir Starmer’s Labour government has tilted back towards cooperation. Several ministers have visited China, including the chancellor. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, will go therelater this year, reviving a trade commission that has been dormant since 2018. Mr Reynolds was manifestly frustrated with the Chinese owners of British Steel during the dash to keep Scunthorpe’s blast furnaces operating last week, but the government has retreated from intimations of deliberate sabotage.At some point, pursuit of economic growth and investment comes into conflict with a national security interest in keeping China at arm’s length. The question iswhere to draw the line. The official answer is that judgment is deferred pending a Whitehall “audit” of relations with Beijing. That is due in June.A decision is also imminent on China’s status under theforeign influence registration scheme– a system for keeping tabs on international organisations and companies exercising political influence in Britain. China is not expected to be named in the “enhanced tier” of risky states, alongside Russia and Iran, but some Chinese institutions might have that designation.Calibrating these judgments – choosing when to prioritise security over commerce – is much harder withDonald Trumpin the White House. What used to be a difference of emphasis between the US and Europe looks like an irreparable fracture in the west.Mr Trump has started a ferocious trade war with Beijing without a convincing strategic rationale. Officials from his administration are telling Europeans they will have to choose a side when it comes to vital communications technology. But the US president is also routinely aggressive in his rhetoric towards the EU, dismissive of Nato and reliably emollienttowards Vladimir Putin’s Russia.From that pattern it is clear in Brussels and other continental capitals that Washington is nolonger a reliable allyand the trajectory must be “strategic autonomy” for Europe. Inevitably, that is changing the calculus of risk and potential benefit from a more pragmatic China policy. The authoritarian character of Xi Jinping’s regime hasn’t changed, but it presents itself as a more predictable force in international affairs while US democracy declines in violent spasms.These changes illuminate a crisis of international orientation for Britain that has been building sinceBrexit. Economic detachment from Europe was premised on a model of the UK as a lone sovereign agent in an open, free-trading globalised world. That was an outdated concept at the time. It has aged very poorly. Britain is not alone in struggling to navigate relations with China in the turbulent new geopolitical climate, but choosing loneliness in a world of rival continental blocs is making the struggle much harder.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the government should draw wider lessons from the chaosWed 16 Apr 2025 13.25 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareIn the 1890s, a visiting American journalist described Birmingham as “thebest-governed cityin the world”. Inspired by the reforming spirit of its one-time mayor Joseph Chamberlain, England’s second city had become a showcase for a new kind of municipal government. Introducing better schools, libraries, parks and public baths, politicians were taking proactive responsibility for the health and welfare of the local population.Preachers of what was then known as the “civic gospel” are thin on the ground these days. Birmingham is currently a byword for political dysfunction, symbolised by the unhealthy piles of bin bags disfiguring its streets since an indefiniterefuse workers’ strikebegan last month. Despite pressure from the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, who sat down with Unite representatives last weekend, the union and Birmingham’s Labour-run city council have now been in full-blown confrontation for close to six weeks. The impact has been particularly gruesome inpoorerareas, where residents cannot afford the costs of commercial waste clearance.Desperate to finally score some political points after months of lacklustre leadership by Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative party and right-leaning media have been making a drama out of a crisis. Visiting Handsworth, Mrs Badenoch’s cabinet colleague/rival Robert Jenrickportrayedthe mounting rubbish as symptomatic of a national malaise. GB News haslauncheda campaign to “Stop trashing Britain”. The reality is somewhat less apocalyptic, and far more specific to a city that has endured a perfect storm of maladministration.The proximate cause of the strike is an attempt by councillors to cut bin service costs by reducing the number of workers and – in some cases – their pay rates. But theoriginsof the mess go back to the disastrously expensive failure of a new software system introduced by the council, and a landmark equal pay settlement which left it liable for payouts totalling hundreds of millions of pounds. Having declared effectivebankruptcyin 2023, councillors have substantially hiked council tax while cutting services to the bone.The 1.1 million or so residents in the United Kingdom’s largest unitary authority are thus receiving the rawest of raw deals. The government hasurgedUnite to accept the latest council offer aimed at ending the dispute, which includes a commitment to redeployment and a voluntary redundancy scheme. But modestly paid key workers should not be asked to pay the price for a fiscal crisis not of their making. Unite’s proposal that the city council’s huge debt should be restructured – allowing at least a softer version of austerity going forward – would offer a better solution if Westminster were willing to listen.More broadly, although Birmingham’s predicament is in part sui generis, Labour would be wise to draw some wider lessons. Across England, savage Conservativecutsduring the 2010s left local government underresourced and cruelly overstretched. Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget provided very limited temporary relief, but the Local Government Association haspredictedan £8.4bn funding gap by 2028‑29. Birmingham’s tipping point arrived in 2023. Without a realistic national funding settlement for the medium term, the dismal scenes playing out on its streets this spring may be repeated elsewhere. After positioning itself as a government committed above all to “delivery”, Labour cannot afford to let that happen.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is not as simple as a lack of cash coming into schools, however (though this is a significant contributing factor).A cursory look at the published accounts of the many multi‑academy trusts (Mats), which now control at least 80% of state secondary schools inEngland, shows an explosion in chief executive pay, with many new ancillary roles – chief finance officers, executive headteachers and trust performance directors – also adding to “central services” bills. Many of these roles didn’t exist a decade ago, yet they leach millions of pounds each year out of the classroom and into the bank balances of the disproportionately white, middle‑class men who fill them.Take my home town of York as an example: where once the63 state schoolswere maintained by a director of children’s services on circa £110,000 and an assistant director of education on circa £80,000, we now have six Mats whose focus is increasingly drawn outside the city boundaries. Together they now employ six CEOs on salaries ranging from at least £130,000 to more than £160,000, six CFOs and several executive heads, and sport a combined wage bill for “key management personnel” that exceeds £7m – money the former education authority could only dream of. Meanwhile, more than a third of the city’s schools remain under the local authority.With school attendance tanking, young people’s wellbeing in the doldrums and a special education needs system in crisis, public money that should be going into the classroom is instead going on duplicated roles and high individual salaries. This, and the lack of any meaningful local accountability, is the real scandal that needs addressing if we are to resolve the financial perils of an education sector that is no longer fit for purpose.Cllr Jonny CrawshawLabour,City of York councilHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But this knowledge is not new. After the horrors of the rise of the Nazis and the persecution by them of Jews and other minority groups before and during the second world war, psychologists, many of them Jewish, began to systematically study the origins of such hatred. One wasHenri Tajfel, a Jew born in Poland whose family were murdered by the Nazis.Tajfel was primarily interested in group identity, and popularised the terms in-group and out-group. Most importantly for understanding our times, Tajfel’s work helped to show that not only do we work for, and experience reward through, the in-group’s success (familiar to supporters of any football club), but, more sinisterly, we will work for, and experience reward through, the detriment of the out-group, even if that also means the in-group suffers, so long as it is to a lesser extent.This, I think, is the psychology that underpins the rise of hard-right populism across the world. It behoves those of us who wish to counter it to better understand the psychology that drives it.Barry GreatorexDerbyGeorge Monbiot is correct to highlight the corrosive nature of inequality and how it is undermining democracy and fuelling the rise of the populist right. However, he overlooks two important aspects.First, he concentrates on income inequality and disparities between rich and poor – yet inequality is a more complex phenomenon. In reality, there are many intersecting inequalities: gender, health, disability and ethnicity are critical in determining wellbeing. Second, surprisingly, he does not mention the causal links between inequality and crises of nature and climate. Without addressing inequality, we cannot find effective, sustainable and just solutions to these crises.As Monbiot points out, the current political regime is not tackling inequality systemically or from its roots. Many of its actions exacerbate the problem. Fortunately, a new political party, theEquality Party, whichopened for membership this year, aims to confront this rising inequality. Its vision is a more inclusive, equitable society with diverse voices in decision-making at all levels.Katrina BrownExeterThe juxtaposition of George Monbiot and Polly Toynbee on the same day (Labour has done right by British Steel – now it must speed up a radical strategy for all industry, 13 April) made grim but convincing reading. Arecent speechby Bernie Sanders in the US chimes in with a list of the issues that are apparently too painful for centrist politicians to mention. He makes it clear that this is because politics has been poisoned by big money.In this country, theLabourgovernment’s strategy has been doomed from the start by assuming that redistribution is unthinkable, so growth is the only way forward. This fails for two reasons: growth isn’t happening, but also any proceeds of growth are hoovered up by the very rich, leaving the rest of us (as Monbiot explains) on the outside looking in. The consequent rise in support for far-right leaders seems inevitable, and Labour seems headed for defeat at the next election if it does not change course.Jeremy CushingWiveliscombe, SomersetDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

He also revealed that he called Pep Guardiola on the morning of the game to thank him for being an inspiration as a player and a coach and giving him the opportunity that led to him coaching here for the first time.Saka and Martinelli fire Arsenal to last four after famous win at Real MadridRead moreAsked if he had ever felt prouder of his players, Arteta replied: “Probably not, not only because we’re in the semi-final but the manner we did it. Because of the circumstances, the amount of injuries. It shows the character of this team, this club. This is another massive step for us.”Arteta admitted it only took a couple of minutes for him to realise that this was a stadium where anything could happen, but his players had shown the maturity to manage the difficult moments and find a way past Madrid. None more so than when Saka missed a first-half penalty.“It could have been a turning point emotionally in the game but the way he handles it, the personality, at his age playing in this stadium for the first time was incredible,” Arteta said. “I could have given him a clip round the ear. But he decided what is best: he had the courage to take it, that’s what he thought was best. I was more concerned about the emotional part of it [than the miss itself]. Then with the penalty [for Madrid] that they ruled out. I felt then that the game might be going somewhere we didn’t want.“You come here and see it live and you realise how difficult it is here, how anything can happen. They can drive you into scenarios that are very difficult. But we have done it and we did it in a very clever way. We were very clear.

The grand old venue had been buffeted by wind and water all ­evening but here was the fire: Inter’s players wheeled over towards their faithful, the stands bouncing to the tune of another legend in the making.European football will miss this stadium achingly whenever it is finally put out to pasture; here it hosted another cocktail of gravitas and exuberance, tense to the last before bursting at the seams, and goodness knows what awaits when Barcelona arrive in the semi-finals three weeks from now.Saka and Martinelli fire Arsenal to last four after famous win at Real MadridRead moreNobody should sleep on Inter as a credible contender to go all the way. They rode their luck during periods of this tie but, at every moment of doubt, found an intervention that bent things in their direction. That kind of quality is usually deemed intangible but Lautaro Martínez, yet to calm down while pandemonium reigned around him, had his own attempt at defining it. “Inter has two balls like that,” he said. “It was an epic match. Inter does not die, Inter has ­personality, heart and brains. Inter is made for great things.”Martínez could thump out the bombast because he had put Inter back on track after Harry Kane, down on his haunches while the home side partied, had levelled the tie. Like his team, Martínez had worked busily for almost an hour without posing much direct threat. He vaulted the advertising hoardings after lashing in a loose ball, presented to him when his header struck Joshua Kimmich, and Inter could spy a way out of their awkward spot.Soon afterwards Benjamin Pavard, powering in Hakan Calhanoglu’s corner for his first goal since joining Inter from Bayern in 2023, doubled their cushion and brought the house down. It said plenty for Bayern that they could nonetheless have forced extra time, Eric Dier looping a header beyond Yann Sommer and bringing about that frenzied finale. “There was a lot that felt right today,” Vincent Kompany said, but the lasting emotion for his side was regret.“It’s a hard reality that we’re not going to play theChampions Leaguefinal at home,” Kompany added. An injury-hit Bayern had wasted chances at the Allianz Arena last week, Kane the most glaring offender, and shaded things on that metric this time too.Thomas Müller, who had equalised in the first meeting, was recalled to the starting lineup as captain and a greater sense of clarity resulted. His link-ups with Michael Olise carved through Inter three times in the first 11 minutes, the most notable opening seeing Alessandro Bastoni deny the London-born forward with a goal-saving tackle.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane scores Bayern Munich’s opening goal with Federico Dimarco of Inter (right) failing to block his shot.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APBefore half-time Müller would see a shot blocked and, just after Kane had punished a backing-off Federico Dimarco with a laser-like finish across Sommer, he spooned over from a fine position on the left of the box. This was an appearance that put him joint third in this competition’s all-time rankings, alongside Lionel Messi, but he will leave Bayern at the season’s end and may not grace this stage again. A degree of their old dead-eyed inevitability will depart with him.He would rue the fact Martínez, showcasing the anatomical qualities he evidently prizes, converted almost immediately after that miss. Pavard picked his moment three minutes after and the sequence summed up Inter’s endeavours over the piece. They did not flow for long periods in either match but moments of devastating emphasis and explosion never feel far away. Simone Inzaghi must have envisaged those coming from counterattacks but both goals came from left-sided set-pieces that Bayern did not handle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nor did they help Henrikh Mkhitaryan when, after a marvellous piece of first-half skill, the ball eventually took a bizarre flight back towards Inter’s half. But they were not the ones who would be harmed if the elements disrupted play and ultimately, for all Bayern’s probing, they could claim to have performed the basics better.Kane hooked over in added time, the angle awkward but the goal beckoning, and will wonder if club football’s biggest prize is destined to slip away. He and Kompany thought Inter had over-celebrated their dramatic victory eight days before but no such complaints would have been credible while the festivities raged this time. “We’re not putting limits on ourselves,” Pavard said.

Given his electric impact on proceedings it was appropriate that Murphy scored it.When Kieran Trippier cued up the winger near the right corner flag, everyone expected Murphy to cross or cut back but, instead, he whipped a high-velocity shot into the top corner. Maybe it is his way of answering back after reading the incessant stream of reports insisting that Howe’s summer transfer market priority is a new “upgraded” right‑winger. On this evidence any replacement will need to be red hot. In his past 18 games, Murphy has clocked up eight goals and nine assists.Newcastle spent much of last summer trying, and failing, to sign Marc Guéhi from Palace. Here Glasner’s captain and key central defender endured a night to forget, shaking his head as Murphy’s goal deceived him.How Guéhi could have done with Eberechi Eze equalising from the penalty spot. That kick was awarded – following a lengthy VAR review – when Nick Pope rather carelessly caught Chris Richards as they challenged for a Palace free‑kick.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

First he directed a cross towards Isak and watched in satisfaction as the ball deflected off Guéhi and looped over Henderson.Having warmed up, Barnes then collected Tonali’s pass, removed Maxence Lacroix from Glasner’s defensive equation courtesy of a smart stepover and, rather than cut in on his right foot, lashed an angled left-foot shot into the bottom corner.Fabian Schär headed in Newcastle’s fourth after Trippier tapped a free‑kick to Murphy whose expertly curved cross created yet another goal. What price impending England call‑ups for Murphy and Barnes?Isak had been having a bit of an off night by his lofty standards, missing a few chances, but he curled a superlative fifth -– Newcastle’s ninth goal in two games -– past Henderson from 20 yards. The blur of perfectly synchronised movement as the Swede shot first time after seizing on the fall out from Joelinton’s tackle on Lacroix emphasised precisely why he is valued at £150m.Glasner had no complaints. “Credit to a very, very good Newcastle side,” he said. “We couldn’t compete with them. We couldn’t deal with their intensity, directness and pace. Nothing worked; we just have to throw this one in the bin.”Newcastle v Crystal Palace: Premier League – liveRead moreExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian contacted Johnson for a response.Other club personnel have reported allegations of misconduct to the FA, which is understood to be working with the club to try to help them resolve the situation.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Johnson’s relegation request is highly unlikely to be successful because it is understood the FA considers such requests only if they are submitted by a club with supporting evidence from their board or committee members, rather than by an individual, and it is understood that Johnson – one of two directors who co‑own the parent company of Hull City Ladies with an equal 50% stake – acted alone.Hull City Ladies – who are not affiliated with the men’s Championship team Hull City – are ninth in the Northern Premier Division, 14 points clear of the relegation zone and safe from the drop, with one game remaining.The players are also unhappy that they do not have medical insurance at the club and the Guardian has been told the club does not employ a strength and conditioning coach. Eight of the team’s players are said to have sustained serious knee injuries in the past 18 months. One Hull player, Hope Knight, wrote on Facebook: “That’s not a coincidence. That’s what happens when footballers are treated like an afterthought – when ambition is replaced by greed.”Others wishing to remain anonymous have alleged to the Guardian that Johnson “hopes the club will have to close down”, describing his request for relegation as an act of “deliberate self-harm” towards the club to try to punish the players. Knight also wrote in her Facebook post: “We can’t stay silent any longer. This is our reality, and it’s time people knew. As players and staff, we’ve seen it with our own eyes – we’ve been lied to, manipulated and bullied.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Erdelatz was the United States Navy’s head football coach and his side had just drawn 0-0 against Duke University. “No one asked the mild spoken navy coach to explain,” the report adds. Well, quite. But sister or not, everyone knew what he meant.Erdelatz’s unique take on the merits or otherwise of not winning are ingrained in American sports where a Lombardian win-at-all-costs mentality prevails. Try explaining Test cricket to an American sports fan, they say, with a wry chuckle – the fact that two teams can battle it out for five full days and in the end, there is not necessarily a winner. Good luck, they smirk. Adelaide 1961? You may as well be describing the plot of Christopher Nolan’s Memento to a toddler. Old Trafford 2005? More chance of a cider-addled bee getting to grips with quantum theory. They do not get it, be gone with your quaint English ways, five days and no winner. That’s crazy, man.County cricket talking points: the Division One table is full of surprisesRead moreYet draws are intrinsic to Test cricket, they are written in its DNA – a double helix in the shape of a deadlock. Draws speak to its beguiling and maddening qualities, a testament to the game’s downright peculiarity. That a side can battle back from a point of seemingly no return to pull off the heist of shared spoils, drop anchor, defy logic, battle against their opponents’ desire, their own self-belief, against conditions under their feet and above their heads, against time itself. This makes the game what it is, why it is called what it is called. Even when you are on top, it is still really hard to finish a side off and win a Test match.In Test cricket’s nigh-on 150-year history of more than 2,500 matches, a third have ended in draws. Now, there are good draws and bad draws, or more precisely, boring draws and exciting draws. Unfortunately, the former are much more prevalent.“In the first 2,573 Test matches, from 1877 to 2025, just 84 were won by a margin of fewer than 30 runs, or three wickets or fewer: 3%, or barely a Test every two years.” Tim Wigmore’s new book Test Cricket: a History charts a narrative history of the longest format with contributions from the game’s biggest characters. It is a riveting and lovingly researched tome thrumming with detail, anecdote and incisive facts such as the one above. As Wigmore says, an exciting draw in a Test match is all well and good, but it turns out those thrilling stalemates that live long in the memory are rarer than a platinum filling on a poultry farm.View image in fullscreenEngland and New Zealand players shake hands on the draw on day five of the first Test at Lord’s in June 2021.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAnyone who has watched an interminable draw play out will know that they come with their own particular kind of soul-sapping non-energy. Ever played in a match where a side signpost they are settling for a draw from the early stages? The worst. Long hours grazing in the field often come with a side portion of existential rumination at the best of times but spending half your weekend watching a middle-aged marketing manager block as if they have a Glock to the temple with the sun barely past the yard arm is enough to make anyone ponder the futility of life, never mind put them off the game for good.Ben Stokes clearly feels the same. He hates draws. His Test side have succumbed to one in his 32-match tenure and that was thewashed-out Ashes Test at Old Traffordin 2023. The England Test captain’s win-or-bust mantra is born out of a belief that there is nothing to fear in failure and therefore no need to even entertain playing for a draw.There is a twisted logic to this approach, it is one that has allowed Stokes’s side to pull off some incredible victories from seemingly impossible positions. It has also meant they have capitulated to some of the heaviest and most embarrassing defeats in England’s history. Last year’s thumpinglosses to India in RajkotandNew Zealand in Hamilton, here’s wincing at you.“We’re in the entertainment business, no more draws,” Joe Root chirped to Nathan Lyon before the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston in 2023. Lyon parroted the line back to his teammates in the Australia dressing room moments later to a mixture of mocking headshakes and shrugs. England’s desire to entertain tipped too far in that Test,Stokes’s day one declarationwith England on 393 for eight with Root playing in princely fashion came back to bite them on day five when half an hour more of runs Root could have led to England winning the first Test or at the very least not lose it. In a five-match series these things tend to count.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Are England’s fans more entertained by a loss, albeit played in a rousing fashion, or would they prefer to see their side grind and guts out a draw once the opportunity to win has subsided?England have adapted since those wild-eyed early days of Bazball, but there is room for further nuance still. England win a lot under Stokes, but they lose plenty too. Nineteen plays 12 at last count. If they find themselves with their backs against the wall against India or Australia, are they willing to knuckle down and spend two days saving a match rather than going down in a ball of flames? Which is the braver option? The most entertaining watch? Which, crucially, would the fans prefer? I think we know the answer to all of those questions.A draw or two in the next two series could well go a long way to determining the overarching success or failure of the Bazball project. Time, then, for Stokes to rethink when it comes to the draw and embrace the grey in an increasingly black and white world.

Eight years afterlosing against Sergio García at Augusta National, Rose was beaten on the first extra holeby Rory McIlroy, who holed from short range for birdie after Rose’s attempt had narrowly missed.Rose had started the final round seven shots behind McIlroy, but made his 10th birdie of the day on the 18th in a closing 66 to set the clubhouse target, with McIlroy then missing from five feet for the title in regulation.Grace of Masters nearly man Justin Rose enhanced McIlroy’s historic win | Andy BullRead more“Mixed emotions for sure,” Rose, who also finishedsecond behind Jordan Spiethin 2015 and was runner-up in the Open Championshipat Royal Troon last year, said of his reflections on the Masters in a press conference ahead of the RBC Heritage.“A lot of outpouring from people with a lot of positive comments coming at me so trying to absorb that and absorb the week, but the same time looking at my phone and wishing there was a different message there.“Having been in that situation before and even more this time, I could really sense what it would be like to win it. I was right there on the edge of winning it obviously.“I certainly don’t feel down in any way, shape or form because of the performance I was able to put in and how I was able to feel putting in that performance, but just sort of ... don’t know what the right word is, tormented probably by the thought of what might have been.“I take that loss pretty badly. But listen, I was a stone’s throw away from winning the Open, winning the Masters. I would have been going for a grand slam at the PGA. It’s like, it can be that close. I’ve got to believe that.

He travelled smoothly for Kieran Shoemark towards the near side before a sharp turn of foot carried him into the lead with just under a furlong to run, and Field Of Gold then extended his advantage to three-and-a-half lengths at the post.It was a second success in a major 2,000 Guineas trial in the space of five days for the Juddmonte bloodstock operation, as Andrew Balding’s Jonquil, who was with the now‑retired Sir Michael Stoute as a two-year-old, took the Greenham Stakes at Newbury on Saturday.“This is a trial, it’s not the Guineas and you’re not fully wound up for this,” saidJohn Gosden, who has won every British Classic bar the 2,000 Guineas. “The race puts them where you want them, that’s the idea of the trials.

Urgent action is needed both to inform people on how to cope with high temperatures and to adapt homes, which are largely designed to keep heat in during the winter, the researchers said.The study also found that the use of air conditioning soared sevenfold to 21% of homes between 2011 and 2022. The researchers warned that continuation of this trend could putstrain on the national electricity grid, increase carbon emissions and fuel social disadvantage among families unable to afford air conditioning.The research was prompted by extreme heatwaves in 2022, when temperatures in the UK rose above40C for the first time. The past two years have been thehottest on record globally, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, which showsno sign of slowing down. More than 10,000 people have died as a result of summer heatwaves from 2020 to 2024, data from the UK Health Security Agency shows.The huge rise in overheated homes and air conditioner use was “a shocking result”, said Dr Mehri Khosravi, at the University of East London, who led the study: “Over the heatwaves experienced in 2022 we had nearly 4,500 dead, but this excess mortality is hidden.” Many heatwave deaths are due to heart attacks, strokes, and respiratory and kidney problems, exacerbated by high temperatures.“British people are not familiar with heat and often don’t see heat as a risk – most consider it as something nice, for socialising, going out, going to the beach” said Khosravi. “Staying inside, drinking less alcohol, and not being on the beach [can help cope with extreme heat]. But these are cultural things we are not familiar with.”Bob Ward, the chair of the London Climate Ready Partnership, said: “This study highlights the extent of the risks caused by overheating of buildings in the UK, which kills hundreds of vulnerable people every year and costs the economy millions of pounds in lost productivity.”“Successive governments have failed to treat this issue with the seriousness it needs and we now face a crisis,” he said. The UK’s climate adaptation plan, published in 2023 under the previous Conservative government, wascondemned as “very weak” on dealing with rising heatwaves.The study was published in the journalEnergy Research & Social Science. It asked almost 1,600 households whether they had experienced uncomfortable warmth in one or more rooms during the summer of 2022, the same question thathad been asked in 2011.It found the rate of overheating reported leaped from 18% to 80% in 2022. More than a third of households said their homes had overheated daily and a further 19% said this happened five or six days a week.Half of people reported experiencing poor sleep because of heat, while a quarter said they suffered frequent headaches, fatigue and had to work less. Half also said they had little to no knowledge of how to cope with extreme heat, with another study finding that athird of peoplestill do not consider heatwaves an immediate risk. Most people in the survey tried to cool themselves in some way, with lighter clothes, cold drinks and cool showers among the most common actions.Similar high levels of overheating were reported from all types of home, from flats to detached houses. However, homes built after 1900 were twice as likely to report overheating, as were those with the highest energy efficiency ratings, EPC bands A and B. Modern buildings focus on airtightness and insulation to cut heat loss in winter, said Khosravi, which can worsen overheating without good ventilation.However, she said: “Research shows that adapting building design is not enough – we also need to adapt people’s behaviour. A simple example is that in the UK, when the weather gets hot, the first thing many do is open the windows. But that only invites more heat to our houses.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Lower income households were more than twice as likely to report overheating than high-income ones, probably because renters cannot make changes to their homes and air conditioning is costly.Building design regulations were updated in 2021 to consider passive cooling options, such as shading and window shutters. But this applies only to newly built homes and no research has been done to see if the changes have had any effect.“Many policymakers don’t even believe that overheating risk exists,” Khosravi said. “One said to me: ‘We only have one month of summer. Why do we need to focus on that, when we have 11 months of cold weather?’” The UK had one of thehighest rates of heat-related deathsin Europe in 2022.Communication with the UK public about overheating is inadequate, she said. “The only warning system is based on colour but it doesn’t explain what red, amber, yellow warming means, or what people need to do.” Khosravi now aims to research how to improve such communication.Ward said: “The government should carry out an urgent retrofit programme to improve ventilation and passive cooling in homes, so that we do not become dependent on expensive air conditioning. This should be targeted at those people who are most vulnerable and whose homes are most likely to overheat in London and south-east England, which tends to experience the hottest temperatures.”Explore more on these topicsExtreme heatClimate crisisHousingHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

But an “urgent and radical reform” of the sector is needed, the charity said, as previous promises under the last round of funding were broken.Nearly 4m hours of raw sewage dumped in England’s waters last yearRead moreThe report also reveals that despite failings to reduce pollution and new regulations intended to reduce profit for executives who preside over sewage spills, shareholders were paid £1.2bn in 2023-24 despite the record number of hours raw sewage was discharged into England’s waters.Giles Bristow, the chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, said: “The numbers are staggering: record hours of sewage discharges, huge bill increases, thousands of people becoming ill and yet still the industry has the gall to still pay out billions of bill-payer money to shareholders. Things could not be clearer: this broken system needs urgent and radical reform.“We can change things if we change the way our system is run. Across the globe, the norm is to manage water at a local level, rather than the 100% private ownership model in place in England that has proved catastrophic for the environment and public health.”The charity runs a sickness monitoring scheme so people can report suspected illness from coming into contact with contaminated water. Swimmers are at risk from bacteria includingEcoliif the water they swim in has recently been subject to a sewage spill.In 2024 alone, Surfers Against Sewage received 1,853 sickness reports through its app – an average of five people getting sick per day after using the water. Of those, 331 had to see a doctor, and 79% of them reported that their doctor had attributed their illness to sewage pollution. There were hundreds of cases of gastroenteritis and chest infections, as well as serious bacterial infections and hospital admissions.In September 2023, 28-year-old Charlie Clarke swam at Clevedon marine lake near Bristol while training for an Ironman race. The next day he collapsed while jogging and was taken to hospital for ECGs and blood tests. Over the following four months, multiple tests concluded that a virus caught while swimming had lowered his blood pressure and caused a minor heart problem.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

My everyday life was impacted, as I was unable to raise my heart rate whilst in recovery. Everyday tasks became a barrier to a normal life – for example, commuting by bike was no longer an option.“My main social outlet is sport, which was put on hold for several months. This impacted my confidence further and left me particularly isolated from football and cycling teams. It took me around a year to become confident enough to raise my heart rate to its maximum.”A spokesperson for the industry body Water UK said: “No sewage spill is ever acceptable and water companies are investing £12bn to almost halve spills from storm overflows by 2030. This is part of the largest amount of money ever spent on the natural environment to help support economic growth, build more homes, secure our water supplies and end sewage entering our rivers and seas.”An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “This level of pollution is unacceptable and we are taking a number of steps to hold water companies to account if they pollute our rivers and waterways. It is now a statutory requirement for water companies to produce annual plans showing how they will meet our expectation of reducing pollution incidents by 40%.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentEnvironment AgencyEnglandWater industryPollutionUtilitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

This leads to reduced population sizes and death. Even low metal levels in nectar can hinder bees’ learning and memory, which degrades their foraging abilities.The contaminated soils tend to be on land previously used for buildings and factories, which have leached these pollutants into the land. The scientists who carried out the study are now recommending that urban areas are tested for contaminants and potentially cleaned before wildflowers are planted.Scientists hoping to target queen bees in search of secret to longer lifeRead moreThe study, published in Ecology and Evolution, was carried out in the post-industrial US city of Cleveland, Ohio, which has more than 33,700 vacant lots left as people have moved away from the area. It was once a hub for iron and steel production, as well as oil refining and car manufacturing. These are all industries that potentially contaminate land with trace metals.The researchers extracted and tested nectar from a range of self-seeded flowering plants that are popular with pollinators, and were found growing across the city. Lead was consistently found at the highest concentrations, but different species of plant accumulated different amounts and types of metals.The bright blue-flowered chicory plant (Cichorium intybus) accumulated the largest total metal concentration, followed by white clover (Trifolium repens), wild carrot (Daucus carota) and bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis).Cities worldwide face metal contamination in soils, and the level of contamination usually increases with the age of the city. Sources include cement dust and mining.But people should not be discouraged from planting wildflowers for bees, the report authors said.Dr Sarah Scott, from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Zoology and first author of the report, said: “It’s really important to have wildflowers as a food source for the bees, and our results should not discourage people from planting wildflowers in towns and cities.“We hope this study will raise awareness that soil health is also important for bee health. Before planting wildflowers in urban areas to attract bees and other pollinators, it’s important to consider the history of the land and what might be in the soil – and if necessary find out whether there’s a local soil testing and cleanup service available first.”Explore more on these topicsBeesWild flowersPollutionWildlifeInsectsnewsShareReuse this content"

Prosper surveilled St Joseph’s, taking images of staff and students from the school’s website and noting times of lessons and assembly.The day before the murders, he bought a shotgun from an online seller for £650 after he “made a high-quality forgery of a shotgun certificate or licence”.He had planned to murder his family while they slept on Friday 13 September, and then leave the home at about 8.30am to travel to St Joseph’s to carry out the attack. However, his plans were disrupted when his family realised that something was wrong. After they challenged him, there was a violent struggle.Explore more on these topicsCourt of appealLutonConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

The government need to lower our retirement age,” said Fairhurst, who said the attack had highlighted how dangerous the job of prison staff is.He said staff at the prison “are traumatised, they are fragile and they were angry” over what he described as the “appeasement” of very violent offenders.He said while strike action is banned for prison officers, there is health and safety legislation that could be considered.Three officers were attacked while one suffered third-degree burns during the sustained attack on Saturday, in which an assailant used a makeshift sharp weapon fashioned out of metal, as well as cooking fat.Martin Hibbert, one of the survivors of the Manchester Arena bombing, used an open letter on Tuesday to describe the attackas a “catastrophic failure” of dutyby the justice secretary.Hibbert said he was “absolutely disgusted – beyond words” to hear about the attack, adding in the letter that wasposted on social media: “Let’s call this what it is: a catastrophic failure of your duty to protect prison staff and the public from an unrepentant terrorist.”Lord Timpson, the minister for prisons, probation and reducing reoffending, said the government would set out the terms and scope of the review in the coming days.“Like everyone, I was appalled by the attack at the weekend and this morning I visited HMP Frankland to thank our hard-working staff.“This government will do everything it can to protect those working in our prisons. As an immediate response we have suspended the use of kitchens for prisoners held in separation and close supervision centres.“We have also launched an independent review into how this attack was able to happen.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationManchester Arena attacknewsShareReuse this content"

Our team of experts checked the tree in December 2024 and found it was healthy and posed no risk to the neighbouring car park and its users,” he said.“As the tree shows clear signs of life, we will also do everything we can to help the tree regrow.”The council had reported Toby Carvery to the Metropolitan police, but officers decided to take no further action as there was no preservation order on the tree. On Tuesday the police closed their investigation after deciding it was a civil matter.UK government report calls for taskforce to save England’s historic treesRead moreErbil said: “The police are treating it as a civil matter, but we will continue to take appropriate legal action.”He added: “As the landowner, we believe this action has broken the terms of the lease which requires Toby Carvery to maintain and protect the existing landscape. The tree was the oldest one on site and cutting it down seems to be a clear breach of this condition.”“We’re therefore seeking advice and will take appropriate legal action. If any criminal activity is found during our investigation, we will not hesitate to report this to the police again.”Erbil said he was “outraged” that Toby Carvery had “cut down this beautiful ancient oak tree without seeking any permissions or advice from Enfield council”.He said: “This tree would have been home to countless wildlife, fungi and pollinators. This tree is a part of our ecological and cultural heritage.”The Woodland Trust said the oak in Whitewebbs Park was an important habitat, supporting hundreds of species including endangered deadwood beetles.Ed Pyne, the Woodland Trust’s senior conservation adviser for trees, said: “This is the most shocking fell I think I’ve ever seen in more than a decade working with ancient trees. In my view, and the view of many others, this is ecologically much more significant than the Sycamore Gap – and certainly a more irreplaceable tree.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They simply can’t be replaced by younger trees and can’t be replaced quickly.”He added: “Some of the biodiversity associated with ancient trees, like the Whitewebbs oak, is among the most threatened in Europe.”Ed Allnut, an Enfield resident and the secretary of the Guardians of Whitewebbs group, said local people wanted justice for the old oak.He said: “The tree belonged to Enfield and to our national heritage. I am personally devastated. We want answers, and we want guarantees the other trees here are being protected properly.”M&BR has been approached for comment.It is understood M&BR plans to conduct a review of the incident to determine whether felling the tree was right or wrong. Its chief executive, Phil Urban, also plans to respond to all those who have complained to him about the destruction of the tree.A source close to the company says Urban will apologise for the distress caused but not the action taken.Explore more on these topicsTrees and forestsLondonConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes after the consumer prices indexfell in February to 2.8%, down from 3% in January.TheOffice for National Statistics(ONS) said falling fuel prices and slowing increases in the cost of a night out drove inflation lower, although this was offset by price rises for clothing and footwear. The price of food was also a factor in dragging down prices growth after it was flat in March compared with rising prices in the same month last year.The average price of petrol fell by 1.6p a litre between February and March 2025 to stand at 137.5p a litre, down from 144.8p a litre in March 2024, the ONS said.Trump’s tariff announcements this month – in which huge levies were imposed on US imports before market turmoil sparked anabrupt U-turn– have clouded the picture for inflation, with the turmoil widely expected to dampen growth.Inflation graphicRuth Gregory, the deputy chief economist at the consultancy CapitalEconomics, said inflation was likely to hit 3% in April due to a 6.4% month-on-month rise in utility bills and 26% month-on-month leap in water bills.She estimated that the peak inflation rate this year would be 3.5%, “but we doubt it will stay there long. We expect the weak economy to prompt an easing in domestic inflation.”Before Trump’s tariff announcements several analysts had predicted that inflation would start rising from April onwards, peaking at about 4% over the summer before falling back next year.However, the US president’s trade war has cast doubt on those forecasts for CPI, which could peak at a lower rate if China is allowed to dump goods in Europe that were previously destined for the US.Gregory said her forecasts were in doubt as Trump’s tariffs begin to harm the global economy and drag down prices across the world. It was possible that inflation would peak at a much lower rate, though the outlook remained uncertain.With inflation remaining about the Bank of England’s 2% target, financial markets are betting on an 86% probability of an interest rate cut at its 8 May meeting, which would lower the key base rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Earnings, excluding bonuses, rose to 5.9%, from a revised 5.8% in the previous rolling three-month period to the end of January, figures showed on Tuesday. This was slightly below a prediction of 6% from City economists.Jobs figures showed a weakening labour market as employment in March fell and firms cut back on job adverts.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: “Inflation falling for two months in a row, wages growing faster than prices and positive growth figures are encouraging signs that our plan for change is working, but there is more to be done.“I know many families are still struggling with the cost of living and this is an anxious time because of a changing world. That is why the government has boosted pay for 3 million people by increasing the minimum wage, frozen fuel duty and begun rolling out free breakfast clubs in primary schools.”The shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, said inflation was expected to increase further this year “because of the chancellor’s choices”.He said: “The Conservatives left Labour with inflation bang on target but the chancellor’s reckless union payouts, tax hikes, and borrowing binge is driving up the cost of living.“Be in no doubt, the chancellor’s choices are keeping inflation higher for longer and working families are paying the price.”Explore more on these topicsInflationEconomicsBank of EnglandInterest ratesOffice for National StatisticsnewsShareReuse this content"

After a hearing in April 2024, five justices at the UK’s highest court ruled on Wednesday that the clinicians could be named.Isaiah suffered “catastrophic” brain damage after being deprived of oxygen at birth following an emergency caesarean. Zainab was born with a rare and “profoundly disabling” neurodegenerative condition.The court of appeal heard that Abbasi and his wife wished to “tell their story”, to speak publicly about their experiences and to identify NHS staff while so doing.Speaking outside the supreme court after the ruling, Abbasi said: “Now, after six years of fighting in courts, we are finally allowed to tell our story.”Haastrup said doctors were “definitely overly protected”, adding: “Justice delayed is better than injustice. It’s a great feeling that Isiah’s life is not in vain.”The court declined an application from the trusts to continue the injunction for a further 21 days. It did not rule on how and when the naming should happen.It found that injunctions stopping doctors being identified should be of limited duration.Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals NHS foundation trust said it had sought to act in the best interests of patients while protecting the rights of its staff “to go about their professional duties and private lives without the potential threat of abuse or harassment”.It said it would “take some time to consider the judgment” and that it continued to “extend its condolences to Zainab’s family”.A spokesperson for King’s College hospital NHS foundation trust said: “We accept the ruling of the supreme court and we will continue to support our staff through this change. We remain sincerely sorry for the events surrounding Isaiah’s birth.”Dr Ben White, a deputy medical director at Medical Protection Society (MPS), said the decisions that doctors must make in paediatric end-of-life care “can be extremely difficult and the loss of a patient is devastating for all involved”.He added: “It is hard to see who benefits from publicly naming the individual clinicians involved in such decisions.” Doctors must protect patient confidentiality, making it “difficult for them to respond to questions or defend themselves against criticism”, he said.PA news agency contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDoctorsNHSLondonNewcastleEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Reynolds accused Jingye of not acting in good faith after itthreatened to shut down British Steel’s furnaces at Scunthorpewithin days, with the loss of 2,700 jobs.The government stepped in on Saturday to avoid the shutdowns withemergency legislationto take control of British Steel.UK government refuses to rule out redundancies at Scunthorpe steelworksRead moreIn its first public comments since the government stepped in, Jingye said on Wednesday that it “request[s] that the UK government respect and protect the legitimate rights and interests of Jingye as a foreign investor throughout this process”.In a statement provided to the Financial Times, Jingye said it would “seek a proper solution that ensures a bright future for British Steel”, and added that it had previously safeguarded jobs and made investments in the plant.The dispute over the future of the Scunthorpe furnaces has threatened to worsen the UK’s already troubled relationship with China, even as theLabourgovernment seeks to boost inward investment.China’s embassy said politicians objecting to the country’s involvement in the UK steel sector “took the opportunity to attack all Chinese companies and the Chinese government”, after awarning by the country’s foreign ministryearlier on Monday against “politicising” the situation.In an unusual question-and-answer format, the embassy wrote: “The anti-China rhetoric of some individual British politicians is extremely absurd, reflecting their arrogance, ignorance and twisted mindset.”Jingye was approached by the Conservative government in 2019 to take over British Steel after its previous owner, the private equity firm Greybull Capital, walked away. British Steel haslost more than £350msince then. Jingye said last month it would close the blast furnaces, and it turned down an offer of £500m in UK government support to switch from the polluting blast furnaces to cleaner electric arc furnaces.Reynolds said the UK had “got it wrong in the past” about allowing Chinese investment in strategically important industries such as steel, and highlighted the influence of the Chinese government on private companies. “I wouldn’t personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector,” he said on Sunday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves,visited China in Januaryto try to drum up investment, andReynolds is due to visit the countrylater this year, despite his criticisms.The embassy credited Jingye with saving workers’ jobs in 2020 and said it was “a normal decision” by the company to close the blast furnaces, adding that the dispute could hit Chinese investment in the UK. It contrasted the treatment of China with the alleged lack of criticism of Donald Trump’s tariffs. The embassy wrote: “What on earth are they up to?”“Any words or deeds that politicise or maliciously hype up business issues will undermine the confidence of Chinese business investors in the UK and damage China-UK economic and trade cooperation,” it added.A UK government spokesperson said: “We will take a consistent, long-term and strategic approach to managing the UK’s relations with China, rooted in UK and global interests.“We will continue to support UK business to engage with the second largest economy in the world, while being clear-eyed to any risks and ensuring security and resilience.”Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelChinaSteel industryJonathan ReynoldsLabourAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

By 3pm, the number had fallen to about 10,000.The price of a perfect playlist – podcastRead moreTwo hours later Spotify confirmed the service was up and running again. The streaming platformposted on Xat 5.08pm: “All clear – thanks for your patience. Get in touch with @SpotifyCares if you still need help.”Users had said they were able to play music they had downloaded on to their devices, but were unable to view artists or use the search function on the app. Others said the platform was slow or unresponsive.After trying to search for music, Spotify appeared to time out, displaying the message “something went wrong” with a refresh button.Many users expressed their frustration on social media, including that the outage had interrupted their gym sessions or study routines.A spokesperson for the Sweden-based streaming platform said: “Spotify experienced an outage today beginning around 6:20am EDT. As of 11:45am EDT, Spotify is back up and functioning normally.”Earlier, a spokesperson had said the company was “aware of the outage and working to resolve it as soon as possible”, adding: “The reports of this being a security hack are completely inaccurate.”Spotify did not provide further information on what had caused the problem.Spotify, which has more than 675 million users worldwide, told the BBC “the issue with search has been addressed” and it was rolling out an update to its users.Explore more on these topicsSpotifyInternetDigital music and audioMusic streamingAppsMusic industrynewsShareReuse this content"

As a safeguard, the clause explicitly says to consider the risk of harm. If there is any indication of harm or imbalance, the duty to report remains.“For example, if a 14-year-old girl is sexually involved with a 17-year-old boy, even if she says she has consented, a teacher or adult might rightly feel uneasy about the power dynamic and the possible impact of grooming. The adult might decide that it is appropriate to report in that case.”Cross said the exemption was “not about condoning underage sex; it is about proportionality”.She added: “We do not want to criminalise young people unnecessarily or deter them from seeking healthcare or advice … It mirrors, for instance, the approach in some Australian states where similar laws exist. Those states carve out consensual peer activity from mandatory reporting to avoid inundating child protection with consensual cases.”More than 110 child sextortion attempts reported each month to UK police forcesRead moreSpeaking for the government,Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding, said she did not want to deter young people from being open about their relationships and accessing services.“This avoids situations such as two kissing teenagers having to be reported to the authorities by a teacher who knows them both well,” she added. “That is not something I want to have to deal with: teenagers kissing in halls. I suppose it is better working here [in parliament]. Well done to the teachers of the world. For the record, I do not want to see anyone kissing in the corridors – teenagers or otherwise.”Under the new law, those who fail to comply with the “duty to report” will be liable for sanctions from their professional regulator or the Disclosure and Barring Service.It will only be if someone deliberately tries to stop a report of child sexual abuse that criminal sanctions will apply, which could lead to up to seven years in prison.Explore more on these topicsChild protectionSocial careChildrenJess PhillipsnewsShareReuse this content"

Additionally, a database of such trees would be drawn up and they could be given automatic protections, with the current system of tree preservation orders strengthened to accommodate this.There was an outpouring of anger this week after it was revealed that a500-year-old oak treein Enfield, north London, had been sliced almost down to the stumps. It later emerged it had no specific legal protections, as most ancient and culturally important trees do not.After theSycamore Gap treewas felled in 2023, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs asked the Tree Council and Forest Research to examine protections for important trees and to see if they needed to be strengthened. The trial of two men accused of felling the Sycamore Gap tree is due to take place this month at Newcastle crown court.The report, seen by the Guardian, found there was currently no definition of important trees, and that some of the UK’s most culturally important trees have no protection whatsoever. The researchers have advised ministers to create a taskforce within the next 12 months to clearly define “important trees” and swiftly prepare an action plan to save them.Defra sources said ministers were evaluating the findings of the report.Jon Stokes, the director of trees, science and research at the Tree Council, said: “Ancient oaks can live up to 1,000 years old and are as precious as our stately homes and castles. Our nation’s green heritage should be valued and protected and we will do everything we can to achieve this.”The main protection for trees is a tree preservation order (TPO), which is granted by local councils. Failure to obtain the necessary consent and carrying out unauthorised works on a tree covered by a TPO can lead to a fine of up to £20,000.The Woodland Trust has called for similar protections, proposing the introduction of a list of nationally important heritage trees and a heritage TPO that could be used to promote the protection and conservation of the country’s oldest and most important trees. The charity isusing citizen scienceto create a database of ancient trees.The report’s authors defined “important trees” as shorthand for “trees of high social, cultural and environmental value”. This includes ancient trees, which are those that have reached a great age in comparison with others of the same species, notable trees connected with specific historic events or people, or well-known landmarks.It could also include “champion trees”, which are the largest individuals of their species in a specific geographical area, and notable trees that are significant at a local scale for their size or have other special features.Richard Benwell, the CEO of the environmental group Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “Ancient trees are living monuments. They are bastions for nature in an increasingly hostile world and home to a spectacular richness of wildlife. We cannot afford to keep losing these living legends if we want to see nature thrive for future generations.“The government should use the planning and infrastructure bill to deliver strict protection for ancient woodlands, veteran trees, and other irreplaceable habitats.”Felled ancient treesIn 2020, the 300-year-old Hunningham Oak near Leamington was felled to make way for infrastructure projects.In 2021, the Happy Man tree in Hackney, which the previous year had won the Woodland Trust’s tree of the year contest, was felled to make way for housing development.In 2022, a 600-year-old oak was felled in Bretton, Peterborough, which reportedly caused structural damage to nearby property.In 2023, 16 ancient lime trees on The Walks in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, were felled to make way for a dual carriageway.Explore more on these topicsTrees and forestsConservationEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Consumers and advertisers use Google because it is helpful, not because there are no alternatives.”Brook said businesses had almost no choice but to use Google ads to advertise their products and services.“Regulators around the world have described Google as a monopoly and securing a spot on Google’s top pages is essential for visibility,” she said in a statement. “Google has been leveraging its dominance in the general search and search advertising market to overcharge advertisers.”TheCompetition and Markets Authoritylaunched a UK investigation into Google’s search services in January, which is still ongoing, including into their impact on advertising markets. It said at the time that millions of people and businesses relied on Google’s services, which accounted for 90% of searches and were used by more than 200,000 UK businesses to advertise.Google is facing several competition investigations and lawsuits around the world that relate to its digital advertising market dominance.Since September, it has been embroiled in asecond antitrust trialin the US over whether it has illegally monopolised the digital advertising industry, afterlosing a landmark case in August, which it is appealing against.One Google ad executivequoted in the US government’s complaintcompared the company’s business model to Goldman Sachs or Citibank owning the New York Stock Exchange.A loss in that trial could force Google to break up parts of its business and divest some of its advertising technology, hitting its primary source of revenue. It would also have far-reaching implications for the wider tech industry and online publishers.In March, the European CommissionaccusedGoogle of breaking its competition rules for digital markets by prioritising search engine results that pointed to Alphabet’s own services over those of rivals, breaching the requirement to treat third-party services in a “transparent, fair and non-discriminatory” way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Israel has denied any violations.More than 51,000 Palestinians have died in Gaza since the conflict began, including more than 1,600 since Israel resumed airstrikes and ground operations on 18 March. The Gaza health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians but has said more than half of those dead were women and children.Another 13 people were killed in airstrikes overnight, with a well-known photographer, Fatema Hassouna, among those reported dead in the northern area of the strip.Doctors and aid groups on the ground said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was becoming graver by the day. “The situation is the worst it has been in 18 months in terms of being deprived of your basic necessities and the resumption of hostilities and attacks against Palestinians in all of Gaza,” said Mahmoud Shalabi, a director at Medical Aid for Palestinians.‘The last thread connecting people to services’: why vets are risking all to care for Gaza’s donkeysRead moreThe resumption of aid into Gaza has become a highly inflammatory political issue in Israel. There are 58 hostages still in Gaza, who were taken captive after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, with 24 believed to still be alive. Far-right figures inBenjamin Netanyahu’s government have said no aid should be restored to the civilians of Gaza until Hamas agrees to the hostages’ release.“As long as our hostages are languishing in the tunnels, there is no reason for a single gram of food or any aid to enter Gaza,” the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said on Wednesday.Katz said Israel intended to eventually set up its own “civilian-based distribution infrastructure” for aid in Gaza, to prevent supplies falling into the hands of Hamas militants, but he gave no timelines or details of how it would be established.Reports have suggested this could involve the Israel Defense Forces setting up and running logistics centres for aid, and vetted aid agencies being tasked with distributing it. However, the plan remains unclear and the UN is said to have so far refused to hand over the names of employees.Efforts by mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US to restore the collapsed ceasefire in Gaza and return the hostages have continued to hit stumbling blocks.Katz said that no matter what deal was agreed, Israeli troops would remain in the buffer zones it had occupied in Gaza, as well as in neighbouring Syria and Lebanon.Since resuming operations in March, Israeli troops have seized control of 30% of the Gaza Strip, establishing what they describe as an “operational security perimeter”. Hamas has demanded that any hostage deal must guarantee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.Katz said: “Unlike in the past, the [Israeli military] is not evacuating areas that have been cleared and seized.” The military would “remain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and [Israeli] communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza, as in Lebanon and Syria”, he said.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In one attack, gunmen using automatic weapons fired at the entrance to Toulon prison in the south ofFrance.In other incidents, cars have been set alight and there have been vandalism and arson attempts on prison wardens’ accommodation.In several of the attacks, the acronym DDPF – Defence of French Prisoners – has been discovered. Le Parisien reported that a prisoner on conditional release had been arrested in the Essonne, south of Paris, on Wednesday morning in connection with the group.The man was alleged to have been part of an encrypted Telegram message group linked to the assaults. A post in the name of the DDPF made on Tuesday read: “We are not terrorists, we are here to defend human rights inside prisons.”Telegram has said it has now deleted all the messages and said calling for violence and threats was “explicitly banned”.French media described the attacks as a “declaration of war” by drug cartels after the government announced a crackdown on traffickers and a toughening of prison conditions for kingpins believed to be operating inside jails.The justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, has announced his intention to put 200 convicted traffickers in new ultra-high-security prisons this summer, where they will be held in isolation with limited access to visitors and telephone calls.

The sell-off picked up as Powell spoke to The Economic Club of Chicago.The S&P 500 index ended the day down 2%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 3% and theDow Jonesdropped 1.7%.“The new administration is in the process of implementing substantial policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy and regulation. Those policies are still evolving, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain,” said Powell.Powell said theUS economywas well-positioned but added that Trump’s tariffs were likely to cause “at least a temporary rise in inflation. The inflationary effects could also be more persistent.”Nvidia, the California company at the heart of the revolution in artificial intelligence technology, lost billions of dollars from its market value at the opening bell, with its shares down 8.5% by early afternoon.‘The sky won’t fall’: China plays down Trump tariff risks as stock markets rallyRead moreThe sell-off, which has spread to semiconductor makers in Asia and Europe, comes after Nvidia said the Trump administration hadrestricted the sale of its H20 chip in Chinaby means of new licence requirements.The company now expects to report a $5.5bn (£34.1bn) hit in its financial quarter that ends on 27 April, covering the cost of licences for its stock of the chips and associated sales commitments.The US restriction will also hit the MI308 processor made by rival chip business Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Its shares dropped 6.5% as it expects to take a charge of as much as $800m because of the new rule.In Asia, South Korean semiconductor businesses such as Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix fell by about 4% overnight, and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) dropped 2.5%.Meanwhile in Europe, shares in semiconductor tech firm ASML fell 5.2% as its chief executive, Christophe Fouquet, said tariffs had “increased uncertainty in the macro environment”. The Dutch company, which produces lithography machines used to make chips, also reported orders of €3.94bn in its first financial quarter, about €1bn less than investors had expected.So far the chip industry has been exempt from the 10% tariffs imposed by the US since 2 April. The US government has historically built up regulations to limit Chinese access to advanced chips – including under Joe Biden as it raced for supremacy in AI. But the Trump administration has beenpaving the way for more levies on the sector.Global stocks were also hit by a warning from the World Trade Organization. It said Trump’stariffs will send international trade into reverse this yearand depress global economic growth. While the WTO had previously expected goods trade to expand by 2.7% this year, it now forecasts a 0.2% decline.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It compared with a 0.2% gain in February, according to the US Census Bureau, though this could suggest consumers were snapping up goods before the implementation of tariffs.Oil prices also rose on Wednesday amid hopes of trade talks betweenChinaand the US, and following a report that Iraq plans to cut oil production in April. Brent crude rose by 84 cents, or 1.3%, to $65.49 a barrel, while US crude rose by a similar amount to $62.12 a barrel.If there are trade talks with China, they will involve the country’snew international trade negotiator. Beijing unexpectedly announced on Wednesday that Li Chenggang will take over the role from the veteran trade tsar Wang Shouwen. No reason was given for the change, although it came amid a broader reshuffle in Chinese government.In the US,California has launched a legal challenge to Trump’s tariffs, accusing the president of overstepping his authority and threatening trade in the state. The lawsuit was brought by California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and its attorney general, Rob Bonta.Also on Wednesday, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that he would attend a trade meeting with Japanese officials and his cabinet secretaries.“Japan is coming in today to negotiateTariffs, the cost of military support, and “TRADE FAIRNESS,” he wrote. “I will attend the meeting, along with Treasury & Commerce Secretaries. Hopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!”Japan was hit with a 24% tariff rate on its exports to the US, though, like most of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, this was paused for 90 days last week. However, a 10% universal rate remains in place, as well as a 25% duty on the sale of Japanese cars to Americans.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsNvidiaStock marketsDonald TrumpChinaStandard & Poor'sNasdaqnewsShareReuse this content"

While the warrant does not specify who he was referring to, it appears to be a reference to Shapiro, who is a strong supporter of Israel amid the war inGaza, and considered a rising star in the Democratic party.The warrant said that Balmer ended the call by saying “you know where to find me. I’m not hiding and I will confess to everything that I’ve done.”Balmer, a resident of Pennsylvania’s capital, Harrisburg, faces charges of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated assault and aggravated arson in connection with the blaze, which badly damaged parts of the mansion.At a Monday court appearance, Balmer stuck out his tongue at reporters as he arrived, and was later denied bail.The Hill reportedthat he had been due in court on Wednesday for a hearing on separate domestic abuse allegations, after Balmer allegedly told officers that he had attempted suicide by taking a full bottle of pills, sparking an argument with his wife that escalated into him attacking her and his stepson.USA Today saidthat Balmer and his wife finalized their divorce in February of this year, and he was subject to a protection from abuse order.The attack on the governor’s mansion in Harrisburg took place around 2am on Sunday, hours after Shapiro, his wife, their four children, two dogs and another family had celebrated the Jewish holiday of Passover in one of the rooms that sustained damage in the blaze.Asked at a press conference about Balmer’s motive, Shapiro pointed to earlier comments downplaying the reason for the attack: “Nothing he could do would deter me from doing my job as governor. Nothing he could do would deter me from proudly and openly practicing my faith.“I said on Sunday that this kind of violence has no place in our society, regardless of what motivates it. This is not how we resolve our differences, and this is not OK. This level of violence has to end,” Shapiro continued, deferring further comment to state prosecutors.In an interview with police after his arrest,Balmer saidthat he would have beaten Shapiro with a small sledgehammer if he had encountered him inside the mansion. Police have said the suspect was in the residence for about a minute, and lit the fires using beer bottles filled with gasoline, after hopping a nearly 7ft-high (2.1-meter-high) fence and eluding officers who were alerted to the breach.Explore more on these topicsPennsylvaniaGazaUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

German press reports identified the suspect as Johannes M, but prosecutors have not released a name.The doctor allegedly “administered an anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant to his patients … without their knowledge or consent”, the Berlin prosecutor’s office said in a statement.The relaxant “paralysed the respiratory muscles, leading to respiratory arrest and death within minutes”. The patients were between 25 and 94 years old.On five occasions, prosecutors allege, the suspect “set fire to their apartments to cover up these killings”.The suspect is accused of killing two patients on the same day. On the morning of 8 July 2024 he is alleged to have killed a 75-year-old man at his home in the central Berlin district of Kreuzberg. A few hours later he allegedly struck again, killing a 76-year-old woman in the neighbouring Neukölln district.The suspect’s alleged attempt to incinerate the crime scene failed when the fire did not catch, prosecutors said. “When he noticed this, he reportedly informed a relative of the woman, claiming that he was standing in front of her apartment and that no one had responded to his ringing,” they said.The list of accusations against the suspect has grown in length and severity since his initial arrest in August. The suspect was originally held on suspicion of manslaughter in relation to four deaths.Prosecutors said in November they were treating the alleged killings as murder cases and added four more deaths to the list of accusations.“The accused appears to have had no motive for killing the people other than the act of killing itself,” prosecutors said at the time. The suspect had nothing other than a “lust for murder”, they said.The updated charge sheet, extended to cover 15 suspicious deaths, accuses the suspect of carrying out the murders with “malice aforethought”.Prosecutors said they were seeking a lifelong professional ban and called for the suspect to be held in preventive detention.A special team of investigators had identified a total of 395 suspicious cases that needed to be re-examined in light of the accusations against the doctor. In 95 cases, an initial suspicion had been confirmed and preliminary proceedings had been initiated. Another 75 were still being assessed.In the course of the investigation, 12 exhumations have been carried out, five of which related to the victims listed in the charges. Another five exhumations are planned to go ahead shortly.The allegations made against the doctor recall another case currently being tried in Germany, in which a nurse is accused of murdering nine patients in palliative care.The nurse, whose trial opened in March, is alleged to have injected a total of 26 patients with large doses of sedatives or painkillers, resulting in the deaths of nine.Prosecutors on the case, being heard in the western city of Aachen, said the suspect was motivated by a desire to reduce his workload on night shifts and had considered himself the “master of life and death”.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The same technology has the potential to produce functional organs, too.“This looks like a transformative step, it’s a really elegant solution,” said Prof Derek Stewart at the James Hutton Institute in Dundee. “They’ve created something of a size and scale that people are hardwired to eat: it’s the chicken nugget model.”A major hurdle togrowing meat in the labis the difficulty in getting enough nutrients and oxygen to muscle cells in thick sections of tissue. Without them, the cells die off. As such, many projects focus on growing tiny pieces of meat akin to mince.To solve the size problem, Prof Shoji Takeuchi, at the University of Tokyo, built a bioreactor that holds living cells in a gel and feeds them with oxygen and nutrients through fine, semi-permeable fibres that pass through the material.“One of the key challenges in growing thick tissue is that cells in the centre can struggle to receive enough oxygen and nutrients, which may lead to cell death,” Takeuchi said. “Our system helped address this by providing internal perfusion, allowing us to support the growth of thicker, more consistent tissue.”Writing inTrends in Biotechnology, Takeuchi and his team describe how they grew an 11g chunk of chicken from a gel that had more than 1,000 hollow fibres running through it. A culture medium rich in nutrients and oxygen was pumped down the fibres to nourish the cells.Growing meat in larger, more structured pieces could help researchers replicate the texture and appearance of meat such as chicken breast or thigh, Takeuchi said. “While small-scale or minced cultured meat is easier to produce, it may not fully capture the fibrous structure and mouth-feel that consumers associate with conventional cuts,” he added.‘You don’t need animals to make real meat’: the man who grows chicken in a labRead moreFor now, the hollow fibres of the artificial circulatory system must be removed by hand once the meat has grown. But the scientists are aiming to replace them with edible cellulose fibres that can be left in and used to vary the texture of the meat.Edible fibres may open up other possibilities, too, Stewart said. Meats could be fortified by adding zinc and selenium to the culture medium, helping to boost the immune systems of older people, he suggested. He also wondered if masala sauce could be passed down the tubes to create a nugget version of chicken tikka masala. “I’d give it a go,” he said.Takeuchi said future versions of the bioreactor may need artificial blood that carries more oxygen to the cells, to allow the growth of larger lumps of meat. With sufficient funding, he believes products based on the approach could be available in five- to 10 years.“At first, it will likely be more expensive than conventional chicken, mainly due to material and production costs,” he said. “However, we are actively developing food-grade, scalable systems, and if successful, we expect the cost to decrease substantially over time.”Explore more on these topicsCell-cultivated meatMeat industryChickenFoodResearchMeatnewsShareReuse this content"

That change codified a law passed in March banning Pride marches and allowing authorities to use facial recognition technology to track attenders so they could be fined. It has been described by one rights group as a “full-frontal attack” on LGBTQ+ people.Strik said: “Organisers and participants of the Budapest Pride risk facing criminal charges for marching peacefully in support of diversity, equality and freedom, as they have done for the last 29 years.”The MEPs said they were calling on theEuropean Commission– the guardian of EU law – to ask the European court of justice to suspend the law pending further legal action.In response to the constitutional changes, the European Commission said on Tuesday it would not hesitate to act if necessary. The Guardian has requested comment on the MEPs’ request for suspension, known as an interim measure.Krzysztof Śmiszek, of the Polish New Left, said the new law had created “a very hostile atmosphere” for LGBTQ+ Hungarians that had “already led to rise of physical, violent attacks and other types of hate crimes”.Michał Wawrykiewicz, a centre-right Polish MEP who campaigned to preserve independent judiciary in his home country, said the group had observed an “indisputable deterioration of the situation” and “an open denial of the rule of law”. He also said some officials had shown a “very aggressive approach toward us” and “rude behaviour”.Sophie Wilmès, a former Belgian prime minister and a liberal MEP, said some authorities had displayed “very aggressive rhetoric” towards the group. She voiced alarm about pressure on independent media. She said the Hungarian government’s extensive control of the media landscape meant “smear campaigns have become the new norm”.Several government departments declined to meet the MEPs, without giving any reason, Strik said. Three nationalist and far-right European parliament groups declined to join the parliamentary visit: the European Conservatives and Reformists, Patriots for Europe and the Europe of Sovereign Nations Group.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

South Africa, one of the world’s most unequal countries, also has one of the world’s highest murder rates, with more than 27,000 that year, 50% higher than a decade earlier.Sullivan was seized on Thursday night while he was preaching at the Fellowship Baptist church, where he had been a missionary since 2018 in the township of Motherwell outside the city of Gqeberha in Eastern Cape province.Four gunmen stormed the church, stealing two mobile phones from congregation members before taking Sullivan. A few hours later, his truck was found abandoned.The kidnappers were eventually tracked to a house in KwaMagxaki, about a 20-minute drive from the church, across the Swartkops River. Suspects inside a vehicle opened fire while attempting to flee, the police said.The Hawks statement said: “The victim was found inside the same vehicle from which the suspects had launched their attack. Miraculously unharmed, he was immediately assessed by medical personnel and is currently in an excellent condition.”Sullivan’s mother, Tonya Morton Rinker, said in a Facebookpost: “My Baby is free! Joshua was rescued earlier today!! He is home with Meagan and the kids … Thank you for your support and prayers.”An earlierpostby Rinker described Sullivan as a “big-hearted gentle giant”. It said the 34-year-old had first travelled to South Africa with his wife, Meagan, for six months in 2015, before returning as “church-planting” missionaries and becoming fluent in Xhosa, the most common language in the Eastern Cape. The couple have four children and have “taken in two Xhosa children”.A report by the Institute of Security Studies, a local thinktank, found 44% of kidnappings were during vehicle hijackings to extort money quickly. Another 22% were tied to robberies, while only 5% were for ransom. It was not immediately clear what the motive for Sullivan’s kidnapping was.Additional reporting by Associated PressExplore more on these topicsSouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

'There is no evidence leading back to me,' Mayer said after winning the WBO title bout. 'It's not my style'. The American also won a rematch with Ryan in Las Vegas last month.Carlsen v Niemann chess dramaAfter 19-year-old Hans Niemann beat world champion Magnus Carlsen at the 2022 Sinquefield Cup, Carlsen withdrew from the event and then resigned from an online game after one move. Another grandmaster, Hikaru Nakamura, claimed Carlsen thought Niemann was 'probably cheating' – and wild online theories included the use of vibrating anal beads to signal moves. Niemann, who did admit to cheating in online games several years ago, filed a $100m lawsuit which was settled in 2023.Sweet revenge for IndiaIndia's Test match against England at Trent Bridge in 2007 was marred by a bizarre incident, as jelly beans appeared on the wicket when Zaheer Khan came out to bat. Zaheer claimed 'someone was chucking them from behind me,' and started a heated exchange with the England slips, who denied all knowledge. While Kevin Pietersen bore the brunt of Zaheer's ire, bowler Chris Tremlett later claimed the idea came from Ian Bell. It didn't work – India won a bad-tempered game by seven wickets.A darting whodunnitAfter Gary Anderson had breezed to victory over Wesley Harms at the 2018 Grand Slam of Darts, his Dutch opponent accused Anderson of distracting him – by breaking wind on stage. \"It'll take me two nights to forget the smell,\" Harms told Dutch TV. Anderson strongly denied the allegation, claiming the stench was like \"rotten eggs, but not from me. Every time I walked past, there was a waft of rotten eggs.\" The mystery remains unsolved.Murphy's amateur angerFormer world snooker champion Shaun Murphy lost at the 2021 UK Championship to amateur player Si Jiahui – and did not take the defeat well. After losing 6-5, Murphy claimed that as an amateur, Si 'shouldn't be in the building' for a professional tournament – a claim contradicted by the final scoreline.

In a world saturated by choice and trends, not only is the choosing done for you, but you’ll often have a less conventional, better rounded and precious bookshelf collection to show for it.This is presumably why there’s a strong appetite for such services: UK fantasy subscription box FairyLoot has 569,000 followers on Instagram alone, and many bookshops have started sending out their own boxes.Now, some of these businesses have decided not just to sell books, but to publish their own: In January, FairyLoot announced a collaboration with Transworld, a division of Penguin Random House, while last week Canada-based subscription service OwlCrate launched OwlCrate Press.Jordan Fleming, head of publishing at OwlCrate, has described publishing as a “broken industry”,telling industry magazine the Booksellerthat the publishing wing had been set up to “eventually address a lot of the issues the industry is facing”.Which issues they’re seeking to address is unclear. It’s fair to see where they could influence things – they have an understanding of their subscribers and can cater to that market well as a result. But curating is not the same as publishing; quality and influence are two different things. Could this mark a potentially monumental shift in the industry?“Book boxes and book subscription services are hugely valuable to publishers,” says Jon Petre, an editor at Profile Books. “Books can get a significant guaranteed sale on publication day through them … A big order of instant sales can land an author straight on the bestseller list. Even if it’s just for a week, the author will be Sunday Times-bestselling for the rest of their career.” Petre says.Hariny Vanniarajan, who is signed up to subscription service Illumicrate, feels that the books she receives in the box are “representative of marginalised voices that we don’t often find in mainstream publishing.”“As a south Indian, I truly enjoy the great variety of authors and cultures I’m being introduced to,” she says. “These are books I normally might not have picked up because I wouldn’t have known about them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The US-based authors say they have “cultivated a huge fanbase” in the UK specifically through editions sold by FairyLoot.It makes sense, then, that subscription services want to push their curation skills further, by commissioning, editing, and publishing titles that aren’t already in the world. They have a guaranteed customer base, a strong sense of the titles that work for them and the ability to create exclusive editions. It’s a pretty powerful sales pitch to any bidding writer.“In a market where customers are spending more money on fewer books, a guaranteed sale can be the difference between making a loss or breaking even for a debut author.” Petre says. Given thatbook ownership is also in decline, there are plenty of reasons to see such businesses as a stable alternative in a choppy industry. Those who do spend on books often “crave a gorgeous physical edition to hold in their hands and display on their shelves,” Elizabeth and Helen say.From beer to books: 16 subscription services to save you time and moneyRead moreWhile you can argue that putting a book you’ve commissioned and published into the hands of a dedicated audience isn’t any more of a bestseller manipulation than choosing a book that already exists, there’s a point to make about the magic and purity of a subscription service being lost by such a move.You can consider this pivot an equivalent of Netflix or Mubi launching original works instead of merely curating them. Has that been a success? Not entirely. While they present new opportunities for individuals, they also present monopolies at large. As with all things art, it’s subjective: Vanniarajan says she wouldn’t necessarily be put off if Illumicrate started putting books it had published itself in her box. “They have built a huge following and seem to understand their audience well, so I assume they’d continue this integrity when choosing authors to work with,” she says.But if you’re after an expert’s recommendations to bolster and surprise your library, as opposed to a powerhouse choosing titles for you, consider supporting a local bookshop’s services instead.Explore more on these topicsBooksPublishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How did that go?Alexis Petridis, chief rock and pop criticOne day in the car I just listened to nothing instead of facing it again. When it plays me songs I like, it’s not what I want to hear at that moment. That’s not to say the music it was recommending wasn’t good. One morning it played Schizophrenia by Sonic Youth. I love that song but I didn’t want to hear it then. It played me Billie Holiday’s Riffin’ the Scotch followed by My Bloody Valentine, which clearly demonstratesthe great breadthof my music taste – but just because I like it all doesn’t mean I want to hear it all together. I didn’t like that it was untouched by human hands. I always think that the amazing thing about a record collection is that it doesn’t make sense to anybody other than you. And yet when it’s presented like that, I find it really jarring and difficult – it’s all over the place.LSThe algorithm is straining to find the data points that connect all those things, to close the net and make it coherent when it’s not.Mood Machine by Liz Pelly review – a savage indictment of SpotifyRead moreAPThe first one I tried had an AI DJ that kept saying “Ga-lax-ie 500”, which sounds like a laxative. I wonder how much of this is to do with my age and these things not having always been in my life, but I find it inherently creepy, both the AI voice and the narrow recommendations based on your own taste. I read enough science fiction in my teens to know that this is very much the thin edge of the wedge – one minute it’s all matey “would you like to listen to Galaxie 500?”, the next humanity’s enslaved, living underground mining uranium for a robot. There are generated playlists that are meant to be generically adjacent to the time of day you listen to it: “Wednesday Shoegaze.” Why? Then you have “70s rock hippie afternoon”, featuring a lot of music that isn’t from the 1970s. There’s I Am Waiting by the Rolling Stones, which is from 1965. Expecting to Fly by Buffalo Springfield is from 1967. Eight Miles High by the Byrds is from 1966. How do you generally use Spotify?LSI have mp3s of anything I care about. I pay for Spotify but I try to spend as much or more on Bandcamp or whatever every month, like carbon-offsetting. To some degree, you and I need to have Spotify, like a film critic needs Netflix. But also, artists don’t earn anything from me playing their mp3s; if I stream music I already own on Spotify, they’re at least getting fractions of a penny and the listener data they need to operate in that ecosystem. And I don’t have to listen to ads. How about you?APOrdinarily my listening isn’t centred on Spotify. I use YouTube more for work. I listen to a lot of physical records. Did you listen to a lot of different stuff as a result of not using Spotify for a week?LSSort of. I subscribe to a lot of music newsletters and inevitably open 20 Bandcamp links a week and shut 15 without listening to them, because there’s only so much time. But this week I went through most of them and really lovedan album by a Swedish composer called Hugo Randulv. I generally only use Spotify as a discovery tool to listen to albums I’ve never heard before that I’ve seen recommended elsewhere or to play old favourites out and about. The only time I cheated was when I ran out of fun music mid-run and put Doechii’s last mixtape on, but I bought it when I got home. I never use their playlists. I stopped checking my Discover Weekly because it often recommends things that would be logical for me to like, but I’ve already decided that I don’t. But that doesn’t compute with their algorithmic concept that one of these things is just like the other.APThat’s the thing – however good the algorithm is, there’s something about human taste that it can’t quite replicate. Let’s look at my “made for you”. I never usually browse this. Here’s my “reggae mix” … featuring folk legends Shirley and Dolly Collins.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus of Boygenius, pictured with Taylor Swift pictured at the 2024 Grammy awards.Photograph: David Swanson/ReutersLSWow. With playlists like “70s hippie afternoon”, it’s like their made-up Spotify Wrapped “genres”, where they’re named a) to mimic the language of memes, and b) as a reduction of music down to “vibes”, stripping away historical context. This might be getting a bit Adbusters, but I think the temporal playlists are also about syncing with consumer habits. Your “get ready with me” playlist, a “main character energy” walk to Starbucks. And the “coffee shop” vibe is so prevailing, it’s ended up dictating the types of music that get signed: you get more pop-ready, front-facing songwriters such as Phoebe Bridgers and Julien Baker on indie labels – they’re obviously great but they’re also products that work well in that ecosystem.APThe guy from the label Secretly Group says in the book that they couldn’t sign the experimental band Oneida now. It’s a really good example of how the competition markers of pop have been brought to bear on all types of music because of Spotify. It’s forcing everybody into competition with Ed Sheeran and Sabrina Carpenter, and that’s not always your motivation for starting a band or making music. It helps you get on in that world if you look like Sam Fender.LSIt can get even more granular. A lot of what I listen to on there is drone, the sound of one organ key being held down for half an hour. But Spotify’s idea of ambient is closer to what they call“perfect fit content” (PFC), as Liz Pelly found outin her book Mood Machine, where they commission muzak-style farms to produce chilled-out music to fit lean-back, mood-based playlists and allegedly pay a lower royalty rate than they do to traditional record labels. Filling playlists with that counts out the artists really invested in those sounds and disciplines who might otherwise stand a chance of making a living from them – there are examples of those playlists being overhauled and musicians losing out on money they had been earning. You found that several jazz playlists seemed to have next to no “real” artists on them.APThe jazz thing is the ultimate extension of that. On one level, yes, Spotify is giving work to the jazz musicians who produce PFC, and it’s hard to get work as a jazz musician. On the other hand, look at Ezra Collective. They’re playing Wembley. This is what can happen when listeners are exposed to something exciting and underground. A jazz playlist full of music apparently commissioned for the purpose is actively stopping listeners from being exposed to that sort of thing. Do you ever discover things from Spotify?LSDefinitely. I try not to let autoplay run after an album ends, but it has led me to good stuff. Sometimes its persistence has made me change my mind about something. I didn’t get Astrid Sonne at first, but I listened to so much Clarissa Connelly – they went to the same experimental Danish music school – that it kept feeding me her, and it clicked. Thinking of massive tech companies, with, say, Amazon, I think most people are aware of the moral conflict in using it – the conditions that packers and delivery drivers work in. Do you think there’s that same sense of compunction about what Spotify is doing to artists?APNo. I think there’s a vague sense that you don’t get paid very well, but the really big stars – the most visible artists – are doing all right.Kate Nash is doing OnlyFansto make money and it’s come tosomethingif you’ve got to do that to keep your career afloat. But in the broader scheme of things, most people see Sabrina Carpenter or the Weeknd and they’re doing really well. So I think there’s a disconnect in people’s minds about this notion that artists aren’t being correctly remunerated by Spotify.LSIt infuriates me that they’ve alsodemonetised any songs with fewer than 1,000 plays.Pay to get playlisted? The accusations against Spotify’s Discovery ModeRead moreAPAnohni makes a very good point in the book that a record can be really impactful but you only have to listen to it twice. There’s loads of music I like, such as extreme electronics, that I’m not going to listen to over and over again.LSI thought the only naive part of the book was the ending, which looks at potential alternatives to streaming. Pelly highlights public libraries in the US that have streaming platforms for local musicians. It’s a lovely idea but with the best will in the world it’s not the same thing. I think we’ve seen a lot of larger-scale alternatives collapse.APRight – who’s still talking about Tidal? It seemed to me to be completely unworkable, though I appreciate her trying to put a positive spin on it – “there is another way” – but I don’t think there is.LSI think the most likely outcome is that Spotify will move on from music to a different product, and other solutions will have to be found. It’s one reason I’ve never got rid of my mp3s, because this could all disappear too.Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist by Liz Pelly is published by Hodder & Stoughton (£22).

They have nothing but admiration for him and wish him the very best for his future.”The Who’sRoger Daltreyis a patron of TCT and until 2024 acted as curator for their annual gig series at the London venue.But areview of the band’s March gig in the Metrosuggested that Daltrey was complaining onstage about Starkey’s performance.It said that the frontman paused their final song, The Song Is Over, and told the audience: “To sing that song I do need to hear the key, and I can’t. All I’ve got is drums going boom, boom, boom. I can’t sing to that. I’m sorry guys.”Starkey, son of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and Maureen Starkey, appeared aware that the news was coming – and not on the warm terms shared by the Who’s representative – when he shared a tongue-in-cheek post on Instagram this weekend.Beneath a photo of himself and Daltrey, Starkey wrote in all caps: “Heard today from inside source that Toger Daktrey [sic] lead singer and principal songwriter of the group unhappy with Zak the drummer’s performance at the Albert Hall a few weeks ago is bringing formal charges of overplaying and is literally going to Zak the drummer.”‘It ain’t over till one of us is gone’: the pop stars who refuse to bury the hatchetRead moreStarkey joined the band full time during their 1996 Quadrophenia tour. He was introduced to drumming by the Who’s original drummer, Keith Moon, a family friend who gave him a drum kit for his eighth birthday.Starkey has also played with Oasis – although the lineup for the band’s upcoming reunion tour is yet to be officially announced – Johnny Marr, the Lightning Seeds, Sly and Robbie, and his father.He performs in the recently formed supergroup Mantra of the Cosmos, also featuring Shaun Ryder and Bez of the Happy Mondays and Black Grape, and Andy Bell of Oasis and Ride.Explore more on these topicsThe WhoPop and rockRoger DaltreynewsShareReuse this content"

This was the early 1990s, and they were joined at the hip on the sofa, laughing at the idea of two portly plumbers becoming gigantic after consuming copious amounts of magic mushrooms.View image in fullscreen‘An ordinary human being rather than the tragic myth he became’ … family photo of Thomas Hobbs with his father, Jonathan.Photograph: Thomas HobbsIn this moment I sensed their natural chemistry, while the intoxicating mix of 8-bit visuals and perky, synth-heavy music blew my toddler mind. Although it was irritating seeing them constantly fail to jump high enough to hit the top of the flagpole at the end of the level, I remember being transfixed by the TV screen, and I’m pretty sure this was the first time I connected properly with a video game.I was only four years old when my dad died. It happened suddenly, a heart attack when he was just 37, and I witnessed it on a bike ride ... It left my family for ever broken. But the formative image of dad at his most carefree and in love, clutching a rectangular controller hooked up to a grey slab of Japanese joy, remained. It was something I could utilise whenever my grief became too much. Most importantly, the memory allowed me to visualise my dad as an ordinary human being rather than the tragic myth he later became.Ours was a working-class household with limited space, so eventually the NES disappeared: no one could work out whether it was gathering dust in an old plastic bag in a relative’s loft, or if it had been accidentally thrown out. So I was shocked recently when my mum unexpectedly handed me the console after finding it during a spring clean. She asked me if I could try to fix it, so that we could keep it in the family.It had no leads, games, or controllers. It was also filthy with sticky clumps of dirt, particularly around the AV slots, and judging by the rust collecting at the cartridge slot, had serious water damage. After giving it a deep clean, hoovering all the damp dust out of the inside and buying a pricey device that converted the games into HD, I switched it on. Somehow, it still worked. Clearly, like most consumer devices produced in the 1980s, the NES had been built to withstand a nuclear winter should the cold war heat up.View image in fullscreenA retro ‘Nintendo Family Computer’, sold in Japan as a forerunner to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesThe last few weeks of rebuying games and getting lost in their fuzzy charms have been genuinely restorative for my mental health; a chance to reconnect with my roots. It took me about 15 minutes to figure out how to make a jump on the Fortress level of World 1 in Super Mario Bros 3, with spikes descending from the ceiling just as my squirrel suit was on the verge of flying to the other side. But by working out I simply had to be patient and duck inside a small space to avoid looming peril, rather than blindly rushing forward, I knew I was experiencing the same glorious lightbulb moment my dad would have enjoyed.I’ve been particularly obsessed with Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!! Despite the clunky 2D crowd and square-ish dimensions, there’s a genuine dynamism to the boxer’s movement and a feeling that David can defeat Goliath simply by bobbing and weaving and flipping the momentum with a well-aimed jab to the chin. While later boxing games might have been dripping with life-like bodily fluids, I have yet to find one that better replicates the magic of a boxer tasting blood and moving in for the kill than this 1987 NES game.Double Dragon has also been a revelation. This co-op fighting game gives you a big open space to navigate and – despite the graphical limitations – makes you feel like Bruce Lee: surrounded by foes, but with enough battlefield intelligence to use the environment to your advantage and kick knife-wielding enemies into the dust. With race-against-the-clock tension, one early sequence where you fight a couple of heavies on a moving conveyor belt made me feel like I was in a John Woo action movie.In these games the lack of a save mode forces you to continuously invest in improving, so the next time you hit the dreaded “Game Over” screen you’re more confident of avoiding the same mistakes. This grift is strangely addictive, and it’s easy to picture my dad taking a quick break after putting baby me to sleep, his mind on the allure of the hard-won achievements at the core of this more patient era of Nintendo gaming.View image in fullscreenGenuine dynamism … Mike Tyson’s Punch Out!!Photograph: NintendoKnowing he would have once had the same smile on his face while playing the NES has made him more tangible in my mind; it’s allowed me to see through his eyes. And, as my two-year-old son experiences his own dad going crazy over firing Flower Power-ups or defeating Dracula Duck during the final boss battle of the family melodrama that is DuckTales, I feel like I’m keeping my father’s energy alive.Retro gaming is very much on the rise in the UK and US, with many players rediscovering the delights of analogue-era consoles. Playing these old cartridges on the original machines provides a deeper appreciation of the evolution of gaming and it’s an escape from a world that feels far less carefree than the time in which these machines were thriving. Perhaps they also hope to re-ignite the memories of those who’ve passed, to remain connected to the loved ones who once invested their time into these devices.Rather than letting that old console become a house for spiders in your loft, dust it off, get playing. It might just help you to grieve, or relive a special memory that otherwise could easily have been lost. When I hear the opening chords of the Super Mario Bros theme song, I’m instantly back on that sofa with my mum and dad, smiling, assured that everything is going to be OK.We have opened comments for readers to share their own stories of a console that reminds them of a lost friend or relative.Explore more on these topicsGamesSuper MariofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Addressing the audience, which included Brin and Zuckerberg as well as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Rogen appeared to refer to Elon Musk (who was not present) by saying: “It’s amazing that others [who have been] in this room underwrote electing a man who, in the last week, single-handedly destroyed all of American science.”The Hollywood Reporter said that Rogen added: “It’s amazing how much good science you can destroy with $320m and RFK Jr, very fast.”However the remark was not included in the “full” 99-minute film of the event that the Breakthrough prize posted on YouTube and on its own website.In a statement to the Hollywood Reporter, the Breakthrough prize foundation said: “This year’s ceremony lasted longer than the prior few years, and several edits were made in order to meet the originally planned run time.”Trump’s assault on the US science establishment has been unrelenting, resulting inan open letter signed by 1,900 prominent scientistsin March, condemning the Trump administration’s threats to universities, federal grants and funding, and triggering mass layoffs, resignations and censorship.Musk supported Trump’s re-election campaignwith nearly $300m, and subsequently became a “special government employee” with the remit to gut government agencies to save money. Robert Kennedy Jr, one of the US’s most prominent vaccine skeptics, was appointed health secretary in February and, among other controversies, has beenaccused of giving Americans “false hope”that the cause of autism would be discovered before the end of 2025.Zuckerberg, Bezos and Altmanalso donated $1m eachto Trump’s inauguration committee.Explore more on these topicsFilmSeth RogenAwards and prizesDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m Lanre Bakare and I usually cover arts and culture for the Guardian, but I’m taking over the newsletter this week to tell you about my new book,We Were There, a cultural history of Black Britain.It’s set between 1979 and 1990, covering the rise and premiership of Margaret Thatcher, the UK’s first female prime minister, whose divisive but transformative remodelling of Britain is still felt today – and within that political upheaval, race dominated the headlines. But it was also a time when modernBlack British culturewas forged.I’ll talk you through five things I learned from my research.What I discovered about Black BritainView image in fullscreenLife and northern soul … revellers at Wigan Casino.Photograph: Francesco MellinaThree years ago, in the early stages of my book research,I wrote aboutBlack British people who attended northern soul nights in the 1970s. Clubs hosted “all-nighters” when fans would dance to often discarded soul tracks from a decade earlier. I was always told that northern soul, despite being a scene built on African American music, was a white movement and that Black British kids weren’t really interested in it. But when I went back and watched Tony Palmer’s amazing documentaryWigan Casino, which took film cameras inside an all-nighter at the famous club night, I spotted half a dozen Black faces in the crowd.As soon as I saw them, I wanted to know their stories and how they had become part of this scene. What I discovered was teenagers who were obsessed with mod culture, football and soul music; young migrants who, for various reasons, had left places such as St Kitts, Jamaica and Ghana and settled in northern towns and cities. They were young people searching for a sense of belonging and northern soul gave that to them. The lesson I learned is that whenever someone presents an assumption about Black Britain and the subcultures we’ve belonged to, you’ll almost always find a counter-narrative of lives that have long been obscured.TV reflected Black life beyond the capitalView image in fullscreenMade in Birmingham … Empire Road actors Nalini Moonasar and Wayne Laryea on set.Photograph: ANL/ShutterstockIn the 1980s, when Black Britain was portrayed on television there was an understanding that Black life extended beyond the capital. Programmes such as Black Bag and Ebony on the Road made a concerted effort to tell true stories about Black communities in Chapeltown in Leeds andButetown in Cardiff. The late 70s soap opera Empire Road, written by Michael Abbensetts, was shot on location on the streets of Handsworth in Birmingham. It’s hard to imagine Black television set in the Midlands or Wales today, as commissioners look to London for a supposedly more “authentic” representation of Black Britain.Think of the recent Black dramas and comedies that have had success – I May Destroy You, Queenie, Dreaming Whilst Black, Supacell, Riches – they are all set in the capital. The BBC dramaThis Town, released last year, was a welcome exception – yet it’s clear we’ve lost the ability, or the interest, to look across the UK for stories about our culture. As the most recent census reveals, for the first timesince at least 1991, the majority of Black people live outside London. To explore the true nature of Black Britain, we must document all of it.Thatcher and Powell gave Labour a passView image in fullscreenHigh tensions … graffiti in support of the Tory MP Enoch Powell, whose inflammatory ‘rivers of blood’ speech split the nation.Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis/Getty ImagesThatcher’s stance on race and immigration was hostile. In 1978, as leader of the opposition, she claimed that areas of Britain were being“swamped” by foreigners.Her comments after the Liverpool unrest in 1981, when she claimed the rioting was by young men “whose high animal spirits” had “wreak[ed] havoc” on the city, were clear dog whistles.But during this period the Labour party, typically viewed as more progressive than the Conservatives, was also incredibly hostile to immigrants and often benefited from more outrageous comments by the Tories. Enoch Powell’s racist“rivers of blood” speechin 1968 came two months after the Labour home secretary, Jim Callaghan, claimed that the “increased flow” of south Asian migrants from east Africa to the UK was “continuing and might become a flood”. The influx, he argued, was “more than we could absorb”.The1968 Commonwealth Immigrants Actfollowed – and for the first time denied British citizens entry to the country on racial grounds. Callaghan’s biographer Kenneth Morgan points out that “from Callaghan’s perspective, Powell’s antics were a valuable distraction. They enabled the government to appear, by contrast, sane and balanced.” In reality, Callaghan (who would become prime minister and was the MP for Butetown) laid the groundwork for the legislationthat led to the Windrush scandal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s clear why renewal was necessary and desirable to remodel Britain: old, often dangerous housing would be replaced by new homes designed to modernist principles. Yet poor construction meant many of these new properties – for example, Hulme Crescents in Manchester – were not fit for purpose.A knock-on effect was felt by home-owning Black Britons whose properties were bought, often for tiny sums, and who were then relocated in new council accommodation. This significantly weakened the economic potential of Black Britons who could, for example, have used their homes as collateral in order to start a business. This pattern was repeated across the UK where Black communities were often on the frontline of the mass redevelopment phases that were introduced during the 1960s and reappeared in the 80s, first in London Docklands, then in Liverpool and Cardiff.Uncles and aunties had beefView image in fullscreenA new chapter … We Were There shifts the narrative of Black Britain in the 20th century beyond London.Photograph: PenguinOne thing that shocked me while writing the book was the amount of beef people from this era had with one another. Some people still don’t talk because of things that happened in the 80s. It makes sense.Often they were in campaign groups or activist circles where one, usually male figure, would dominate. That led to some people being marginalised. Other times there were personality clashes, which isn’t uncommon in an environment where outspoken, politically driven people come together for a cause.The final chapter is about Black rugby league players, who I assumed would all be friends, united by their position as outsiders in this ultra macho sport. But they often kept intense professional rivalries, in some cases to keep an edge over a competitor, in others because they genuinely despised each other.We Were There: How Black Culture, Resistance and Community Shaped Modern Britain by Lanre Bakare is published by Bodley Head (£22).

To be clear, these weren’t the words of Angelo Moriondo, the Italian inventor who patented the first espresso machine in 1884, but it’s nice to imagine that he shared the sentiment. Without him, and the inventors that refined his creation, our daily lives – the sour-faced commutes and sunny weekend strolls – would be all the poorer.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Espresso forms the bedrock of many coffee staples – the latte, the cappuccino, the flat white, the americano – but making the perfect shot, or just a rather good one, is a thrillingly contentious topic. Millions of hours of YouTube videos have been dedicated to the craft, and the associated Reddit threads may one day form a voluminous historical artefact.The truth? It’s not hard to brew good espresso at home. It’s not even that hard to make a fairly great one – all you need is a decent espresso machine on your worktop, a respectable grinder, some freshly roasted coffee and the patience to do more than press a single button. The new breed of “assisted” models even do most of the hard work for you, if you prefer.Over the past couple of months, I’ve put a troop of espresso machines, from £100 manual wonders to four-figure assisted wunderkinds, through a highly caffeinated bootcamp to find the best-value espresso machines money can buy.At a glanceBestmanual espresso machineoverall:Lelit Anna PL41TEM£509.95 at AmazonBest budget espresso machine:De’Longhi Stilosa EC230£89 at AmazonBestfor temperature control on a budget:ProCook espresso machine£199 at ProCookBestif you can afford it:Sage Dual Boiler£1,249.95 at SageBestassisted espresso machine overall:Ninja Luxe Cafe Premier£499 at John LewisBest assisted machine for beginners:Sage Bambino Plus£349 at John LewisBest high-end assisted espresso machine:Sage Oracle Jet£1,699 at John LewisWhy you should trust meMy kitchen has hosted many coffee machines since I started reviewing them seven years ago. I’ve come to learn why even good coffee beans can make bad coffee, and I’ve spent hundreds of hours swearing at grinders, measuring scales and coffee machines in the search of bliss in a cup. My ideal? The best possible coffee with the bare minimum of effort. My attention span is short, my kids noisy and my need for caffeine insatiable.By the time I’ve decided a machine is worthy of sitting on my kitchen worktop, I’ve spent hours poking, prodding, pouring and slurping before finally putting pen to pad and fingers to keyboard.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘Several kilos of freshly roasted coffee beans were consumed during testing.’Photograph: Sasha MullerOver the course of several weeks, I made a lot of espresso. Some awful, some wonderful – but a lot of espresso all the same. The sheer number of machines (12, plus others that I’ll be reviewing in the coming months) meant I had to rotate the various machines in my kitchen, and then come back to specific models to test them side by side with their closest competitors.The starting point is good coffee. Several kilos of freshly roasted beans fromCraft House Coffeewere consumed during testing, and they were used about a fortnight after the roast date for optimum and comparable results. Grinders included aKingrinder K6 hand grinderand aBaratza Vario W+(which featured in our guide toeverything you need to make great coffee).In addition to taste testing, I also timed how long it took for machines to reach brewing temperature from cold, and how long it took to froth 180ml of fridge-cold milk to a creamy 65C microfoam.And if you’ve ever wondered how much espresso is too much, then I can safely say that it is once your eyeballs begin to feel as if they’re sweating. At this point, I recommend a drink of water, a nice sit down and some calming music. This paragraph is unofficially sponsored by Brian Eno. Thanks, Brian.The best espresso machines in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Pair it with a good grinder and it’ll pour a ludicrously tasty shot’: the De’Longhi Stilosa EC230.Photograph: Sasha MullerBestmanual espresso machine overall:Lelit Anna PL41TEMView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller£509.95 at Coffee Friend£509.95 at AmazonIt might look similar to the Gaggia Classic, but the Anna PL41TEM squeezes in one key feature missing on that machine: PID temperature control for brewing and steaming. A PID controller maintains temperature more precisely than thermostat boilers, and the result is more adjustability, better shot-to-shot consistency and no need to consider third-party upgrades.Why we love itThe simple LCD screen shows you the temperature and you can separately adjust the brew and steam temperature in a range from 80C to 130C. The default brew setting is a sensible 95C. A dial shows you the brew pressure, too, which is handy, and you can adjust it if you’re brave enough to delve inside the machine with a screwdriver.The machine takes about three minutes to heat up, and usefully the top tray warms up enough to heat a few espresso cups. The results are uniformly good, too. Excellent, even, for the money, and the adjustable temperature makes it easy to dial in lighter and darker roasts to perfection.Lelit is confident of the build quality. Unusually, you get two years of warranty for home use and a full year of warranty for commercial use – something that would void all the other warranties here.It’s a shame that …the build might be tough, but it all feels quite clunky, and beginners may find the manual fill boiler daunting. The bullet-point instructions look as if they’ve been printed straight out of Microsoft Word.Another minor annoyance: the 57mm portafilter is not a standard size, so upgrades are in shorter supply than the usual 58mm. Take note when buying replacement baskets, or a proper metal tamper for that matter – the awful plastic one supplied is sadly destined for the recycling bin. If you have hard water, you’ll want to stock up onLelit’s dedicated resin water filters, too – none are included.Type:manualDimensions:23x 38 x 34cm (WDH)Water tank:2.7lTime to heat up:3minsTime to steam milk:1min 19secsGrinder included:noNoise:50dB (brew), 67dB (steam)Warranty:two-year repair or replace at Lelit’s discretionBest budget espresso machine:De’Longhi Stilosa EC230View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller£89.99 at De’Longhi£89 at AmazonThe De’Longhi Stilosa is a rare sight: a genuinely decent espresso machine with an RRP that’s a whisker under £100. Pair it with a good grinder and it’ll pour a ludicrously tasty shot. What’s more, its basic steam wand creates the perfect microfoam for silky cappuccinos and flat whites.Why we love itThe first thing to be aware of is that there are three similar-looking models: the EC230, EC235 and EC260. The EC235 and EC260 come with pressurised baskets designed for use with pre-ground, not-so-fresh coffee; the EC235 has a manual steam wand, the EC260 a low-effort automatic wand. I tested the EC230 and the EC260, and it’s the EC230 I’d recommend: it comes with unpressurised single and double basketsanda manual steaming wand.There is a simple, plasticky charm to the Stilosa. It’s sturdy and solid for the cash; the controls are easy to get to grips with; and the design is sensible. The one-litre water tank slides in and out easily, and a little slot alongside stores the spare single or double shot basket. Leave the machine on for a few minutes, and the front section warms up enough to gently warm cups before you begin brewing.The manual steam wand makes a far silkier foam than the EC260’s automatic wand with the right technique, and with a little effort, the EC230 produced microfoam as good as any of the assisted machines here – and that includes the £1,699 Oracle Jet.It’s a shame that …at this price, my biggest complaint is that the user manual is awful. It swaps text for confusing illustrations, and this makes a simple machine far harder to understand than it needs to be. Also, the plastic tamper is rubbish – but frankly, at this price, you can afford to upgrade it.Type:manualDimensions:21x 34 x 29cm (WDH)Water tank:1lTime to heat up:1min 30secsTime to steam milk:1min 25secsGrinder included:noNoise:50dB (brew), 65dB (steam)Warranty:one-year repair or replaceBestfor temperature control on a budget:ProCook espresso machineView image in fullscreen£199 at ProCook£174.98 at eBayProCook’s machines combine familiar-looking design with the kind of features that usually command a far higher price. This is the entry-level model in the range, delivering adjustable PID temperature control and a solid all-round performance for the price.Why we love itIf you initially thought you were looking at a Sage machine, then join the club: the silver metal and curved plastics are terribly familiar.Flip the machine on, and the simple button layout and LCD screen make it easy to get brewing. You can set the brewing temperature between 90C and 96C in two-degree increments, and while the single and double shot buttons produce a standard volume, you can manually set it to your preference. The dedicated hot-water button is a boon, too – take note, Sage – although it rather awkwardly dispenses from the steam wand.Brewing quality and steaming performance are respectable for the cash. Heat-up time is less than 30 seconds thanks to the Thermoblock design, and the only disappointment is that, despite the promising-looking wand, steaming feels underpowered. All importantly, though, espresso quality is good for the money, and the adjustable temperature makes a big difference here, especially with the medium-light roast beans I had on the shelf.It’s a shame that …it’s not as solid-feeling as Sage’s Bambino models: the 58mm portafilter feels light and cheap, and the overall build feels more plasticky.You’ll have to buy your own stainless-steel milk jug for steaming milk, too, and there’s no water filter included or available to buy. If you’re in a hard-water area, you’ll want to use a good water filter jug.There was lots of dripping after pulling shots: the machine does eventually purge the excess water into the drip tray, but it takes its time. Only time will tell what the long-term reliability looks like.Type:manualDimensions:27 x 30 x 33cm (WDH)Water tank:2.2lTime to heat up:45secsTime to steam milk:1min 35secsGrinder included:noNoise:48dB (brew), 73dB (steam)Warranty:two-year replace or refundBestif you can afford it:Sage Dual BoilerView image in fullscreen£1,249.95 at Sage£1,299.95 at Assembly CoffeeIt may sound like an exceedingly strange thing to say about a coffee machine this expensive, but Sage’s Dual Boiler is very good value for money. Half the battle with espresso is consistency, and the Dual Boiler provides a firm bedrock for everyone from beginners to seasoned aficionados. It’s easy to use, highly adjustable and makes stunning coffee.Why we love itIt’s not as daunting to use as some enthusiast machines, which means that anyone in the house who’s eager to learn – not just the coffee obsessives – will get the benefit, and the simple LCD screen and push-button controls make it easy to tinker with.The dual stainless-steel boilers require a five-minute warm-up time – far longer than any of the other machines here – but once they’re up to temperature, they stay there. Even the portafilter is temperature controlled, and the steam wand is supremely powerful – though it takes a little getting used to.Dial in the grind, dosage, brewing temperature, pre-infusion and shot time, and you can tweak the results to perfection with confidence. Pour a bad shot and you know it’s entirely your fault, which makes it far easier to fix.The other details only add to the appeal. The hidden caster wheels that allow you to roll the machine forward to access the water tank; the little window that shows the remaining water level; the weighty-feeling portafilter, generous drip tray and the little compartment hidden behind so you can hide useful accessories.It’s a shame that …you need a truly great grinder to get anywhere close to the Dual Boiler’s capabilities. Don’t skimp – if you can’t afford another £300 or so, then split your budget more evenly between a sub-£1,000 machine and grinder.Also, the powerful boilers make themselves heard. Start pulling a shot and the machine begins to thrum excitedly – your flat- or housemates may be less so. Until they taste the coffee, that is.Type:manualDimensions:40 x 37 x 38 cm (WDH)Water tank:2.5lTime to heat up:5minsTime to steam milk:45secsGrinder included:noNoise:60dB (brew), 64dB (steam)Warranty:two-year repair, replace or refund at Sage’s discretionBestassisted espresso machine overall:Ninja Luxe Cafe Premier ES601View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller£499 at John Lewis£499.99 at ArgosWith most assisted machines costing closer to £1,000, this £550-ish machine breaks the mould. Ninja’s superb Barista Assist feature is the best of any machine here – and means that the Luxe Cafe is a viable, and better-tasting, alternative to a fully automatic bean-to-cup machine.Why we love itYou get a lot for the money. The patchwork of black plastics and brushed metal looks good and feels solid, and most of the parts feel hefty. I’m a big fan of the heavy, sprung tamper, which makes it easy and satisfying to get the coffee puck just so.The sheer number of drinks the Luxe Cafe can concoct is dizzying. The coffee staples include espresso, cold-press espresso, filter coffee and iced coffee, and the ingenious milk frother is more versatile than most, producing steamed milk, thin and thick froth and even cold frothed milk. The result? There are few coffee-based drinks it can’t prepare.Ninja’s Barista Assist technology is superb. It’s terrific at dialling in the grind, the dosage and the shot, and it does a better job of tweaking grind size to maintain a consistent brew from shot to shot than any machine here – and for each brewing method. It’s a godsend for users who just want great coffee, but obsessives can still tweak grind size and brew temperature to produce the perfect shot.It’s a shame that …the plastic dosing funnel is an obvious weak point, and given that you need to shove the portafilter under the grinder, we suspect it may be the first part to break. Only time will tell.Also, the controls are initially rather daunting. With multiple buttons scattered across the fascia, and a huge number of drink options, beginners will want to keep the simple step-by-step manual close to hand.Type:assistedDimensions:37x 33 x 37cm (WDH)Water tank:2lTime to heat up:35secsTime to steam milk:2mins 20secsGrinder included:yesNoise:48dB (brew), 58dB (steam), 63dB (grind)Warranty:two yearsBestassisted machine for beginners:Sage Bambino PlusView image in fullscreen£349 at John Lewis£349.95 at AmazonThe Bambino Plus remains a go-to recommendation.

There are pressurised and unpressurised baskets, so you can brew with freshly ground coffee or bags of pre-ground supermarket coffee, and you get single and double baskets for both types.The “razor” dosing tool means you don’t need to shell out on scales right away – it ensures you don’t overpack the portafilter – and the light plastic tamper is fine for starting out. The stainless-steel milk jug and cleaning accessories are a nice touch.The Bambino Plus’s PID temperature controller ensures that brewing temperatures are consistent. It’s not adjustable, but if you feed the machine with medium or dark roast beans and carefully optimise the grind size and dosage, you’ll be pouring consistently good espresso.With zero faff, espresso is very good indeed, but it’s the automatic milk texturing that’s really handy. It’s possible to get better results doing it manually, but being able to hit the button and walk off while the Bambino whips up a silken microfoam is a godsend on busy mornings, or when you’re feeling lazy.It’s a shame that …at this price, the Bambino Plus isn’t much cheaper than models with adjustable brew temperature, such as the Lelit Anna PL41TEM, that give you more versatility when it comes to light or dark roasts. It’s more user friendly, but it’s a question of priorities.Type:assistedDimensions:19 x 36 x 30cm (WDH)Water tank:1.9lTime to heat up:6secsTime to steam milk:56secsGrinder included:noNoise:46dB (brew), 59dB (steam)Warranty:two-year repair, replace or refund at Sage’s discretionBest high-end assisted espresso machine:Sage Oracle JetView image in fullscreen£1,699 at John Lewis£1,699.95 at SageImagine being able to put many of your local coffee shops to shame – and without having the faintest idea where to start. That’s the appeal of the Oracle Jet.Why we love itThe colour touchscreen provides a silky-smooth interface. Slick animations lead users through the preparation and brewing process, and you can pick from 14 preset drinks recipes, including espresso, cappuccino, flat white, iced espresso, cold espresso and cold-brew coffee. You can also add your own.The automatic dosing and tamping works well: just slot in the portafilter, nudge it to the right and the Oracle Jet will grind the perfect amount and tamp the puck beautifully with no faff. Double shots tended to be a little long, but they tasted great – there’s more depth of flavour than any of the cheaper assisted machines here.Sage’s Auto MilQ feature froths dairy, soy, almond and oat-based milks, and temperature is adjustable from 40C to 75C (in case you prefer burned milk). The froth is a bit too bubbly with semi-skimmed milk, but whole milk is wonderfully creamy.Once you gain confidence, there’s oodles of adjustability. The fine grind-size adjustment allows for tiny tweaks, and the brewing temperature adjusts in single degree increments from 86C to 96C.It’s a shame that …at this price, there’s room for improvement. The barista guidance doesn’t adapt as readily as the cheaper Ninja; I’m hoping firmware updates over the wifi connection will improve things. Given the potential of the machine, I often found myself fine-tuning manually – it’s nice to have the option, but arguably defeats the point somewhat.Type:assistedDimensions:38 x 37 x 43cm (WDH)Water tank:2.3lTime to heat up:6secsTime to steam milk:1min 12secsGrinder included:yesNoise:46dB (brew), 58dB (steam), 66dB (grind)Warranty:two-year repair, replace or refund at Sage’s discretionThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: golfcphoto/Getty ImagesSage Barista Touch ImpressView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller£999.95 at Sage£999.99 at CurrysBest for:Sage’s excellent barista assistance at a slightly lower priceLet’s get one thing straight: is the Barista Touch Impress (RRP £1,199.95) twice as good as the £549 Ninja Luxe Cafe? No, it isn’t. Is it still good, though? Yes, very. And despite being another assisted model, it’s a very different type of machine.We love that the touchscreen is more welcoming than rows of buttons and little LED lights. Anyone can walk up to the machine, prod an icon and make some coffee (or a hot chocolate, or babycino). Once you’ve filled the 340g bean hopper and run through the initial setup process, there’s little in the way of faff.There’s nothing to get wrong: the grind is automatic, the lever tamps for you, and as long as you rerun the “intelligent” set-up process when you buy new beans, the espresso is great. Then simply shove the milk jug in place with your choice of dairy or plant-based milks, and the Impress whips it to a pleasing froth. If everyone in the house has their preferred recipe, then they can create their own drinks icon, too.It all feels elegant and slick; it’s more refined than the Ninja. It’s still not as simple or immediate as a brilliant automatic bean-to-cup machine, but the coffee is on a different planet – and all the difficult bits are done for you. The only danger? The hand-holding may embolden nervous baristas to upgrade to a fully manual machine and go it alone.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s still expensive, and now that it’s flanked by the more capable Oracle Jet and the dramatically cheaper Ninja Luxe Cafe, it’s tougher to recommend unequivocally. It’s a great assisted machine.Type:assisted;dimensions:36 x 34 x 42cm (WDH);water tank:2l;time to heat up:5mins;time to steam milk:1min 10secs;grinder included:yes;noise:50dB (brew), 57dB (steam), 69dB (grind);warranty:two-year repair, replace or refund at Sage’s discretionDe’Longhi La Specialista TouchView image in fullscreen£699.99 at De’Longhi£699.99 at John LewisBest for:touchscreen barista guidance for less than rival modelsThe La Specialista Touch sees De’Longhi attempt to blend the ease of use of its bean-to-cup machines with the brewing talents of its La Specialista manual espresso models. The result is a touchscreen-powered, assisted espresso experience for less money than other touchscreen-equipped rivals.The bright colour 3.5in touchscreen leads you through the process step by step. It asks for the roast type of your beans and adjusts the brewing temperature to suit – something other assisted machines don’t tend to automate. It also helps you balance the grind size, dosage and pour with a guided, hands-on approach.Looks and size are a major plus point: this is a nicely styled machine and it’s also relatively compact. Despite the small footprint, the 1.7-litre water tank, which can be topped up in place or unclipped from the rear, is a sensible size and the bean hopper on top has a 180g capacity and 15 grind settings.You also get unpressurised single and double baskets in the box, a nice stainless-steel milk jug and the steam wand has adjustable modes for different dairy or plant-based milks, alongside four temperature settings and five adjustable froth levels.It didn’t make the final cut because …the coffee it brews is good, but not mind-blowing. Milk frothing could be better, too: the automatic mode struggles to produce a genuinely fine microfoam. It’s a shame there isn’t a water filter included. It’s not available to buy, either, which could eventually spell trouble in hard-water areas.Crucially, though, the assisted brewing is below par. Unlike the Sage or Ninja machines, there’s no sensor to detect the correct amount of ground coffee, so you manually have to grind, check the tamp height, grind again, trim, tamp and repeat the process when you change beans. Frankly, it’s as much of a faff as doing it manually.Type:assisted;dimensions:32 x 37 x 40cm (WDH);water tank:1.7l;time to heat up:46secs;time to steam milk:1min 55secs;grinder included:yes;noise:46dB (brew), 70dB (steam), 72dB (grind);warranty:one-year repair or replaceGaggia Classic Evo ProView image in fullscreen£549 at Gaggia£549 at AmazonBest for:hands-on espresso enthusiasts and secondhand bargain huntersThe Gaggia Classic keeps on having things added to its name – Evo, Pro, E24 – but the changes are minor. While recent redesigns have chopped and changed the boiler design between polished aluminium, non-stick coated and brass, it’s otherwise unchanged and remains a firm favourite of upgrade-focused tinkerers.The simplicity of the Classic is its biggest asset: there are no LCD screens or LED-lit, button-clad fasciae. There are three big, clicky buttons. One is an on switch. One brews coffee. One toggles the steam. A big plastic dial at the side opens and closes the valve to the steam wand.You get the essential accessories in the box. The big, heavy 58mm portafilter isn’t beautifully cast, but it’s fine – the 58mm size means it’s easy to find bottomless upgraded alternatives and better-machined baskets – and you get single and double baskets in the box. The supplied plastic tamper fits well in the recycling bin.It didn’t make the final cut because …the Classic Evo Pro is a lovely machine, but to get the best from it you need to modify it straight away. Out of the box, the brew pressure is high, and this can make pulling consistently balanced shots tricky. It’s only a few quid for a new OPV (over-pressure valve) spring and about 10 minutes’ effort to modify it, but it’s a hassle many won’t want.Even with that done, the lack of a temperature controller can make consistent brewing a bit of a stab in the dark. Aftermarket PID upgrades – or turbo-charged mods such as the Gaggiuino – take the Classic into giantkiller territory, but those £200+ DIY projects aren’t for everyone.Type:manual;dimensions:23 x 24 x 38cm(WDH);water tank:2.1l;time to heat up:1min;time to steam milk:1min 24secs;grinder included:no;noise:54dB (brew), 72dB (steam);warranty:three-year repair or replaceWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreen‘The coffee you use, and the way it’s been roasted, presents different challenges.’Photograph: RyanJLane/Getty ImagesHow to make the best espresso at homeTruly great espresso isakin to alchemy. A high-pressure pump forces hot water through a small puck of finely ground coffee at precisely the rate required to draw out a perfect balance of the coffee’s sour, sweet and bitter flavours. Done correctly, the result is a tiny cup of gold-topped ebony.Every facet of the brew must be in equilibrium: the coffee should be fresh (look for a roast date, not a best before); the grind fine, but not too fine; the water hot, but not too hot; and the pressure high, but – you get the idea. If the espresso flows too fast, the sour flavours dominate. If it slows to a drip, the bitterness draws focus. Somewhere in between lies perfection: a staccato drip quickening to an elastic pour. To put it in numbers: you want 15-20g of ground coffee to produce two to three times that weight of espresso in about 20 to 30 seconds.The coffee you use, and the way it’s been roasted, presents different challenges. Beans come broadly in light, medium and dark roasts. The longer a bean is roasted, the softer and more porous it becomes, and this means two things – it becomes easier to dissolve its flavours in hot water, and it goes stale more quickly. The first of these issues is why it’s desirable for an espresso machine to have an adjustable brewing temperature: dark roast beans might only need to be brewed at 80C to 90C before bitterness overwhelms, whereas a more dense light or medium roast bean might need 90C to 96C to mollify the mouth-puckering sourness.If you’re intent on using something other than freshly roasted coffee, then you’ll need to think about baskets. These are the little metal containers that hold the coffee and slot in and out of the portafilter handle, and they come in two options: pressurised and unpressurised.Pressurised baskets are designed to compensate for coffee that is either not fresh enough or too coarsely ground – such as supermarket coffee – by forcing the coffee through a couple of tiny holes underneath. By contrast, unpressurised baskets have lots of pinprick holes all over, and these rely on fresh, finely ground coffee to provide enough resistance to build up a sufficient brew pressure. Using the right type of basket for the coffee you have is essential.What types of espresso machine are there?Broadly speaking, several types of coffee machines claim to brew espresso. There are capsule machines that provide a facile foil-wrapped approximation, fully automatic bean-to-cup boxes that concoct a half-decent espresso at the touch of a button, and then there are “proper” manual espresso machines of the kind you see in coffee shops. You know, the ones with fancy portafilter handles and big stainless-steel exteriors. It’s this latter sort, and their modern “assisted” derivatives, that are covered in this article, and – with no exceptions to the rule – it’s this type of machine that makes the best-tasting espresso.How to choose the right type of coffee machine for youRead moreWhere it gets a little confusing is that there are fully manual portafilter espresso machinesandassisted variations, all of which provide differing amounts of assistance. (To confuse things further, some manufacturers refer to manual espresso machines with integrated grinders as bean-to-cup espresso machines, which are not to be confused with the fully automatic bean-to-cup type, but I digress.)Some machines, such as the Sage Bambino Plus, provide a bare minimum of assistance and leave the grinding, tamping and brewing entirely to you (and you’ll need to buy your own grinder, too). Press a button, however, and they’ll automatically steam a jug of milk to a hot, creamy froth.Right at the other end of the scale, fully assisted machines, such as the Ninja Luxe Cafe or Sage Oracle Jet, are akin to an AI barista: they use integrated grinders and sensors to automatically grind the right amount of coffee into the portafilter, help you to tamp (in other words, squish) it down just so, and then time and measure the shot to ensure that you’re extracting the perfect espresso. Shove the milk jug in place, and they automatically froth the milk to a silky perfect microfoam. The fun barista role play is all yours, though: you get to manually lever the portafilter into place, thunk the spent coffee puck into the bin and attempt to daub latte art on top of your flat white.Sasha Muller is a freelance tech and consumer journalist, avid coffee drinker and craft beer enthusiast with more than two decades of experience in testing products and avoiding deadlines.

But when they became painful and impractical, it transformed my relationship with clothesKimberly CampanelloWed 16 Apr 2025 01.55 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 06.02 EDTShareStyle and comfort have always been of equal priority for me. I got my first pair of Converse All Stars at the mall in Indiana in the 1980s. They were teal and yellow – I would fold the lip of the hi-top over to show off the lemony interior. For my wedding, I wore low-top leather Converse with my white dress. I’ve walked across cities from Rome to Mumbai, Chicago to Oslo – all while wearing Converse, or Fly London boots – looking for vintage one-offs and secondhand gems, clothes made to last.In 2021, aged 41, I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s, a degenerative disease that resulted in symptoms including difficulty moving, especially walking. Dystonia is a common symptom for those of us with young onset Parkinson’s; it involves the involuntary and painful twisting of parts of the body. In my case, dystonia occurs in my back, hands, feet and ankles. When my medications aren’t working, or when I’m tired – and more so as the disease progresses – this drastically curtails my mobility and dexterity. My toes grip the earth, my ankles frequently and painfully roll, sometimes I stumble and nearly or actually fall. It is mentally and physically exhausting, and the pain can take my breath away.As well as affecting my mobility, Parkinson’s also began to transform my relationship with clothes. Soon after my diagnosis, I found that my beloved All Stars had become no good for walking. They induced the twisting in my toes, possibly because the soles were flexible and light. Fly boots were also treacherous: the wedge soles created a high-stakes perch from which my ankles would collapse. NHS orthotics didn’t fit in either brand.My footwear shift began after a transatlantic flight. A fellow traveller, also using special assistance, shared his tip: Nike tactical boots have stiff soles and lace-up ankle support. I began to wear those instead, progressing to Nike Dunk Highs. Soon, I wore nothing else.View image in fullscreen‘Soon, I wore nothing else’ … Kimberly Campanello, left, wearing Dunks, with her friend, the poet Dimitra Xidous, in Volturara Appula, Italy, 2024.Photograph: Courtesy of Kimberly CampanelloThe Flys and All Stars languished in my closet; I found it hard to accept that I would never wear them again. I had clothes, too, that were no longer comfortable – but for so long those shoes had felt like “me”. So much of my life had changed already, and they were a part of my identity I wasn’t willing to sacrifice.A friend suggested selling pieces I no longer wore on Vinted. I listed everything that now made movement difficult and received warm and grateful reviews from those who bought them. I did the same as a buyer, turning to Vinted for my new obsessions: one-of-a-kind funky shirts to wear under longish jackets. Layering helps regulate temperature fluctuations that arise due to Parkinson’s and the side-effects of my medication.I didn’t touch my old shoes for almost a year – not until the time came to invest in a new pair of Nikes. I saw how much my beloved boots could fetch and made a reluctant listing. In a single day, all the Flys were gone.The Converse took longer. I had priced them high, very high – to me, they were priceless. I watched them sit motionless in my real and virtual wardrobes until I received an offer on a grey pair. I accepted. It was the first pair I let go and I wrote a personal note to the buyer, explaining why I would be sad to give them up.A reply arrived, embellished with sweet emojis. The buyer was also a longtime All Stars-wearer; she had just worn through a much-loved pair in the same colour. She sympathised with my reluctance to part with my favourite footwear and told me to keep well. Over time, I connected with other buyers, who also shared stories of illness, bodily change and evolving personal style.These days, I wear whichever shoes give me comfort, aware that this too may evolve over time. I don’t walk as far as I used to, but I still seek out clothes and shoes that will go the distance. I have gained a greater understanding of the things that trip us up, that cause more pain, and what we must choose to let go, as well as the power of kind words to move us, and to keep us moving forward.An Interesting Detail by Kimberly Campanello is published by Bloomsbury (£10.99).

Thewater consumer group CCW also has one on its site. If unsure, you can always call your provider and ask for advice. It can review your usage and compare it with how much you are likely to pay if metered. It is free to have a meter installed but you have to apply through your provider’s website or give the company a call.In Scotland, you will be charged the labour costs for installing a meter, so staying with fixed payments may be the better option. If you do not have a meter, you will probably pay for your water with your council tax. A council tax reduction could mean you also get up to 35% off water and waste.‘Awful April’: bill rises Britons face, from council tax to energy and carsRead moreIf you cannot get a meter in England or Wales, you may be eligible for an assessed charge, which is based on factors such as the size of your property and the number of people in it. You can also apply for asocial tariff. If you are unhappy with the water company’s decision or billing in England and Wales, you can make a complaint to the water redress scheme (WATRS).Have shorter showersView image in fullscreenA lot of 80s classic hits fit the four-minute bill.Photograph: Jonathan Knowles/GettyCutting the time you spend showering to four minutes or less could save more than 50 litres of water compared with an eight-minute shower, which adds up if you are on a meter.To help track the time you could make a playlist of your favourite four-minute songs, or useWater Aid’s Spotify one. Beyoncé’s Run the World (Girls) comes in at 3:55. A lot of 80s hits also fit the four-minute bill. When the song starts to wind down, you will know time is nearly up and the bubbles must come off. Bonus points if it is a song about water or washing.You could still be wasting a lot of water by using an inefficient shower head. A standard version uses 10-15 litres a minute, compared with about six litres a minute for a water-saving one. It works by reducing the amount of water that flows through it using restrictors or aerators, which mix air and water to create a misty spray that feels like a full-flow shower. This allows you to use less water without sacrificing shower pressure, and can save a lot of money in the long run.Even if you are not on a water meter and are paying a fixed rate, changing your shower head can also help to lower your energy bills because it reduces the amount of water that needs to be heated.Take fewer bathsSimilarly, consider reducing the number of baths you take. If you love a soak, this will not be welcome news: a typical bath uses about 80 litres of water, about double the water used in a six-minute shower.You do not have to cut out baths entirely, but taking fewer of them could help you save over time. The Energy Saving Trust estimates that swapping one bath a week for a four-minute shower could save you £9 a year on energy bills.Turn off tapsDo not leave the tap running while brushing your teeth, shaving, washing your face or doing the dishes. This also applies when applying soap, shampoo, or shower gel in the shower. A running tap can waste more than 6 litres of water a minute, according to the industry body Water UK. That is about 24 litres of water wasted every day from just brushing your teeth twice a day.If you spend 10 minutes washing up, that adds up to 60 litres of water. Instead, fill up a washing-up bowl with soapy water. If you need to rinse utensils or wash vegetables, use cold water if possible and when you are finished use it to water your plants.You could also fit a tap aerator. This small device attaches to the spout and mixes air with the water, making the water feel fuller and more forceful, even though less of it is actually being used.It could save you about £16 a year in water if you are on a meter, plus an additional £19 on energy from reduced heating costs, according to the Energy Saving Trust.Get a water-efficient toiletModern toilets, such as low-flow models, typically use about 4.5 litres of water a flush, compared with older ones that can use up to 13 litres or more.Dual-flush toilets offer a lower-water option for liquid waste (about 3 litres) and a higher-water one for solid waste (about 6 litres). Some high-efficiency toilets use even less water. Fitting a new toilet is not cheap, so instead you could get a cistern displacement device, which sits your toilet cistern and saves you about 1-2 litres every flush.Don’t ignore leaksA dripping tap or running toilet can waste up to 400 litres of water a day. Some water companies such asYorkshire Water offer free leak-detection servicesand may even repair them at no cost. You can also buy dye tablets that you put in a cistern to check toilet leaks.According to the UK housebuilder Barratt Redrow, fixing leaks can save a household up to £519 a year, making it an easy and effective way to reduce your costs and conserve resources.Only wash full loadsThe average washing machine load uses 50 litres on a normal cycle.Photograph: evgenyatamanenko/GettyInstead of running your dishwasher or washing machine half-full, wait until you have enough for a full load. The average washing machine uses 50 litres on a normal cycle. Wessex Water estimates that cutting out two washes a week could save you about £50 a year on water and energy bills.Dishwashers are generally more water-efficient than handwashing dishes, using about 9.5 litres of water per full cycle. Opt for eco-friendly cycles and use lower temperature settings for washing.Maintain and replace appliancesRegular maintenance of your washing machine and dishwasher also ensures they run efficiently. Cleaning filters and checking for leaks can prevent them from using more power than necessary. If your appliances are outdated, upgrading to energy-efficient models – which are designed to be water-saving – can further reduce bills. While the upfront cost may be higher, the long-term savings on energy and water make it a wise investment.Buy a water buttIf you have a garden or balcony, collecting rainwater for watering plants or washing your car can help to reduce water use. As it rains quite a lot in the UK, you probably will not have to wait long before it is full. You can pick up a210-litre water butt from B&Qfor about £40; abalcony-friendly 100-litre model costs about £35.Explore more on these topicsWater billsMoney hacksConsumer affairsHousehold billsWater industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not only do these old-fashioned canapés look and taste great, but, as we’re belatedly remembering, the boiled egg, in particular, is a nutritional powerhouse far superior to a mere bowl of crisps. Make up to a day ahead, if necessary.Prep15 minCook12 minMakes84 eggs(see step 1)1 tsp softened butter1 tsp mustard powder3 tbsp mayonnaise, at room temperature (see step 8)¼ tsp flaky celery saltA generous shake of hot sauce½ tsp white-wine vinegar(see step 6)Black pepper, to taste1 small bunch chivesCayenne pepper, to finish1 A note on the eggsIf possible, make these with room-temperature eggs, stored on their side for as long as possible before cooking to centre the yolks and to make for a prettier finished dish. I prefer to buy mixed-sized boxes (large eggs can be painful for the hens; small and medium are kinder), but the timings here will work regardless.View image in fullscreen2 Boil the eggsPut the eggs in a pan large enough to hold them in a single layer and add cold water to cover by about 2cm. Bring to a boil, then immediately turn down the heat to a bare shimmer and leave to cook for 12 minutes. Scoop out into a large bowl or pan of cold water (once cool, the boiled eggs will keep in the fridge for up to a week).3 Peel the eggsTo prepare, lightly rap the eggs against a hard surface to crack the shells all the way round, then, starting at the blunt end, where there’s an air pocket to facilitate matters, peel carefully. I like to do this in a bowl of cold water, because this helps the shell come off even more easily.View image in fullscreen4 Halve the eggsIf you really want to impress your audience, trim a little from the roundest point on each side of the egg, so it will sit flat on a plate (keep the trimmings), then cut in half – use a long, thin knife, dipped in cold water first, to give a neater result.5 Mash the yolks and prep the mayoView image in fullscreenScoop out the yolks into a small bowl and mash with a fork (add the finely chopped egg white trimmings, too, if you have those).View image in fullscreenIn a separate bowl, beat the butter with a fork to soften it further, then gradually beat in the mustard powder and mayonnaise (see step 8 for a quick homemade option), until thoroughly combined.6 Flavour the mayoStir the celery salt, hot sauce and vinegar into the mayonnaise mixture and season with a little pepper.View image in fullscreenMost types of vinegar will work here, but anything dark such as balsamic will give your eggs a less than appetising colour, while malt has a whiff of the chippie. Swap in any other flavourings (for example, miso, curry powder, capers, fish roe, etc) as you fancy.7 Add the mashed egg yolkStir in the crumbled egg yolks. Finely chop the chives, stir into the mix, then taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.View image in fullscreenUsing a small spoon, divide the egg yolk mayo between the hollowed-out egg whites or, if you’re feeling very fancy, pipe it in using a bag and a star-shaped nozzle. Arrange on a plate, dust with cayenne pepper and serve.View image in fullscreen8 How to make a quick mayo …To make a quick mayonnaise, you’ll need a stick blender and a jar or jug that’s barely larger than the head of the blender.View image in fullscreenPut an egg yolk in the jar with a tablespoon each of mustard and cold water and a teaspoon of vinegar. Pour in 225ml of neutral oil followed by 25ml extra-virgin olive oil, then leave to settle for 30 seconds.9 … finish the mayoPlunge the stick blender into the base of the jar and turn it on, keeping it hard against the bottom until you see white mayonnaise begin to billow out from underneath. At this point, very slowly draw the blender up through the remaining oil until it’s all emulsified, then season to taste.Explore more on these topicsEggsFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodSnacksStarterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When I checked his post I was surprised to find a bill from Direct Line addressed to the “executor of RC” stating a “final payment of £148 is overdue” for his cancelled car insurance. This was news to me as my uncle didn’t own a car.I was upset by this and contacted the insurer to suggest that it owed us money, not the other way round. The £670 policy on his Hyundaii30 had auto-renewed in September 2023but he had disposed of the car two months later and died in May 2024.Even if my uncle, who was in his late 80s and had been unwell, still had thecar, I can’t understand how an insurance company thinks it reasonable to request money from an executor. Apart from the lack oftact, it should have been alerted by the closed bank account.SE,LondonI tried to sell my car but was told it had been written offRead moreIn the past year you have been tasked with tying up two estates after the death of your father and uncle, and the bureaucracy has been overwhelming. This was the final straw. Every organisation has a different process, you say, and while some want to deal with “sadmin” online, others demand physical documents. By the time this demand arrived you’d had enough.After I contacted Direct Line it moved quickly to make things right. It refunded the £700 for the previous year’s policy and also awarded your family £200 compensation because its “service fell below our expected standards”.Direct Line said: “We have a dedicated bereavement team supporting customers; however, on this occasion the correct procedure for cancelling SE’s uncle’s policy was not followed. We have offered our sincere apologies to SE, confirmed the policy has been cancelled and the charges waived.”This was not about the money; you want companies to do a better job of helping the bereaved. “How many people are in the same situation as me?” you wonder.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Australia’s opposition leader Peter Dutton risks turning off votersDutton has taken the Liberal party further to the right, but his strategy of aping the US president could be unravelling as Trump tariffs cause chaosSee all our Australia 2025 election coverageAnne Daviesin SydneyWed 16 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTSharePeter Dutton, the man who would be prime minister of Australia, is one of the hard men of the country’s politics.So, with Australia facing a federal election now set for 3 May, it was not a huge step for him to start road-testing some of the language and policies of Donald Trump after his win in the US last November.The burly former Queensland policemancourted controversy more than onceduring his spells as immigration, home affairs and defence minister, none more so than when he wrongly claimed in 2018 that Melbourne residents weretoo terrified to go out to dinnerdue to African gangs in the streets.Donald Trump in the White House seemed like a plus for Peter Dutton. But after this week, maybe not so much | Josh ButlerRead moreSince becoming leader of the opposition after the last election in 2022, Dutton has taken the once-broad church of theLiberal party– the larger of the two parties that make up the conservative Coalition – further to the right.The cost-of-living crisis has taken the shine off Anthony Albanese’s Labor government. It has given renewed force to the Coalition’s mantra that they are better economic managers and taxes are always lower when they are in power.But Dutton has added red meat:campaigning on migrationand crime,big cuts to the “wasteful” public service, an end to“indoctrination” of schoolchildren, andattacks on renewable powerin favour of his landmark election promise to add nuclear power to Australia’s energy mix.In late 2024 it looked as though the strategy was working, particularly following Dutton’s success in campaigning for a no vote inthe 2023 referendum on an Indigenous voice to parliament.View image in fullscreenLeader of the Opposition Peter Dutton at a petrol station in Hoxton Park in Sydney on day 11 of his 2025 Federal Election CampaignPhotograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPBut Dutton’s nods to Trump since the US election are now looking like a liability as Australians, like the rest of the world, worry about Trump’s unpredictable tariff policy imposed on friends and enemies alike and the economic chaos it has unleashed.“Perhaps it seemed like smart politics to attempt to emulate the success of Trump and other conservative leaders,” says Peter Lewis from Essential, the Guardian’s pollster in Australia, which also conducts qualitative research for the governingLabor party.“The whole strategy of this term was to protect his right base and ensure it didn’t splinter out and go elsewhere. It worked so well for him – he got 60% of the population agreeing with his proposition – and he thought: this can work.“And it was working overseas. It was kind of a logical conclusion to draw, particularly if you have lost all your progressive base.”Dutton’s borrowing from the Trump playbook hasn’t been subtle.In January he announced that Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, the senator who spearheaded the no campaign on the voice referendum,would take on a new “important role”: shadow minister for government efficiency.Sound familiar? Dutton stopped short of proposing an agency similar to the Doge in the US, headed by Elon Musk. But the message was the same.He promisedbig cuts to Australia’s federal public service: 41,000 out of a total bureaucracy of 185,000, excluding the defence forces.“With Australians sick of the wasteful spending that is out of control under the Albanese government … Jacinta will be looking closely at how we can achieve a more efficient use of taxpayers’ money,” Dutton said.He singled out positions such as “culture, diversity and inclusion advisers, change managers and internal communication specialists” as ripe for the axe.“Such positions, as I say, do nothing to improve the lives of everyday Australians.”It’s true that the public service has grown by16.8% in the past three years,but that’s partly because Labor took a hatchet to the Coalition’smassive spending on private sector consultantsover the previous decade.In further echoes of Trump, Dutton said the 41,000 “Canberra public servants” had been added in the nation’s capital.The only problem was that only about 7,500 of the new hires were actually in Canberra, with the rest scattered across the country, including in outer suburban and regional areas Dutton was hoping to woo.Labor gleefully attacked, asking daily for detail on where the cuts would fall and what services would be cut.Last weekDutton changed his tune, saying the cuts would be achieved gradually by “natural attrition” and a hiring freeze, and that undefined “frontline” services would be protected.View image in fullscreenAustralian prime minister Anthony Albanese speaks to the media during a visit to Palmerston Medicare Urgent Care Clinic in the electorate of Solomon on Day 13 of the 2025 federal election campaignPhotograph: Lukas Coch/AAPFor his part, Albanese has been quick to link Dutton to Trump at every opportunity.“We don’t have to adopt all of America’s policies,” he said.“[Dutton] is so policy-lazy, him and his team – if they hear something on the news, an announcement from overseas about sacking public servants, or people working from home, or DEI, the dreaded inclusion policy they’re so worried about, they say, ‘yeah, I’ll have some of that’.”He was labelled “Temu Trump” by a Greens MP in parliament, but the nickname hasn’t stuck, despite his party’s Trumpian “Let’s get Australia back on track” slogan.On energy policy, Dutton has not gone as far as Trump’s call to “drill, baby, drill”, but he has enthusiastically embraced expanding gas exploration to fill Australia’s energy needs in the interregnum before the Coalition’s planned nuclear plants come on line by around 2040.Dutton has vowed tocancel offshore windfarmsbecause they are “a scar” on the landscape and, like Trump, he has suggested theymay harm whales, despite the lack of scientific evidence.As concerns about immigration have helped propel right wing parties governments around the world, Dutton has proposed reducing legal migration to Australia despite concerns from the business community and universities, which depend on overseas students.Lewis says the polls suggest Trump-style language and policies appeared to be working until Trump took power and just started governing.“They clearly thought they were on a winner and this would be the horse that would get us across the finishing line. But now it’s jumping and bucking and they are struggling to hang on,” Lewis says.AnEssential poll of 2,000 voters in March– before the tariff announcements – showed 62% thought Trump would be negative for the global economy compared with just 24% who viewed him as a positive. About 61% said he would be a negative for the Australian economy.Guardian Australia’s poll tracker– which averages out the main published polls over time – shows Labor has been steadily gaining ground since mid-February, due less to any great fervour for Albanese’s government and more to an alarming slump in support for the Coalition.Lewis has been sitting in on focus groups during the first few weeks of the campaign.“President Trump’s decision to impose world-wide tariffs – including 10% on Australian exports to the US – has created a very negative reaction among many Australians, and to the extent Dutton is associated with Trump, this is a clear negative for the Coalition,” Lewis says.Separate focus group researchrevealed by news.com.au, a News Corp publication, found voters reaching for words such as “extreme”, “creepy”, “aggro”, “charmless”, “scary” and even “evil” to describe Dutton (they were not much more flattering about Albanese). But above all they found the opposition leader was “too much like Trump”.Lewis says: “For Dutton to win he now has to convince people that he is the best way of protecting Australia from the craziness of Trump and that’s hard.”It hardly helped when Price, who had been touted as one of the Coalition’s star campaigners,blurted out at the weekendthat a Dutton government would “make Australia great again” and then accused the media of being “obsessed with Donald Trump”.Coalition representatives rushed to hose down the comments as “inadvertent” and “a slip of the tongue”, butimages then emergedof the senator explicitly endorsing the US president in December.It must have seemed like a good idea at the time.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Peter DuttonLiberal partyCoalitionAustralian politicsAnthony AlbaneseLabor partyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This time, three women had been injured earlier that afternoon by a female rhino outside Laukhani village in the park’s buffer zone.The hospital had bandaged up their fractured legs and ribs and treated the bites on their hips and knees. “Normally rhinos are vegetarian, but they use their incisors for attacks,” says Aryal. Those incisors can grow to three inches long.It is difficult but we have to accept it, what can we do? It is a species we need to protect. This is the land of rhinoRam Kumar AryalIncidents like this are not unusual. In the past six months,eight peoplehave been killed by rhinos in the Chitwan national park buffer zone –a 750 sq km (290 sq miles) area surrounding the park, which is home to 45,000 households. In towns here, rhinos can often be seen wandering the streets, sauntering past restaurants, bars and motorbike stands, snoozing on hotel lawns and grazing in people’s back gardens. Residents are curious but wary of them.View image in fullscreenRhinos in a garden in Sauraha, Nepal.Photograph: Paul Hilton/Earth Tree ImagesThe women survived by jumping inside a hollowed out tree, says Aryal, who used to work for the semi-governmental organisation the National Trust for NatureConservation(NTNC). Two years ago, Aryal’s uncle was found dead after he had gone out looking for vegetables in the jungle. They found rhino bite marks on his body and prints nearby. “It is difficult but we have to accept it, what can we do? It is a species we need to protect,” says Aryal. “We still respect rhinos. This is the land of rhino, with human beings in.”When the park was created in 1973 there were 100 greater one-horned rhinos.Now there are almost 700in Chitwan, 90% of Nepal’s total. The human population is also growing, with300,000 peopleliving in the buffer zone, which has made it a hotspot for human wildlife conflict. It is not just rhinos – the park’s growing population of elephants, tigers and sloth bears have also killed humans.View image in fullscreenSome tamer rhinos – usually rescue animals – are stationed more permanently in the villages.Photograph: Paul Hilton/Earth Tree ImagesThe greater one-horned rhino is classified asvulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN) and was once close to extinction. Its population recovery is considered one of Asia’sgreat conservation success stories, thanks to strict protection in Nepal and India.Wild rhinos typically pass through villages on their way to cropland on the other side, but some tamer rhinos are stationed more permanently in the villages. These resident rhinos (often rescue animals) generally ignore people.View image in fullscreenThe resident rhinos usually ignore humans; local people recognise individuals and know their temperaments.Photograph: Paul Hilton/Earth Tree ImagesOne, named Meghauli, was rescued from a flood when he was two or three and cared for by NTNC staff. “He was already the size of a horse,” says Aryal. When it was time to go back into the forest, Meghauli didn’t want to go – he was getting picked on by bigger males. “When his incisors – or teeth – are bigger he will go into the jungle. They will be his main instrument for fighting,” says Aryal. “Of course, people will miss him when he goes into the forest.”Other tame rhinos include Pushpa and Anjali, who were abandoned by their mothers and raised by park authorities. Local people recognise them and know their temperaments, but two months ago, someone mistook a wild rhino for one of the adopted ones and was killed.View image in fullscreenMost people in the area have a positive attitude towards rhino conservation, despite the challenges of living in close proximity with them.Photograph: Paul Hilton/Earth Tree ImagesView image in fullscreenLocal people feed them and leave out buckets of water for them.Photograph: Paul Hilton/Earth Tree ImagesRabin KC, a conservationist from NTNC who grew up in the village, says: “The domesticated rhinos haven’t killed anyone in Sauraha. But it could happen – at the end of the day, they are wild. If you pull their tail they might attack.” Despite this, he says local people are fond of them. “People are not that anxious about the orphan rhinos in Sauraha. They are earning good money from them, so they are welcoming them, by feeding them and giving them buckets of water.”The village is popular with tourists visiting Chitwan national park, which attracted185,000 foreign visitorsin 2019. Within Sauraha village there is a Rhino Lodge and Hotel, a Hotel Rhino Land, and Rhino Residency Resort. “They may not see the rhino in the park, but they can see them in the streets,” says KC. “Locals are earning a good amount of foreign currency and welcoming a lot of tourists. Sometimes, people are making TikTok videos of the rhinos.”View image in fullscreenSauraha village has embraced its rhino attraction, with many locals appreciating the income they generate.Photograph: Paul Hilton/Earth Tree ImagesBirendra Mahato, founder chair of the Tharu Cultural Museum and Research Center, who lives in Sauraha, says he personally knows more than 20 people who have been killed by rhinos.His parents – who are farmers – used to live inside what is now the national park, but were removed from the land into Sauraha village when the park was designated in 1973. “The conflict with rhinos mostly impacts poorer, Indigenous people, who have no land. Those who are poor need to go to the park to get fuel or grass, and at the same time they are attacked,” he says.Those living closer to the national park, who are most dependent on its resources, have the most negative attitudes towards rhinos,research suggests. Yet out of 200 local people surveyed, only two said they did not care about rhino conservation. “Despite their fear and the amount of crop damage caused by the rhino, people still have a positive attitude towards the rhino conservation,” the study found.View image in fullscreenAlmost 700 rhinos live in Chitwan national park.Photograph: Paul Hilton/Earth Tree ImagesMahato says government policies need to provide more support to those most affected. “People don’t mind rhinos coming into the villages, but they mind when they eat their crops and they get no compensation,” he says. Sometimes they do get compensation, but it is slow, and often only amounts to 20% of the total damage. If a human is killed by a large predator, the family getsone million Nepali rupees(£5,500).Nepal’s rhino conservation work has been hailed as a great success, but some people living alongside these animals are paying the highest price. “You cannot compensate a life with money,” says KC.View image in fullscreenSome argue that there should be better compensation for damage to crops as well as injuries and deaths caused by the animals.Photograph: Paul Hilton/Earth Tree ImagesFind moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsConservationThe age of extinctionWildlifeNepalSouth and central AsiaAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Behind them, girls sit with their heads covered, praying. On the top-floor terrace a feast of steaming rice, meat and vegetable gravy is being prepared.It is a bright Sunday afternoon in February. The young people are mostly asylum seekers from Senegal, who live in detention centreswhere conditions can be brutal,according to Spanish human rights groups.Senegalese made up a significant proportion of therecord number of migrant arrivalsto the Canary Islands last year. Nearly 47,000 people reached the Spanish archipelago in 2024 via the increasingly deadly Atlantic migration route from Africa.View image in fullscreenMany teenagers come to thedahirato find a sense of community and relieve their anxietiesMore of the country’s young people are leaving the west African country because of a dearth of jobs. Most want to make more money in Europe, but asylum systems abroad, particularly in the Canaries, are overwhelmed.In this house, though, the teenagers see themselves simply astalibés,students who aredisciples of the Mouride – a Sufi order with roots in Senegal. “We feel like we’re back in Senegal when we come here,” says Mame Diarra, 18, who arrived on the Spanish island a year ago and lives at a women-only holding centre.Senegal’s Mourides make up about 40% of the country’s Muslim-majority population and are the second largest of a handful of rival brotherhoods, which date back to the 17th century, when locals turned to sects in numbers to organise against French colonisation.View image in fullscreenThe mosque in the Gran Canariadahira. On the wall is a photo of Amadou Bamba – the only known one of the Mouride’s founderAmadou Bamba, the revered founder of the Mouride brotherhood, preached non-violent resistance against colonisation and was forced into exile first to Gabon, then Mauritania. Each year, four million people mark Bamba’s exile in aGrand Magal, or pilgrimage, to the Senegalese city of Touba, the sect’s headquarters.Mouride circles, ordahiras,like the one in Gran Canaria, are partly a school and partly a social network, connecting people of shared allegiances in a tightly knit, familial bond. That makes the group, which counts two former presidents as members, politically influential.View image in fullscreenFor those in need, thedahiraprovides food and temporary shelterBamba gained a saint-like reverence upon his return from exile, which means Mourides see migrating as sacred, says Cheikh Babou, a history professor at the University of Pennsylvania.Many Senegalese people seek to move, to earn more and send money home, but for Mourides there is an added spiritual incentive and the assurance of a safety net wherever they go.We speak to them about their concerns and tell them to be patient. We are like their support centrePapa GueyeDahirasfrom Paris to New York have garnered thousands of followers who send huge amounts of money back to Touba each year for the upkeep of the Grand Mosque, one of the largest in Africa.Their economic power means they are increasingly shaping the movement, a prickly topic for sheikhs in Touba who fear their power is being chipped away, Babou says. Onedahirain Italy established a three-day marathon supplication festival, now celebrated by others, even in Senegal. Another in mainland Spainbuilt a massive Touba hospital.Connecting both worlds aremarabouts– religious teachers who periodically visitdahirasabroad, offering spiritual advice and receiving donations.

When he visits in February, he eagerly points out his great-grandfather’s lifesize photo in the waiting room.In a separate, dimly lit room in the building, Papa Gueye, the island’s Mouride president, sips coffee. Members of the sect donate enough to maintain the building and the work within – even the young asylum seekers, who sometimes get a token sum from their centres, he says.Thedahirauses the money to provide food and temporary shelter to those in need; the rest goes back to Touba. Last year, the group contributed €25,000 (£21,000) of the €150,000 total sent back fromSpain.View image in fullscreenPapa Gueye, Gran Canaria’s Mouride presidentGueye, who left his teaching job in Senegal and now works as a taxi driver, says the community is doubly needed in the Canary Islands because of the thousands of Senegalese desperately seeking residence papers or jobs after their harrowing journey from the African mainland.Besides the problem of overwhelmed asylum centres, children fear turning 18 – whenas adults they will no longer be entitled to government support. Gueye says he tries to give them “peace of mind”.“We speak to them about their concerns and tell them to be patient [with their residence papers],” he says. “We are like their support centre.”Around the corner from thedahira, three maletalibéssit on a park bench, glued to their phones.

However, those rights do not automatically apply once they turn 18.“At the age of 18, Spanish authorities say asylum seekers no longer need any form of guardianship since they are considered adults and are abandoned by the government and are left to fend for themselves,” Ndiaye says.The Spanish government was approached for comment.‘Barcelona or death’: mothers watch and wait as Senegal’s men risk all to reach EuropeRead moreSeveral humanitarian organisations on the island have opened their doors to help the 18-year-olds, but housing in these reception centres is limited, says Ndiaye.At thedahira, the soulful recital continues late into the evening, resonating peace and calm throughout the room.

This has prompted concern that a specific brand ofChristianitywill be prioritised over other faiths and Christian denominations.With Trump having recently been pictured being prayed over in the White House by a host of white Christian nationalists, concerns are rising about what a government influenced by those beliefs could mean. White Christian nationalists typically are anti-LGBTQ+, anti-immigration and anti-efforts to ensure racial equality, and broadly believe that America was founded as a white Christian nation and must be returned to such.“We will see the further dismantling of government institutions. We will see an abandonment of democratic principles and a further perversion of the institutions of justice,” said Katherine Stewart, a journalist and author ofMoney, Lies and God: Inside the Movement to Destroy American Democracy, which explores what Stewart calls the “antidemocratic movement” – a mix of Christian nationalists, billionaire or super-rich oligarchs and conservative ideologues who have seized control of the Republican party, and aim to fundamentally change the US.“Trump’s anti-Christian bias taskforce will lead to a further chilling of free speech, political opposition, and investigations of corruption. We will see public funds flowing directly to religious institutions, and the insertion of the Bible and sectarian messaging in public schools, town meetings and other places that serve religiously diverse populations. The intention is to make anyone who is not onboard with their agenda feel that they don’t belong.”The faith officeis headed by Paula White, the tongues-speaking, multimillionaire televangelist who called the Black Lives Matter movement the “Antichrist” and said Jesus would have been “sinful” and not “our Messiah” if he had broken immigration law. And the other appointees to the WHFO are also Christian.Trump appointed Jennifer Korn as deputy assistant to the president and faith director of WHFO. Korn was previously senior adviser of the National Faith Advisory Board,the rightwing, Trump-backingChristian group founded by White.Jackson Lane will serve as deputy director of faith engagement. Lane graduated from Missouri Baptist University and was previously deputy director of faith outreach for the Trump-Vance 2024 campaign.Barack Obama had a similar faith-based office, but his leadership notablyincluded people of Muslim and Jewish faith. In announcing his own office, Joe Biden said that “when Methodists and Muslims, Buddhists and Baptists, Sikhs and Secular Humanists serve together, we strengthen one another and we strengthen America,” and his office sought to include a range of religious voices, including atits 2022 United We Standanti-hate summit.The makeup of Trump’s faith office is so far “not at all” representative of the various religions practiced in the US, said Kristin Kobes Du Mez, a professor at Calvin University and research fellow at the center for philosophy of religion at the University of Notre Dame.“It’s not even representative of Christianity in the United States,” said Du Mez, who authored the book ​​Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation.“It’s a pretty narrow slice of rightwing, predominantly, but not exclusively, white conservative Protestantism. But that is the Christianity that Trump thinks of when he thinks of Christianity.”Trump appears unlikely to reach out to non-Christians, however, and the contrast between him and his predecessors was shown ina White House post on Xin March.“The White House Faith Office and Faith Leaders from across the country joined President Trump to pray in the Oval Office,” the post read, beneath a photo showing more than a dozen people, most of them white, looking solemn behind Trump, some with their arms on his shoulders. The trophy for the upcoming Club World Cup soccer competition was next to Trump’s desk, apparently left overfrom a photoshootthat had, oddly, taken place a week earlier.The Daily Mailidentified all 15 of the faith leaders, and found that each of them was Christian, including some who are openly Christian nationalist. They included William Wolfe, who worked in the first Trump administration and whotold the rightwing Daily Signalthat he had used the March meeting with Trump to “push aggressively” for pro-life policies.Wolfe claimed that “Christians were not welcome in the Biden administration or the Obama administration,” and according to the Daily Signal said mass deportations were a Christian issue.“We actually believe it is directly related to the preservation of America as we know it,” Wolfe said.Du Mez pointed to other figures who carry a lot of influence in the Trump administration, including Russell Vought, whoAssociated Press reportedhas “unabashedly advanced ‘Christian nationalism”. Vought, one of architects of Project 2025, the rightwing plan for Trump’s second term, was appointed White House budget director in February. It’s one of the less glamorous roles, but holds sprawling responsibilities including managing the development and implementation of the federal budget and overseeing federal agencies.Ina 2021 opinion article, Vought wrote that Christian nationalism was “a commitment to an institutional separation between church and state, but not the separation of Christianity from its influence on government and society”. That influence could extend beyond social issues, Du Mez said.“When people hear ‘Christian nationalism’, they tend to think of a narrow set of [beliefs] prioritizing Christian faith, Christian supremacy – people tend to think of these kind of moral values issues,” Du Mez said.“But it is also anti-woke. It is also anti-immigration, and it is also, if you look historically at the Christian right ideas of Christian America and returning America to its Christian foundations, have always been, for almost a century, intertwined with deregulationism, free market capitalism.”Stewart warned that Trump’s appointment of Pete Hegseth to defense secretary could also be problematic. Hegseth drew scrutiny in March after it emerged he had a tattoo of what the Council on American-Islamic Relations described as “a display of … anti-Muslim hostility”, along with other tattoos tied to the Christian crusades. Last yearthe Idaho Capital Sun reportedthat Hegseth “has close ties to an Idaho-based Christian nationalist church”.Also concerning isthe sheer number of peopleinvolved in Project 2025, which the Charles F Kettering foundation, a non-partisan research foundation which seeks to preserve democracy,described as“The Blueprint for Christian Nationalist Regime Change”, who are now in Trump’s government.“It’s not unimportant that there are some people who identify as Christian nationalists who are playing a big role in the administration,” Stewart said.“But what’s important to understand is that the movement is driving policy, whether or not the people who are pushing that policy identify themselves as Christian nationalists or adhere to Christian nationalist ideas.“Part of what we’re also seeing is the favoring not of Christians per se, but of a certain kind of Christianity. Trump and his people are aiming not to just work with the movement, but to shape the movement itself, to make it more faux-populist, demagogic and frankly authoritarian.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationChristianityDonald TrumpUS politicsReligionanalysisShareReuse this content"

As the actor says goodbye to the role, he reflects on celebrity, controversy and masculinityWed 16 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 06.30 EDTShareEarly morning in Penn Badgley’s house has the reassuringly normal noisy chaos that comes with a young family. The actor is in his New York home, preparing to talk about murder and manipulation, while listening out for signs that his wife, who is pregnant with twins, needs help getting their four-year-old son out of the door. She does; he excuses himself, and disappears for a few minutes. If Joe Goldberg, the serial killer Badgley portrays on the hitNetflix series Youis controlling, devoid of love and unable to form relationships, Badgley appears to have created a life that looks the opposite.His time as Goldberg – the role that has been his highest-profile after his big break on another hit series,Gossip Girl– is about to come to an end. The series’ fifth and final season is about to air, and after that, says Badgley with a smile, “I don’t have to speak about Joe Goldberg ever again, if I don’t want to,” before adding: “Of course, I’m sure I will.”Badgley was 30 when he took the role of Goldberg, the intellectual narcissist and obsessive, who stalks, captures and murders the women he claims to love. He will be 39 this year. “So my 30s have been officially defined by him,” he says. He had only recently married Domino Kirke, a singer and doula, and become stepfather to her son, when You began, then they had another son together around the same time the character became a father. “It’s possible that [Goldberg has] made me a better person because he’s caused a lot of reflection,” says Badgley. It was never meant to be a clinical portrait of a serial killer, he says. “Ultimately, the show is about misconceptions or modern myths about love and about masculinity. I’ve been reflecting on love and what that means, and what it means to be a man and a father and a husband, [while] all these things were starting to happen to me in real life as well.”It was inevitable, he says, that Goldberg “has been this exercise in understanding all the things I want to avoid”. He laughs and adds: “That’s kind of obvious to say, like, don’t kill, don’t manipulate, don’t be a predator. But what I’ve had to do is try to understand, in some manner, where these things come from. I’ve found similarities, and had to understand how it could have been possible for me to end up that way, rather than the way that I am.”View image in fullscreen‘Why do we make heroes of evil people?’ … Badgley as Joe Goldberg in You.Photograph: NetflixBadgley seems immensely thoughtful and reflective, in a way that sounds horrendously earnest written down. But, in person, over the weird intimacy of Zoom, he has a lightness and a refreshing lack of mock irony. He was a child actor who went on to find huge success with Gossip Girl, the teen drama that ran from 2007 to 2012. His has been an extremely abnormal coming of age, but his interest in the awkward period of transformation that happens in adolescence is one reason he started, and co-hosts, his podcast,Podcrushed, in which celebrities explore their teen years.In his mid-20s, Badgley was feeling alienated by fame, and unfulfilled by his outward success. It led him to the Baha’í faith, which originated in Iran and parts of the Middle East in the 19th century, and espouses the unity of religions and humanity. “I try to understand the principles I’m living by better, so that I can convert what I’ve been working towards into some kind of service,” he says. “That’s why I’ve tried to deepen the conversations around Joe Goldberg – it’s trying to offer something of meaning. We all have some small part to play, and I’m just trying to convert this part I’ve been given into something that I can make meaningful.”He knows he’s an actor talking about an overblownNetflixshow, but this is where he finds himself, and what if he could make it more? It’s the reason he has spent years talking about male violence, gender equality, and trying to widen his industry’s view on sex scenes. (On his podcast in 2023, Badgley talked about his dislike of sex scenes and said he had asked the You showrunner, Sera Gamble, to reduce the ones he had to do.)“Sexual violence has been rampant for a long time, there’s inequality between the sexes, there’s a lot of reasons we should be concerned with sexuality and want to explore it far more meaningfully than we have, but a sex scene is not doing that,” he says now. “Usually it’s there to titillate, and to say: ‘Ah, the thing you’ve been waiting to see, it’s finally happening.’” And, even then, he adds: “It’s just not the way sex happens, the falling against the wall and grasping at each other’s clothes, all this stuff. There’s no time for condoms, there’s no time for conversation. There’s no time for awkwardness, for real connection. It’s a narrow and simplistic way that we have done it so far, and I’m just not interested in that.”View image in fullscreen‘There’s no way to get past the superficiality of this work’ … Badgley.Photograph: Benedict Evans/The GuardianIn the most recent series of You, Goldberg had moved to London to reinvent himself as an English professor, but developed a new fixation on a woman. If it highlights misogyny, violence and whatever version of masculinity Goldberg is supposed to have, it’s also somewhat schlocky. “It is always ultimately satirical and, wearing the garb of social commentary, it’s never meant to feel utterly real,” he says. “The ways it’s exploring its themes feel truthful and meaningful, but I don’t think the journey there is meant to feel real. We use camp and absurdity in a way that I think saves us and the viewer from, I don’t know, a more grisly exercise.”In the books by Caroline Kepnes, on which the series is based, Goldberg is far less likable. One of the criticisms the show has faced is that it glamorises stalking and violence against women, and their version of Goldberg – embodied by Badgley, a man who always looks slightly embarrassed by his own beauty – has shades of the romantic hero despite his obvious monstrousness. To make him as unpalatable as he is in the book would have been too much to sustain a TV show, says Badgley, but the ethics of that has, he says, “been my concern throughout the entirety of this series. Has he been too likable? I personally always struggled with that question. I’ve always wanted to make him less likable at every turn that is possible and plausible, and in this moment, I actually don’t know what to say about that.”Why do we make heroes of evil people? “That’s what I’ve been trying to understand,” says Badgley. “I think we all have to wonder how much value is there in exploring the darker side of human nature. I do think we need to explore the ‘light’ side, and I don’t mean light in a way that is thin or has less gravity.” The show is of its time, he says. “It’s a politically intensifying world, and I don’t think this show would make sense starting right now. It’s ending right now. The way this show plays with questions of how we reward bad people, that was a more playful question eight to 10 years ago. It’s not as playful a question now, and it comes with way more stakes, and I’m glad we’re not going to be playing with it any longer.” He gives a small laugh. “And for that reason, I’m really glad it’s ending.”He takes a long pause when I ask him about how he feels about the state of US politics. “I think it’s more important than ever to understand how the process of unification actually works, because we’re an incredibly divided, massive population splintering more and more into groups who feel they are competing or opposing each other, and I just don’t see that as sustainable. People want to make a lot of comparisons to the past, but we’ve never actually beenherebefore. I take that seriously, and for that reason, I’m being very measured.” He smiles. “Because I don’t think it’s a time when celebrities have a lot to add, that’s for sure.”When Badgley was a child – an only child – his family moved to the “middle of nowhere” in Washington state. “I was very isolated for a time.” Getting involved in local theatre gave him the community he craved. When his parents separated, he moved with his mother to Los Angeles. At the age of 12, he started working and never stopped. “I would certainly not recommend it to anybody,” he says of being a child actor in Hollywood. Looking back at the people he grew up and worked with, most, like him, had come from disintegrated families, drawn to Hollywood as “an opportunity to put a pause on the collapsing family dynamic, sort of have this escape, or this fantasy”. And, for the majority of young actors, a successful career is unlikely, so they also have to deal with a sense of failure at a young age. “There’s a lot of ways in which I think it’s objectively negative, in terms of the value system, for a kid to be growing up around.” If you do succeed, as Badgley did, “you’re succeeding despite your own delusions that it would work. It’s a very weird thing.”View image in fullscreen‘What was that show other than aesthetic? That was its thing, the way we all looked.’ Badgley (second right) with the cast of Gossip Girl.Photograph: Warner BrosAt 20, he was playing the role of Dan Humphrey in Gossip Girl (the shocking twist was that Humphrey, the Brooklyn outsider, was the secret blogger writing about Manhattan’s elite teens; fans have linked the creepy obsessiveness of Humphrey to the psychopathy of Goldberg). Badgley, wary of his loneliness from childhood, found fame isolating and alienating. “Extremely unnatural, just the way that people want to relate to you. It’s not a new idea that fame has all these nefarious dimensions to it. And in order to even appreciate or utilise the privileges that come with it, one has to really grapple with the ways in which it’s completely disabled parts of you or your life, or your relationship to others and society.” He doesn’t expect anyone to feel sorry for him, he says with a laugh, but he points out “the privileges and the sacrifices are both extreme and obscene, and so you have to take them both. In order to be a decent person, a good father and a husband, a good friend, a responsible colleague, I’ve been grappling with all the ways in which this stuff is just not a good way for somebody to live.”As a child, Badgley experienced what he calls “body dysmorphia” – not diagnosed by any doctor or psychologists, he adds. “I know that I hated my body and simply wanted a different one.” He had put on weight – overeating as a response, he thinks, to his parents’ divorce and social isolation, but idolised the men he watched in films, feeling that he should look like them, although “that just seemed like an impossibility”. Becoming an actor, where what you look like is scrutinised, brought extra pressures. “There was just a period where, coming out of depression and isolation, I was jumping wilfully into, but also being thrust into, this world where the more conventionally beautiful I seemed, the more successful I might be, the more value I might have. There’s no way to get past the superficiality of this work, and if you recognise that, you can’t help but recognise the superficiality of our culture, because of the way it rewards this work.”With Gossip Girl in particular, a show about rich teens growing up in the Upper East Side: “What was that show other than aesthetic? That was its thing, the way we all looked.” It was huge for Badgley’s career, but, he says: “I didn’t particularly love the superficial celebrity aspect of the way I was perceived.” By his mid-20s, he realised that success, money and celebrity were not going to sustain him.For a while, he had considered leaving acting. Instead, he sought spirituality – and the Baha’í faith. “That is what allowed me to persevere through the disillusionment, all the things I’d been grappling with, and then come back to it all, but with hopefully some kind of inner transformation.” He says he prays and meditates every day, which has helped him maintain his sanity, along with “the simple stuff of life, like having a family, meaningful relationships with my friends”.Approaching his 40s, with twins on the way, as well as a book in the autumn (and a production company whose projects so far will not feature him as an actor), Badgley seems more than ready to purge himself of Goldberg. Filming the final scenes at about 2am, Badgley found it was something of an expulsion. Over the years, he has felt Goldberg’s rage in his body, particularly in the muscles of his neck. On that night shoot, he found he couldn’t perform, and had a strange feeling of having to cough or vomit up the words. “It was as though I couldn’t sustain the rage any more, couldn’t sustain the levels of artifice with him, just all of it.” He can’t say what happens to Goldberg, if there is justice even. Is it good enough (bad enough)? “Nothing is really good enough. There’s levels to it; it’s not just like: does he die? Does he go to jail? Is he tortured? Does he live and is he miserable alone? It’s really about how we get there.” He thinks, he says, that “we reached truly the best resolution for him”. And there, I think Badgley feels, he should stay.The final season of You premieres on Netflix on 24 AprilExplore more on these topicsTelevisionNetflixYoung peopleDramainterviewsShareReuse this content"

He joined his brother in Maryland and started a new life.In 2019, he was arrested by immigration officials and accused of being a gang member, but his lawyers argued there was no evidence for this, pointed out he had no criminal convictions and insisted he should not be sent back to a country where he was himself at risk from criminal gangs. A judge agreed and gave him protected status so he could not be deported.For the next few years, Ábrego García’s normal life continued. He worked as a metal worker, lived with his wife, two stepchildren and five-year-old son, and started studying again.ThenDonald Trumpreturned to power, on the promise he would begin deporting criminals en masse.

South Africa, one of the world’s most unequal countries, also has one of the world’s highest murder rates, with more than 27,000 that year, 50% higher than a decade earlier.Sullivan was seized on Thursday night while he was preaching at the Fellowship Baptist church, where he had been a missionary since 2018 in the township of Motherwell outside the city of Gqeberha in Eastern Cape province.Four gunmen stormed the church, stealing two mobile phones from congregation members before taking Sullivan. A few hours later, his truck was found abandoned.The kidnappers were eventually tracked to a house in KwaMagxaki, about a 20-minute drive from the church, across the Swartkops River. Suspects inside a vehicle opened fire while attempting to flee, the police said.The Hawks statement said: “The victim was found inside the same vehicle from which the suspects had launched their attack. Miraculously unharmed, he was immediately assessed by medical personnel and is currently in an excellent condition.”Sullivan’s mother, Tonya Morton Rinker, said in a Facebookpost: “My Baby is free! Joshua was rescued earlier today!! He is home with Meagan and the kids … Thank you for your support and prayers.”An earlierpostby Rinker described Sullivan as a “big-hearted gentle giant”. It said the 34-year-old had first travelled to South Africa with his wife, Meagan, for six months in 2015, before returning as “church-planting” missionaries and becoming fluent in Xhosa, the most common language in the Eastern Cape. The couple have four children and have “taken in two Xhosa children”.A report by the Institute of Security Studies, a local thinktank, found 44% of kidnappings were during vehicle hijackings to extort money quickly. Another 22% were tied to robberies, while only 5% were for ransom. It was not immediately clear what the motive for Sullivan’s kidnapping was.Additional reporting by Associated PressExplore more on these topicsSouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

And he said, well, you need to make earlier provisions to go visit Cecot,” Van Hollen said. “I said, I’m not interested at this moment in taking a tour of Cecot, I just want to meet with Mr Ábrego García. He said he was not able to make that happen.”Van Hollen said he offered to come back next week to meet with Ábrego García, but Ulloa “said he couldn’t promise that either”. The vice-president also said he could not arrange for Ábrego García’s family to speak to him by phone. When the senator asked if he could do so, Ulloa told him that the US embassy must make that request, Van Hollen said.“We have an unjust situation here. The Trump administration is lying about Ábrego García,” said Van Hollen, who said his constituent had been wrongly named as a member of the MS-13 criminal gang. The Trump administration has admitted that an “administrative error” led to the deportation of Ábrego García to his native country, despite an immigration judge granting him protected status in 2019.Van Hollen said that he had asked Ulloa if he would consider releasing Ábrego García, to which the vice-president replied by reiterating Bukele’s comments from earlier this week that he would not “smuggle” the deportee back into the United States.The senator’s visit came as Democrats have seized on the deportation and the Trump administration’s refusal to take any steps to return him, in apparent defiance of the supreme court, to argue that the president is plunging the United States into a constitutional crisis by defying the courts.The White House has attacked Van Hollen for his visit to the country, releasing a statement on Wednesday that touted the arrests of suspected undocumented immigrant criminals and saying: “Where was his concern for Maryland constituents put at risk by the many other illegal immigrants allowed to roam free until now?”In an appearance on Fox News, Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, said: “Rather than taking care of the constituents in his state, the victims of illegal crime in his state, he’s going to run to El Salvador to protect an MS-13 terrorist. It’s just disgusting.”Several other Democratic lawmakers have signaled that they would like to visit El Salvador to check on Ábrego García, including Adriano Espaillat, chair of the Congressional Hispanic caucus, and Robert Garcia and Maxwell Alejandro Frost, both members of the House oversight committee.“I can assure the president, the vice-president, that I may be the first United States senator to visit El Salvador on this issue, but there will be more and there will be more members of Congress coming,” Van Hollen said.“This is an unsustainable and unjust moment, and so it cannot continue this way.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationEl SalvadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

None of their responses have been satisfactory.”The threat of contempt proceedings marked a major escalation in the showdown over Donald Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members, without normal due process, in his expansive interpretation of his executive power.It came one day after another federal judge, in a separate case involving the wrongful deportation of a man to El Salvador, said she would force the administration to detail what steps it had taken to comply with a US supreme court order compelling his return.In that case, US district judge Paula Xinisordered the administration to answer questions in depositions and in writingabout whether it had actually sought to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was protected from being sent to El Salvador.Taken together, the decisions represented a developing effort by the federal judiciary to hold the White House accountable for its apparent willingness to flout adverse court orders and test the limits of the legal system.At issue in the case overseen by Boasberg is the Trump administration’s apparent violation of his temporary restraining order last month blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act – and crucially to recall planes that had already departed.The administration never recalled the planes and argued, after the fact, that they did not follow Boasberg’s order to recall the planes because he gave that instruction verbally and it was not included in his later written order.In subsequent hearings, lawyers for the Trump administration also suggested that even if Boasberg had included the directive in his written order, by the time he had granted the temporary restraining order,the deportation flights were outside US airspace and therefore beyond the judge’s jurisdiction.Boasberg excoriated that excuse and others in his opinion, writing that under the so-called collateral-bar rule, if a party is charged with acting in contempt for disobeying a court order, it cannot raise the possible legal invalidity of the order as a defense.“If Defendants believed – correctly or not – that the Order encroached upon the President’s Article II powers, they had two options: they could seek judicial review of the injunction but not disobey it, or they could disobey it but forfeit any right to raise their legal argument as a defense,” Boasberg wrote.Boasberg also rejected the administration’s claim that his authority over the planes disappeared the moment they left US airspace, finding that federal courts regularly restrain executive branch conduct abroad, even when it touches on national security matters.“That courts can enjoin US officials’ overseas conduct simply reflects the fact that an injunction … binds the enjoined parties wherever they might be; the ‘situs of the [violation], whether within or without the United States, is of no importance,’” Boasberg wrote.Boasberg added he was unpersuaded by the Trump administration’s efforts to stonewall his attempts to date to establish whether it knew it had deliberately flouted his injunction, including by invoking the state secrets doctrine to withhold basic information about when and what times the planes departed.“The Court is skeptical that such information rises to the level of a state secret. As noted, the Government has widely publicized details of the flights through social media and official announcements thereby revealing snippets of the information the Court seeks,” Boasberg wrote.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationLaw (US)US politicsVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The commission said that inclusion of a Green leader would “undermine the integrity of the debates and the interests of the voting public”.Canada’s federal election is on 28 April. Only two debates will be held: one in French on 16 April and the other in English on 17 April.In order to qualify for the only two federal debates, a party needs to meet two of three criteria: it must be running candidates in at least 90% of Canada’s 343 ridings 28 days before the 28 April general election, poll above 4% and have a sitting member of parliament. Despite initially indicating they would run a full slate, the Greens eventually only nominated 232 candidates.Pedneault accused the commission trying to “silence” the party, and said the last-minute change was “unjust and baseless”.The decision to exclude the Greens came a day after commission shifted the debate timing to avoid clashing with the Montreal Canadiens-Carolina Hurricanes match. The team is facing a must-win game in order to advance to the national hockey league playoffs.On Tuesday, both the Bloc Québécois and New Democratic party requested the debate be rescheduled. The NDP said in a news release that failing to change the timing of the debate would effectively force people to choose between “political engagement and national pride”.“Hockey is in our blood,” said leader Jagmeet Singh, adding the commission risked looking “out of touch” with the national mood if it didn’t change course.Later that day, the commission relented and agreed to move the debate to 6pm eastern time, a decision supported by all parties.The last time Montreal reached the playoffs was 2021.Trump effect leaves Canada’s Conservatives facing catastrophic lossRead moreChanging the debate because of an important hockey game has precedent: in 2011, the then Bloc Québécois leader, Gilles Duceppe, asked for the French-language debate be rescheduled to avoid conflict with a key playoff showdown between the Canadiens and the Boston Bruins, a request the commission agreed to.The Liberal party ispolling ahead of rival Conservativesand poised to capture a majority government. For the Tories, a party that has seen adramatic reversal of political fortunes, the debates are widely seen as a last-ditch attempt to regain momentum.Explore more on these topicsCanadaIce hockeyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It was completely illogical,” she said.He later appointed herchargé d’affaires in Turkey.Abad claims that Noboa’s main goal was to prevent her from assuming the presidency during this year’s campaign.Despite Noboa’s refusal to step down, Ecuador’s electoral authorities allowed the election to go ahead.After atight first roundin which he edged out González by fewer than 17,000 votes, Noboa won the runoff by nearly 1.2 million – a result that no opinion poll had predicted.González has called for a recount, but observers sent by the European Union and the Organization of American States said that, although there was an “imbalance” and “conditions of inequity” between the candidates, there was no indication of fraud.Shortly before the second round, however, Noboa announced$560m (£423m) in bonuses and social aid packagesfor seven different population groups, including police and military personnel, farmers, and young people aged 18 to 29.“Noboa designed a system of cash transfers – a clientelist policy tactically aimed at the social and electoral segments where he needed to mobilise votes,” said Luis C Córdova-Alarcón, a political violence researcher and professor at the Central University of Ecuador. “That’s how you can begin to understand where that one million-vote lead came from,” he said.Córdova-Alarcón said there were two other contributing factors in Noboa’s victory.The first was the lingering memory of the 10-year presidency of Rafael Correa – González’s political mentor – a period marked by social advances thanks to a commodity boom, but also bycorruptionand accusations of creeping authoritarianism.The second was the fact that what was once one of the safest countries in Latin America has, in recent years, recorded the region’s highest homicide rate – a crisis that Noboa’s declared “war on drugs” in January 2024 has failed to resolve.Noboa’sdisregard for the constitutionand thenumerous human rights violationscommitted by hismano dura(iron fist) offensive earned the president mounting accusations of authoritarianism.Córdova-Alarcón said the outlook was only likely to worsen. “Given the context in which this election has taken place, Noboa has no incentives to change,” he said.Abad said that although she still fears for her life due to her public disputes with Noboa, she hoped that he “has learned to listen and can fulfil his promises because the problems haven’t gone: we still face sky-high insecurity, a struggling economy, and widespread poverty”.In March, the electoral court suspended her political rights for allegedly committing “gender-based political violence” against Noboa’s foreign minister, Gabriela Sommerfeld, by accusing her of persecution. Meanwhile, Abad’s complaints against Noboahave gone nowhere.Noboa’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment, but at a campaign event in late March, the president referred to Abad as “a traitor who’s already been dismissed”.Officially, she remains Ecuador’s vice-president until 24 May, when Noboa begins his new term with businesswoman María José Pinto as his second-in-command.“Until 24 May and beyond, I will continue to fight for my rights because, in the end, it sets a precedent for those women who will occupy this position,” said Abad.Explore more on these topicsEcuadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Party faithful – some in the ill-fitting free T-shirts handed out by staffers – craned their necks for a glimpse of the man they hoped will be the next Canadian prime minister.Hair perfectly parted and clad in his standard-issue crisp blue suit, Poilievre embraced the first supporter, a gesture that appeared to leave her overjoyed. Another supporter, wearing a red “Save Canada” shirt, was crestfallen when Poilievre seemed to miss him, before the leader turned and gripped the man’s hand in a firm shake.The excitement at the rally earlier this month came with an intensity that party strategists could normally only dream of. Poilievre’s populist messaging has inspired a fervent response from his supporters, who say he has given a voice to those who feel ignored and mocked by political elites. And it appeared to have found a broader audience too: as recently as February, Poilievre enjoyed a 25-point lead over the governing Liberals.Pollsters estimatedhe and his party were on track for an unprecedented victory.Canada’s Liberals on course for political resurrection amid trade war, polls showRead moreBut with less than two weeks before Canada’s federal election, one of thesharpest polling shiftsin the country’s political history now has the Conservatives trailing well behind the Liberal party. The abrupt change in the country’s political mood – largely the result of Donald Trump’s tariffs and threats to annex Canada – has prompted infighting within the Conservatives party as it faces what is likely to be a catastrophic loss.As Poilievre and his Liberal opponentMark Carneyprepare for the campaign’s only two debates on Wednesday and Thursday, the Conservatives have pinned their remaining hopes on a last-minute reversal of fortune.Poilievre’s confrontational style, his attack on “woke” politics and his laser focus on the cost-of-living crisis has earned the career politician a cadre of devoted fans and fuelled a meteoric rise within the Conservative party.A viral 2023 clip of Poilievrechastising a reporter while casually munching on an apple receivedpraise from Republicans in the United Statesand captured both his growing disdain for the media and his teeth-bared style of confrontation.Poll graphicAt the recent rally in the city of Brampton, Aris Symeonides, a history teacher, was attending his first federal campaign event in order to witness the brash populist in action.“Poilievre’s vision of building a stronger and more independent nation is really attractive.Mark Carneyis just a technocrat and a devout environmentalist [who] will sacrifice our industry on the altar of that movement. You cannot take a modern economy and pretend that oil and energy don’t matter any more,” he said. “But what I like most is that Poilievre is an attack dog. He’ll really go hard after his opponent.”Poilievre has honed a reputation asa pugnacious fighteron the campaign trail and in parliament. His relentless attacks on Justin Trudeau helped crater the former prime minister’s popularity, leading to his decision to resign in early January.But polls suggest that the persona that won Poilievre legions of adoring fans is hurting him among the broader electorate.Poilievre enjoys strong support among young men, but inrepeated surveys, the Tory leader was viewed poorly among female voters and is the most disliked party leader among all voters. Fears of a possible Conservative victory have also prompted leftwing New Democratic voters to flee the party in favour of Carney, putting the socially progressive party on track for its worst ever electoral result.Over the weekend, Poilievre worked to soften criticisms that his belligerent personality is too jarring to voters, appeared on the popular French-language show Tout le Monde en Parle in Montreal.“I was the leader of the opposition. Now I’m preparing to become prime minister,” he told the hosts. “It’s the time to present hope.”Poilievre rejected comparisons to the divisive US president when he was asked if he was a “mini-Trump, medium Trump or large Trump” – a frequent line of attack by political rivals.Conservative strategist Jamie Ellerton said that the Conservative would need to show empathy for ordinary voters in his debate appearances. “For Pierre to close the deal and get the results the Conservative party want in this election he needs to speak to the anxieties that Canadians are facing.”View image in fullscreenThe Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, makes a campaign stop in Hamilton, Ontario.Photograph: Carlos Osorio/ReutersBut Poilievre’s decision to focus his attacks on Trudeau and then Carney – instead of Trump – has prompted questions over whether the strategy will translate to an electoral win.“Attacking Mark Carney feels like politics as usual. That’s not going to be rewarded in a debate where people are looking for reassurance that the country is going to be OK,” said Ellerton.Behind the scenes, the Conservatives’ loss of one of the largest polling leads in generations has already prompted a fierce round of recriminations.“Blowing a 25-point lead and being, like, 10 points down is fucking campaign malpractice at the highest fucking level. And I’m sorry to have to point that out, Conservatives, but that is the actual reality,” said Kory Teneycke, a campaign manager for Ontario’s Progressive Conservative party, in a recent podcast appearance.Teneycke, who oversaw three conservative victories in 2018, 2022 and 2025 – all of which resulted in majority provincial governments – continued: “This campaign is going to be studied for decades as the biggest fucking disaster in terms of having lost a massive lead in ways that were so obvious, with so much information.”Teneycke is a polarizing figure on the right, but earlier this week, his outburst won the support of Ontario’s powerful Conservative premier, Doug Ford.“He’s the best campaign manager in the country. And to be very frank, if Kory was running that campaign, I don’t think Mr Poilievre would be in the position he’s in right now,” Ford told reporters. “At the end of the day, the people will decide which way we want this country to move forward – but sometimes the truth hurts.”The Conservative party did not respond to a request for comment.But the campaign, which has attempted to distance its leader from the US president, has also been on the defensive over the Trumpish language of some of its supporters. At the Brampton rally, several attenders wore white sweatshirts emblazoned with the words “Do You Believe the Polls?”View image in fullscreenConservative supporters in Brampton, some wearing ‘Do You Believe the Polls?’ sweatshirts.Photograph: Carlos Osorio/Reuters“The polls are swinging so dramatically, they don’t seem like they’re well put together,” said one of them, Paul Micucci, adding that he believed Poilievre was actually ahead by at least eight points. Prominent supporters have startedusing the phrase “too big to rig”when describing the size of the rallies.Liberal activists have been caught trying capitalize on the infighting,distributing buttons at a recent conservative conferencewith the slogan “Stop the Steal”, in an apparent attempt to create the appearance of Maga-like messaging.Despite being on the wrong end of the quickest and most dramatic polling shift in Canadian history, Conservatives still have hope the race can be salvaged.“At this point, it would take something truly extraordinary … to change direction at this point,” said Ellerton. “But two weeks is also a lifetime in politics. At the end of the day it’s math. The Liberal number needs to come down if Conservatives are going to win. You can spend all your time talking about polls, or you can do something about it and get campaigning.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasMark CarneynewsShareReuse this content"

On the same day of the home raids, Wang was fired from his longstanding post atIndianaUniversity over email – a move that goes against the university’s own policy.But Wang hasn’t been charged with any offence, and his lawyer says no criminal charges are pending.The incident has driven fear into the hearts of Bloomington’s Asian community of faculty and students who fear a political motivation.“I study at the computer science department, and I’ve overheard Chinese professors talking about how worried they are that something similar could happen them, too,” says a Chinese PhD student who came to Bloomington from Suzhou, Jiangsu province, last September and who asked not to be named given the sensitivity of the issue.During the first Trump administration, the Department of Justice createdthe China Initiativein an effort to find and prosecute spies for Beijing working in US research and development sectors. At the time, it was criticized by rights groups for fueling racial profiling and violence against Asian Americans, and a review by the Biden administration saw the effort ended in 2022.Now as before, Trump has made targeting universities whose leadership and faculty he believes run against his own agenda a key element of his second term.Forthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Gang Chen, what happened to Wang “brings chills to our spines”.“What is particularly troubling in this case is that Indiana University fired him and his wife without due process, presuming guilt instead of innocence,” Chen says.Chen, who has US and Chinese nationality, found himself charged by the Department of Justice for allegedly failing to disclose links to Chinese organizations on a grant application for a federally funded project, with just weeks remaining in Trump’s first term, in January 2021.The charges were dismissed a year later.“The investigations on Professor Wang and his firing creates huge fear among researchers of Chinese descent, especially students and postdoctorates fromChina. It is clear that such events, together with legislation and hostile rhetoric, are driving out talents. I learned that many Chinese students and postdoctorates here are considering leaving the US.”More students from China come to the US to study and research at third-level institutions than from any other country.The fear of Chinese spies operating in the US isn’t completely unfounded.Areport released recentlyby US intelligence agencies found that China remains the top cyber threat to America, and many politicians on the right believe smaller colleges in low-key parts of the country such as the midwest could be used as gateways into the US by the Chinese Communist party.In October,five Chinese studentsat a college in Michigan were charged with spying on a military training camp where Taiwanese soldiers participate. This month, information on several Chinese students at Purdue University, also in Indiana, was sought by members of Congress,claimingnational security interests, though no charges have been brought.But the vast majority of the estimated 300,000 Chinese academics and students in the US today are in the country to legitimately contribute to research and to learn, say experts who fear that Trump’s targeting of colleges deemed to be antisemitic may now be shifting to the midwest.Last month, the Department of EducationnamedIndiana University Bloomington among 60 colleges under investigation for alleged antisemitic discrimination, a move that could result in funding cuts.It’s not only Chinese academics and students who could be affected.Universities in Illinois, Indiana and other heartland states are home to some of the largest Chinese student populations in the country.Nearly half of Urbana-Champaign’s combined population of 130,000 people in neighboring Illinois is made up of college students and staff. Nearly six thousand are students from China.In Bloomington, which has a population of under 80,000 people, close to 50,000 are students, with nearly 10% coming from overseas.Midwestern colleges and the communities around them are keen to attract international students and rely heavily on the money they bring with them; about2,000 Chinese studentsenroll at Indiana University every year. International undergrad students arechargedan average of $42,000 in tuition and fees, alongside $14,000 in housing and food, bringing hundreds of millions of dollars into the college and town.Over the years, these and other small university towns have come to rely on international students to prop up their economies.A couple of blocks west of the University of Indiana Bloomington campus, a grouping of Chinese, Korean and Asian eateries cater to the college’s large Asian community. The sidewalk in front of the Longfei Chinese restaurant is dotted with food signs written in Mandarin. The restaurant’s manager, however, says he believes that the political problems between Washington and Beijing have seen the number of Chinese students coming to the US – and through his doors – fall in recent years.The Chinese PhD student, who one recent morning is here grabbing lunch, says his student visa status allows him to stay in the US for up to five years, but he and his Chinese colleagues are worried that the Trump administration may cut that short.“I’m concerned with President Trump’s hostility against China and this kind of hostility may affect Chinese students and professors, and the funding that we get,” he says.“I’m concerned about the impact on my life.”Faculty at the department where Wang worked for more than two decades have called for Indiana University to revoke his dismissal. His profile page on the University’s website has been removed and college authorities have not commented on his firing.“Neither Prof Wang nor Ms Ma [his wife, who worked as a library analyst at the same university] have been arrested … further, there are no pending criminal charges as far as we are aware,” says Jason Covert, a lawyer at Taft Stettinius & Hollister, a firm representing Wang and Ma.“They look forward to clearing their names and resuming their successful careers at the conclusion of this investigation.”Covert would not say whether Wang planned to remain in the US.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsChinaIndianaAsia PacificUniversitiesUS universitiesHigher educationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Reynolds accused Jingye of not acting in good faith after itthreatened to shut down British Steel’s furnaces at Scunthorpewithin days, with the loss of 2,700 jobs.The government stepped in on Saturday to avoid the shutdowns withemergency legislationto take control of British Steel.UK government refuses to rule out redundancies at Scunthorpe steelworksRead moreIn its first public comments since the government stepped in, Jingye said on Wednesday that it “request[s] that the UK government respect and protect the legitimate rights and interests of Jingye as a foreign investor throughout this process”.In a statement provided to the Financial Times, Jingye said it would “seek a proper solution that ensures a bright future for British Steel”, and added that it had previously safeguarded jobs and made investments in the plant.The dispute over the future of the Scunthorpe furnaces has threatened to worsen the UK’s already troubled relationship with China, even as theLabourgovernment seeks to boost inward investment.China’s embassy said politicians objecting to the country’s involvement in the UK steel sector “took the opportunity to attack all Chinese companies and the Chinese government”, after awarning by the country’s foreign ministryearlier on Monday against “politicising” the situation.In an unusual question-and-answer format, the embassy wrote: “The anti-China rhetoric of some individual British politicians is extremely absurd, reflecting their arrogance, ignorance and twisted mindset.”Jingye was approached by the Conservative government in 2019 to take over British Steel after its previous owner, the private equity firm Greybull Capital, walked away. British Steel haslost more than £350msince then. Jingye said last month it would close the blast furnaces, and it turned down an offer of £500m in UK government support to switch from the polluting blast furnaces to cleaner electric arc furnaces.Reynolds said the UK had “got it wrong in the past” about allowing Chinese investment in strategically important industries such as steel, and highlighted the influence of the Chinese government on private companies. “I wouldn’t personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector,” he said on Sunday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves,visited China in Januaryto try to drum up investment, andReynolds is due to visit the countrylater this year, despite his criticisms.The embassy credited Jingye with saving workers’ jobs in 2020 and said it was “a normal decision” by the company to close the blast furnaces, adding that the dispute could hit Chinese investment in the UK. It contrasted the treatment of China with the alleged lack of criticism of Donald Trump’s tariffs. The embassy wrote: “What on earth are they up to?”“Any words or deeds that politicise or maliciously hype up business issues will undermine the confidence of Chinese business investors in the UK and damage China-UK economic and trade cooperation,” it added.A UK government spokesperson said: “We will take a consistent, long-term and strategic approach to managing the UK’s relations with China, rooted in UK and global interests.“We will continue to support UK business to engage with the second largest economy in the world, while being clear-eyed to any risks and ensuring security and resilience.”Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelChinaSteel industryJonathan ReynoldsLabourAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He verballed the president of Indonesia,” he told the press conference.“Verballing” is a term for the misattribution of a statement to another person.The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, went even further and claimed Dutton’s comments were a “disqualifying moment” for his bid to win government.“He is temperamentally unfit to manage our relationships in the world and to manage our economy here at home,” Chalmers said.Chalmers also claimed Dutton “lies in ways that are bordering on the pathological about the Australian economy”.Coalition MP Colin Boyce told climate science deniers blackouts a ‘big political opportunity’Read moreWong told the ABC that Dutton had “fabricated a statement” by Prabowo, and that the government had engaged with Indonesia through “the appropriate channels” to confirm that Indonesia would not allow Russia to base planes there.“Peter Dutton fabricated a statement by the Indonesian president,” Wong said.“Now, this is an extraordinary thing for a man who wants to be the prime minister to do – to actually try and verbal the president of Indonesia in order to make a domestic political point.“He is simply too reckless and too aggro.”The shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, was asked later about Wong’s accusations on ABC News Breakfast and said the comment was “bizarre” and “very defensive”.“Clearly she was blind-sided by this report and has been on the back foot since,” she said.Matthew Sussex, a strategic and defence studies centre fellow at the Australian National University,wrote in the Conversationthat Indonesia and Russia have been deepening military ties since Prabowo came to power in October.Moscow has tried “on numerous occasions to pivot to Asia to give itself more economic heft and leverage in the region”, he wrote.“The Kremlin is also cognisant that Europe won’t be a friend for the foreseeable future.

Its shares have risen by more than 1,400% since 2020, making it one of the few businesses in the US worth trillions of dollars.However, the news on Tuesday sent Nvidia shares down about 6% in after-hours trading in the US, which could wipe off billions from its market value at the opening bell on Wednesday.A chipmaker sell-off has already started in Asia, with South Korean semiconductor businesses such as Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix falling by as much as 3% overnight. In Europe, shares in ASML dropped 5% in early trading after its chief executive, Christophe Fouquet, said: “The recent tariff announcements have increased uncertainty in the macro environment and the situation will remain dynamic for a while.” The Dutch company, which produces lithography machines used to make chips, also reported that orders in its first financial quarter were €3.94bn (£3.37bn), about €1bn less than investors had expected.Shares in the US competitor Advanced Micro Devices also fell 7% in after-hours trading.While so far the chip industry has been exempt from the 10% tariffs that started on 5 April, Trump said he would announce a levy on imported semiconductors over this week, adding that there could be some flexibility for certain companies in the sector.This week, the US Department of Commerceinitiated an investigationinto the impact of imports of chips and pharmaceuticals on American national security.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Leading oil and gas companies are also invited, along with big technology businesses, and petrostates including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.The absence ofChina– the world’s biggest producer of clean energy technology, and biggest emitter of greenhouse gases – is a blow to the UK, though it is likely to be privately welcomed by the US. The landmark conference, to which 60 countries have been invited, would have marked the first time the US and China had jointly attended a big international forum since Donald Trump began his trade war over tariffs last month.Tzeporah Berman, founder of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said: “There is no question that China not coming is a huge setback for global energy cooperation, at a critical moment in history. Trump will send a Maga climate denier to try to distort the conversation and push for increased dependency on US oil and gas, rather than a shift towards cleaner energy systems.“China is leading the world in renewables and electric cars and their refusal to come is a clear signal that they are not going to entertain the Trump administration’s strong-arming to hold back progress.”Robbie MacPherson, a Churchill fellow and former head of the UK’s all-party parliamentary group on climate change, said: “Transitioning away from fossil fuels requires the participation of all emitters. Engaging China is critical to ensuring action that safeguards the planet and unleashes the renewable energy age.”The Guardian understands that China’s non-attendance is down to a diary clash on the part of its senior energy official. But it comes asLabour MPs have been pushing the government to examine the UK’s links with Chinese companiesafter theapparent abandonment of Scunthorpe’s steelworks by Chinese investors, while Ed Miliband, the UK energy secretary, has come under fire in sections of the media for attempting to forge closer links with China on the supply of energy technologies.Thesummit on the future of energy security, to take place at Lancaster House in London next Thursday and Friday, has also been slammed by green campaigners, who fear it will be dominated by fossil fuel interests.More than 75 countries were invited, according to an unpublished guestlist seen by the Guardian, and about 60 are likely to attend. Many leading oil and gas producers are on the list, though Russia is excluded. More than 20 developing countries have been invited, including Egypt, Barbados, Zambia and Costa Rica.Only a handful of civil society groups were initially invited, but several more received invitations late on Monday afternoon, after the Guardian made inquiries to the government on Monday morning about their absence.Many of the developing countries invited are those with strong oil and gas interests, such as Nigeria and Algeria, and countries beginning to exploit fossil fuels, or with large untapped reserves, such as Guyana, Senegal and Tanzania, rather than the poorest countries and those most vulnerable to the climate crisis.Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “It’s hugely disappointing to see the Labour government hosting a summit about energy but not inviting people who are on the frontlines of the climate crisis. Having just slashed the aid budget, leaving many of the poorest people in the world to face a perilous present and future, the UK government now neglects their presence at a major energy summit.”Berman warned the US was likely to use the summit to push for its booming oil and gas exports. “This summit will be a showdown over whether the IEA and the UK can hold firm against fossil fuel interests and redefine energy security to mean a liberation from dependence on volatile and climate-warming fossil fuels, or chart a safer course,” she said. “The Trump administration is trying to bully its way to continued dependence on US oil and gas – the fact that no one owns the sun and wind is an existential threat to administrations that want to foster dependence and hold on to obscene record profits.”Among the businesses invited are companies that have recently rowed back on their climate commitments, including the oil companies BP, Shell and ExxonMobil; technology companies with strong interests in AI, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft; and banks with large fossil fuel investments, including Bank of America, HSBC and Barclays.The Guardian understands that space constraints at Lancaster House prevented more invitations. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “As we go further and faster in delivering the clean energy transition, Britain is returning to responsible global leadership. That is why we have invited governments, businesses, academics, civil society organisations and others to be part of this dialogue.”A spokesperson for the IEA, the global energy watchdog, said: “The ministers taking part in the summit are from countries across Africa, the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe and the Middle East, including countries on the frontlines of a wide range of energy challenges, such as access, affordability, reliability and climate.“Leaders from a broad cross-section of the whole energy sector, as well as international organisations, civil society groups and beyond will also take part in the discussions in and around the summit, which will seek to build consensus on a holistic approach to energy security.”Explore more on these topicsChinaEnergy industryOilAsia PacificGasClimate crisisRenewable energynewsShareReuse this content"

This letter serves as a clear and unequivocal statement of our complete lack of confidence in your ability to lead this organisation effectively.”Collette responded to staff last week, saying he recognised the disappointment and distress they had experienced over the rescinding of the artistic duo’s Venice contract, and that he had discussed the letter with the board and his executive colleagues.He went on to urge all staff to take partin the independent reviewbeing conducted by outside governance and risk management firm Blackhall & Pearl, which would examine “the processes leading to the commission and its subsequent rescission”.Previous interpretations of the inquiry’s terms of reference had led many staff and the public to believe only the selection process – not the board’s decision to overturn the advisory panel’s selection – would be investigated.A Creative Australia spokesperson clarified this on Wednesday.“The review won’t take a view on whether the decision to appoint the artistic team was right or wrong, or whether the decision to rescind the commission was right or wrong,” they said.“However, it may identify areas for improvement in how we make ongoing and future decisions about theVenice Biennale.”Collette’s letter to staff prompted a second letter in response, saying some employees had expressed concerns regarding safety and security over participating in the inquiry, and about what repercussions that might have on their future employment.The response demanded a representative of the Community and Public Sector Union be included in the process, as well as the appointment of a cultural mediator.Creative Australia told Guardian Australia it remained committed to promoting a safe, inclusive and respectful workplace.“We acknowledge some staff have expressed concerns, and we continue to maintain an open dialogue,” the statement said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moderator David Speers ran the show like a joint interview on his Insiders program, probing each man with repeated follow-ups when they dodged questions: Dutton on the uncertainty over his cuts, Albanese on when energy prices would come down under his renewables-heavy power plan. Speers forced the two to actually answer the question, not just give an answer to the question they wished they had been asked.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterDutton arguably landed the best punch of the debate, mocking Albanese for claiming there had been no modelling done on changes to negative gearing (treasurer Jim Chalmerssaid it was “not unusual” for governments to get such advice, even as he stressed it wasn’t on their radar). Laughing as Albanese said it wasn’t commissioned by Labor, Dutton said it was “publicly available”. Albanese looked uncomfortable as Dutton continued: “This prime minister has a problem with the truth.”But Dutton had his own problems with the truth. After 24 hours ofbeing accused of “verballing” Indonesia’s presidentand “fabricating” a statement from Prabowo Subianto, Dutton finally conceded he had got it wrong when claiming there had been an announcement from Jakarta about Russian planes. Forthe second time in this campaign, he admitted he’d made a mistake.Dutton still failed to come clean on how he would slash government services to make savings. Six times at least Speers asked what specifically he would trim. Dutton offered only that he was searching for “inefficiency”, and conceded “we won’t achieve all of the savings we need to achieve through our changes to the public service”.Labor will run that line from now until election day, to bolster their claims of “secret cuts” coming to essential services.Albanese dissembled a similar number of times on when energy prices would come down, saying they already had under this government – even as both men say more needs to be done to ease hip pocket pain. Asked about the legacy they wanted to leave, Albanese offered affordable childcare, while Dutton said his gas reservation plan would be his defining moment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Coalition haven’t exactly memory-holed that controversial idea yet, but it’s not top of their agenda. Given Dutton’s long-winded and unconvincing answer on nuclear and water usage, sounding somewhat likeJohn Hewson with his birthday cake, it’s clear why they are not singing it from the rooftops any more.Concerning, too, was his shakiness on speaking about climate change. The same day Guardian Australiarevealed anti-renewables comments from Coalition MP Colin Boyceto a group of climate science deniers, Dutton said he would “let scientists pass that judgment” about whether climate change was making weather events more serious. The Liberal leader conceded there was “an impact” but when asked if recent natural disasters were examples of climate change happening now, Dutton only offered: “I don’t know because I’m not a scientist”.Albanese quickly countered: “The science is very clear. It doesn’t mean that every single weather event is because of climate change. It does mean the science told us the events would be more extreme and they’d be more frequent.”After an hour, there was no winner announced by the ABC, and no clear winner emerged. Albanese, ahead in the polls and ahead on the electoral scoreboard, is probably fine with a spirited draw in the debate. Dutton, with a mountain to climb and a dwindling number of days to do it, is fast running out of opportunities to get ahead.And with performances like this, where he offered very little evidence of how he would act if he got the top job, it’s unclear what he’s pinning his hopes on to overcome the gap.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsPeter DuttonAnthony AlbaneseLabor partyCoalitionanalysisShareReuse this content"

I’ve not met him.”In the hours before the debate, senior Labor ministers accused Dutton of making “reckless” comments about Indonesia, with the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, saying Dutton had “fabricated” a statement from the Indonesian president,Prabowo Subianto.Dutton acknowledged he should not have claimed the Indonesian president had made an announcement about a Russian proposal to base Russian aerospace forces aircraft on Manuhua air force base on Biak island in Indonesia’seasternmost Papua region – about 1,400km from Darwin.“The reference I was making should not have been to the president, it was in relation to sources from the Prabowo government,” Dutton said. “It was a mistake and I am happy to admit [that].”Albanese described Dutton’s comments as “extraordinary” and argued they demonstrated he had “no understanding of the need for diplomacy”.The pair also clashed over the Coalition’s plan to reduce the size of the federal public service by 41,000 jobs by the end of the decade, through a mixture of natural attrition and voluntary redundancies.When asked whether “cuts” to the public service would cover all of its election commitments, Dutton said “the short answer is no”.“We won’t achieve all of the savings we need to achieve through our changes to the public service,” Dutton said.Dutton also declined to state which departments the 41,000 jobs would come from beyond frontline services, which the opposition leader has said would be ringfenced.“It’s not something you can do from opposition, to redesign the public service in the way that works,” Dutton said.In response, Albanese accused Dutton of not being upfront with the Australian public.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The question is what we can do about it as a population of 27 million people. We should be good corporate citizens, good international neighbours. But at the moment China is building two coal fired power stations a week.”Bridget McKenzie admits she ‘made a mistake’ by claiming Russia and China want Albanese to win electionRead moreIn his closing statement, Albanese accused Dutton of not accepting the science of climate change.“We’ve heard tonight no acceptance of the science of climate change,” Albanese said. “We accept it and we’re acting on it.”Both leaders were asked whether their initiatives to address housing affordability would increase property prices, as many economists have claimed, but both said measures to increase supply would offset any increase in demand.Albanese denied claims his government had modelled the impact of any change to negative gearing, before later clarifying that the modelling did exist and that it wasn’t commissioned by his team.“It was modelled by the government,” Dutton said. “That’s publicly available. This prime minister has a problem with the truth.”The next leaders’ debate will be held next Tuesday, and will be hosted on Nine.

In one attack, gunmen using automatic weapons fired at the entrance to Toulon prison in the south ofFrance.In other incidents, cars have been set alight and there have been vandalism and arson attempts on prison wardens’ accommodation.In several of the attacks, the acronym DDPF – Defence of French Prisoners – has been discovered. Le Parisien reported that a prisoner on conditional release had been arrested in the Essonne, south of Paris, on Wednesday morning in connection with the group.The man was alleged to have been part of an encrypted Telegram message group linked to the assaults. A post in the name of the DDPF made on Tuesday read: “We are not terrorists, we are here to defend human rights inside prisons.”Telegram has said it has now deleted all the messages and said calling for violence and threats was “explicitly banned”.French media described the attacks as a “declaration of war” by drug cartels after the government announced a crackdown on traffickers and a toughening of prison conditions for kingpins believed to be operating inside jails.The justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, has announced his intention to put 200 convicted traffickers in new ultra-high-security prisons this summer, where they will be held in isolation with limited access to visitors and telephone calls. Ministers are concerned about convicted drug dealers continuing to run their networks from behind bars.View image in fullscreenThe French justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, at Toulon prison.

That change codified a law passed in March banning Pride marches and allowing authorities to use facial recognition technology to track attenders so they could be fined. It has been described by one rights group as a “full-frontal attack” on LGBTQ+ people.Strik said: “Organisers and participants of the Budapest Pride risk facing criminal charges for marching peacefully in support of diversity, equality and freedom, as they have done for the last 29 years.”The MEPs said they were calling on theEuropean Commission– the guardian of EU law – to ask the European court of justice to suspend the law pending further legal action.In response to the constitutional changes, the European Commission said on Tuesday it would not hesitate to act if necessary. The Guardian has requested comment on the MEPs’ request for suspension, known as an interim measure.Krzysztof Śmiszek, of the Polish New Left, said the new law had created “a very hostile atmosphere” for LGBTQ+ Hungarians that had “already led to rise of physical, violent attacks and other types of hate crimes”.Michał Wawrykiewicz, a centre-right Polish MEP who campaigned to preserve independent judiciary in his home country, said the group had observed an “indisputable deterioration of the situation” and “an open denial of the rule of law”. He also said some officials had shown a “very aggressive approach toward us” and “rude behaviour”.Sophie Wilmès, a former Belgian prime minister and a liberal MEP, said some authorities had displayed “very aggressive rhetoric” towards the group. She voiced alarm about pressure on independent media. She said the Hungarian government’s extensive control of the media landscape meant “smear campaigns have become the new norm”.Several government departments declined to meet the MEPs, without giving any reason, Strik said. Three nationalist and far-right European parliament groups declined to join the parliamentary visit: the European Conservatives and Reformists, Patriots for Europe and the Europe of Sovereign Nations Group.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Hungarian government said at the time it intended to challenge this as soon as Donald Trump took office.Orbán is one of Trump’s biggest supporters, once saying he would open several bottles of champagne if Trump was re-elected. Hungary was the only EU member state to vote against the EU’s retaliatory measures against Trump’s tariffs, which were later suspended after a last-minute policy reversal by the White House.In an awkward moment for the Orbán government, the Trump administration released a report on foreign trade barriers raising concerns about corruption in Hungary’s public procurement system. Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, claimed in response that parts of the report had been “dictated by” the previous US ambassador to Budapest, David Pressman, who was avocal criticof the government’s democratic backsliding and foreign policy positions.Explore more on these topicsHungaryLGBTQ+ rightsEuropean CommissionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

German press reports identified the suspect as Johannes M, but prosecutors have not released a name.The doctor allegedly “administered an anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant to his patients … without their knowledge or consent”, the Berlin prosecutor’s office said in a statement.The relaxant “paralysed the respiratory muscles, leading to respiratory arrest and death within minutes”. The patients were between 25 and 94 years old.On five occasions, prosecutors allege, the suspect “set fire to their apartments to cover up these killings”.The suspect is accused of killing two patients on the same day. On the morning of 8 July 2024 he is alleged to have killed a 75-year-old man at his home in the central Berlin district of Kreuzberg. A few hours later he allegedly struck again, killing a 76-year-old woman in the neighbouring Neukölln district.The suspect’s alleged attempt to incinerate the crime scene failed when the fire did not catch, prosecutors said. “When he noticed this, he reportedly informed a relative of the woman, claiming that he was standing in front of her apartment and that no one had responded to his ringing,” they said.The list of accusations against the suspect has grown in length and severity since his initial arrest in August. The suspect was originally held on suspicion of manslaughter in relation to four deaths.Prosecutors said in November they were treating the alleged killings as murder cases and added four more deaths to the list of accusations.“The accused appears to have had no motive for killing the people other than the act of killing itself,” prosecutors said at the time. The suspect had nothing other than a “lust for murder”, they said.The updated charge sheet, extended to cover 15 suspicious deaths, accuses the suspect of carrying out the murders with “malice aforethought”.Prosecutors said they were seeking a lifelong professional ban and called for the suspect to be held in preventive detention.A special team of investigators had identified a total of 395 suspicious cases that needed to be re-examined in light of the accusations against the doctor. In 95 cases, an initial suspicion had been confirmed and preliminary proceedings had been initiated. Another 75 were still being assessed.In the course of the investigation, 12 exhumations have been carried out, five of which related to the victims listed in the charges. Another five exhumations are planned to go ahead shortly.The allegations made against the doctor recall another case currently being tried in Germany, in which a nurse is accused of murdering nine patients in palliative care.The nurse, whose trial opened in March, is alleged to have injected a total of 26 patients with large doses of sedatives or painkillers, resulting in the deaths of nine.Prosecutors on the case, being heard in the western city of Aachen, said the suspect was motivated by a desire to reduce his workload on night shifts and had considered himself the “master of life and death”.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Limits have also been set for percentages of caffeine, fats and salt.Government studies show that 70% of the drinks in school dispensing machines exceed recommended limits of sugar and caffeine.Pizzas and pies that are not prepared in the school kitchen can only be served once a month and any fried food should be cooked in olive or sunflower oil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You could argue it would be the other way around and stock will free up, and it is more likely to be that than inflationary for the UK.”He said the company had not seen any disruption to deliveries from overseas suppliers owing to the rapidly changing news on tariffs. Any changes in sourcing or prices were unlikely to be swift forWH Smithas the group’s stock orders were “locked and loaded” until after Christmas.“We know exactly what product and packaging we are getting, what we are paying and have got orders committed,” he said.He added that trading in the UK was “pretty robust” with airline passenger bookings up slightly year-on-year for this summer and “no softening in numbers at all” in recent weeks despite fears about lagging consumer confidence.But he said retailers “have got to be a bit mobile” to deal with volatile changes in the trading landscape as the US changes the rules on tariffs from China and elsewhere.He said WH Smith’s US business – which operates 258 stores in airports, most of which handle domestic flights – bought the majority of its food and snacks locally.But its suppliers of other products, such as headphones and charging cables, were likely to come from countries in Asia, including China, which are now subject to high import tariffs. Cowling said it was likely that suppliers of these small electronics and other goods could shift production from China to Vietnam, the Philippines or other countries with lower tariffs if necessary.“While we are on top of the detail and mindful of it, I don’t thing we are going to be impacted in the way other retailers [selling, for example] fashion might be,” he said.Carling’s comments came as WH Smith revealed that profits at its high street business had dived by almost a third, as sales slid 7% in the run-up to its sale to the Hobbycraft owner Modella.The groupagreed to sell its 480 high street storeslast month to focus on its travel business at railway stations, airports and hospitals amid rising costs and falling visitor numbers in traditional retail destinations.

It expects to open more than 60 travel stores worldwide this financial year.Cowling said its North American business was seeing the benefit of improvements in its stores and product range: “We continue to win new space, and I am delighted to announce that we have recently secured a significant contract at a major east coast airport.“The second half of the financial year has started well, and we remain on track to deliver full-year results in line with market expectations.

Israel has denied any violations.More than 51,000 Palestinians have died in Gaza since the conflict began, including more than 1,600 since Israel resumed airstrikes and ground operations on 18 March. The Gaza health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians but has said more than half of those dead were women and children.Another 13 people were killed in airstrikes overnight, with a well-known photographer, Fatema Hassouna, among those reported dead in the northern area of the strip.Doctors and aid groups on the ground said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was becoming graver by the day. “The situation is the worst it has been in 18 months in terms of being deprived of your basic necessities and the resumption of hostilities and attacks against Palestinians in all of Gaza,” said Mahmoud Shalabi, a director at Medical Aid for Palestinians.‘The last thread connecting people to services’: why vets are risking all to care for Gaza’s donkeysRead moreThe resumption of aid into Gaza has become a highly inflammatory political issue in Israel. There are 58 hostages still in Gaza, who were taken captive after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, with 24 believed to still be alive. Far-right figures inBenjamin Netanyahu’s government have said no aid should be restored to the civilians of Gaza until Hamas agrees to the hostages’ release.“As long as our hostages are languishing in the tunnels, there is no reason for a single gram of food or any aid to enter Gaza,” the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said on Wednesday.Katz said Israel intended to eventually set up its own “civilian-based distribution infrastructure” for aid in Gaza, to prevent supplies falling into the hands of Hamas militants, but he gave no timelines or details of how it would be established.Reports have suggested this could involve the Israel Defense Forces setting up and running logistics centres for aid, and vetted aid agencies being tasked with distributing it. However, the plan remains unclear and the UN is said to have so far refused to hand over the names of employees.Efforts by mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US to restore the collapsed ceasefire in Gaza and return the hostages have continued to hit stumbling blocks.Katz said that no matter what deal was agreed, Israeli troops would remain in the buffer zones it had occupied in Gaza, as well as in neighbouring Syria and Lebanon.Since resuming operations in March, Israeli troops have seized control of 30% of the Gaza Strip, establishing what they describe as an “operational security perimeter”. Hamas has demanded that any hostage deal must guarantee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.Katz said: “Unlike in the past, the [Israeli military] is not evacuating areas that have been cleared and seized.” The military would “remain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and [Israeli] communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza, as in Lebanon and Syria”, he said.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

News of Sa’ar’s presence in the UK – at a time whenIsraelis intensifying its offensive in Gaza, having ended a ceasefire last month – has triggered outrage among critics of Israel, and a formal request from activists for an arrest warrant to be issued against him on charges of alleged complicity in war crimes.The Global Legal Action Network (Glan), a London-based group seeking legal redress for disadvantaged and persecuted communities, and the Brussels-based Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), which focuses on legal accountability for Israeli war crimes, wrote joint letters on Wednesday to the UK’s attorney general and the director of public prosecutions to seek their consent for a private prosecution against Sa’ar in the UK.They also said an application for an arrest warrant had been prepared for Westminster magistrates court.Members of leading British Jewish body condemn Israel’s latest actions in GazaRead moreGlan and the HRF cited Sa’ar’s position in the Israeli security cabinet and his public statements on Gaza as grounds for alleging the foreign minister’s complicity in war crimes carried out by Israeli forces.Sa’ar’s visit to London was not publicised by him or his ministry, and the Israeli embassy did not reply to a request for comment on Wednesday afternoon. The Israeli government has denied committing war crimes, and has rejected the jurisdiction of the international criminal court (ICC) and the international court of justice (ICJ).The HRF has been particularly criticised in Israel for its legal pursuit of Israeli soldiers when they travel abroad. The organisation’s founders, Dyab Abou Jahjah and Karim Hassoun, have beenaccused of expressing public supportfor Hezbollah and Hamas.A spokesperson for the HRF said: “Since our formation, there has been a baseless campaign to smear our founders, led mostly by the Israeli government. Dyab Abou Jahjah is not, nor has he ever been, a member of Hezbollah. Karim Hassoun is originally from Morocco. While both support and respect the rights of all people to resist occupation – as is their human right under international law – neither adhere to any political party in Lebanon.”The UK Foreign Office confirmed that Lammy met Sa’ar on Tuesday to discuss Gaza and other pressing Middle East issues, during what it described as the latter’s “private visit to the UK”.Sa’ar was spotted by an Israeli journalist leaving Israel for the UK on Monday. His meeting with Lammy was first reported by the UK-based news website Middle East Eye, and Ynet in Israel.Zarah Sultana, the independent MP for Coventry South, said Sa’ar’s visit was “a direct affront to both international law and the Palestinian people enduring genocide, military occupation and apartheid under his government”.No plans to allow any aid into Gaza, says Israeli ministerRead more“Sa’ar has openly justified the denial of life-saving aid to a besieged civilian population,” Sultana said. “That is why I fully support the initiative by humanitarian law groups to demand an arrest warrant. The UK must stand firmly with international law and ensure all those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity are held accountable, no matter how powerful they are.”In the submissions presented on Wednesday, Glan and the HRF said the ICC hadissued arrest warrantsfor the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the former defence minister Yoav Gallant for their involvement in the military campaign in Gaza, in which an estimated 51,000 people have been killed over 18 months, and in the restriction of humanitarian aid supplies to Gaza’s population of 2.2 million.On Wednesday, the ICC called on the Hungarian government of Viktor Orbán to formally explain its actions earlier this month, when it hosted Netanyahu in Budapest, ignoring the arrest warrant. During Netanyahu’s visit, Hungaryannounced it was leaving the ICC, though under the court’s founding Rome statute, it takes a year for withdrawal to take effect.The ICJ is also reviewing an allegation of genocide, first brought by South Africa, directed at Israel’s war in Gaza. The ICJ issuedprovisional orders last yearcalling for Netanyahu’s government to halt its offensive and urgently address the humanitarian situation. In March, the Netanyahu government ended a ceasefire agreement and intensified its military operations and aid blockage of Gaza.Glan and the HRF said in a joint press statement: “As a senior member of Israel’s security cabinet alongsideBenjamin Netanyahu– wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza – Gideon Sa’ar is deeply implicated in the collective decisions that led to mass civilian death and suffering following October 7, 2023.“His central role in shaping and defending the government’s military policy makes him a key figure in the leadership responsible for a campaign the ICJ has found plausibly genocidal.”The UK Foreign Office passed on a question about the arrest warrant request to the attorney general’s office. It said that in Lammy’s meeting with Sa’ar on Tuesday, the British foreign secretary “raised the ongoing hostage negotiations, protection of aid workers, the need to end the humanitarian blockade of Gaza and stop settlement expansion in the West Bank, and the Iranian nuclear issue”.‘Keeping people alive’: Gaza’s last working bakery forced by Israel to keep on movingRead moreLammy also “raised the importance” of visits by UK members of parliament to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, after twoLabourMPs were denied entry by Israeli authorities.In their submission, Glan and the HRF said Sa’ar had been a member of Israel’s security cabinet and an informal consultative group around Netanyahu since he rejoined the governing coalition in September.Among their list of alleged war crimes committed by the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza is the siege of the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza between October and December last year and the detention of its medical director, Dr Hossam Abu Safiya, who the organisations say has been subjected to torture while in Israeli prisons.Israel, the complaint says, is responsible in general for the “wanton destruction” of Gaza’s infrastructure, aimed at “destroying the fabric of Gaza’s society and for the purpose of starving Gaza”. It also pointed to the harm caused to civilians by the Israeli blockade of medical supplies and basic provisions into Gaza.As well as citing Sa’ar’s membership of the Israeli security cabinet, the groups’ submission in support of the arrest warrant request quotes Sa’ar’s public statements on seizing territory in Gaza and cutting off humanitarian aid. They also argued that he did not have immunity from arrest on the basis of his government position.The Israeli government and Sa’ar himself have previously denounced attempts to pursue prosecutions against Israel in international courts as antisemitic. In January, Sa’ar said: “What we are witnessing is a systematic and antisemitic campaign aimed at denying Israel’s right to self-defence.”“Countless international actors and many countries are complicit in this,” he added.Explore more on these topicsIsraelForeign policyIsrael-Gaza warDavid LammyLabourMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

Hundreds and hundreds more Palestinians have been killed; food, fuel and medical supplies have once again been blocked from entering Gaza; and we are back in a brutal war where thekilling of 15 paramedics and their burial in a mass graveis again possible and risks being normal.“Such incidents are too painful and shocking to take in, but we know in our hearts we cannot turn a blind eye or remain silent at this renewed loss of life and livelihoods, with hopes dwindling for a peaceful reconciliation and the return of the hostages.“This most extremist of Israeli governments is openly encouraging violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, strangling the Palestinian economy and building more new settlements than ever … Israel’s soul is being ripped out and we, members of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, fear for the future of the Israel we love and have such close ties to.”The letter adds: “Silence is seen as support for policies and actions that run contrary to our Jewish values. Led by the families of the hostages, hundreds of thousands of Israelis are demonstrating on the streets against the return to war by an Israeli government that has not prioritised the return of the hostages. We stand with them. We stand against the war … It is our duty, as Jews, to speak out.”Hundreds of former Mossad operatives criticise Israel’s return to war in GazaRead moreOne of the signatories, Philip Goldenberg, a lawyer, said the Israeli government had “absolutely adopted the Trump playbook”, including demonising those who disagreed with it. “That is not what Israel is about,” he told the BBC’s The World at One.There was a “whole range of views” among British Jews, “and there are those who think we should not have done this”, he said. There were others who shared the views expressed in the letter but “don’t want to put their heads above the parapet”.What was happening inGazawas “a total breach of Jewish ethical values”, he added. “More damage is being done to the Zionist project by Netanyahu than Hamas could ever achieve.”A spokesperson for the Board of Deputies said other members would “no doubt put more emphasis on the fundamental responsibility of Hamas for this ghastly situation and the need to ensure that they are prevented from ever repeating the heinous crimes of 7 October”.Within the diversity of views among British Jews, “however, there is much unity”, the spokesperson added. The UK Jewish community wanted to see Hamas release the remaining hostages, aid flowing in to Gaza and “definitive progress towards lasting peace and security for Israelis, Palestinians and the wider Middle East”.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelJudaismBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

Madhusudhan (Cambridge University)James Webb space telescopeScientists hail ‘strongest evidence’ so far for life beyond our solar systemAstrophysics team say observation of chemical compounds may be ‘tipping point’ in search for extraterrestrial lifeHannah DevlinScience correspondentWed 16 Apr 2025 19.05 EDTShareA giant planet 124 light years from Earth has yielded the strongest evidence yet that extraterrestrial life may be thriving beyond our solar system, astronomers claim.Observations by theJames Webb space telescopeof a planet called K2-18 b appear to reveal the chemical fingerprints of two compounds that, on Earth, are only known to be produced by life.Detection of the chemicals, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) would not amount to proof of alien biological activity, but could bring the answer to the question of whether we are alone in the universe much closer.“This is the strongest evidence to date for a biological activity beyond the solar system,” said Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, an astrophysicist at theUniversity of Cambridgewho led the observations. “We are very cautious. We have to question ourselves both on whether the signal is real and what it means.”He added: “Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach. This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we’re alone in the universe is one we’re capable of answering.”Others are more sceptical, with questions remaining about whether the overall conditions on K2-18 b, are favourable to life and whether DMS and DMDS, which are largely produced by marine phytoplankton on Earth, can be reliably regarded as biosignatures.K2-18 b, which sits in the Leo constellation, is nearly nine times as massive as the Earth and 2.6 times as large and orbits in the habitable zone of its star, a cool red dwarf less than half the size of the sun. When the Hubble space telescope appeared to spotwater vapour in its atmosphere in 2019, scientists declared it “the most habitable known world” beyond the solar system.The supposed water signal was shown to be methane in follow-up observations by Madhusudhan’s team in 2023. But, they argued, K2-18 b’s profile was consistent with a habitable world, covered in a vast, deep ocean – a view that remains contentious. More provocatively, the Cambridge team reporteda tentative hint of DMS.Astronomers find signal that gives ‘unexpected’ insight into early universeRead morePlanets beyond our solar system are too distant to photograph or reach with robotic spacecraft. But scientists can estimate their size, density and temperature and probe their chemical makeup by tracking the exoplanet as it passes across the face of its host star and measuring starlight that has been filtered through its atmosphere. In the latest observations, wavelengths that are absorbed by DMS and DMDS, were seen to suddenly drop off as K2-18 b wandered in front of the red dwarf.“The signal came through strong and clear,” said Madhusudhan. “If we can detect these molecules on habitable planets, this is the first time we’ve been able to do that as a species … it’s mind-boggling that this is possible.”The findings, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, suggest concentrations of DMS, DMDS or both (their signatures overlap) thousands of times stronger than the levels on Earth. The results are reported with a “three-sigma” level of statistical significance (a 0.3% probability that they occurred by chance) although this falls short of the gold standard for discoveries in physics.“There may be processes that we don’t know about that are producing these molecules,” Madhusudhan said. “But I don’t think there is any known process that can explain this without biology.”A challenge in identifying potential other processes is that the conditions on K2-18 b remain disputed. While the Cambridge team favour an ocean scenario, others say the data is suggestive of a gas planet or one withoceans made of magma, not water.There is a question of whether DMS could have been brought to the planet by comets – this would require an intensity of bombardment that seems improbable – or produced in hydrothermal vents, volcanoes or lightning storms through exotic chemical processes.“Life is one of the options, but it’s one among many,” said Dr Nora Hänni, a chemist at the Physics Institute of the University of Berne, whose research revealed thatDMS was present on an icy, lifeless comet. “We would have to strictly rule out all the other options before claiming life.”Others say that measuring planetary atmospheres may never yield a smoking gun for life. “It’s under-appreciated in the field, but technosignatures, such as an intercepted message from an advanced civilisation, could be better smoking guns, despite the unlikelihood of finding such a signal,” said Dr Caroline Morley, an astrophysicist at the University of Texas, Austin, adding that the findings were, nonetheless, an important advance.Dr Jo Barstow, a planetary scientist at the Open University, also viewed the detection as significant, but said: “My scepticism dial for any claim relating to evidence of life is permanently turned up to 11, not because I don’t think that other life is out there, but because I feel that for such a profound and significant discovery the burden of proof must be very, very high. I don’t think this latest work crosses that threshold.”At 120 light years away, there is no prospect of resolving the debate through closeup observations, but Madhusudhan notes that this has not been a barrier to the discovery of black holes or other cosmic phenomena.“In astronomy, the question is never about going there,” he said. “We’re trying to establish if the laws of biology are universal in nature. I don’t see it as: ‘We have to go and swim in the water to catch the fish.’”Explore more on these topicsJames Webb space telescopeSpaceAstronomyUniversity of CambridgenewsShareReuse this content"

Starbucks dropped its vegan milk surcharge in the UK in 2022. Leon and Joe and the Juice do not charge extra for any standard dairy-free milk alternatives.Costa Coffee and Caffè Nero do not charge for soya milk, but oat and coconut milk are an additional 45p at both. Costa also has an “ultimate blend” plant-based milk alternative at some coffee shops for 35p.A spokesperson for Gail’s said: “We understand choice is important, which is why we’re proud to offer British-grown oat milk and soya as dairy alternatives. From 21 May, there will be no additional charge for soya milk in our bakeries.“We want to make it easier for everyone to enjoy their coffee or tea the way they like it, while remaining dedicated to sourcing high-quality ingredients that are both delicious and sustainable.”Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkFoodFood & drink industryHospitality industryVeganismnewsShareReuse this content"

National Trust rangers now fear this rare, protected moorland bird may have been lost to the area entirely.Chris Smith, the National Trust’s countryside manager for Mid and South Wales, said: “The impacts on wildlife are widespread, with birds’ nests, insects, amphibians and reptiles all scorched by fire.“Whole ecosystems have been decimated and will remain altered well into the future.“Alongside this, the huge loss of surface vegetation leaves the peat bogs we have been working hard to restore ... vulnerable to erosion and at further risk of fire and carbon loss.“Where the flames burnt down to the peat soils, they will take hundreds of years to recover.”In 2024, South Wales fire and rescue service responded to 34 wildfire callouts between 1 January and 10 April. This year, it has faced 445 over the same period – a 1,200% increase.In total, Wales’s three fire services have reported responding to more than 1,300 grass fires so far this year.InNorthern Ireland, recent fires on the Mourne Mountains have scorched land used by an array of wildlife including small heath butterflies, rove beetles, skylarks and peregrine falcons.Small birds such as skylarks rely on insects and beetles for food, and in turn provide a food source for birds of prey.In the Peak District, the National Trust said a recent fire on Howden Moor that stretched for 2km had caused £30,000-worth of damage, ruining years’ worth of conservation efforts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But they are also human, and it is their more self-serving instincts that may have caused some to breathe a sigh of relief at thesupreme court rulingon gender recognition.After a challenge by the gender-critical group ForWomenScotland – which started out as a dispute over Scottish government legislation about female representation on public boards – judges ruled that the terms “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act refer to biological women and biological sex.The verdict will be heavily contested, and could bring serious and perhaps unforeseen repercussions for transgender women. But such an unexpectedly definitive view allows leaders in Scotland and Westminster to (and there is no gentle way of putting this) dodge responsibility over one of the most contentious and toxic debates of our age.The Scottish government’s response was particularly eloquent. While stressing that no one should see the ruling as cause to triumph, it otherwise talked blandly about “engaging with the UK government to understand the full implication of this ruling”.There is logic to this. The Equality Act and theGenderRecognition Act, the legislative focus of the deliberations, are both UK-wide and thus not something the Holyrood administration can decide unilaterally.But beneath this reassuring constitutional hum lurks the sound of quiet footsteps, as the SNP’s first minister, John Swinney, shuffles his party away from an era when Nicola Sturgeon’s government was very proudly at the vanguard of transgender rights.It was little more than two years ago that Sturgeon’s government wasopenly seeking a battlewith Westminster over a plan to make it easier for transgender people in Scotland to get gender recognition certificates – a move blocked by Rishi Sunak.We are in a very different political climate now, and not just with the open prejudice of the Donald Trump administration, which ispurging transgender people from the militaryon the stated basis that their very identity makes them unfit to serve.Scotland’s government has been on the receiving end of pushback from other controversies, for example the decision to send Isla Bryson, a transgender woman convicted of double rape,to a women’s prison. To again frame it in slightly unpalatable political terms, this is no longer seen as a vote-winner for the SNP.View image in fullscreenMembers of For Women Scotland and others celebrate following the supreme court’s ruling on Wednesday.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press/Rex/ShutterstockFor Keir Starmer and the Westminster administration, there had been an unspoken worry about a fudged or unclear court ruling, one that placed the impetus on politicians to decide.Instead, as a UK government spokesperson said, it gave “clarity and confidence”, both for women and for those who run single-sex spaces. Clarity and confidence, perhaps. Political cover? Most definitely.Starmer has spent his five years as Labour leader having TV and radio interviewers intermittently asking him to declare, yes or no, whether a woman can have a penis. Starmer’sstandard dual response– under the law, a tiny number of trans people are recognised as women but might not have completed gender reassignment surgery – prompted an inevitable and arguably damaging wave of attacks from political opponents.Kemi Badenoch has been particularly relentless in this, despite having served as equalities minister in a government that did not amend or clarify the Equality Act to reflect her view that, as she put it ina celebratory tweeton Wednesday, “saying ‘trans women are women’ was never true in fact”.This was not just a Conservative obsession. Starmer faced criticism from some inside Labour – notably from the now independent MP for Canterbury, Rosie Duffield – for, as they saw it, failing to stand up for women. Others condemned him in the belief he was edging away from trans rights.From a nakedly political-management perspective, the supreme court decision was ideal, making the decision judicial rather than political. No 10 officials believe there will be no need to tweak the Equality Act, leaving their role as little more than a neutral voice in helping organisations adjust to the new reality.Starmer’s aides deny he has been on a political journey from a few years ago, when as a Labour leadership candidate he signed up to a pledge from the LGBT Labour group “that trans women are women, that trans men are men” – or 18 months later whenhe criticised Duffieldfor saying only women could have a cervix.This is perhaps disingenuous. But in a debate where niceties and nuance are so often trampled on, the prime minister is very much not the first politician to try to fudge things.Explore more on these topicsTransgenderGenderWomenEquality Act 2010UK supreme courtanalysisShareReuse this content"

It prompted calls for the UK’s laws on gender recognition to be rewritten.The UK government said the ruling brought “clarity and confidence” for women and those who run hospitals, sports clubs and women’s refuges.A spokesperson said: “We have always supported the protection of single-sex spaces based on biological sex. Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government.”The case was brought to the supreme court by the gender-critical campaign group For Women Scotland, which is backed financially byJK Rowling, after two Scottish courts rejected its arguments that the Equality Act’s definition of a woman was limited to people born biologically female.Lord Hodge, the deputy president of the court, said the Equality Act was very clear that its provisions dealt with biological sex at birth, and not with a person’s acquired gender, regardless of whether they held a gender recognition certificate.That affected policymaking on gender in sports and the armed services, hospitals, as well as women-only charities, and access to changing rooms and women-only spaces, he said. However, trans women still have equal pay rights as women, and could have the right to be treated as women in some situations.In its 88-page judgment, the court said that while the word “biological” did not appear in the definition of man or woman in the Equality Act, “the ordinary meaning of those plain and unambiguous words corresponds with the biological characteristics that make an individual a man or a woman”.If “sex” did not only mean biological sex in the 2010 legislation, providers of single-sex spaces including changing rooms, homeless hostels and medical services would face “practical difficulties”, it said.The justices added: “Read fairly and in context, the provisions relating to single-sex services can only be interpreted by reference to biological sex.”The ruling represents a significant defeat for the Scottish government. For WomenScotlandhad initially challenged legislation that allowed trans women with a GRC to sit on public boards in posts reserved for women.Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, said his government accepted the court’s judgment. He said it clarified the limits of theGenderRecognition Act 2004, which introduced gender recognition certificates for trans people.“We will now engage on the implications of the ruling,” he said. “Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions.”The Scottish government defended its actions in the case, which it said were always guided by the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s advice. It said it would now engage with UK ministers and with the EHRC to look at the ruling’s implications, since the legislation involved was passed by Westminster.Trans rights campaigners urged trans people and their supporters to remain calm about the decision.The campaign group Scottish Trans said: “We are really shocked by today’s supreme court decision, which reverses 20 years of understanding of how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates.“We will continue working for a world in which trans people can get on with their lives with privacy, dignity and safety. That is something we all deserve.”Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of the human rights group Amnesty International UK, which joined with the Scottish government in the supreme court case, said the decision was “clearly disappointing”.“There are potentially concerning consequences for trans people, but it is important to stress that the court has been clear that trans people are protected under the Equality Act against discrimination and harassment,” he said.“The ruling does not change the protection trans people are afforded under the protected characteristic of ‘gender reassignment’, as well as other provisions under the Equality Act.”Susan Smith, a co-founder of ForWomenScotland, said the legal action had been “a really, really long road”. “Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex,” she said.“Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the supreme court for this ruling.”In a social media post, JK Rowling said: “It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the supreme court,” adding: “I’m so proud to know you.”Hodge, the deputy president of the court, said it believed the position taken by the Scottish government and the EHRC that people with gender recognition certificates did qualify as women, while those without did not, created “two sub-groups”.This would confuse any organisations they were involved with. A public body could not know whether a trans woman did or did not have that certificate because the information was private and confidential.And allowing trans women the same legal status as biological women could also affect spaces and services designed specifically for lesbians, who had also suffered historical discrimination and abuse.Kishwer Falkner, the chair of the EHRC, said it was pleased the ruling had dealt with its concerns about the lack of clarity around single-sex and lesbian-only spaces, but would need time to fully understand its implications.“We are pleased that this judgment addresses several of the difficulties we highlighted in our submission to the court, including the challenges faced by those seeking to maintain single-sex spaces, and the rights of same-sex attracted persons to form associations.”Explore more on these topicsGenderTransgenderEquality Act 2010JK RowlingWomenUK supreme courtScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

I think there’s a good chance that, yes, we’ll come to a great agreement that’s in the best interest of both countries.”However, behind the scenes concern is growing over the vulnerability of UK industries and companies to Trump’s “America first” agenda.Before Trump’s inauguration, UK trade documents related to US talks were generally marked “Official – sensitive (UK eyes only)”, according to examples seen by the Guardian, and officials were allowed to share these on internal email chains. This classification stood while British officials attempted to negotiate with Joe Biden’s administration, even after a full-blown trade deal was ruled out by the White House.Now, a far greater proportion of documents and correspondence detailing the negotiating positions being discussed by officials from No 10, the Foreign Office and the Department for Business and Trade come with additional handling instructions to avoid US interception, with some classified as “secret” and “top secret”, sources said. These classifications also carry different guidance on how documents may be shared digitally, in order to avoid interception.Companies with commercial interests in the UK have also been told to take additional precautions in how they share information with the trade department and No 10, senior business sources said. These include large pharmaceutical companies with operations in the UK and EU.A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said: “The US is an indispensable ally and negotiations on an economic prosperity deal that strengthens our existing trading relationship continue.”Wider questions have been asked about whether the special relationship between the UK and US can withstand increasingly divergent policies on Russian hostility, as well as deep criticisms of Nato and defence collaboration. On trade, pressures are mounting in sensitive areas such as car manufacturing and pharmaceuticals.Other reports suggest the European Commission has also changed its perspective on the risks of sensitive or secret information being intercepted by the US. Commission employeeshave been issued with burner phonesif they are visiting the US, the Financial Times has reported.So close has the UK and US position been on defence and security in recent years that secure government material is sometimes marked “UK/US only”, or given a “Five Eyes” marking, in reference to the intelligence-sharing collective made up of the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. So far, the Guardian has only established a change in document-handling related to trade discussions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU would also delay its response to US tariffs.Until July, the EU will face a 10% duty on exports to the US, rather than the 20% “reciprocal tariff” rate that was in force for a matter of hours, until Trump’s reversal last Wednesday. US duties of 25% tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars are still in place, however.Despite suggestions that Trump may be chastened by the markets’ volatile response to his trade policies, the president’s incremental steps have increased duties on Chinese imports to 145%. China responded on Friday by announcingit would increase tariffs on US goods to 125%. The announcement from the Chinese commerce ministry also suggested that it would not pursue higher tariffs in any further retaliatory steps against the US, adding that “at the current tariff level, there is no market acceptance for US goods exported to China”.“If the US continues to impose tariffs on Chinese goods exported to the US, China will ignore it,” it said, flagging that there were other countermeasures to come. Xi, meanwhile,urged the EU to resist Trump’s “bullying”.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyTrump tariffsCivil serviceGlobal economyEconomicsTariffsEuropean CommissionnewsShareReuse this content"

Vera’s staff was confused by the request, as its government funding had been canceled a week prior, but agreed to a call which they said took place on Tuesday.The demand to meet with an independent non-profit organization and potentially embed its staffers there represents an expansion of Doge’s already sprawling reach and coincides with Musk issuing public attacks against non-governmental organizations. Doge has previously gutted government institutions such as USAID andcongressionally funded non-profit USIP, but its meeting with Vera marks a new targeting of a wholly independent organization.Doge unemployment ‘fraud’ discoveries are old finds from Biden era, experts sayRead more“We have watched this administration try to kneecap academia, law firms, media, and now they are coming for the non-profit sector,” said Insha Rahman, Vera’s vice-president of advocacy and partnerships.Vera’s programs focus on a variety of criminal justice issues and improving conditions for incarcerated people, as well as supporting mental health and crisis services. Its annual budget of around $45m comes primarily from private donors – although as is common with non-profits, it has also received federal grants. Vera has also been a repeated target for rightwing media outlets that attack its approach to criminal justice reform, which Rahman believes is one of the reasons that Doge staffers may have targeted the organization.When Vera’s legal counsel then held a 20-minute phone call with two members of Doge this week, Rahman says they informed the Doge staffers that the organization had already stopped receiving government funding. The Department of Justice had abruptly canceled $5m in contracts for the non-profit earlier that month. The Doge staffers did not know Vera’s funding had been canceled, according to Rahman, and took back their request for information on Vera’s contracts while refusing to answer questions on what gave them the authority to investigate Vera in the first place.“Doge staffers Nick Cavanaugh and Justin Aimonetti informed us of its plan to assign a Doge team to the Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) as part of its larger plan to assign Doge teams to ‘every institute or agency that has congressional monies appropriated to it’,” Vera said in a statement. “When asked about the legal standing for Doge to investigate an independent nonprofit, Aimonetti, who is an attorney, deferred.”Musk hasclaimed without evidencethat there is widespread, pervasive fraud among NGOs receiving government contracts and that leaders of “fake NGOs” should be thrown in prison. Vera stated that it is going public with the incident out of concern that theTrump administrationand Doge is planning to target other non-profits that do not conform to their ideology.“The Democrat government-funded NGO scam might be the biggest theft of taxpayer money ever,” Musk posted on X last month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, a White House spokesperson told the Post that Doge plans to “specifically look” at non-profits that receive large amounts of federal funding.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Speaking to Entertainment Tonight in 2021, Trachtenbergsaid: “There was a lot required of me … I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity.”Other projects Trachtenberg starred in include the teen comedy EuroTrip, as well as the critically acclaimed drama Mysterious Skin by Gregg Araki.Reflecting on her experience with Mysterious Skin, Trachtenbergsaid: “I was this girl who had done glitzy, PG-themed stuff and here’s Gregg Araki, director of Doom Generation, and we sat down and had a cup of coffee and I said: ‘You’re probably not gonna hire me but this is what I got, this is what I feel. If you’re willing to take the chance, I’m willing to go there with you.’ It was the most exhilarating experience I’ve had as an actress.”Following her death, Trachtenberg’s various cast memberspaid tributesto her, with her Gossip Girl co-star Blake Lively writing: “She was electricity … You knew when she entered a room because the vibration changed. Everything she did, she did 200%.”Similarly, Smith-Cameron wrote: “She was always very warm toward me. I feel very shocked and unsettled to hear of her passing.”Meanwhile, the Buffy the Vampire lead, Sarah Michelle Gellar, said: “Michelle, listen to me … Listen. I love you. I will always love you.

The sell-off picked up as Powell spoke to The Economic Club of Chicago.The S&P 500 index ended the day down 2%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 3% and theDow Jonesdropped 1.7%.“The new administration is in the process of implementing substantial policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy and regulation. Those policies are still evolving, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain,” said Powell.Powell said theUS economywas well-positioned but added that Trump’s tariffs were likely to cause “at least a temporary rise in inflation. The inflationary effects could also be more persistent.”Nvidia, the California company at the heart of the revolution in artificial intelligence technology, lost billions of dollars from its market value at the opening bell, with its shares down 8.5% by early afternoon.‘The sky won’t fall’: China plays down Trump tariff risks as stock markets rallyRead moreThe sell-off, which has spread to semiconductor makers in Asia and Europe, comes after Nvidia said the Trump administration hadrestricted the sale of its H20 chip in Chinaby means of new licence requirements.The company now expects to report a $5.5bn (£34.1bn) hit in its financial quarter that ends on 27 April, covering the cost of licences for its stock of the chips and associated sales commitments.The US restriction will also hit the MI308 processor made by rival chip business Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Its shares dropped 6.5% as it expects to take a charge of as much as $800m because of the new rule.In Asia, South Korean semiconductor businesses such as Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix fell by about 4% overnight, and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) dropped 2.5%.Meanwhile in Europe, shares in semiconductor tech firm ASML fell 5.2% as its chief executive, Christophe Fouquet, said tariffs had “increased uncertainty in the macro environment”. The Dutch company, which produces lithography machines used to make chips, also reported orders of €3.94bn in its first financial quarter, about €1bn less than investors had expected.So far the chip industry has been exempt from the 10% tariffs imposed by the US since 2 April. The US government has historically built up regulations to limit Chinese access to advanced chips – including under Joe Biden as it raced for supremacy in AI. But the Trump administration has beenpaving the way for more levies on the sector.Global stocks were also hit by a warning from the World Trade Organization. It said Trump’stariffs will send international trade into reverse this yearand depress global economic growth. While the WTO had previously expected goods trade to expand by 2.7% this year, it now forecasts a 0.2% decline.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It compared with a 0.2% gain in February, according to the US Census Bureau, though this could suggest consumers were snapping up goods before the implementation of tariffs.Oil prices also rose on Wednesday amid hopes of trade talks betweenChinaand the US, and following a report that Iraq plans to cut oil production in April. Brent crude rose by 84 cents, or 1.3%, to $65.49 a barrel, while US crude rose by a similar amount to $62.12 a barrel.If there are trade talks with China, they will involve the country’snew international trade negotiator. Beijing unexpectedly announced on Wednesday that Li Chenggang will take over the role from the veteran trade tsar Wang Shouwen. No reason was given for the change, although it came amid a broader reshuffle in Chinese government.In the US,California has launched a legal challenge to Trump’s tariffs, accusing the president of overstepping his authority and threatening trade in the state. The lawsuit was brought by California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and its attorney general, Rob Bonta.Also on Wednesday, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that he would attend a trade meeting with Japanese officials and his cabinet secretaries.“Japan is coming in today to negotiateTariffs, the cost of military support, and “TRADE FAIRNESS,” he wrote. “I will attend the meeting, along with Treasury & Commerce Secretaries. Hopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!”Japan was hit with a 24% tariff rate on its exports to the US, though, like most of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, this was paused for 90 days last week. However, a 10% universal rate remains in place, as well as a 25% duty on the sale of Japanese cars to Americans.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsNvidiaStock marketsDonald TrumpChinaStandard & Poor'sNasdaqnewsShareReuse this content"

The fund will be in turn used to provide “immediate and strategic support to any member institution under direct political or legal infringement”.In recent weeks, Trump has come after dozens of universities, including private institutions such asHarvard University, which has an endowment, unlike public universities, as part of his administration’s crackdowns on alleged antisemitism and civil rights violations. Many of the Big 10 academic alliance schools have also been targeted by Trump.Indiana University Bloomington is among 60 schoolsunder federal investigationover alleged violations “relating to antisemitic harassment and discrimination”. The administration has also come after the University of Washington and Penn State University which sawover a dozenof their international students’ visascancelled.Meanwhile, federal authorities areinvestigatingUniversity of Oregon’s partnership with the PhD Project, a non-profit organization that supports students from marginalized communities in obtaining degrees.The Guardian has reached out to the Big 10 academic alliance schools.In a statement to the Guardian, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s associate chancellor Robin Kaler said: “Free speech and academic freedom are foundational to our university’s missions of discovery and exploration… The university remains committed to protecting the first amendment rights of all individuals. This is a legal obligation of any public entity and, we believe, an ethical responsibility for an institution like ours that values diverse perspectives and academic interrogation.”Meanwhile, Rutgers University’s assistant vice-president, Dory Devlin, said: “The university appreciates the guidance of the university senate to encourage the efforts of universities across the Big Ten, and more broadly, to find common ground and shared values during a time of shifting federal policies, while recognizing that each school in the conference has its own local dynamics and pressures.”In addition to demanding universities close their diversity, equity and inclusion programs, Trump hasfrozenfundingto universities andissueda slew of extortive and broadly-worded demands to the institutions.Most recently, Trump ordered Harvard University to conduct audits on study bodies, faculty and leadership on their views about diversity, ban face masks, as well as halt the recognition and funding of “any student group or club that endorses or promotes criminal activity, illegal violence or illegal harassment”.Harvard has refused to capitulate to theTrump administration’s demands,prompting supportfrom Barack Obama, as well as further complaints from Trump whocalledHarvard a “joke” that “teaches hate and stupidity”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsDonald TrumpUS universitiesIndianaTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The sell-off picked up as Powell spoke to The Economic Club of Chicago.The S&P 500 index ended the day down 2%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 3% and theDow Jonesdropped 1.7%.“The new administration is in the process of implementing substantial policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy and regulation. Those policies are still evolving, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain,” said Powell.Powell said theUS economywas well-positioned but added that Trump’s tariffs were likely to cause “at least a temporary rise in inflation. The inflationary effects could also be more persistent.”Nvidia, the California company at the heart of the revolution in artificial intelligence technology, lost billions of dollars from its market value at the opening bell, with its shares down 8.5% by early afternoon.‘The sky won’t fall’: China plays down Trump tariff risks as stock markets rallyRead moreThe sell-off, which has spread to semiconductor makers in Asia and Europe, comes after Nvidia said the Trump administration hadrestricted the sale of its H20 chip in Chinaby means of new licence requirements.The company now expects to report a $5.5bn (£34.1bn) hit in its financial quarter that ends on 27 April, covering the cost of licences for its stock of the chips and associated sales commitments.The US restriction will also hit the MI308 processor made by rival chip business Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Its shares dropped 6.5% as it expects to take a charge of as much as $800m because of the new rule.In Asia, South Korean semiconductor businesses such as Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix fell by about 4% overnight, and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) dropped 2.5%.Meanwhile in Europe, shares in semiconductor tech firm ASML fell 5.2% as its chief executive, Christophe Fouquet, said tariffs had “increased uncertainty in the macro environment”. The Dutch company, which produces lithography machines used to make chips, also reported orders of €3.94bn in its first financial quarter, about €1bn less than investors had expected.So far the chip industry has been exempt from the 10% tariffs imposed by the US since 2 April. The US government has historically built up regulations to limit Chinese access to advanced chips – including under Joe Biden as it raced for supremacy in AI. But the Trump administration has beenpaving the way for more levies on the sector.Global stocks were also hit by a warning from the World Trade Organization. It said Trump’stariffs will send international trade into reverse this yearand depress global economic growth. While the WTO had previously expected goods trade to expand by 2.7% this year, it now forecasts a 0.2% decline.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It compared with a 0.2% gain in February, according to the US Census Bureau, though this could suggest consumers were snapping up goods before the implementation of tariffs.Oil prices also rose on Wednesday amid hopes of trade talks betweenChinaand the US, and following a report that Iraq plans to cut oil production in April. Brent crude rose by 84 cents, or 1.3%, to $65.49 a barrel, while US crude rose by a similar amount to $62.12 a barrel.If there are trade talks with China, they will involve the country’snew international trade negotiator. Beijing unexpectedly announced on Wednesday that Li Chenggang will take over the role from the veteran trade tsar Wang Shouwen. No reason was given for the change, although it came amid a broader reshuffle in Chinese government.In the US,California has launched a legal challenge to Trump’s tariffs, accusing the president of overstepping his authority and threatening trade in the state. The lawsuit was brought by California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and its attorney general, Rob Bonta.Also on Wednesday, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that he would attend a trade meeting with Japanese officials and his cabinet secretaries.“Japan is coming in today to negotiateTariffs, the cost of military support, and “TRADE FAIRNESS,” he wrote. “I will attend the meeting, along with Treasury & Commerce Secretaries. Hopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!”Japan was hit with a 24% tariff rate on its exports to the US, though, like most of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, this was paused for 90 days last week. However, a 10% universal rate remains in place, as well as a 25% duty on the sale of Japanese cars to Americans.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsNvidiaStock marketsDonald TrumpChinaStandard & Poor'sNasdaqnewsShareReuse this content"

As a result of Washington’s trade policy, it is now forecasting a 0.2% decline.Presenting the forecasts, the WTO’s director general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said she was particularly concerned about the “decoupling” of the US andChina, calling it “a phenomenon that is really worrying to me”.She said trade between the two geopolitical rivals was expected to plunge by 81-91% without exemptions for tech products such as smartphones – saying this was “tantamount to a decoupling of the two economies” and would have, “far-reaching consequences”.Okonjo-Iweala said the WTO was canvassing its member countries about whether to convene an emergency meeting to discuss the situation.In its report, the organisation says: “The outlook for global trade has deteriorated sharply due to a surge in tariffs and trade policy uncertainty.”chartIt had previously forecast global GDP growth of 2.8% for 2025, but now expects a weaker 2.2%.The US has imposed tariffs of 10% on all imports, with much higher rates for China totalling 145%, and on specific sectors including cars and steel. The WTO expects the biggest impact of the policy to be a sharp decline in trade with the US – with other regions still expected to experience growth.Trump’s far larger “reciprocal” tariffs werepaused last week for 90 daysafter a violent reaction in financial markets. The WTO warns that if these are reimposed after the hiatus, it would have a much greater impact, causing a 0.8% decline in global goods trade.If this was followed by a surge in “trade policy uncertainty” worldwide, as other countries readjust their policies in response, the WTO suggests the effects would be an even greater 1.5% fall in trade. And in this worst-case scenario, the WTO predicts even weaker global GDP growth, of just 1.7%.After Trump’s “liberation day” tariff announcement on 2 April was followed by a string of sometimes apparently contradictory statements from Washington, the WTO warns that uncertainty in itself is an important contributor to the risks of a slowdown.“Uncertainty fosters an increased prudence in decision-making,” the WTO says, pointing to evidence that “trade policy uncertainty can, among other things, dampen business confidence, reducing business investment and thereby impairing economic growth.”It adds: “Ultimately, the degree to which uncertainty can be managed by firms will be a key determinant of whether the positive macroeconomic momentum observed in 2024 translates into sustained global trade growth in the coming years.”chartThe International Monetary Fund and World Bank have also warned about the potential shock to trade from a tariff war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He argued this economic model held back the development of independent and more resilient nations.The WTO predicts some “diversion” of trade, as Beijing seeks new markets for its goods outside the US. Chinese exports to regions outside North America are expected to expand by between 4% and 9%, in 2025.Services trade is not directly hit by Trump’s tariffs, but the WTO expects it to be affected indirectly. “Tariff induced declines in goods trade weaken demand for related services such as transport and logistics, while broader uncertainty dampens discretionary spending on travel and slows investment-related services,” it warns.The WTO acts as the watchdog for global trading rules, and has previously provided a forum for the negotiation of international trade deals – but its role has increasingly come into question in recent years, as the progress of globalisation has slowed.Trump’s tariffs have been applied in complete disregard to the “most favoured nation” rule that forms the bedrock of the system overseen by the WTO – which is meant to mean that trade advantages offered to one member-country should be extended to all.China has urged the WTO to investigate the impact of theTrump tariffs. Beijing said in a statement to the WTO last week: “Reciprocal tariffs are not – and will never be – a cure for trade imbalances. Instead, they will backfire, harming the US itself.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsWorld Trade OrganizationInternational tradeTariffsDonald TrumpEconomicsGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

Its shares have risen by more than 1,400% since 2020, making it one of the few businesses in the US worth trillions of dollars.However, the news on Tuesday sent Nvidia shares down about 6% in after-hours trading in the US, which could wipe off billions from its market value at the opening bell on Wednesday.A chipmaker sell-off has already started in Asia, with South Korean semiconductor businesses such as Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix falling by as much as 3% overnight. In Europe, shares in ASML dropped 5% in early trading after its chief executive, Christophe Fouquet, said: “The recent tariff announcements have increased uncertainty in the macro environment and the situation will remain dynamic for a while.” The Dutch company, which produces lithography machines used to make chips, also reported that orders in its first financial quarter were €3.94bn (£3.37bn), about €1bn less than investors had expected.Shares in the US competitor Advanced Micro Devices also fell 7% in after-hours trading.While so far the chip industry has been exempt from the 10% tariffs that started on 5 April, Trump said he would announce a levy on imported semiconductors over this week, adding that there could be some flexibility for certain companies in the sector.This week, the US Department of Commerceinitiated an investigationinto the impact of imports of chips and pharmaceuticals on American national security.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reynolds accused Jingye of not acting in good faith after itthreatened to shut down British Steel’s furnaces at Scunthorpewithin days, with the loss of 2,700 jobs.The government stepped in on Saturday to avoid the shutdowns withemergency legislationto take control of British Steel.UK government refuses to rule out redundancies at Scunthorpe steelworksRead moreIn its first public comments since the government stepped in, Jingye said on Wednesday that it “request[s] that the UK government respect and protect the legitimate rights and interests of Jingye as a foreign investor throughout this process”.In a statement provided to the Financial Times, Jingye said it would “seek a proper solution that ensures a bright future for British Steel”, and added that it had previously safeguarded jobs and made investments in the plant.The dispute over the future of the Scunthorpe furnaces has threatened to worsen the UK’s already troubled relationship with China, even as theLabourgovernment seeks to boost inward investment.China’s embassy said politicians objecting to the country’s involvement in the UK steel sector “took the opportunity to attack all Chinese companies and the Chinese government”, after awarning by the country’s foreign ministryearlier on Monday against “politicising” the situation.In an unusual question-and-answer format, the embassy wrote: “The anti-China rhetoric of some individual British politicians is extremely absurd, reflecting their arrogance, ignorance and twisted mindset.”Jingye was approached by the Conservative government in 2019 to take over British Steel after its previous owner, the private equity firm Greybull Capital, walked away. British Steel haslost more than £350msince then. Jingye said last month it would close the blast furnaces, and it turned down an offer of £500m in UK government support to switch from the polluting blast furnaces to cleaner electric arc furnaces.Reynolds said the UK had “got it wrong in the past” about allowing Chinese investment in strategically important industries such as steel, and highlighted the influence of the Chinese government on private companies. “I wouldn’t personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector,” he said on Sunday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It contrasted the treatment of China with the alleged lack of criticism of Donald Trump’s tariffs. The embassy wrote: “What on earth are they up to?”“Any words or deeds that politicise or maliciously hype up business issues will undermine the confidence of Chinese business investors in the UK and damage China-UK economic and trade cooperation,” it added.A UK government spokesperson said: “We will take a consistent, long-term and strategic approach to managing the UK’s relations with China, rooted in UK and global interests.“We will continue to support UK business to engage with the second largest economy in the world, while being clear-eyed to any risks and ensuring security and resilience.”Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelChinaSteel industryJonathan ReynoldsLabourAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But Italy’s relationship with China, with whom the US is embroiled in a fierce tariff war, could be problematic.“On one hand, she is attempting to pursue a soft reset with China following Italy’s withdrawal from the belt and road initiative,” said Piccoli. “On the other, she is keen to position herself as president Trump’s preferred European partner.”Bialetti’s inexpensive but stylish octagonal moka pots were aimed at bringing the espresso-style experience into the home. The name moka originated from the city of Mokha in Yemen, one of the first places in the world to produce coffee.Bialetti struggled during the second world war due to a shortage of aluminium but was then revived by Alfonso’s son, Renato, who was celebrated for turning the moka pot into a global icon after introducing “the little man with a moustache”, a mascot representing a caricature of himself that was printed on the side of the pots. Renato died in 2016, with his ashes buried inside a giant moka.Although other brands have replicated the moka pot, a study in 2010 found that 90% of Italian households owned a Bialetti.But the company has struggled in recent years due to poor investments and competition from capsule coffee makers. Bialetti expanded by opening stores in shopping malls, but business took a hit during the Covid pandemic, and its venture into the sale of kitchen utensils has been unsuccessful.In 2024, company posted a €1.1m loss and closed the year with adjusted net financial debts of €81.9m.Egidio Cozzi, who will stay on as Bialetti chief executive after the acquisition, said: “Today Bialetti is a more solid company, with a clear strategic vision and a globally recognised brand.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessItalyHong KongnewsShareReuse this content"

Andthatwas pretty special, Arsenal’s own story written as Mikel Arteta had asked and given a scene they will remember for a long time, a coming of age.The goal that finally confirmed that they were heading into their third European Cup semi-final was a portrait of the way Arsenal had played here: an exercise in patience, control, and maturity.‘Massive step’: Arteta praises Arsenal’s character in statement Real Madrid winRead morePrecision, timing and courage, too. Saka had missed a first-half penalty that might have set up their passage sooner, that could have felt like a catastrophe then amidst the noise of the lion’s den into which they had stepped, but he was not sunk, nor scared. None of them were: not by the legend, the atmosphere, the history, not by the players before them.

Instead, the Bernabéu spell was broken,Real Madrideliminated and deservedly so.At no point wasArsenal’s 3-0 first‑leg leadin real danger, not even when they gifted Madrid an absurd equaliser immediately after Saka’s goal. The kind of moment that usually sparks madness, a sense of impending doom, did not; the men in black ensured as much.And then, as if to underline their superiority – and make no mistake, over these two legs they have been far, far superior to Madrid – Gabriel Martinelli escaped through the middle of what little was left of the home defence in the last minute and slotted past Thibaut Courtois.Arsenal had not just beaten the European championsacrosstwo games, winning 5-1 on aggregate, they had beaten themintwo games. High in the stands above, fans sang long into perhaps the greatest night in their European history, completed on its grandest stage and in grand style.They blew Madrid away a week ago; now they managed them, Declan Rice, Martin Ødegaard and Thomas Partey dominating midfield, taking control before clinically finishing the task. For all the comeback narrative that had been built against them, there was no sign of nerves and only one bit of bad news – a late yellow card that means Partey will miss the first leg against PSG.View image in fullscreenGabriel Martinelli slots home Arsenal’s winning goal past Thibaut Courtois.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersArsenal had started well and might have started perfectly. Saka flashed a shot past the post and saw another pushed away by Courtois before he passed up a glorious opportunity to make this an even more comfortable night. Twelve minutes had gone when François Letexier was called to the VAR screen where, in slow motion, he saw Raúl Asencio pull down Mikel Merino. Saka clipped the penalty too low and too soft, allowing Courtois to reach up a right hand to palm it away, this place erupting.If that seemed like the spark Madrid needed, the fatalism flooding through Arsenal, it was quickly followed by another. Or so, at least, it seemed when Letexier gave a penalty for a tug on Kylian Mbappé. Rice, though, protested his innocence and although it took a good five minutes to go and look, the referee eventually agreed.Relief reinforced the plan. Arteta’s team managed the tempo, slowing down when it suited and occasionally stepping out. He had talked about the value of frustrating Madrid, turning that expectation against them, and that was a fairly accurate description of what was happening. David Raya was booked for time-wasting but not called on to make a save in the first half. Courtois had made three, the last a sharp stop from Rice.Madrid lacked structure and ideas, a Lucas Vázquez cross that curled all the way through proving to be about the best they could offer and an indication of their limitations. Nor did they really have the energy to create the chaos they sought. There was a tiredness about them, little spark.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vinícius smashed the ball into an empty net, suddenly there was a roar, a flicker of hope, a reaction to something so ridiculous that for a moment Madrid thought that maybe, maybe, it could be the start of something even more ridiculous.Arsenal, though, were not going to let that happen: not now, not ever, Martinelli adding the final line of the story they will tell for a long time.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueReal MadridArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Dallas fans are furious – and they’re not aloneWed 16 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 11.39 EDTShareIn the NBA, villainy rarely looks like chaos. It often arrives in the form of billionaires who believe their power serves a greater good. The NBA’s old guard of terrible owners – Donald Sterling, Glen Taylor and Robert Sarver – have mostly exited the stage, having offloaded their controlling stakes in recent years. Even James Dolan, long regarded as the autocratic overlord of the New York Knicks, has begun toloosen his grip on basketball operations. Yet as the league evolves, the absence of these figures creates a vacuum – one in which a new archetype of villainous owner can emerge. And from where I stand, Miriam Adelson is the No 1 example.Adelson, the widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson,is worth around $27bn, making her one of the world’s richest women. Her fortune primarily stems from her majority ownership in the Las Vegas Sands casino and resort company. In late 2023, she purchased majority ownership of the Dallas Mavericksfrom Mark Cuban for $3.5bn. In a little over two years in charge, she has alienated large parts of the team’s fanbase by allowing thetrade of a generational superstar, Luka Dončić, who took the team to the NBA finals last season.US sports owners make huge political donations. Which party does your team’s give to?Read moreAdelson, her son-in-law Patrick Dupont and former shoe salesman-turned-Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison haveturned the Mavericks into a laughingstock. The city of Dallas is still seething from losing Dončić, who will almost certainly end up in the Hall of Fame. Chants of “Fire Nico” have broken out across the city,from Medieval Timestocollege basketball games. Harrison may have traded Dončić, but he did so with the blessing and support of Adelson. More troubling to fans like me are her close links to Donald Trump; she is a Maga megadonor, themost generous of any sports team ownerby some distance, and herstaunch support of Israelas tens of thousands of Palestinianssuffer under a brutal war.NBA owners havelong participated in political fundraising, often quietly backing presidential candidates behind the scenes. Yet few have done so as overtly as Adelson. Her political engagement transcends mere support and enters the realm of activism – in 2024 alone, Adelson gave more $100m to Trump’s campaign efforts –the very term conservatives so often weaponize as a pejorative. And that’s before we get to an op-ed she wrote in 2023,saying pro-Palestinian protestorsare “not our critics. They are our enemies.” Adelson, of course, is perfectly entitled to support whichever politician she wants and have her own opinions on Israel – and many Mavs fans don’t care, as long as the team performs well (which it isn’t). But for other fans, myself included, there’s an enduring irony in how many on the right bristle when players like LeBron James speak out on social issues yet remain unbothered when an NBA team owner funnels millions into a presidential campaign or has their own say on politics. Those critics stay triggered when players mix sports and politics, but not when owners contribute millions to elect candidates – a darkly hilarious lack of self-awareness.View image in fullscreenMiriam Adelson, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, looks on during the first half of a November game against the Orlando Magic at American Airlines Center.Photograph: Sam Hodde/Getty ImagesI see the on-court basketball chaos funded by Adelson as a fitting – if much less serious – parallel toher supportof an Israeli regime that has inflicted suffering on the Palestinian people. Since the controversial trade that sent Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers, the Mavericks have experienced a near-total unraveling. A series of injuries, along with the absence of Dončić, mean the Mavericks only just scraped into the play-in tournament a year after reaching the NBA finals. Meanwhile, the franchise has relinquished control of its first-round draft picks from 2027 through 2030 – a period during which their aging core, including Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving, will likely be in steep decline.To compound the fan revolt, shortly after the trade the Mavericks announced an average season ticket priceincrease of 8% for 2025-26, with some seat hikes increasing by 10%. If the goal was to alienate fans, it proved remarkably effective.ESPN’s Tim MacMahon reportedthat moving on from Dončić may significantly damage the Mavericks – potentially causing the franchise to “lose dozens of millions in revenue this season due to dwindling crowds, plummeting merchandise sales and sponsors severing ties with the franchise in the wake of the trade.” There have been very visible signs of fans’ discontent: when Dončić returned to Dallas with the Lakers to play the Mavs last week, a“Fire Nico” muralhad been erected five minutes away from the stadium.Inside the arena, as the Mavericks played a tribute video thanking Dončić for his years of brilliance with the team, the fruits of Adelson’s ownership decisions came into full view. Dončić, sensing what was to come, asked for a towel before the montage even began – soon he was in floods of tears. Then he stepped on to court and scored 45 points asthe Lakers routed the Mavs 112-97.Watching it all from the seats was Dirk Nowitzki, the man who had led Dallas to their first – and only – NBA title in 2011. When he retired in 2019, a year after the Mavericks drafted Dončić, it seemed like a perfect passing of the torch – until Adelson, Dumont, and Harrison traded away Dončić, the new heart and soul of Dallas. For fans like myself, they did not seem to understand or care about how much Dončić meant to the city of Dallas. Like many superstars before him, he embodied the hopes and dreams of the city he wore on his chest. But from her support of the divisive presidency of Trump – in a city wheremost of the population voted for Kamala Harrisin 2024 – to her backing of Israel as the Gaza campaign continues, to her ownership of the Mavericks, Adelson strikes me as someone who cares little about how her decisions affect others.There have always been NBA villains. But this may be the first time we’ve had one whose emblem you can wear on a jersey andwhose massive influenceshapes both the league and American legislation and policy.Explore more on these topicsDallas MavericksNBABasketballUS sportsLuka DončićcommentShareReuse this content"

So why are its brightest stars drawn to the US president? The answer lies in marginalization and the need to be seenWed 16 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTShareEvery March, I tune in to the NCAA Division I Men’sWrestlingChampionships, a ritual I associate with the arrival of spring. It also reminds me of my own athletic tenure. I grew up in rural Pennsylvania and started wrestling when I was five, and went on to compete at the Division I level in college.This year’s championships were compulsive viewing. Penn State’s Carter Starocci became the firstfive-time D-I national champion, and Oklahoma State’s Wyatt Hendrickson stunned Olympic champion,Gable Steveson, in the heavyweight final.Oh. And Donald Trump was there. Joining him were Elon Musk, former wrestler turned Republican Ohio congressman Jim Jordan, and other political allies.Trump made his entrance in Philadelphia’s Wells Fargo Center to cheers and “U-S-A, U-S-A” chants. He appeared after Starocci had just claimed his historic fifth title, prompting ESPN to interrupt Starocci’s interview and cut to the president. As Trump waved to the crowd, I received a text from a former training partner – “Dude, WTF” he wrote. I knew what he meant. I felt the same sinking disappointment.Our sentiments, however, were not shared by many of the wrestlers at the tournament. Throughout the night, athletes shook hands with the president, posed with him for pictures and let him hold their NCAA trophies, obelisk-like totems that represent years of bloody sacrifice the uninitiated would be hard-pressed to fathom. On his X account, Tom Ryan, head coach at Ohio State, posted a picture of himself and Elon Musk, whom he called one of his “favorite men”. Hendrickson celebrated his victory by firing a stout salute in Trump’s direction and draping an American flag over his massive shoulders.Two days after the tournament, StaroccijoinedFox & Friends, and, despite his name being mispronounced multiple times, seemed happy to be there. Hendricksonappearedvia video chat on America’s Newsroom, where Fox anchor Bill Hemmer, like many others, called him “Captain America”. Both interviews focused on wrestling and Trump in equal measure.What do these athletes see in Trump? He is a wrestler’s opposite in nearly every way. Though he has a weird habit of trying to dominate handshakes, he’s never been a serious athlete,despite his boasts. His privilege has shielded him from accountability throughout his life. Among high-level wrestlers, personal accountability is a deep, almost spiritual core value. Most wrestlers never reach their athletic goals, regardless of how hard they work. I can attest that such failures are crushing. And yet, when it comes to losses, most wrestlers reject any form of excuse. Two years ago, in a bout considered one of the all-time college upsets, Matt Ramos of Purdue pinned Iowa superstar, Spencer Lee. Lee, who was injured, said in a Barstoolinterview, “I saw people say I lost because I was hurt … That’s not true. I got beat. I hate when people try to make excuses for me when I got outwrestled and beat.” Trump has yet to publicly concede his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.This paradox is not surprising. Many of Trump’s fans voted for policies that will not benefit their lives. Their support is based on emotion, not logic. Viewed through this lens, college wrestling’s embrace of Trump makes sense. Trump’s antagonistic relationship with higher ed matters little when, to wrestling, he and his allies say, “We love you, we’re proud of you.”For a sport routinely shoved to the margins, this high-profile support is significant. Penn State’s Mitchell Mesenbrinksaidif “you put politics aside, no matter if you’re conservative or liberal … to have the president of the United States be at something we want to get people to watch … [is] really, really cool.” Wasted tax dollars notwithstanding, Mesenbrink is right. You seldom see wrestlers in a montage on Gatorade commercials. You don’t hear about them inking huge corporate sponsorship deals. Simone Biles, Caitlin Clark and Michael Phelps are household names, yet a relatively small sect outside the wrestling world knows who Jordan Burroughs is. In 2016, The New Yorker publishedThe Faces of College Wrestlers, which featured portraits taken after wrestlers had stepped off the mat. I was delighted until I read the article’s comment section on Facebook. With articulate prose, people had reduced these young men to knuckle-dragging stereotypes. The phrase “toxic masculinity” appeared multiple times.Negative attention is nothing new for wrestling. Fifty years ago, there were more than 150 D-I wrestling programs; as of 2025,there are 79. My alma mater, Boston University, cut its program in 2014 to make space for men’s lacrosse. To me, an elite urban school rejecting wrestling for a sport associated with affluence felt like a rejection of my home state, and, more broadly, of rural America.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump waves as he arrives at the NCAA Division I Men’s Wrestling Championships last month in Philadelphia.Photograph: Kayla Bartkowski/Getty ImagesHerein lies the other thread that tethers wrestling to Trump: while wrestling programs of all levels exist in various parts of the country, wrestling is largely associated with rural America. The urban-rural divide has continued to widen since Trump first entered the political arena. Many rural voters have voiced feelings of being unseen – or, if seen, of being scorned – by the political elite. Trump’s policies do not improve life for most of his rural constituents – quite the opposite. Nonetheless, to these voters, Trump routinely says,I see you.Democrats have struggled to find a language that engages rural America (a trend Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are trying to change). Similarly, many on the left have faltered when it comes to locating a productive language to discuss masculinity. Trump fills that void, hollow as his platitudes may be.It took me three application cycles to gain admission to a fully funded MFA program. As rejections rolled in, I leaned on the persistence wrestling had instilled in me. My eventual acceptance letter filled me with as much joy as any win on the mat ever had. My first night on campus, an MFA colleague, referring to my identity as a straight white male, asked, “How does it feel to be part of the problem?” The question portended a number of similar experiences. Phrases like “toxic masculinity” and “lit bro” were swung in my direction like a judge banging a gavel. In those moments, I wanted to turn translucent – to hold out my arms like a Da Vinci sketch and show the scar tissue and nerve damage and old surgeries and say,see?In aguest essayfor the New York Times, David J Morris laments the dearth of young men involved in the reading and writing of literature. He notes that this reality is reflected in our national politics. “Young men who still exhibit curiosity about the world,” he writes, “Too often seek intellectual stimulation through figures of the ‘manosphere’ such as Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan.”Morris points out a number of discouraging trends. Suicide rates among young men have skyrocketed while educational statistics continue to plummet. Young men who exhibit “traditional” masculine qualities, such as physical strength and self-reliance, are labeled “toxic” by a culture that will just as quickly make male vulnerability the punchline of a joke.Last year, astudyconducted at Dublin City University by Dr Catherine Baker, professor Debbie Ging, and Dr Maja Brandt Andreasen uncovered the alarming extent to which algorithms used by social media platforms recommend misogynistic content to young men. A 2023studyconducted by the Pew Research Center found that young men are reaching financial milestones at a slower rate than men of previous generations, while numbers among women swing in the opposite direction.Leading up to the election, Trump took pains to forge an associative link between young men’s economic woes and progressive politics; his racist and misogynistic attacks on Kamala Harris fed into a prevailing sense of anger and dissatisfaction. The irony, of course, is that Trump has a long history of relying on immigrant labor and stiffing the working class. On 13 July 2024, the attempt on Trump’s life at a rally in Pennsylvania further solidified his tough-guy image. AP photographer Evan Vuccicaptured a photo of Trumppumping his fist like a victorious athlete as blood dripped from his ear. (Celebrations of Trump’s temerity tended to ignore the fact that audience member Corey Comperatore was killed.) The president also has a strong relationship with the UFC. Last Saturday, heattended UFC 314 in Miami. For fight fans, chaos-inducing trade policies are trivial when Trump – like a Roman emperor at the Colosseum – sits among the people for a dose of cathartic violence. Is it thus surprising that Trump made significant gains among young men of all backgrounds in last year’s presidential election?Wrestling is hard, and those who excel at it deserve to be celebrated. It teaches young people how to hold themselves accountable and persevere through difficult challenges – skills that seem to be in short supply. Boys are not the lone beneficiaries. Girls’ wrestling is America’s fastest growing high school sport. While many figures of the “manosphere” champion physical fitness, the wholesale conflation of fitness and toxic masculinity is a mistake. Wrestling, like any sport, has its bad actors. Still, no one benefits when those who promote inclusiveness take it upon themselves to define masculinity with narrow parameters that shame a large number of young men. Shame drives these young men toward the praise of a hypocritical false idol, and, worse, toward “manosphere” extremism.Perhaps the wrestling world’s embrace of Trump is a metonym for our historical moment. How to positively reengage young men is the question with which America must grapple if it is going to wrest democracy from the jaws of defeat. The whistle has already been blown; the match is underway.Explore more on these topicsWrestlingDonald TrumpCollege sportsUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

The grand old venue had been buffeted by wind and water all ­evening but here was the fire: Inter’s players wheeled over towards their faithful, the stands bouncing to the tune of another legend in the making.European football will miss this stadium achingly whenever it is finally put out to pasture; here it hosted another cocktail of gravitas and exuberance, tense to the last before bursting at the seams, and goodness knows what awaits when Barcelona arrive in the semi-finals three weeks from now.Saka and Martinelli fire Arsenal to last four after famous win at Real MadridRead moreNobody should sleep on Inter as a credible contender to go all the way. They rode their luck during periods of this tie but, at every moment of doubt, found an intervention that bent things in their direction. That kind of quality is usually deemed intangible but Lautaro Martínez, yet to calm down while pandemonium reigned around him, had his own attempt at defining it. “Inter has two balls like that,” he said. “It was an epic match. Inter does not die, Inter has ­personality, heart and brains. Inter is made for great things.”Martínez could thump out the bombast because he had put Inter back on track after Harry Kane, down on his haunches while the home side partied, had levelled the tie. Like his team, Martínez had worked busily for almost an hour without posing much direct threat. He vaulted the advertising hoardings after lashing in a loose ball, presented to him when his header struck Joshua Kimmich, and Inter could spy a way out of their awkward spot.Soon afterwards Benjamin Pavard, powering in Hakan Calhanoglu’s corner for his first goal since joining Inter from Bayern in 2023, doubled their cushion and brought the house down. It said plenty for Bayern that they could nonetheless have forced extra time, Eric Dier looping a header beyond Yann Sommer and bringing about that frenzied finale. “There was a lot that felt right today,” Vincent Kompany said, but the lasting emotion for his side was regret.“It’s a hard reality that we’re not going to play theChampions Leaguefinal at home,” Kompany added. An injury-hit Bayern had wasted chances at the Allianz Arena last week, Kane the most glaring offender, and shaded things on that metric this time too.Thomas Müller, who had equalised in the first meeting, was recalled to the starting lineup as captain and a greater sense of clarity resulted. His link-ups with Michael Olise carved through Inter three times in the first 11 minutes, the most notable opening seeing Alessandro Bastoni deny the London-born forward with a goal-saving tackle.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane scores Bayern Munich’s opening goal with Federico Dimarco of Inter (right) failing to block his shot.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APBefore half-time Müller would see a shot blocked and, just after Kane had punished a backing-off Federico Dimarco with a laser-like finish across Sommer, he spooned over from a fine position on the left of the box. This was an appearance that put him joint third in this competition’s all-time rankings, alongside Lionel Messi, but he will leave Bayern at the season’s end and may not grace this stage again. A degree of their old dead-eyed inevitability will depart with him.He would rue the fact Martínez, showcasing the anatomical qualities he evidently prizes, converted almost immediately after that miss. Pavard picked his moment three minutes after and the sequence summed up Inter’s endeavours over the piece. They did not flow for long periods in either match but moments of devastating emphasis and explosion never feel far away. Simone Inzaghi must have envisaged those coming from counterattacks but both goals came from left-sided set-pieces that Bayern did not handle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nor did they help Henrikh Mkhitaryan when, after a marvellous piece of first-half skill, the ball eventually took a bizarre flight back towards Inter’s half. But they were not the ones who would be harmed if the elements disrupted play and ultimately, for all Bayern’s probing, they could claim to have performed the basics better.Kane hooked over in added time, the angle awkward but the goal beckoning, and will wonder if club football’s biggest prize is destined to slip away. He and Kompany thought Inter had over-celebrated their dramatic victory eight days before but no such complaints would have been credible while the festivities raged this time. “We’re not putting limits on ourselves,” Pavard said.

Given his electric impact on proceedings it was appropriate that Murphy scored it.When Kieran Trippier cued up the winger near the right corner flag, everyone expected Murphy to cross or cut back but, instead, he whipped a high-velocity shot into the top corner. Maybe it is his way of answering back after reading the incessant stream of reports insisting that Howe’s summer transfer market priority is a new “upgraded” right‑winger. On this evidence any replacement will need to be red hot. In his past 18 games, Murphy has clocked up eight goals and nine assists.Newcastle spent much of last summer trying, and failing, to sign Marc Guéhi from Palace. Here Glasner’s captain and key central defender endured a night to forget, shaking his head as Murphy’s goal deceived him.How Guéhi could have done with Eberechi Eze equalising from the penalty spot. That kick was awarded – following a lengthy VAR review – when Nick Pope rather carelessly caught Chris Richards as they challenged for a Palace free‑kick.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

First he directed a cross towards Isak and watched in satisfaction as the ball deflected off Guéhi and looped over Henderson.Having warmed up, Barnes then collected Tonali’s pass, removed Maxence Lacroix from Glasner’s defensive equation courtesy of a smart stepover and, rather than cut in on his right foot, lashed an angled left-foot shot into the bottom corner.Fabian Schär headed in Newcastle’s fourth after Trippier tapped a free‑kick to Murphy whose expertly curved cross created yet another goal. What price impending England call‑ups for Murphy and Barnes?Isak had been having a bit of an off night by his lofty standards, missing a few chances, but he curled a superlative fifth -– Newcastle’s ninth goal in two games -– past Henderson from 20 yards. The blur of perfectly synchronised movement as the Swede shot first time after seizing on the fall out from Joelinton’s tackle on Lacroix emphasised precisely why he is valued at £150m.Glasner had no complaints. “Credit to a very, very good Newcastle side,” he said. “We couldn’t compete with them. We couldn’t deal with their intensity, directness and pace. Nothing worked; we just have to throw this one in the bin.”Newcastle v Crystal Palace: Premier League – liveRead moreExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

With the victory, Ju becomes only the fourth woman in history to win the title five times, joining a storied class that includes Vera Menchik, Nona Gaprindashvili and Maia Chiburdanidze.The best-of-12-games match ended with three contests to spare after Ju secured a calm, risk-free draw in game nine to punctuate a stretch of four straight wins that all but sealed the result. She takes home the winner’s purse of €300,000 ($340,580) while Tan earns €200,000.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on lichess.org.

In previous matches, she’d always needed the final game to prevail. Not this time. Even after falling behind early with a loss in the second game, she stormed back, breaking the match wide open with four consecutive wins from the fifth through eighth games – something no player had done in a women’s world championship since the 1950s.Her victory is also the latest chapter in a personal rivalry nearly a decade in the making. In 2017, Tan eliminated Ju en route to becoming world champion. The following year, Ju won the rematch, narrowly edging Tan to claim her first world title. Since then, she’s successfully defended the crown in every format: through a 64-player knockout later in 2018, a dramatic match against Aleksandra Goryachkina in 2020 and a tense face-off with Lei Tingjie in 2023.Chess: Magnus Carlsen in form at Paris Freestyle after Hans Niemann drops outRead moreThis 2025 edition brought the rivalry full circle. The match was staged across both players’ hometowns – starting in Ju’s Shanghai and moving midway to Tan’s Chongqing – a symbolic nod to the shared history and national dominance of Chinese women’s chess.For a while, it looked as though the fight would be close. Tandrew first blood with a shock winin game two, taking advantage of a rare Ju error in the endgame. But Ju struck back immediately, and the turning point came just after the halfway mark. In game five, she dismantled Tan’s Sicilian setup with positional pressure. Then she built momentum – tactically sharp in game six, surgically precise in games seven and eight.Each of those victories told a story. In the seventh game, Tan created real chances but overplayed her hand, pushing for a win she desperately needed and slipping into time trouble. In the eighth, Ju passed up a chance to force a draw, choosing instead to grind out a difficult endgame – and doing so flawlessly. That marked the first time a player had won at least four straight games in a women’s world title match since Elisaveta Bykova won six on the trot against Olga Rubtsova in 1958.By the time they returned to the board for Wednesday’s ninth encounter, the match was effectively over. Ju needed only a draw and she played for exactly that: safe, clean and with total command. The queens came off early, the position simplified, and Tan, with no realistic chance of catching up, offered the handshake.“I was playing more and more in the zone,” Ju said afterward. She credited her team, including grandmasters Ni Hua and Maxim Matlakov, for keeping her steady after the early setback. Tan, meanwhile, acknowledged the weight of the moment. “I think I exposed some of my weaknesses,” she said. “If I want to continue this journey, I’ll have to fix them.”Both players are set to return to international competition next month: Tan in Austria and Sweden, Ju in Norway.But for Ju, this win is more than another notch in her résumé. It’s a generational marker. Seven years after first claiming the crown, she has now reigned through an entire cycle of challengers and formats, defending the title at home and abroad and turning back the same opponent who once dethroned her.Explore more on these topicsChessChinaShareReuse this content"

'There is no evidence leading back to me,' Mayer said after winning the WBO title bout. 'It's not my style'. The American also won a rematch with Ryan in Las Vegas last month.Carlsen v Niemann chess dramaAfter 19-year-old Hans Niemann beat world champion Magnus Carlsen at the 2022 Sinquefield Cup, Carlsen withdrew from the event and then resigned from an online game after one move. Another grandmaster, Hikaru Nakamura, claimed Carlsen thought Niemann was 'probably cheating' – and wild online theories included the use of vibrating anal beads to signal moves. Niemann, who did admit to cheating in online games several years ago, filed a $100m lawsuit which was settled in 2023.Sweet revenge for IndiaIndia's Test match against England at Trent Bridge in 2007 was marred by a bizarre incident, as jelly beans appeared on the wicket when Zaheer Khan came out to bat. Zaheer claimed 'someone was chucking them from behind me,' and started a heated exchange with the England slips, who denied all knowledge. While Kevin Pietersen bore the brunt of Zaheer's ire, bowler Chris Tremlett later claimed the idea came from Ian Bell.

The Guardian contacted Johnson for a response.Other club personnel have reported allegations of misconduct to the FA, which is understood to be working with the club to try to help them resolve the situation.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Johnson’s relegation request is highly unlikely to be successful because it is understood the FA considers such requests only if they are submitted by a club with supporting evidence from their board or committee members, rather than by an individual, and it is understood that Johnson – one of two directors who co‑own the parent company of Hull City Ladies with an equal 50% stake – acted alone.Hull City Ladies – who are not affiliated with the men’s Championship team Hull City – are ninth in the Northern Premier Division, 14 points clear of the relegation zone and safe from the drop, with one game remaining.The players are also unhappy that they do not have medical insurance at the club and the Guardian has been told the club does not employ a strength and conditioning coach. Eight of the team’s players are said to have sustained serious knee injuries in the past 18 months. One Hull player, Hope Knight, wrote on Facebook: “That’s not a coincidence. That’s what happens when footballers are treated like an afterthought – when ambition is replaced by greed.”Others wishing to remain anonymous have alleged to the Guardian that Johnson “hopes the club will have to close down”, describing his request for relegation as an act of “deliberate self-harm” towards the club to try to punish the players. Knight also wrote in her Facebook post: “We can’t stay silent any longer. This is our reality, and it’s time people knew. As players and staff, we’ve seen it with our own eyes – we’ve been lied to, manipulated and bullied.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Postecoglou admitted that it was a blow to lose his captain as his team prepare for their most important game of the season, after a 17th Premier League defeat of the campaignagainst Wolves on Sunday.‘Right direction’: Enzo Maresca defends Chelsea’s style before Legia Warsaw testRead moreHowever, asked whether he was feeling the burden of pressure as Spurs attempt to reach the last four of this competition for the first time since winning it in 1984, Postecoglou said he is not concerned about what fate awaits him if they lose.“No, not at all mate,” the Australian said. “Because I don’t define my career and me as a person by what people think about me. I never have. Never will. If you don’t think I’m a good coach today, you won’t think I’m a good coach tomorrow, even if we win. One game ain’t going to make a difference to that. You either think I’m capable of doing the job now or you don’t.“That’s where I sit with these things. If people think that us winning tomorrow all of a sudden makes me a better manager than what I am today or us losing tomorrow somehow makes me a worse manager, I guess that’s their burden, not mine. I don’t think that way and I don’t think most people think that way. Or I’d like to think they don’t, in terms of their own sort of self-esteem and who they are as people. I couldn’t care less.“What I’m sitting here doing is thinking we’ve got a great opportunity to get to the final four of a major tournament. I’m not going to let that slip by without fighting tooth and nail for it irrespective of what may come the day after.”Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola and Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner –who led Frankfurt to Europa League glory in 2022– have been linked to Spurs if Postecoglou is sacked. Tottenham are on course for their lowest Premier League points tally after a season that has been scarred by injuries and individual errors, with Postecoglou confirming that Guglielmo Vicario and Cristian Romero will retain their places despite making mistakes against Wolves.“It’s better they don’t make them at all but they’re human beings, these things happen,” he said. “Both have got a really good mentality, they’re both strong leaders, they’re both strong individuals. They weren’t hiding away from the fact that they made those mistakes, they owned up to them which is no surprise to me. And I think they’ll go out tomorrow night not thinking about that but, again, thinking about the opportunity for us.”Frankfurt have lost only once at home against an English club in eight meetings and the Frankfurt defender Robin Koch, formerly of Leeds, warned Spurs they will be entering “the lion’s den” of 58,000 supporters at Deutsche Bank Park. But Micky van de Ven is confident they can cope with the hostile atmosphere and was adamant that the Tottenham players are still behind Postecoglou.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the head coach will start Onana in Thursday’s return at Old Trafford as United seek to progress to a semi-final against Rangers or Athletic Bilbao.Onana has made a number of errors since joining United in July 2023. Amorim was asked whether he would consider acquiring a new goalkeeper in the next window.Aston Villa fall short of heroic comeback against PSG – Football WeeklyRead more“We are going to make that evaluation for any position in the squad,” he said. “You can see my record [too] – my record is the worst in the team. I am also underperforming. We need to improve. We cannot change all the players.“We need to improve every position on the field. Goalkeeper is the same; we can work with André. André Onana already proved he is a top player with Inter. Altay the same with Fenerbahce. We have some seasons where we are underperforming.”Amorim admitted resting Onana may have increased the scrutiny on the 29-year-old for Lyon’s visit. The manager said: “This is the big factor in being a coach: everything you do has two ways. If he is going to be really good tomorrow – I am sure of that – but if it is the other way, people will say it is a bad decision. We never know.“I am trying to be clear on things, try to make the evaluation, be really simple, not overthinking. When I imagine the game, I see André Onana. He had one weekend of rest, so now he is ready to return to competition and I chose André to start this game. When I made that decision I talked before with André and that is important – to explain to the player to understand what I am thinking.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chelsea sit sixth in the league with six games left as they chase Champions League qualification, with Maresca’s patient and possession‑heavy formula under focus.“In the last two years, Chelsea has been top four zero times,” the head coach said. “This season we have been top four most of our season. I was not here last season, two years ago. So I’m not judging what’s happened last year or two years ago. I’m just judging this season. And this is the reason why I think fans, they have to trust the team, they have to trust the club, what we are doing now.“I think it’s quite clear that the direction is the right one. The style is the right one. Before the Ipswich game, we were the third‑best defenders after Arsenal and Liverpool. And the third- or fourth‑best attacking. They are numbers that show that the team is doing well.”Chelsea finished sixth last season under Mauricio Pochettino; the year before they were 12th. Before last weekend’s fixtures, the club were fifth in the league in terms of goals scored (54) and fourth in terms of fewest conceded (37).In regards to unrest among supporters, Maresca said: “If fans complain because after four minutes our keeper gave the ball away, if I am one of the fans, I also complain. But sometimes also they complain with something that probably they cannot see, but it’s a planned game.“The fans, with us, they have been always good.Sometimes they are not happy, but when you are 0-2 at home against Ipswich and we are making some mistakes, it’s normal that they are not happy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So this is the reason why probably we attack more and we attack more quick. But against the rest, they just wait inside the box, it’s a different game.

And yet at 3-2, there was the claw up and over to keep out Youri Tielemans’s looping header and the one-on-one block against the Villa substitute and PSG loanee Marco Asensio.Donnarumma had no time for the Asensio narrative or the one about a Villa comeback for the ages, one to take a stellar return to Europe’s elite competition after a four decades-plus absence to a glorious new pitch. That said, it felt a little incongruous for Donnarumma to end up as the PSG story because it was not how it was meant to be, how the French champions have been cast this season, certainly since the turn of the year.When Luis Enrique’s team reported back after the winter break, they beat Monaco in Qatar to win the Trophée des Champions, and before the trip to Villa Park their record in 2025 showed 22 wins from 24 matches. They drew with Reims in Ligue 1 and there was also theChampions Leaguelast-16 first‑leg defeat against Liverpool.And yet even that 1-0 reverse at the Parc des Princes, which would not be an impediment to progress, was an occasion to embellish their reputation for exciting football, where control is the basis, expression and fearlessness the motifs. Towards the end of January in their penultimate group tie, PSG had shrugged off a 2-0 deficit at home against Manchester City tostorm to a 4-2 victory. The 3-1 first‑leg win against Villa was another showcase for the off‑the‑cuff talents of their attacking players.The Villa Park return was not the game that PSG wanted, even if the opening half-hour went well, the full-backs Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes getting forward to finish off lovely counters. PSG took their foot off the pedal, they lost control in midfield.Against a Villa team with nothing to lose, they almost lost it all. From the start of the second half to about the 70th minute, PSG suffered as never before under Luis Enrique. “I don’t think this team has been so dominated by another team in that way,” he said.Luis Enrique talked about PSG feeling “overconfident” at 2-0 and perhaps the overall experience was just a part of what you get with a young team. The 12 players that Luis Enrique used had an average age of 24.4. It was their fifth defeat of the Champions League season; they lost against Arsenal, Atlético Madrid and Bayern Munich in the league stage.View image in fullscreenThere is an old-school vibe to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (pictured), Ousmane Dembélé,Désiré Doué and Bradley Barcola in PSG’s way of playing.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianPSG have dominated domestically, wrapping up the league title and winning through to the Coupe de France final, where they will face Reims. They have yet to lose in either competition. But the Champions League is another level and it has revealed a few vulnerabilities.The broader takeaway is that thrilling and flawed is good; jeopardy the same. It can be difficult for the neutral to warm to expensively assembled squads that bulldoze all before them, especially when they are loaded with megastar individuals. For the first time since Nasser al-Khelaifi and his Qatar Sports Investments group took a majority stake in PSG in the summer of 2011, the club has a seriously popular team.It is because they are one in the truest sense, no more Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappé, the impossible-to-accommodate “three kings” as the former managerMauricio Pochettino once called them. But mainly it is because of their outlook, how they look to play.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionMake no mistake, Luis Enrique wants to hog the ball, he wants to pass the opposition to death, with Vitinha setting the tone in front of the back four. Luis Enrique is obsessed with hard work, with discipline. Remember how he dropped Ousmane Dembélé for the Arsenal game after the forward, surely the squad’s highest‑profile player, fell short of showing the team ethic that is demanded? But it is the creative licence which Luis Enrique has granted that sets this group apart.There is an argument to say that PSG are the most watchable team in Europe at present, even in defeat over 90 minutes. It is because of how Luis Enrique encourages his players to make their moves in the one-v-ones, starting with the full‑backs who he plays daringly high and majoring on those in the front three.There is an old-school vibe to Dembélé and Bradley Barcola, to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Désiré Doué. In a game where structured systems stuff is taking over, PSG are an antidote. They are a team to save football from itself.In the early days of the QSI project,Khelaifi told the Guardianthat he wanted to invest in young players, to develop PSG’s infrastructure and to market the club as an international brand. He has delivered. PSG opened a state‑of-the-art training campus last November and have pushed themselves on the fashion front, helped by a collaboration with Nike and Michael Jordan. They have stores on Oxford Street in London and Fifth Avenue in New York, among other cities.The domestic titles have been harvested; this season’s is No 11 for QSI. But what has eluded them is the Champions League. Before their takeover, PSG had next to no pedigree in the competition, their only impact having been the bolt to the 1994-95 semi-finals with Luis Fernández’s team of George Weah, Raí and David Ginola.PSG secured qualification back into it in QSI’s first season and they have since been an ever-present in the knockout rounds. Before this campaign, they had five last‑16 finishes, four quarter-finals, two semi-finals and one final – the defeat by Bayern in 2020.It is fair to say that PSG’s various demises were not greatly mourned outside their fanbase, but there is a different energy around things now; an interest, an admiration. Qatar is enjoying the reflected glory. PSG edge ever closer.Explore more on these topicsParis Saint-GermainEuropean club footballLigue 1Champions LeagueanalysisShareReuse this content"

The strikers Khadija Shaw and Vivianne Miedema also missed Sunday’s game with injuries.Fowler, who scored for Australia on home soilagainst South Koreaon 7 April, six days before her injury, told theMatildas’ website: “I’m really disappointed to be facing some time out of the game. It’s never easy when something like this happens especially when you’ve been working so hard and feeling good. The road ahead will be challenging, but I’m ready to take it on.“There’s still so much I want to achieve, and I’ll be using this time to grow in every way I can. I’m committed to doing the work, staying positive and coming back better than ever. I want to say a big thank you to everyone who’s sent messages or checked in – it’s honestly meant so much. The support from my teammates, family, friends and fans has been a real lift and reminded me how lucky I am to be surrounded by such a strong network.”Australia’s interim head coach, Tom Sermanni, said: “This is tough news for Mary and for all of us who know the dedication and passion she brings to her craft.

He also revealed that he called Pep Guardiola on the morning of the game to thank him for being an inspiration as a player and a coach and giving him the opportunity that led to him coaching here for the first time.Saka and Martinelli fire Arsenal to last four after famous win at Real MadridRead moreAsked if he had ever felt prouder of his players, Arteta replied: “Probably not, not only because we’re in the semi-final but the manner we did it. Because of the circumstances, the amount of injuries. It shows the character of this team, this club. This is another massive step for us.”Arteta admitted it only took a couple of minutes for him to realise that this was a stadium where anything could happen, but his players had shown the maturity to manage the difficult moments and find a way past Madrid. None more so than when Saka missed a first-half penalty.“It could have been a turning point emotionally in the game but the way he handles it, the personality, at his age playing in this stadium for the first time was incredible,” Arteta said. “I could have given him a clip round the ear. But he decided what is best: he had the courage to take it, that’s what he thought was best. I was more concerned about the emotional part of it [than the miss itself]. Then with the penalty [for Madrid] that they ruled out. I felt then that the game might be going somewhere we didn’t want.“You come here and see it live and you realise how difficult it is here, how anything can happen. They can drive you into scenarios that are very difficult. But we have done it and we did it in a very clever way. We were very clear.

Eight years afterlosing against Sergio García at Augusta National, Rose was beaten on the first extra holeby Rory McIlroy, who holed from short range for birdie after Rose’s attempt had narrowly missed.Rose had started the final round seven shots behind McIlroy, but made his 10th birdie of the day on the 18th in a closing 66 to set the clubhouse target, with McIlroy then missing from five feet for the title in regulation.Grace of Masters nearly man Justin Rose enhanced McIlroy’s historic win | Andy BullRead more“Mixed emotions for sure,” Rose, who also finishedsecond behind Jordan Spiethin 2015 and was runner-up in the Open Championshipat Royal Troon last year, said of his reflections on the Masters in a press conference ahead of the RBC Heritage.“A lot of outpouring from people with a lot of positive comments coming at me so trying to absorb that and absorb the week, but the same time looking at my phone and wishing there was a different message there.“Having been in that situation before and even more this time, I could really sense what it would be like to win it. I was right there on the edge of winning it obviously.“I certainly don’t feel down in any way, shape or form because of the performance I was able to put in and how I was able to feel putting in that performance, but just sort of ... don’t know what the right word is, tormented probably by the thought of what might have been.“I take that loss pretty badly. But listen, I was a stone’s throw away from winning the Open, winning the Masters. I would have been going for a grand slam at the PGA. It’s like, it can be that close. I’ve got to believe that.

He travelled smoothly for Kieran Shoemark towards the near side before a sharp turn of foot carried him into the lead with just under a furlong to run, and Field Of Gold then extended his advantage to three-and-a-half lengths at the post.It was a second success in a major 2,000 Guineas trial in the space of five days for the Juddmonte bloodstock operation, as Andrew Balding’s Jonquil, who was with the now‑retired Sir Michael Stoute as a two-year-old, took the Greenham Stakes at Newbury on Saturday.“This is a trial, it’s not the Guineas and you’re not fully wound up for this,” saidJohn Gosden, who has won every British Classic bar the 2,000 Guineas. “The race puts them where you want them, that’s the idea of the trials.

Consumers and advertisers use Google because it is helpful, not because there are no alternatives.”Brook said businesses had almost no choice but to use Google ads to advertise their products and services.“Regulators around the world have described Google as a monopoly and securing a spot on Google’s top pages is essential for visibility,” she said in a statement. “Google has been leveraging its dominance in the general search and search advertising market to overcharge advertisers.”TheCompetition and Markets Authoritylaunched a UK investigation into Google’s search services in January, which is still ongoing, including into their impact on advertising markets. It said at the time that millions of people and businesses relied on Google’s services, which accounted for 90% of searches and were used by more than 200,000 UK businesses to advertise.Google is facing several competition investigations and lawsuits around the world that relate to its digital advertising market dominance.Since September, it has been embroiled in asecond antitrust trialin the US over whether it has illegally monopolised the digital advertising industry, afterlosing a landmark case in August, which it is appealing against.One Google ad executivequoted in the US government’s complaintcompared the company’s business model to Goldman Sachs or Citibank owning the New York Stock Exchange.A loss in that trial could force Google to break up parts of its business and divest some of its advertising technology, hitting its primary source of revenue. It would also have far-reaching implications for the wider tech industry and online publishers.In March, the European CommissionaccusedGoogle of breaking its competition rules for digital markets by prioritising search engine results that pointed to Alphabet’s own services over those of rivals, breaching the requirement to treat third-party services in a “transparent, fair and non-discriminatory” way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its shares have risen by more than 1,400% since 2020, making it one of the few businesses in the US worth trillions of dollars.However, the news on Tuesday sent Nvidia shares down about 6% in after-hours trading in the US, which could wipe off billions from its market value at the opening bell on Wednesday.A chipmaker sell-off has already started in Asia, with South Korean semiconductor businesses such as Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix falling by as much as 3% overnight. In Europe, shares in ASML dropped 5% in early trading after its chief executive, Christophe Fouquet, said: “The recent tariff announcements have increased uncertainty in the macro environment and the situation will remain dynamic for a while.” The Dutch company, which produces lithography machines used to make chips, also reported that orders in its first financial quarter were €3.94bn (£3.37bn), about €1bn less than investors had expected.Shares in the US competitor Advanced Micro Devices also fell 7% in after-hours trading.While so far the chip industry has been exempt from the 10% tariffs that started on 5 April, Trump said he would announce a levy on imported semiconductors over this week, adding that there could be some flexibility for certain companies in the sector.This week, the US Department of Commerceinitiated an investigationinto the impact of imports of chips and pharmaceuticals on American national security.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To be clear, these weren’t the words of Angelo Moriondo, the Italian inventor who patented the first espresso machine in 1884, but it’s nice to imagine that he shared the sentiment. Without him, and the inventors that refined his creation, our daily lives – the sour-faced commutes and sunny weekend strolls – would be all the poorer.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Espresso forms the bedrock of many coffee staples – the latte, the cappuccino, the flat white, the americano – but making the perfect shot, or just a rather good one, is a thrillingly contentious topic. Millions of hours of YouTube videos have been dedicated to the craft, and the associated Reddit threads may one day form a voluminous historical artefact.The truth? It’s not hard to brew good espresso at home. It’s not even that hard to make a fairly great one – all you need is a decent espresso machine on your worktop, a respectable grinder, some freshly roasted coffee and the patience to do more than press a single button. The new breed of “assisted” models even do most of the hard work for you, if you prefer.Over the past couple of months, I’ve put a troop of espresso machines, from £100 manual wonders to four-figure assisted wunderkinds, through a highly caffeinated bootcamp to find the best-value espresso machines money can buy.At a glanceBestmanual espresso machineoverall:Lelit Anna PL41TEM£509.95 at AmazonBest budget espresso machine:De’Longhi Stilosa EC230£89 at AmazonBestfor temperature control on a budget:ProCook espresso machine£199 at ProCookBestif you can afford it:Sage Dual Boiler£1,249.95 at SageBestassisted espresso machine overall:Ninja Luxe Cafe Premier£499 at John LewisBest assisted machine for beginners:Sage Bambino Plus£349 at John LewisBest high-end assisted espresso machine:Sage Oracle Jet£1,699 at John LewisWhy you should trust meMy kitchen has hosted many coffee machines since I started reviewing them seven years ago. I’ve come to learn why even good coffee beans can make bad coffee, and I’ve spent hundreds of hours swearing at grinders, measuring scales and coffee machines in the search of bliss in a cup. My ideal? The best possible coffee with the bare minimum of effort. My attention span is short, my kids noisy and my need for caffeine insatiable.By the time I’ve decided a machine is worthy of sitting on my kitchen worktop, I’ve spent hours poking, prodding, pouring and slurping before finally putting pen to pad and fingers to keyboard.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘Several kilos of freshly roasted coffee beans were consumed during testing.’Photograph: Sasha MullerOver the course of several weeks, I made a lot of espresso. Some awful, some wonderful – but a lot of espresso all the same. The sheer number of machines (12, plus others that I’ll be reviewing in the coming months) meant I had to rotate the various machines in my kitchen, and then come back to specific models to test them side by side with their closest competitors.The starting point is good coffee. Several kilos of freshly roasted beans fromCraft House Coffeewere consumed during testing, and they were used about a fortnight after the roast date for optimum and comparable results. Grinders included aKingrinder K6 hand grinderand aBaratza Vario W+(which featured in our guide toeverything you need to make great coffee).In addition to taste testing, I also timed how long it took for machines to reach brewing temperature from cold, and how long it took to froth 180ml of fridge-cold milk to a creamy 65C microfoam.And if you’ve ever wondered how much espresso is too much, then I can safely say that it is once your eyeballs begin to feel as if they’re sweating. At this point, I recommend a drink of water, a nice sit down and some calming music. This paragraph is unofficially sponsored by Brian Eno.

A PID controller maintains temperature more precisely than thermostat boilers, and the result is more adjustability, better shot-to-shot consistency and no need to consider third-party upgrades.Why we love itThe simple LCD screen shows you the temperature and you can separately adjust the brew and steam temperature in a range from 80C to 130C. The default brew setting is a sensible 95C. A dial shows you the brew pressure, too, which is handy, and you can adjust it if you’re brave enough to delve inside the machine with a screwdriver.The machine takes about three minutes to heat up, and usefully the top tray warms up enough to heat a few espresso cups. The results are uniformly good, too. Excellent, even, for the money, and the adjustable temperature makes it easy to dial in lighter and darker roasts to perfection.Lelit is confident of the build quality. Unusually, you get two years of warranty for home use and a full year of warranty for commercial use – something that would void all the other warranties here.It’s a shame that …the build might be tough, but it all feels quite clunky, and beginners may find the manual fill boiler daunting. The bullet-point instructions look as if they’ve been printed straight out of Microsoft Word.Another minor annoyance: the 57mm portafilter is not a standard size, so upgrades are in shorter supply than the usual 58mm. Take note when buying replacement baskets, or a proper metal tamper for that matter – the awful plastic one supplied is sadly destined for the recycling bin. If you have hard water, you’ll want to stock up onLelit’s dedicated resin water filters, too – none are included.Type:manualDimensions:23x 38 x 34cm (WDH)Water tank:2.7lTime to heat up:3minsTime to steam milk:1min 19secsGrinder included:noNoise:50dB (brew), 67dB (steam)Warranty:two-year repair or replace at Lelit’s discretionBest budget espresso machine:De’Longhi Stilosa EC230View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller£89.99 at De’Longhi£89 at AmazonThe De’Longhi Stilosa is a rare sight: a genuinely decent espresso machine with an RRP that’s a whisker under £100. Pair it with a good grinder and it’ll pour a ludicrously tasty shot. What’s more, its basic steam wand creates the perfect microfoam for silky cappuccinos and flat whites.Why we love itThe first thing to be aware of is that there are three similar-looking models: the EC230, EC235 and EC260. The EC235 and EC260 come with pressurised baskets designed for use with pre-ground, not-so-fresh coffee; the EC235 has a manual steam wand, the EC260 a low-effort automatic wand. I tested the EC230 and the EC260, and it’s the EC230 I’d recommend: it comes with unpressurised single and double basketsanda manual steaming wand.There is a simple, plasticky charm to the Stilosa. It’s sturdy and solid for the cash; the controls are easy to get to grips with; and the design is sensible. The one-litre water tank slides in and out easily, and a little slot alongside stores the spare single or double shot basket. Leave the machine on for a few minutes, and the front section warms up enough to gently warm cups before you begin brewing.The manual steam wand makes a far silkier foam than the EC260’s automatic wand with the right technique, and with a little effort, the EC230 produced microfoam as good as any of the assisted machines here – and that includes the £1,699 Oracle Jet.It’s a shame that …at this price, my biggest complaint is that the user manual is awful. It swaps text for confusing illustrations, and this makes a simple machine far harder to understand than it needs to be. Also, the plastic tamper is rubbish – but frankly, at this price, you can afford to upgrade it.Type:manualDimensions:21x 34 x 29cm (WDH)Water tank:1lTime to heat up:1min 30secsTime to steam milk:1min 25secsGrinder included:noNoise:50dB (brew), 65dB (steam)Warranty:one-year repair or replaceBestfor temperature control on a budget:ProCook espresso machineView image in fullscreen£199 at ProCook£174.98 at eBayProCook’s machines combine familiar-looking design with the kind of features that usually command a far higher price. This is the entry-level model in the range, delivering adjustable PID temperature control and a solid all-round performance for the price.Why we love itIf you initially thought you were looking at a Sage machine, then join the club: the silver metal and curved plastics are terribly familiar.Flip the machine on, and the simple button layout and LCD screen make it easy to get brewing. You can set the brewing temperature between 90C and 96C in two-degree increments, and while the single and double shot buttons produce a standard volume, you can manually set it to your preference. The dedicated hot-water button is a boon, too – take note, Sage – although it rather awkwardly dispenses from the steam wand.Brewing quality and steaming performance are respectable for the cash. Heat-up time is less than 30 seconds thanks to the Thermoblock design, and the only disappointment is that, despite the promising-looking wand, steaming feels underpowered. All importantly, though, espresso quality is good for the money, and the adjustable temperature makes a big difference here, especially with the medium-light roast beans I had on the shelf.It’s a shame that …it’s not as solid-feeling as Sage’s Bambino models: the 58mm portafilter feels light and cheap, and the overall build feels more plasticky.You’ll have to buy your own stainless-steel milk jug for steaming milk, too, and there’s no water filter included or available to buy. If you’re in a hard-water area, you’ll want to use a good water filter jug.There was lots of dripping after pulling shots: the machine does eventually purge the excess water into the drip tray, but it takes its time. Only time will tell what the long-term reliability looks like.Type:manualDimensions:27 x 30 x 33cm (WDH)Water tank:2.2lTime to heat up:45secsTime to steam milk:1min 35secsGrinder included:noNoise:48dB (brew), 73dB (steam)Warranty:two-year replace or refundBestif you can afford it:Sage Dual BoilerView image in fullscreen£1,249.95 at Sage£1,299.95 at Assembly CoffeeIt may sound like an exceedingly strange thing to say about a coffee machine this expensive, but Sage’s Dual Boiler is very good value for money. Half the battle with espresso is consistency, and the Dual Boiler provides a firm bedrock for everyone from beginners to seasoned aficionados. It’s easy to use, highly adjustable and makes stunning coffee.Why we love itIt’s not as daunting to use as some enthusiast machines, which means that anyone in the house who’s eager to learn – not just the coffee obsessives – will get the benefit, and the simple LCD screen and push-button controls make it easy to tinker with.The dual stainless-steel boilers require a five-minute warm-up time – far longer than any of the other machines here – but once they’re up to temperature, they stay there. Even the portafilter is temperature controlled, and the steam wand is supremely powerful – though it takes a little getting used to.Dial in the grind, dosage, brewing temperature, pre-infusion and shot time, and you can tweak the results to perfection with confidence. Pour a bad shot and you know it’s entirely your fault, which makes it far easier to fix.The other details only add to the appeal. The hidden caster wheels that allow you to roll the machine forward to access the water tank; the little window that shows the remaining water level; the weighty-feeling portafilter, generous drip tray and the little compartment hidden behind so you can hide useful accessories.It’s a shame that …you need a truly great grinder to get anywhere close to the Dual Boiler’s capabilities. Don’t skimp – if you can’t afford another £300 or so, then split your budget more evenly between a sub-£1,000 machine and grinder.Also, the powerful boilers make themselves heard. Start pulling a shot and the machine begins to thrum excitedly – your flat- or housemates may be less so. Until they taste the coffee, that is.Type:manualDimensions:40 x 37 x 38 cm (WDH)Water tank:2.5lTime to heat up:5minsTime to steam milk:45secsGrinder included:noNoise:60dB (brew), 64dB (steam)Warranty:two-year repair, replace or refund at Sage’s discretionBestassisted espresso machine overall:Ninja Luxe Cafe Premier ES601View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller£499 at John Lewis£499.99 at ArgosWith most assisted machines costing closer to £1,000, this £550-ish machine breaks the mould. Ninja’s superb Barista Assist feature is the best of any machine here – and means that the Luxe Cafe is a viable, and better-tasting, alternative to a fully automatic bean-to-cup machine.Why we love itYou get a lot for the money. The patchwork of black plastics and brushed metal looks good and feels solid, and most of the parts feel hefty. I’m a big fan of the heavy, sprung tamper, which makes it easy and satisfying to get the coffee puck just so.The sheer number of drinks the Luxe Cafe can concoct is dizzying. The coffee staples include espresso, cold-press espresso, filter coffee and iced coffee, and the ingenious milk frother is more versatile than most, producing steamed milk, thin and thick froth and even cold frothed milk. The result? There are few coffee-based drinks it can’t prepare.Ninja’s Barista Assist technology is superb. It’s terrific at dialling in the grind, the dosage and the shot, and it does a better job of tweaking grind size to maintain a consistent brew from shot to shot than any machine here – and for each brewing method. It’s a godsend for users who just want great coffee, but obsessives can still tweak grind size and brew temperature to produce the perfect shot.It’s a shame that …the plastic dosing funnel is an obvious weak point, and given that you need to shove the portafilter under the grinder, we suspect it may be the first part to break. Only time will tell.Also, the controls are initially rather daunting. With multiple buttons scattered across the fascia, and a huge number of drink options, beginners will want to keep the simple step-by-step manual close to hand.Type:assistedDimensions:37x 33 x 37cm (WDH)Water tank:2lTime to heat up:35secsTime to steam milk:2mins 20secsGrinder included:yesNoise:48dB (brew), 58dB (steam), 63dB (grind)Warranty:two yearsBestassisted machine for beginners:Sage Bambino PlusView image in fullscreen£349 at John Lewis£349.95 at AmazonThe Bambino Plus remains a go-to recommendation.

There are pressurised and unpressurised baskets, so you can brew with freshly ground coffee or bags of pre-ground supermarket coffee, and you get single and double baskets for both types.The “razor” dosing tool means you don’t need to shell out on scales right away – it ensures you don’t overpack the portafilter – and the light plastic tamper is fine for starting out. The stainless-steel milk jug and cleaning accessories are a nice touch.The Bambino Plus’s PID temperature controller ensures that brewing temperatures are consistent. It’s not adjustable, but if you feed the machine with medium or dark roast beans and carefully optimise the grind size and dosage, you’ll be pouring consistently good espresso.With zero faff, espresso is very good indeed, but it’s the automatic milk texturing that’s really handy. It’s possible to get better results doing it manually, but being able to hit the button and walk off while the Bambino whips up a silken microfoam is a godsend on busy mornings, or when you’re feeling lazy.It’s a shame that …at this price, the Bambino Plus isn’t much cheaper than models with adjustable brew temperature, such as the Lelit Anna PL41TEM, that give you more versatility when it comes to light or dark roasts. It’s more user friendly, but it’s a question of priorities.Type:assistedDimensions:19 x 36 x 30cm (WDH)Water tank:1.9lTime to heat up:6secsTime to steam milk:56secsGrinder included:noNoise:46dB (brew), 59dB (steam)Warranty:two-year repair, replace or refund at Sage’s discretionBest high-end assisted espresso machine:Sage Oracle JetView image in fullscreen£1,699 at John Lewis£1,699.95 at SageImagine being able to put many of your local coffee shops to shame – and without having the faintest idea where to start. That’s the appeal of the Oracle Jet.Why we love itThe colour touchscreen provides a silky-smooth interface. Slick animations lead users through the preparation and brewing process, and you can pick from 14 preset drinks recipes, including espresso, cappuccino, flat white, iced espresso, cold espresso and cold-brew coffee. You can also add your own.The automatic dosing and tamping works well: just slot in the portafilter, nudge it to the right and the Oracle Jet will grind the perfect amount and tamp the puck beautifully with no faff. Double shots tended to be a little long, but they tasted great – there’s more depth of flavour than any of the cheaper assisted machines here.Sage’s Auto MilQ feature froths dairy, soy, almond and oat-based milks, and temperature is adjustable from 40C to 75C (in case you prefer burned milk). The froth is a bit too bubbly with semi-skimmed milk, but whole milk is wonderfully creamy.Once you gain confidence, there’s oodles of adjustability. The fine grind-size adjustment allows for tiny tweaks, and the brewing temperature adjusts in single degree increments from 86C to 96C.It’s a shame that …at this price, there’s room for improvement. The barista guidance doesn’t adapt as readily as the cheaper Ninja; I’m hoping firmware updates over the wifi connection will improve things. Given the potential of the machine, I often found myself fine-tuning manually – it’s nice to have the option, but arguably defeats the point somewhat.Type:assistedDimensions:38 x 37 x 43cm (WDH)Water tank:2.3lTime to heat up:6secsTime to steam milk:1min 12secsGrinder included:yesNoise:46dB (brew), 58dB (steam), 66dB (grind)Warranty:two-year repair, replace or refund at Sage’s discretionThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: golfcphoto/Getty ImagesSage Barista Touch ImpressView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sasha Muller£999.95 at Sage£999.99 at CurrysBest for:Sage’s excellent barista assistance at a slightly lower priceLet’s get one thing straight: is the Barista Touch Impress (RRP £1,199.95) twice as good as the £549 Ninja Luxe Cafe? No, it isn’t. Is it still good, though? Yes, very. And despite being another assisted model, it’s a very different type of machine.We love that the touchscreen is more welcoming than rows of buttons and little LED lights. Anyone can walk up to the machine, prod an icon and make some coffee (or a hot chocolate, or babycino). Once you’ve filled the 340g bean hopper and run through the initial setup process, there’s little in the way of faff.There’s nothing to get wrong: the grind is automatic, the lever tamps for you, and as long as you rerun the “intelligent” set-up process when you buy new beans, the espresso is great. Then simply shove the milk jug in place with your choice of dairy or plant-based milks, and the Impress whips it to a pleasing froth. If everyone in the house has their preferred recipe, then they can create their own drinks icon, too.It all feels elegant and slick; it’s more refined than the Ninja. It’s still not as simple or immediate as a brilliant automatic bean-to-cup machine, but the coffee is on a different planet – and all the difficult bits are done for you. The only danger? The hand-holding may embolden nervous baristas to upgrade to a fully manual machine and go it alone.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s still expensive, and now that it’s flanked by the more capable Oracle Jet and the dramatically cheaper Ninja Luxe Cafe, it’s tougher to recommend unequivocally. It’s a great assisted machine.Type:assisted;dimensions:36 x 34 x 42cm (WDH);water tank:2l;time to heat up:5mins;time to steam milk:1min 10secs;grinder included:yes;noise:50dB (brew), 57dB (steam), 69dB (grind);warranty:two-year repair, replace or refund at Sage’s discretionDe’Longhi La Specialista TouchView image in fullscreen£699.99 at De’Longhi£699.99 at John LewisBest for:touchscreen barista guidance for less than rival modelsThe La Specialista Touch sees De’Longhi attempt to blend the ease of use of its bean-to-cup machines with the brewing talents of its La Specialista manual espresso models. The result is a touchscreen-powered, assisted espresso experience for less money than other touchscreen-equipped rivals.The bright colour 3.5in touchscreen leads you through the process step by step. It asks for the roast type of your beans and adjusts the brewing temperature to suit – something other assisted machines don’t tend to automate. It also helps you balance the grind size, dosage and pour with a guided, hands-on approach.Looks and size are a major plus point: this is a nicely styled machine and it’s also relatively compact. Despite the small footprint, the 1.7-litre water tank, which can be topped up in place or unclipped from the rear, is a sensible size and the bean hopper on top has a 180g capacity and 15 grind settings.You also get unpressurised single and double baskets in the box, a nice stainless-steel milk jug and the steam wand has adjustable modes for different dairy or plant-based milks, alongside four temperature settings and five adjustable froth levels.It didn’t make the final cut because …the coffee it brews is good, but not mind-blowing. Milk frothing could be better, too: the automatic mode struggles to produce a genuinely fine microfoam. It’s a shame there isn’t a water filter included. It’s not available to buy, either, which could eventually spell trouble in hard-water areas.Crucially, though, the assisted brewing is below par. Unlike the Sage or Ninja machines, there’s no sensor to detect the correct amount of ground coffee, so you manually have to grind, check the tamp height, grind again, trim, tamp and repeat the process when you change beans. Frankly, it’s as much of a faff as doing it manually.Type:assisted;dimensions:32 x 37 x 40cm (WDH);water tank:1.7l;time to heat up:46secs;time to steam milk:1min 55secs;grinder included:yes;noise:46dB (brew), 70dB (steam), 72dB (grind);warranty:one-year repair or replaceGaggia Classic Evo ProView image in fullscreen£549 at Gaggia£549 at AmazonBest for:hands-on espresso enthusiasts and secondhand bargain huntersThe Gaggia Classic keeps on having things added to its name – Evo, Pro, E24 – but the changes are minor. While recent redesigns have chopped and changed the boiler design between polished aluminium, non-stick coated and brass, it’s otherwise unchanged and remains a firm favourite of upgrade-focused tinkerers.The simplicity of the Classic is its biggest asset: there are no LCD screens or LED-lit, button-clad fasciae. There are three big, clicky buttons. One is an on switch. One brews coffee. One toggles the steam. A big plastic dial at the side opens and closes the valve to the steam wand.You get the essential accessories in the box. The big, heavy 58mm portafilter isn’t beautifully cast, but it’s fine – the 58mm size means it’s easy to find bottomless upgraded alternatives and better-machined baskets – and you get single and double baskets in the box. The supplied plastic tamper fits well in the recycling bin.It didn’t make the final cut because …the Classic Evo Pro is a lovely machine, but to get the best from it you need to modify it straight away. Out of the box, the brew pressure is high, and this can make pulling consistently balanced shots tricky. It’s only a few quid for a new OPV (over-pressure valve) spring and about 10 minutes’ effort to modify it, but it’s a hassle many won’t want.Even with that done, the lack of a temperature controller can make consistent brewing a bit of a stab in the dark. Aftermarket PID upgrades – or turbo-charged mods such as the Gaggiuino – take the Classic into giantkiller territory, but those £200+ DIY projects aren’t for everyone.Type:manual;dimensions:23 x 24 x 38cm(WDH);water tank:2.1l;time to heat up:1min;time to steam milk:1min 24secs;grinder included:no;noise:54dB (brew), 72dB (steam);warranty:three-year repair or replaceWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreen‘The coffee you use, and the way it’s been roasted, presents different challenges.’Photograph: RyanJLane/Getty ImagesHow to make the best espresso at homeTruly great espresso isakin to alchemy. A high-pressure pump forces hot water through a small puck of finely ground coffee at precisely the rate required to draw out a perfect balance of the coffee’s sour, sweet and bitter flavours. Done correctly, the result is a tiny cup of gold-topped ebony.Every facet of the brew must be in equilibrium: the coffee should be fresh (look for a roast date, not a best before); the grind fine, but not too fine; the water hot, but not too hot; and the pressure high, but – you get the idea. If the espresso flows too fast, the sour flavours dominate. If it slows to a drip, the bitterness draws focus. Somewhere in between lies perfection: a staccato drip quickening to an elastic pour. To put it in numbers: you want 15-20g of ground coffee to produce two to three times that weight of espresso in about 20 to 30 seconds.The coffee you use, and the way it’s been roasted, presents different challenges. Beans come broadly in light, medium and dark roasts. The longer a bean is roasted, the softer and more porous it becomes, and this means two things – it becomes easier to dissolve its flavours in hot water, and it goes stale more quickly. The first of these issues is why it’s desirable for an espresso machine to have an adjustable brewing temperature: dark roast beans might only need to be brewed at 80C to 90C before bitterness overwhelms, whereas a more dense light or medium roast bean might need 90C to 96C to mollify the mouth-puckering sourness.If you’re intent on using something other than freshly roasted coffee, then you’ll need to think about baskets. These are the little metal containers that hold the coffee and slot in and out of the portafilter handle, and they come in two options: pressurised and unpressurised.Pressurised baskets are designed to compensate for coffee that is either not fresh enough or too coarsely ground – such as supermarket coffee – by forcing the coffee through a couple of tiny holes underneath. By contrast, unpressurised baskets have lots of pinprick holes all over, and these rely on fresh, finely ground coffee to provide enough resistance to build up a sufficient brew pressure. Using the right type of basket for the coffee you have is essential.What types of espresso machine are there?Broadly speaking, several types of coffee machines claim to brew espresso. There are capsule machines that provide a facile foil-wrapped approximation, fully automatic bean-to-cup boxes that concoct a half-decent espresso at the touch of a button, and then there are “proper” manual espresso machines of the kind you see in coffee shops. You know, the ones with fancy portafilter handles and big stainless-steel exteriors. It’s this latter sort, and their modern “assisted” derivatives, that are covered in this article, and – with no exceptions to the rule – it’s this type of machine that makes the best-tasting espresso.How to choose the right type of coffee machine for youRead moreWhere it gets a little confusing is that there are fully manual portafilter espresso machinesandassisted variations, all of which provide differing amounts of assistance. (To confuse things further, some manufacturers refer to manual espresso machines with integrated grinders as bean-to-cup espresso machines, which are not to be confused with the fully automatic bean-to-cup type, but I digress.)Some machines, such as the Sage Bambino Plus, provide a bare minimum of assistance and leave the grinding, tamping and brewing entirely to you (and you’ll need to buy your own grinder, too). Press a button, however, and they’ll automatically steam a jug of milk to a hot, creamy froth.Right at the other end of the scale, fully assisted machines, such as the Ninja Luxe Cafe or Sage Oracle Jet, are akin to an AI barista: they use integrated grinders and sensors to automatically grind the right amount of coffee into the portafilter, help you to tamp (in other words, squish) it down just so, and then time and measure the shot to ensure that you’re extracting the perfect espresso. Shove the milk jug in place, and they automatically froth the milk to a silky perfect microfoam. The fun barista role play is all yours, though: you get to manually lever the portafilter into place, thunk the spent coffee puck into the bin and attempt to daub latte art on top of your flat white.Sasha Muller is a freelance tech and consumer journalist, avid coffee drinker and craft beer enthusiast with more than two decades of experience in testing products and avoiding deadlines.

How did that go?Alexis Petridis, chief rock and pop criticOne day in the car I just listened to nothing instead of facing it again. When it plays me songs I like, it’s not what I want to hear at that moment. That’s not to say the music it was recommending wasn’t good. One morning it played Schizophrenia by Sonic Youth. I love that song but I didn’t want to hear it then. It played me Billie Holiday’s Riffin’ the Scotch followed by My Bloody Valentine, which clearly demonstratesthe great breadthof my music taste – but just because I like it all doesn’t mean I want to hear it all together. I didn’t like that it was untouched by human hands. I always think that the amazing thing about a record collection is that it doesn’t make sense to anybody other than you. And yet when it’s presented like that, I find it really jarring and difficult – it’s all over the place.LSThe algorithm is straining to find the data points that connect all those things, to close the net and make it coherent when it’s not.Mood Machine by Liz Pelly review – a savage indictment of SpotifyRead moreAPThe first one I tried had an AI DJ that kept saying “Ga-lax-ie 500”, which sounds like a laxative. I wonder how much of this is to do with my age and these things not having always been in my life, but I find it inherently creepy, both the AI voice and the narrow recommendations based on your own taste. I read enough science fiction in my teens to know that this is very much the thin edge of the wedge – one minute it’s all matey “would you like to listen to Galaxie 500?”, the next humanity’s enslaved, living underground mining uranium for a robot. There are generated playlists that are meant to be generically adjacent to the time of day you listen to it: “Wednesday Shoegaze.” Why? Then you have “70s rock hippie afternoon”, featuring a lot of music that isn’t from the 1970s. There’s I Am Waiting by the Rolling Stones, which is from 1965. Expecting to Fly by Buffalo Springfield is from 1967. Eight Miles High by the Byrds is from 1966. How do you generally use Spotify?LSI have mp3s of anything I care about. I pay for Spotify but I try to spend as much or more on Bandcamp or whatever every month, like carbon-offsetting. To some degree, you and I need to have Spotify, like a film critic needs Netflix. But also, artists don’t earn anything from me playing their mp3s; if I stream music I already own on Spotify, they’re at least getting fractions of a penny and the listener data they need to operate in that ecosystem. And I don’t have to listen to ads. How about you?APOrdinarily my listening isn’t centred on Spotify. I use YouTube more for work. I listen to a lot of physical records. Did you listen to a lot of different stuff as a result of not using Spotify for a week?LSSort of. I subscribe to a lot of music newsletters and inevitably open 20 Bandcamp links a week and shut 15 without listening to them, because there’s only so much time. But this week I went through most of them and really lovedan album by a Swedish composer called Hugo Randulv. I generally only use Spotify as a discovery tool to listen to albums I’ve never heard before that I’ve seen recommended elsewhere or to play old favourites out and about. The only time I cheated was when I ran out of fun music mid-run and put Doechii’s last mixtape on, but I bought it when I got home. I never use their playlists. I stopped checking my Discover Weekly because it often recommends things that would be logical for me to like, but I’ve already decided that I don’t. But that doesn’t compute with their algorithmic concept that one of these things is just like the other.APThat’s the thing – however good the algorithm is, there’s something about human taste that it can’t quite replicate. Let’s look at my “made for you”. I never usually browse this. Here’s my “reggae mix” … featuring folk legends Shirley and Dolly Collins.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus of Boygenius, pictured with Taylor Swift pictured at the 2024 Grammy awards.Photograph: David Swanson/ReutersLSWow. With playlists like “70s hippie afternoon”, it’s like their made-up Spotify Wrapped “genres”, where they’re named a) to mimic the language of memes, and b) as a reduction of music down to “vibes”, stripping away historical context. This might be getting a bit Adbusters, but I think the temporal playlists are also about syncing with consumer habits. Your “get ready with me” playlist, a “main character energy” walk to Starbucks. And the “coffee shop” vibe is so prevailing, it’s ended up dictating the types of music that get signed: you get more pop-ready, front-facing songwriters such as Phoebe Bridgers and Julien Baker on indie labels – they’re obviously great but they’re also products that work well in that ecosystem.APThe guy from the label Secretly Group says in the book that they couldn’t sign the experimental band Oneida now. It’s a really good example of how the competition markers of pop have been brought to bear on all types of music because of Spotify. It’s forcing everybody into competition with Ed Sheeran and Sabrina Carpenter, and that’s not always your motivation for starting a band or making music. It helps you get on in that world if you look like Sam Fender.LSIt can get even more granular. A lot of what I listen to on there is drone, the sound of one organ key being held down for half an hour. But Spotify’s idea of ambient is closer to what they call“perfect fit content” (PFC), as Liz Pelly found outin her book Mood Machine, where they commission muzak-style farms to produce chilled-out music to fit lean-back, mood-based playlists and allegedly pay a lower royalty rate than they do to traditional record labels. Filling playlists with that counts out the artists really invested in those sounds and disciplines who might otherwise stand a chance of making a living from them – there are examples of those playlists being overhauled and musicians losing out on money they had been earning. You found that several jazz playlists seemed to have next to no “real” artists on them.APThe jazz thing is the ultimate extension of that. On one level, yes, Spotify is giving work to the jazz musicians who produce PFC, and it’s hard to get work as a jazz musician. On the other hand, look at Ezra Collective. They’re playing Wembley. This is what can happen when listeners are exposed to something exciting and underground. A jazz playlist full of music apparently commissioned for the purpose is actively stopping listeners from being exposed to that sort of thing. Do you ever discover things from Spotify?LSDefinitely. I try not to let autoplay run after an album ends, but it has led me to good stuff. Sometimes its persistence has made me change my mind about something. I didn’t get Astrid Sonne at first, but I listened to so much Clarissa Connelly – they went to the same experimental Danish music school – that it kept feeding me her, and it clicked. Thinking of massive tech companies, with, say, Amazon, I think most people are aware of the moral conflict in using it – the conditions that packers and delivery drivers work in. Do you think there’s that same sense of compunction about what Spotify is doing to artists?APNo. I think there’s a vague sense that you don’t get paid very well, but the really big stars – the most visible artists – are doing all right.Kate Nash is doing OnlyFansto make money and it’s come tosomethingif you’ve got to do that to keep your career afloat. But in the broader scheme of things, most people see Sabrina Carpenter or the Weeknd and they’re doing really well. So I think there’s a disconnect in people’s minds about this notion that artists aren’t being correctly remunerated by Spotify.LSIt infuriates me that they’ve alsodemonetised any songs with fewer than 1,000 plays.Pay to get playlisted? The accusations against Spotify’s Discovery ModeRead moreAPAnohni makes a very good point in the book that a record can be really impactful but you only have to listen to it twice. There’s loads of music I like, such as extreme electronics, that I’m not going to listen to over and over again.LSI thought the only naive part of the book was the ending, which looks at potential alternatives to streaming. Pelly highlights public libraries in the US that have streaming platforms for local musicians. It’s a lovely idea but with the best will in the world it’s not the same thing. I think we’ve seen a lot of larger-scale alternatives collapse.APRight – who’s still talking about Tidal? It seemed to me to be completely unworkable, though I appreciate her trying to put a positive spin on it – “there is another way” – but I don’t think there is.LSI think the most likely outcome is that Spotify will move on from music to a different product, and other solutions will have to be found. It’s one reason I’ve never got rid of my mp3s, because this could all disappear too.Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist by Liz Pelly is published by Hodder & Stoughton (£22).

This was the early 1990s, and they were joined at the hip on the sofa, laughing at the idea of two portly plumbers becoming gigantic after consuming copious amounts of magic mushrooms.View image in fullscreen‘An ordinary human being rather than the tragic myth he became’ … family photo of Thomas Hobbs with his father, Jonathan.Photograph: Thomas HobbsIn this moment I sensed their natural chemistry, while the intoxicating mix of 8-bit visuals and perky, synth-heavy music blew my toddler mind. Although it was irritating seeing them constantly fail to jump high enough to hit the top of the flagpole at the end of the level, I remember being transfixed by the TV screen, and I’m pretty sure this was the first time I connected properly with a video game.I was only four years old when my dad died. It happened suddenly, a heart attack when he was just 37, and I witnessed it on a bike ride ... It left my family for ever broken. But the formative image of dad at his most carefree and in love, clutching a rectangular controller hooked up to a grey slab of Japanese joy, remained. It was something I could utilise whenever my grief became too much. Most importantly, the memory allowed me to visualise my dad as an ordinary human being rather than the tragic myth he later became.Ours was a working-class household with limited space, so eventually the NES disappeared: no one could work out whether it was gathering dust in an old plastic bag in a relative’s loft, or if it had been accidentally thrown out. So I was shocked recently when my mum unexpectedly handed me the console after finding it during a spring clean. She asked me if I could try to fix it, so that we could keep it in the family.It had no leads, games, or controllers. It was also filthy with sticky clumps of dirt, particularly around the AV slots, and judging by the rust collecting at the cartridge slot, had serious water damage. After giving it a deep clean, hoovering all the damp dust out of the inside and buying a pricey device that converted the games into HD, I switched it on. Somehow, it still worked. Clearly, like most consumer devices produced in the 1980s, the NES had been built to withstand a nuclear winter should the cold war heat up.View image in fullscreenA retro ‘Nintendo Family Computer’, sold in Japan as a forerunner to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesThe last few weeks of rebuying games and getting lost in their fuzzy charms have been genuinely restorative for my mental health; a chance to reconnect with my roots. It took me about 15 minutes to figure out how to make a jump on the Fortress level of World 1 in Super Mario Bros 3, with spikes descending from the ceiling just as my squirrel suit was on the verge of flying to the other side. But by working out I simply had to be patient and duck inside a small space to avoid looming peril, rather than blindly rushing forward, I knew I was experiencing the same glorious lightbulb moment my dad would have enjoyed.I’ve been particularly obsessed with Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!! Despite the clunky 2D crowd and square-ish dimensions, there’s a genuine dynamism to the boxer’s movement and a feeling that David can defeat Goliath simply by bobbing and weaving and flipping the momentum with a well-aimed jab to the chin. While later boxing games might have been dripping with life-like bodily fluids, I have yet to find one that better replicates the magic of a boxer tasting blood and moving in for the kill than this 1987 NES game.Double Dragon has also been a revelation. This co-op fighting game gives you a big open space to navigate and – despite the graphical limitations – makes you feel like Bruce Lee: surrounded by foes, but with enough battlefield intelligence to use the environment to your advantage and kick knife-wielding enemies into the dust. With race-against-the-clock tension, one early sequence where you fight a couple of heavies on a moving conveyor belt made me feel like I was in a John Woo action movie.In these games the lack of a save mode forces you to continuously invest in improving, so the next time you hit the dreaded “Game Over” screen you’re more confident of avoiding the same mistakes. This grift is strangely addictive, and it’s easy to picture my dad taking a quick break after putting baby me to sleep, his mind on the allure of the hard-won achievements at the core of this more patient era of Nintendo gaming.View image in fullscreenGenuine dynamism … Mike Tyson’s Punch Out!!Photograph: NintendoKnowing he would have once had the same smile on his face while playing the NES has made him more tangible in my mind; it’s allowed me to see through his eyes. And, as my two-year-old son experiences his own dad going crazy over firing Flower Power-ups or defeating Dracula Duck during the final boss battle of the family melodrama that is DuckTales, I feel like I’m keeping my father’s energy alive.Retro gaming is very much on the rise in the UK and US, with many players rediscovering the delights of analogue-era consoles. Playing these old cartridges on the original machines provides a deeper appreciation of the evolution of gaming and it’s an escape from a world that feels far less carefree than the time in which these machines were thriving. Perhaps they also hope to re-ignite the memories of those who’ve passed, to remain connected to the loved ones who once invested their time into these devices.Rather than letting that old console become a house for spiders in your loft, dust it off, get playing. It might just help you to grieve, or relive a special memory that otherwise could easily have been lost. When I hear the opening chords of the Super Mario Bros theme song, I’m instantly back on that sofa with my mum and dad, smiling, assured that everything is going to be OK.We have opened comments for readers to share their own stories of a console that reminds them of a lost friend or relative.Explore more on these topicsGamesSuper MariofeaturesShareReuse this content"

There has always been common wariness of Beijing as a commercial rival and potential security threat. But for hawks in Washington the idea of an alternative superpower closing in on economic and technological parity feels existential. More dovish Europeans have been readier to leaven caution with engagement.Britain has veered between the two poles. In 2015, David Cameron promised a “golden era” of open trade with China. In 2020, under pressure from the US, Boris Johnson banned Huawei, a Chinese telecoms company, from UK 5G infrastructure.In opposition, Conservatives have become increasingly hawkish against Beijing. Keir Starmer’s Labour government has tilted back towards cooperation. Several ministers have visited China, including the chancellor. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, will go therelater this year, reviving a trade commission that has been dormant since 2018. Mr Reynolds was manifestly frustrated with the Chinese owners of British Steel during the dash to keep Scunthorpe’s blast furnaces operating last week, but the government has retreated from intimations of deliberate sabotage.At some point, pursuit of economic growth and investment comes into conflict with a national security interest in keeping China at arm’s length. The question iswhere to draw the line. The official answer is that judgment is deferred pending a Whitehall “audit” of relations with Beijing. That is due in June.A decision is also imminent on China’s status under theforeign influence registration scheme– a system for keeping tabs on international organisations and companies exercising political influence in Britain. China is not expected to be named in the “enhanced tier” of risky states, alongside Russia and Iran, but some Chinese institutions might have that designation.Calibrating these judgments – choosing when to prioritise security over commerce – is much harder withDonald Trumpin the White House. What used to be a difference of emphasis between the US and Europe looks like an irreparable fracture in the west.Mr Trump has started a ferocious trade war with Beijing without a convincing strategic rationale. Officials from his administration are telling Europeans they will have to choose a side when it comes to vital communications technology. But the US president is also routinely aggressive in his rhetoric towards the EU, dismissive of Nato and reliably emollienttowards Vladimir Putin’s Russia.From that pattern it is clear in Brussels and other continental capitals that Washington is nolonger a reliable allyand the trajectory must be “strategic autonomy” for Europe. Inevitably, that is changing the calculus of risk and potential benefit from a more pragmatic China policy. The authoritarian character of Xi Jinping’s regime hasn’t changed, but it presents itself as a more predictable force in international affairs while US democracy declines in violent spasms.These changes illuminate a crisis of international orientation for Britain that has been building sinceBrexit. Economic detachment from Europe was premised on a model of the UK as a lone sovereign agent in an open, free-trading globalised world. That was an outdated concept at the time. It has aged very poorly. Britain is not alone in struggling to navigate relations with China in the turbulent new geopolitical climate, but choosing loneliness in a world of rival continental blocs is making the struggle much harder.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s a puzzler, because if she wants to praise Donald Trump and Elon Musk,peddle dark conspiracy theoriesand give the fullest possible account of her grandiose self-belief, she’d be in great company on X. But that wouldn’t be thinking big enough – she wants to create an entirely new network, “uncensored and uncancellable”, which will grow a grassroots movement of Trussites.So often, Truss appears as a pioneer, whether that’s of free-market fundamentalism so radical as to give all markets a nervous breakdown, or of free-speech fundamentalism so trenchant that it needs its own domain. But she’s actually not the first Tory to try this. Matt Hancock launched his own app in 2018, when he was the culture secretary. His intention was completely opaque –he described itas “a chance for you to tell me what you think, and to engage with others on issues that matter to you”. You can lose hours wondering how he arrived at the conclusion that anyone wanted to tell him what they thought, before you get to the hard stop: if you wanted to engage with others who shared your views, and could find no space in the modern media landscape to do that, who would you choose as your conduit? Would it be Hancock, or would it be literally anybody else? What even were his views?When the app closed five years later, it had reportedly been downloaded 5,000 times on Google Play,with an average user rating of 2.7. It is impossible to guess, I’m afraid, what those users were looking for, and how they came to be so disappointed. No, wait, I can guess. There were 4,999 journalists, looking for something juicy and coming away empty, plus Hancock’s mum.The stranger experiment was Louise Mensch’s in 2012, when she launched Menshn, describing it as “Twitter for topics”. Menschfell out with her co-founderand closed the site before anyone figured out what that meant. She had a lot in common with Truss, in fact – a quality of self-aggrandisement, a love of publicity – but what they didn’t share was context.Back then, “freedom of speech” was already a dog-whistle for “why isn’t a decent person like me allowed to say offensive things?”, but there was noconcerted attempt by the USto get Britain to repeal our laws on hate speech. And this was partly because there was no threat of tariffs and therefore nothing to leverage, but mainly because Barack Obama wasn’t trying to create an authoritarian state by radically circumventing allowable opinion, then accusing opponents of doing exactly that.JD Vance, by contrast, finds any state measure to limit bile – particularly, at the moment, when directed at LGBTQ+ groups – to be a threat to freedom, and by extension, to western civilisation. He can square this with the fact that it’s now possible in the US to be arrested forattending a pro-Gaza protest. Truss’s project has a similar upside-down-world quality; in her telling, the noisiest of the rightwing are those living in perpetual fear of cancellation, and all legislative measures designed to preserve civility are actually acts of control and hostility to free citizens.The similarity between her case and that of the Trumpians might not even register – you can easily imagine that administration having forgotten she was ever prime minister, and never clocking her fearless unilateral attempts to take the brakes off our hate speech legislation by creating the space to say hateful things. Nevertheless, you can see her taking heart from the company.Furthermore, the “freedom of speech” debate has changed shape over the past decade: pre-Brexit, it was mainly a shortcut to negative attention. Going back to Michael Howard’s “Are you thinking what we’re thinking?” 2005election slogan, if you flagged that you might be prepared to say something bigoted, that was catnip to a bored media. Post-Brexit, “freedom of speech” became a code for announcing which side you were on. If you wanted to talk about the customs union and the leaky Irish border, you were most likely a remainer. If you wanted to talk about freedom of speech, you were most likely a Brexiter.Now its use has changed again: everyone knows it has nothing to do with censorship. Everyone knows that the same people who will fight to the death for their right to attack transgender kids are happy to ban books and close down political demonstrations. Everyone knows that “cancelled” means “except for the newspaper column and the show on GB News”. The use of the term is a straight bid to overwrite observable reality, until none of us know which way is up.Does this make Truss’s enterprise more of a threat, since she’s singing from a global hymn sheet with a lot of reach and power? Or less of a threat, since she’s such an insignificant figure among people much louder and better resourced? It’s hard to tell at this distance, particularly since we don’t know how much cash is behind her, or who’s supplying it. But I feel sure this problem would go away if someone would just do the decent thing and give her a column in the Daily Mail.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLiz TrussOpinionTrump administrationSocial mediaConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

Instead, Adolescence is a four-episode limited series about a 13-year-old British boy accused of stabbing his female classmate to death. And as the story unfolds, the pernicious influence of cyberbullying and social media radicalization on the main character comes into focus.The show has sparked conversations about the much-discussed male loneliness epidemic and the pervasive influence of hypermasculine online personalities. It has set off public debate fromIndiatoAustraliato theUnited Statesabout how we raise boys in an era when social media increasingly serves as an endless trough of misogynist messaging. In the UK, where the series became the firststreaming showto top the country’s TV ratings, it has stirred intense conversations on news panels and in parliament. Even the prime ministerjumped into the frayafter watching the show with his teenage children.But whileAdolescencehas become a lightning rod for these debates, the show itself takes a nuanced approach to topical themes of male isolation, vulnerability and violence. Adolescence never lectures its audience, and it is not prescriptive; instead, it leaves viewers with more questions than answers. And the popularity of the show could help foster meaningful conversations about a healthier approach to media consumption and participation for all.Adolescence’s protagonist, Jamie, is far from alone in his loneliness. In the last few years, writing about the post-Covid escalation in isolation has become something of a cottage industry. From Jonathan Haidt’sThe Anxious Generationto Jean Twenge’sGenerations, youthful despair is the issue that has launched a thousand podcast appearances. Despite this abundance of coverage, the problem persists that young people remain lonely: in the UK, 16- to 29-year-olds arethe loneliest age group, and in the US, 40% of teensreport feeling chronically hopeless. Youth suicide rates haveincreased by almost two-thirdssince 2007.More than half of US teens have come to spendalmost five hourson social media every day, on platforms that can not only exacerbate loneliness, but encourage antisocial behavior. The two most popular platforms among 13- to 17-year-oldsare YouTube and TikTok, both of whichuse algorithmsthat are aspowerful as they are dangerous. YouTube, for example,recommends right-leaning videoseven to viewers who haven’t interacted with that type of content. The Department of Homeland Security has also reported that TikTokpromotes extremist discourse, including “tactical guidance” from the January 6 insurrectionists.The results have been tragic. Last July, a 26-year-old man in Englandmurdered his ex-girlfriend, Louise Hunt, along with her sister Hannah, and her mother, Carol. Prosecutors later revealed that he hadbinge-watched videos of Andrew Tate, a kickboxerfacing rape allegations in the UKand a criminal investigation in Romania over alleged human trafficking. Crimes like this one bring Adolescence disturbingly close to the threshold of documentary.But what is too easily missed is that it’s not only young men being manipulated and radicalized online. More than a decade ago, a 12-year-old girlstabbed her friendin tribute to a fictional online character called Slender Man. While girlsare far less likely to commit acts of violenceagainst others, they are more likely to adopt self-harming behaviors such asself-injury,eating disordersandsuicide attempts, all of whichare inflamed by YouTube algorithms.Now, Adolescence’s creator is offering a well-intentioned solution:banning access to social mediafor teenagers. Australia has alreadypassed such an embargofor anyone under 16, and though it won’t take effect until later this year, it still exemplifies the idea’s unfeasibility. The law will enforce restrictions through age-verification technology, which the platforms will have to implement themselves, a bit like asking Al Capone to enforce temperance.Even if they do, patronizing young people by telling them they can’t be trusted with a technology they’ve been using their whole lives is unlikely to work. Those who want to keep using social media will find a way to do so. VPNs can easily circumvent regional barriers,as Russians discoveredwhen Vladimir Putin banned Facebook and Instagram in 2022. And websites like YouTube don’t require an account to view videos,granting theman almost uncloseable loophole.That’s why this crisis seems better addressed through pragmatism than prohibitionism. After all, teenagers themselves recognize the harm that social media can pose – perhaps better than anyone – and94% of them saythey want their schools to offer instruction in media literacy. The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, intends to kickstart that education byscreening Adolescence in secondary schoolsnationwide. But in the US, our official head of stateowns a multibillion-dollar social media company– as does ourunofficial head of state– so a similar move seems unlikely.Then again, if there is going to be a cultural shift toward mitigating the risks of social media, it will probably not come from senators hectoring parents and their children about screen time. Instead, it will take more delicate, patient, thoughtful conversations like the kind organically taking place in response to Adolescence. And in the classroom, there may not be a one-size-fits-all approach, butMedia Literacy Now’s database of more than 130 lesson plans – on everything fromdigital citizenshiptodetoxing your feed– could be a good start. (And to be clear: adults would benefit just as much, if not more, from brushing up on these topics.)Adolescence has resonated so deeply with so many by presenting a complex, human story that defies simple answers. In that spirit, it seems unlikely that anything would be solved by trying to get young people to quit algorithms cold turkey. But perhaps with enough empathy, respect and humility, we could all help each other scroll responsibly.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineat 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

And that last year, families with children experienced thelargestsingle-year increase in homelessness, with nearly 40% more people in families with children experiencing homelessness?And what if I told you that Donald Trump’s agenda – expressed through hismore than 100harmful executive actions, Elon Musk’s Doge cuts, and his budget making its way through his Republican-majority Congress – will make things even worse for women and children?I’m a pediatrician in Texas. Things are dire and we need your support – not your condescension | Seema JilaniRead moreI bet you’ll be pretty angry. Smith is.“Is Congress working on any of this?” she asks about the struggles of working families. “Unfortunately, no.” Asshe wrote in a recent op-ed: “they’re doing the opposite right now.In fact, theGOP budget proposalcould slash$880bn from Medicaidand$230bn from food assistance. They’re also cutting government agencies that assist with affordable housing, transportation, safety, veterans, and children with disabilities.”The final amounts of those cuts will vary, but the numbers stand to be huge and devastating. Why? Because the GOP is looking for at least$4.5tnin more tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest Americans. “They are reaching into my very shallow pockets, into my daughter’s life-saving medical care to pay for it,” Smith says.A newpaperI co-authored for Repairers of the Breach and the Institute for Policy Studies tries to reckon with what these costs would mean for working Americans. For women and children, we found that some of the harshest blows will come in healthcare access and in help putting food on the table.Nearly one in five women and almost half of all childrenrely on Medicaid or itsChildren’s Health Insurance Programfor healthcare. The House Republican budget resolution calls for potentialcutsof hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid – as much as $880bn by 2034, as Smith points out.And a shocking9 million people, disproportionately women and children, could loseallfood assistance under the proposed supplemental nutrition assistance (Snap) cuts. Children could also miss out on food at school, since the Republican House budget proposal also calls for a$12bn cutto public schools’ free and reduced meals programs. This would eliminate 24,000 schools – serving12 million students– from the program.Beyond food and healthcare, these cuts and proposals would also harm women and children in countless other ways.Nationally, women are already paid18% less than men, which contributes to their higher likelihood of poverty. But now, nearly 3 million pregnant workers are at risk of losing their jobsamid doubtsthat Trump will properly enforce thePregnant Workers Fairness Act, which provides worker protections for pregnant women.That’s especially egregious when you consider that22 millionwomen and girls of reproductive age live in states where their reproductive rights have been either eliminated or significantly eroded since justices appointed by Trump helped overturn Roe v Wade.Trump’s budget cuts could also lead to40,000 childrenlosing their childcare – and affect2.4 million children’s accessto childcare and early childhood education. That could have negative effects that follow those kids around the rest of their lives, in addition to imposing greater hardships on their parents.Other cuts targetfundingfor the National Institutes of Health (NIH) research on health disparities, including Black maternal and fetal health, as well as$11.4bnin state and community health department grants. And of course all this comes alongside Trump’santi-DEI executive actions, which target anti-discrimination protections for transgender children and transgender women.One of the few winners in this budget is the mass deportation system, which is poised to see significant increases. Yet the immigration raids and deportations this will fund will separate families – including up to 4.4 millionUS citizen children with an undocumented parent and another 850,000 undocumented minors.None of this is popular. By large majorities, Americans across the political spectrumoppose cuts to Medicaid,Snapand other safety net programs, as well asdeportations that separate families and target Dreamerswho came here as young children. It’s no wonder that countless women and children were among the millions who turned out for 5 April’s “Hands Off” rallies.I agree with Jocelyn Smith, who asks: “I don’t think this is fair. Do you?”Karen Dolan is a federal safety net expert and a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies.Explore more on these topicsUS healthcareOpinionTrump administrationRepublicansUS politicsHouse of RepresentativescommentShareReuse this content"

How long before he changes his mind?Wed 16 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 18.48 EDTShareSam Harris is the kind of guestJoe Roganloves to have on his podcast: he dresses awkwardly in a sport coat with jeans;he undertook a PhD in neuroscience after a transformative experience with MDMA; his tone is accessible yet patronising; he has a sense of academic authority which belies a set of controversial views that include calling Islam “uniquely uncivil” and almost unfettered support for Israeli attacks on Gaza; he made an app called Waking Up, which promises to be “a new operating system for your mind”. Rogan has hosted Harris on his podcast many times and the pair call each other good friends.But even Harris seems perturbed by Rogan’s more wholehearted embrace of Musk and Maga. “He’s in over his head on so many topics of great consequence,” Harris told his listeners of his own podcast last week. “He’ll bring someone in to shoot the shit on ‘how the Holocaust is not what you think it was’ or ‘maybe Churchill was the bad guy in world war two’ … or he’ll talk to someone like Trump or Tucker Carlson, who lie as freely as they breathe, and doesn’t push back against any of their lies … It is irresponsible, and it’s directly harmful.”Joe Rogan’s podcast success has in large part been about building a community of regular guests from the worlds of comedy, wrestling, psychedelics and non-fiction publishing, a kind of Rogansphere that has begun to feel like a subculture. He hosts his favourite guests time after time, with many of them building entire careers off their appearances on the show.But recently, various members of the Rogansphere have started to turn against their leader. They can’t understand how the host of the most popular podcast in the world seems to have gone from examining both sides to defendingElon Muskat every turn and providing a platform for second world war revisionists.View image in fullscreenSam Harris debates Jordan Peterson in London in 2021.Photograph: Jeff Gilbert/AlamyIn the past few months, Rogan has called people who thoughtElon Musk’s hand gesturewas a Nazi salute “dumb”, “crazy”, “illogical and weird” and defended it by saying it’s how Americans used to give the pledge of allegiance in the 1940s. Weeks later, he gave a very sympathetic interview to the podcaster Darryl Cooper, who has previously called Winston Churchill the main villain of the second world war and tweeted an image of Nazis in Paris, saying it was“infinitely preferable” to the drag “Last Supper” scene at the 2024 Paris Olympics opening ceremony.Rogan wasn’t always like this. Over the past decade he has built his podcast into by far the most successful in the world, weathering numerous controversies. He spent much of his career being mislabelled as ideologically rightwing or misogynistic when in fact he’s more of a simpleton who agrees with almost everyone who comes on his show, even when the things they’re saying are contradictory. He has been a staunch believer “in just asking questions” but not so much in listening to or processing the answers. He has supported both Bernie Sanders and RFK Jr, and has taken conflicting views on everything from trans rights to Ye,sometimes hilariously so.The best thing you could say about Rogan is that he is distrustful of all mainstream narratives, in an indiscriminate way. That’s led to him promoting a number of conspiracy theories that fly in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence about vaccines and the climate crisis, but also vocally criticising the war in Gaza and the influence of lobbyists in Washington DC.But his outlook has shifted since Trump was elected for the second time, a victory many credit to a good performance on Rogan’s podcast andRogan’s subsequent endorsement. On Saturday night at a UFC fight, Rogan ran into Trump, warmly embraced him and said: “I’m so happy for you sir.” Many of his biggest fans, those that discuss episodes in detail on Reddit and Discord, are complaining that he has become a shill for the elites he used to claim to distrust.Rogan has tended to brush off these critiques in the past, saying he’s just an interested comedian asking questions. But even Rogan’s comedy friends have started to bristle at his unwavering support for Musk. Rogan values comedy above all else, investing much of the riches from his podcast in the Austin comedy scene, buying up clubs and appearing regularly as a panellist on Kill Tony, the open-mic standup podcast that takes shots at perceived wokeism. Rogan has a regular cast of comedians on his podcast including Shane Gillis, Kyle Dunnigan and Tim Dillon. These comedians give Rogan his street credibility, and he in turn has given them a huge platform.While they haven’t turned on Rogan yet, they are incredibly disparaging about Musk. Dillon called Musk’s White House press conference “the grossest and cringiest shit anyone has seen for a long time … I disagree with close friends of mine who think Elon Musk is the new Jesus.” Gillis laughed about Musk’s salute on his podcast, and said he thought Musk was “psychotic” and “fucking weird” for lying about how good he is at video games.Rogan meanwhile has recently called Musk “a super genius that’s been fucked with” and “one of the smartest people alive”.This emerging divide between Rogan and his comedic milieu came to a head last month at the recording of Kill Tony’s first special for Netflix (filmed at Rogan’s Comedy Mothership club in Austin). Both Dunnigan and Rogan were on the panel together but Dunnigan was in character, hilariously, as Musk. It was a brilliant and vicious send-up of Musk’s bizarre humour and minimal intelligence that had everyone laughing except Rogan, who avoided making eye contact or saying almost anything for the entire episode. It seemed as though he didn’t want to give any impression to Musk that he was was mocking him.There are no simple ideological lines being drawn between Rogan and the guests that are turning on him. Douglas Murray, for example, is an incredibly conservative pro-Israel historian who supports the withdrawal of visas from students who demonstrated on college campuses last year andhas saidhe wants to ban “all immigration into Europe from Muslim countries”. In many ways he is to the right of Rogan, and spent much of his appearance on the podcast losing a debate with his fellow guest Dave Smith over Gaza. Yet he also used his time to admonish Rogan for having too many amateur and conspiracy theory-minded historians on the podcast. “I feel you’ve opened the door to quite a lot of people. You’ve now got a big platform and have been throwing out counter-historical stuff but a very dangerous kind.”Rogan had very little in the way of a meaningful defence. Defending why he had the conspiracy theorist andPizzagate proponentIan Carroll on his program, Rogan replied: “I just think I’d like to talk to this person … I brought him on because I want to find out, like, how does one get involved in the whole conspiracy theory business? Because his whole thing is just conspiracies.”There are no smart guys here; both Murray and Rogan have tendency to use circuitous straw man arguments that suit their specific brand of politics. But it does show cracks in the cultural wing of Trumpism.Rogan himself seems to be backing down from a full-throated endorsement of the president’s policies, calling the Venezuelan deportations “horrific” and “bad for the cause”, and calling Trump’s feud with Canada over tariffs “stupid”. Last month he said healthcare should “100% should be socially funded” and wascelebrated by Bernie Sanders for doing so.Yet these acknowledgements of bad policies haven’t translated into a lack of enthusiasm for either Trump or Musk, yet. But with Rogan it only takes one convincing guest to change his mind.What’s more, Rogan’s main constituency of listeners, young men,appear to be feeling buyer’s remorse about Trump, with new polling suggesting the group is swinging away from the president. Where his audience go, Rogan tends to follow.On his podcast, Harris told his listeners: “Our society is as politically shattered as it is in part because of how Joe [Rogan] has interacted with information.” Rogan might revel in criticism from progressives, but barbs from his friends are likely to sting. How long Trump can count on Rogan’s cuddles and warm wishes might depend on whether his favourite guests begin to ostracize him.Explore more on these topicsJoe RoganOpinionUS politicsFar right (US)Donald TrumpElon MuskBernie SandersTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

But they’re part of an American traditionSteven HahnSince colonial times, self-designated ‘communities’ have used expulsions to address supposed threats. It helps to explain how easy it has been for Trump to win supportWed 16 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 11.49 EDTShareThe recent expulsion ofKilmar Armando Ábrego García, a protected legal resident who had committed no offense, is only the latest example of the Trump administration’s unbounded efforts to detain and rapidly expel any immigrant, undocumented or not, who may come into its grasp.Although expulsions – often known as deportations – of undocumented men, women and children have been regular features of life under Democratic as well as Republican presidents in recent years, those of the new administration have been jaw-dropping in their cruelty and utter defiance of federal law and judicial due process, in their heralded scale and in the lust with which they have been carried out. And we would be mistaken to believe that immigrants will be the only victims of what is in effect a widening campaign of political expulsion. After all, Trump has just requested asixfold increase in fundingfor detention facilities.Unprecedented as they may appear, the expulsive policies that Trump and his supporters relish, in truth, have a very long and worrisome history in this country. Indeed, they have been integral to political and cultural life since the colonizing settlement of the early 17th century, almost always expressing the will of a self-designated “community” against those accused of threatening its security and integrity. Puritans had barely established the colony of Massachusetts Bay before they expelled Anne Hutchinson and Roger Williams for challenging their religious doctrine and civil authority. Others, of less notoriety, would follow them, not to mention the many women who suffered lethal expulsions owing to witchcraft accusations before the century was out.The enlightened republicanism of the 18th century offered little respite and, in some cases, further provocations. Thomas Jefferson expressed the belief that slavery could not be abolished unless the freed Black population, whom he regarded as inferior to the white,was expelledto some foreign territory. His perspective, soon sanitized as “colonization”, would be embraced by most white people in the antislavery movement, including Abraham Lincoln, until well into the civil war. During the revolutionary and constitutional periods, those holding objectionable political views could be treated to tar-and-featherings, ridings on the rail and other well-known rituals of humiliation and expulsion.Over time, expulsions became more common and widespread, almost routine methods of resolving problemsThe early republic and Jacksonian eras, when political democracy appeared to be on the march, were in fact awash with violence-laden expulsions. The targets included Catholics (long associated with “popery”), Mormons (not seen as Christian), abolitionists (accused of promoting miscegenation) and Masons (reviled for their political secrecy) as well as Native peoples who were subjected to the largest mass expulsion in all of our history, forcibly driven out of their homelands east of the Mississippi River to “Indian” territory in the west. Both Alexis de Tocqueville and Abraham Lincoln feared at the time that the tyranny of public opinion and the rule of the mob, found north and south, were eating at the vitals of the young United States, and threatened to turn the country into a despotism.Yet, over time, expulsions became more common and widespread, almost routine methods of resolving problems as communities – however large or small – saw them. For African Americans, expulsions came in the form of segregation, political disfranchisement, red-lining, the destruction of their settlements (thinkGreenwood, Oklahoma, andRosewood, Florida), and the brutal treatment of those who attempted to find housing in white neighborhoods. For unwanted and politically radical immigrants, expulsions came in the form of deportations, vigilante violence and federal repression. And for the poor, expulsions have long come in the form of turning-outs, confinements to workhouses, the denial of political rights and housing, and arrests for vagrancy. At all events, expulsions depended on paramilitary enforcement, whether by armed patrols, the Ku Klux Klan, the American Legion, citizens’ associations or neighborhood watches.Mass incarceration is but the awful culmination of an expulsionism that has been at the heart of criminal punishment since the advent of the penitentiary in the early 19th century. Enlightenment-inspired social reformers had begun to insist that convicted offenders be removed from their communities rather than punished in public, apparently to the benefit of all. From the first, however, those incarcerated were disproportionately poor and Black (wherever they were held), and subject to close surveillance and coerced labor, even when slavery and involuntary servitude were under attack. Recall the “exception clause” of the 13th amendment, which allows for slavery or involuntary servitude as criminal punishment. Expulsive incarceration was deemed an appropriate solution to growing social disorder and was quickly embraced when racial unrest became of concern to politicians and policymakers, who then roused an easily frightened public with warnings about crime and demands for law and order. The expulsions were political as well as social, disenfranchising felons not only during their time of incarceration but often for years thereafter as they fulfilled parole requirements and attempted to repay debts contracted while they were locked up. The state of Florida now has nearly one million formerly incarcerated people who are still expelled from the arenas of American politics.Race-based gerrymandering, which denies the Black representation that a state’s population would have required, has enabled Republicans in some legislatures to in effect define themselves as a political community, set their own rules, establish rights that members could claim, and expel those who push back. In Tennessee, the general assemblyrecently expelledtwo duly elected Black legislators – and nearly expelled an “unruly” white female legislator – with some of the mostexplicitly racist languageto be heard in public these days, clearly performances for their white Republican supporters. But they were only following politically expulsive traditions begun during the turbulent days of Reconstruction, when Black elected officials were expelled from their seats in legislatures, regularly run off after assuming local office, or murdered if they determined to stay in power.This long history helps us understand how easy it has been for Donald Trump to attract millions of supporters by offering expulsions – soon, perhaps, of political opponents as well – as a solution to their fears of economic decline, diminishing opportunities, racial replacement and social unrest. As was true in the past, Trump has described “communities” under siege from internal and external enemies alike, and has encouraged summary punishments for those who have “invaded”, either fromwithinor without. And as was true in the past, these are ethnic and political cleansings that should warn us of the illiberal cast infusing our democracy and of the dangerous road to its possible collapse. First they came for those who could be declared “illegal” and were accused of “poisoning the blood of our country”. Then …It would be difficult to find a precedent for Trump’s expulsive policies in their potential reach and ambitions. Yet, frighteningly, in one form or another, they have happened before in America.Steven Hahn is professor of history at New York University and author, most recently, of Illiberal America: A HistoryExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionUS politicsRaceDonald TrumpNative AmericansUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

If you want to improve your health, just look to Donald “My Body Is a Temple” Trump for pointers. The US president just had his annual checkup and emerged with flying colours. “President Trump remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function,” White House physician Sean Barbella said in areport released on Sunday.How does the 78-year-old, who is the oldest person in history to be inaugurated US president, stay in such great shape? The report cited an active lifestyle, noting Trump’s many speeches and “frequent victories in golf events”. But if you’re not a golfer, don’t worry. I have put together a four-point Donald John Trump Wellness Plan so that you can be as perky as the president.1. Don’t rundown your battery with too much exerciseAccording to a2017 New Yorker profile, the president’s views on exercise – like his views on everything else – seem to have emerged from Victorian Britain. “Other than golf, [Trump] considers exercise misguided, arguing that a person, like a battery, is born with a finite amount of energy,” the article notes. Sounds bonkers, I know. But look at the speed with which Trump is dismantling democracy! Maybe he’s on to something.2. Sleep as little as possible“Don’t sleep any more than you have to,”Trump advisedin his 2004 book Trump: Think Like a Billionaire. “I usually sleep about four hours per night.” He expounded on this on the campaign trail. “I’m not a big sleeper. I like three hours, four hours, I toss, I turn, I beep-de-beep, I want to find out what’s going on,” Trumpsaid in 2015. For most people, anxiety and aweakened immune systemis what’s going on after chronic sleep deprivation. But, clearly, it’s working out for Donald.3. Repeat after me: person, woman, man, camera, TV“They said nobody gets it in order – it’s actually not that easy,” Trump said after taking a cognitive test in 2020 thatinvolved repeating those words.4. Inhale Diet Cokes and “hamberders”Trump doesn’t drink alcohol and, in a rare moment of self-awareness, noted that never drinking is one of his “only good traits”. Instead of boozing, however, he throws back so many fizzy drinks that he’s installed a Diet Coke button on the Oval Office desk. He’s also a big fan of fast food and loveswhat he calls “hamberders.”Again, inhaling junk food is unorthodox wellness advice, but you can’t argue with the healthiest president the US has ever seen, can you?Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So why are its brightest stars drawn to the US president? The answer lies in marginalization and the need to be seenWed 16 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTShareEvery March, I tune in to the NCAA Division I Men’sWrestlingChampionships, a ritual I associate with the arrival of spring. It also reminds me of my own athletic tenure. I grew up in rural Pennsylvania and started wrestling when I was five, and went on to compete at the Division I level in college.This year’s championships were compulsive viewing. Penn State’s Carter Starocci became the firstfive-time D-I national champion, and Oklahoma State’s Wyatt Hendrickson stunned Olympic champion,Gable Steveson, in the heavyweight final.Oh. And Donald Trump was there. Joining him were Elon Musk, former wrestler turned Republican Ohio congressman Jim Jordan, and other political allies.Trump made his entrance in Philadelphia’s Wells Fargo Center to cheers and “U-S-A, U-S-A” chants. He appeared after Starocci had just claimed his historic fifth title, prompting ESPN to interrupt Starocci’s interview and cut to the president. As Trump waved to the crowd, I received a text from a former training partner – “Dude, WTF” he wrote. I knew what he meant. I felt the same sinking disappointment.Our sentiments, however, were not shared by many of the wrestlers at the tournament. Throughout the night, athletes shook hands with the president, posed with him for pictures and let him hold their NCAA trophies, obelisk-like totems that represent years of bloody sacrifice the uninitiated would be hard-pressed to fathom. On his X account, Tom Ryan, head coach at Ohio State, posted a picture of himself and Elon Musk, whom he called one of his “favorite men”. Hendrickson celebrated his victory by firing a stout salute in Trump’s direction and draping an American flag over his massive shoulders.Two days after the tournament, StaroccijoinedFox & Friends, and, despite his name being mispronounced multiple times, seemed happy to be there. Hendricksonappearedvia video chat on America’s Newsroom, where Fox anchor Bill Hemmer, like many others, called him “Captain America”. Both interviews focused on wrestling and Trump in equal measure.What do these athletes see in Trump? He is a wrestler’s opposite in nearly every way. Though he has a weird habit of trying to dominate handshakes, he’s never been a serious athlete,despite his boasts. His privilege has shielded him from accountability throughout his life. Among high-level wrestlers, personal accountability is a deep, almost spiritual core value. Most wrestlers never reach their athletic goals, regardless of how hard they work. I can attest that such failures are crushing. And yet, when it comes to losses, most wrestlers reject any form of excuse. Two years ago, in a bout considered one of the all-time college upsets, Matt Ramos of Purdue pinned Iowa superstar, Spencer Lee. Lee, who was injured, said in a Barstoolinterview, “I saw people say I lost because I was hurt … That’s not true. I got beat. I hate when people try to make excuses for me when I got outwrestled and beat.” Trump has yet to publicly concede his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.This paradox is not surprising. Many of Trump’s fans voted for policies that will not benefit their lives. Their support is based on emotion, not logic. Viewed through this lens, college wrestling’s embrace of Trump makes sense. Trump’s antagonistic relationship with higher ed matters little when, to wrestling, he and his allies say, “We love you, we’re proud of you.”For a sport routinely shoved to the margins, this high-profile support is significant. Penn State’s Mitchell Mesenbrinksaidif “you put politics aside, no matter if you’re conservative or liberal … to have the president of the United States be at something we want to get people to watch … [is] really, really cool.” Wasted tax dollars notwithstanding, Mesenbrink is right. You seldom see wrestlers in a montage on Gatorade commercials. You don’t hear about them inking huge corporate sponsorship deals. Simone Biles, Caitlin Clark and Michael Phelps are household names, yet a relatively small sect outside the wrestling world knows who Jordan Burroughs is. In 2016, The New Yorker publishedThe Faces of College Wrestlers, which featured portraits taken after wrestlers had stepped off the mat. I was delighted until I read the article’s comment section on Facebook. With articulate prose, people had reduced these young men to knuckle-dragging stereotypes. The phrase “toxic masculinity” appeared multiple times.Negative attention is nothing new for wrestling. Fifty years ago, there were more than 150 D-I wrestling programs; as of 2025,there are 79. My alma mater, Boston University, cut its program in 2014 to make space for men’s lacrosse. To me, an elite urban school rejecting wrestling for a sport associated with affluence felt like a rejection of my home state, and, more broadly, of rural America.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump waves as he arrives at the NCAA Division I Men’s Wrestling Championships last month in Philadelphia.Photograph: Kayla Bartkowski/Getty ImagesHerein lies the other thread that tethers wrestling to Trump: while wrestling programs of all levels exist in various parts of the country, wrestling is largely associated with rural America. The urban-rural divide has continued to widen since Trump first entered the political arena. Many rural voters have voiced feelings of being unseen – or, if seen, of being scorned – by the political elite. Trump’s policies do not improve life for most of his rural constituents – quite the opposite. Nonetheless, to these voters, Trump routinely says,I see you.Democrats have struggled to find a language that engages rural America (a trend Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are trying to change). Similarly, many on the left have faltered when it comes to locating a productive language to discuss masculinity. Trump fills that void, hollow as his platitudes may be.It took me three application cycles to gain admission to a fully funded MFA program. As rejections rolled in, I leaned on the persistence wrestling had instilled in me. My eventual acceptance letter filled me with as much joy as any win on the mat ever had. My first night on campus, an MFA colleague, referring to my identity as a straight white male, asked, “How does it feel to be part of the problem?” The question portended a number of similar experiences. Phrases like “toxic masculinity” and “lit bro” were swung in my direction like a judge banging a gavel. In those moments, I wanted to turn translucent – to hold out my arms like a Da Vinci sketch and show the scar tissue and nerve damage and old surgeries and say,see?In aguest essayfor the New York Times, David J Morris laments the dearth of young men involved in the reading and writing of literature. He notes that this reality is reflected in our national politics. “Young men who still exhibit curiosity about the world,” he writes, “Too often seek intellectual stimulation through figures of the ‘manosphere’ such as Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan.”Morris points out a number of discouraging trends. Suicide rates among young men have skyrocketed while educational statistics continue to plummet. Young men who exhibit “traditional” masculine qualities, such as physical strength and self-reliance, are labeled “toxic” by a culture that will just as quickly make male vulnerability the punchline of a joke.Last year, astudyconducted at Dublin City University by Dr Catherine Baker, professor Debbie Ging, and Dr Maja Brandt Andreasen uncovered the alarming extent to which algorithms used by social media platforms recommend misogynistic content to young men. A 2023studyconducted by the Pew Research Center found that young men are reaching financial milestones at a slower rate than men of previous generations, while numbers among women swing in the opposite direction.Leading up to the election, Trump took pains to forge an associative link between young men’s economic woes and progressive politics; his racist and misogynistic attacks on Kamala Harris fed into a prevailing sense of anger and dissatisfaction. The irony, of course, is that Trump has a long history of relying on immigrant labor and stiffing the working class. On 13 July 2024, the attempt on Trump’s life at a rally in Pennsylvania further solidified his tough-guy image. AP photographer Evan Vuccicaptured a photo of Trumppumping his fist like a victorious athlete as blood dripped from his ear. (Celebrations of Trump’s temerity tended to ignore the fact that audience member Corey Comperatore was killed.) The president also has a strong relationship with the UFC. Last Saturday, heattended UFC 314 in Miami. For fight fans, chaos-inducing trade policies are trivial when Trump – like a Roman emperor at the Colosseum – sits among the people for a dose of cathartic violence. Is it thus surprising that Trump made significant gains among young men of all backgrounds in last year’s presidential election?Wrestling is hard, and those who excel at it deserve to be celebrated. It teaches young people how to hold themselves accountable and persevere through difficult challenges – skills that seem to be in short supply. Boys are not the lone beneficiaries. Girls’ wrestling is America’s fastest growing high school sport. While many figures of the “manosphere” champion physical fitness, the wholesale conflation of fitness and toxic masculinity is a mistake. Wrestling, like any sport, has its bad actors. Still, no one benefits when those who promote inclusiveness take it upon themselves to define masculinity with narrow parameters that shame a large number of young men. Shame drives these young men toward the praise of a hypocritical false idol, and, worse, toward “manosphere” extremism.Perhaps the wrestling world’s embrace of Trump is a metonym for our historical moment. How to positively reengage young men is the question with which America must grapple if it is going to wrest democracy from the jaws of defeat. The whistle has already been blown; the match is underway.Explore more on these topicsWrestlingDonald TrumpCollege sportsUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Dallas fans are furious – and they’re not aloneWed 16 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 11.39 EDTShareIn the NBA, villainy rarely looks like chaos. It often arrives in the form of billionaires who believe their power serves a greater good. The NBA’s old guard of terrible owners – Donald Sterling, Glen Taylor and Robert Sarver – have mostly exited the stage, having offloaded their controlling stakes in recent years. Even James Dolan, long regarded as the autocratic overlord of the New York Knicks, has begun toloosen his grip on basketball operations. Yet as the league evolves, the absence of these figures creates a vacuum – one in which a new archetype of villainous owner can emerge. And from where I stand, Miriam Adelson is the No 1 example.Adelson, the widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson,is worth around $27bn, making her one of the world’s richest women. Her fortune primarily stems from her majority ownership in the Las Vegas Sands casino and resort company. In late 2023, she purchased majority ownership of the Dallas Mavericksfrom Mark Cuban for $3.5bn. In a little over two years in charge, she has alienated large parts of the team’s fanbase by allowing thetrade of a generational superstar, Luka Dončić, who took the team to the NBA finals last season.US sports owners make huge political donations. Which party does your team’s give to?Read moreAdelson, her son-in-law Patrick Dupont and former shoe salesman-turned-Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison haveturned the Mavericks into a laughingstock. The city of Dallas is still seething from losing Dončić, who will almost certainly end up in the Hall of Fame. Chants of “Fire Nico” have broken out across the city,from Medieval Timestocollege basketball games. Harrison may have traded Dončić, but he did so with the blessing and support of Adelson. More troubling to fans like me are her close links to Donald Trump; she is a Maga megadonor, themost generous of any sports team ownerby some distance, and herstaunch support of Israelas tens of thousands of Palestinianssuffer under a brutal war.NBA owners havelong participated in political fundraising, often quietly backing presidential candidates behind the scenes. Yet few have done so as overtly as Adelson. Her political engagement transcends mere support and enters the realm of activism – in 2024 alone, Adelson gave more $100m to Trump’s campaign efforts –the very term conservatives so often weaponize as a pejorative. And that’s before we get to an op-ed she wrote in 2023,saying pro-Palestinian protestorsare “not our critics. They are our enemies.” Adelson, of course, is perfectly entitled to support whichever politician she wants and have her own opinions on Israel – and many Mavs fans don’t care, as long as the team performs well (which it isn’t). But for other fans, myself included, there’s an enduring irony in how many on the right bristle when players like LeBron James speak out on social issues yet remain unbothered when an NBA team owner funnels millions into a presidential campaign or has their own say on politics. Those critics stay triggered when players mix sports and politics, but not when owners contribute millions to elect candidates – a darkly hilarious lack of self-awareness.View image in fullscreenMiriam Adelson, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, looks on during the first half of a November game against the Orlando Magic at American Airlines Center.Photograph: Sam Hodde/Getty ImagesI see the on-court basketball chaos funded by Adelson as a fitting – if much less serious – parallel toher supportof an Israeli regime that has inflicted suffering on the Palestinian people. Since the controversial trade that sent Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers, the Mavericks have experienced a near-total unraveling. A series of injuries, along with the absence of Dončić, mean the Mavericks only just scraped into the play-in tournament a year after reaching the NBA finals. Meanwhile, the franchise has relinquished control of its first-round draft picks from 2027 through 2030 – a period during which their aging core, including Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving, will likely be in steep decline.To compound the fan revolt, shortly after the trade the Mavericks announced an average season ticket priceincrease of 8% for 2025-26, with some seat hikes increasing by 10%. If the goal was to alienate fans, it proved remarkably effective.ESPN’s Tim MacMahon reportedthat moving on from Dončić may significantly damage the Mavericks – potentially causing the franchise to “lose dozens of millions in revenue this season due to dwindling crowds, plummeting merchandise sales and sponsors severing ties with the franchise in the wake of the trade.” There have been very visible signs of fans’ discontent: when Dončić returned to Dallas with the Lakers to play the Mavs last week, a“Fire Nico” muralhad been erected five minutes away from the stadium.Inside the arena, as the Mavericks played a tribute video thanking Dončić for his years of brilliance with the team, the fruits of Adelson’s ownership decisions came into full view. Dončić, sensing what was to come, asked for a towel before the montage even began – soon he was in floods of tears. Then he stepped on to court and scored 45 points asthe Lakers routed the Mavs 112-97.Watching it all from the seats was Dirk Nowitzki, the man who had led Dallas to their first – and only – NBA title in 2011. When he retired in 2019, a year after the Mavericks drafted Dončić, it seemed like a perfect passing of the torch – until Adelson, Dumont, and Harrison traded away Dončić, the new heart and soul of Dallas. For fans like myself, they did not seem to understand or care about how much Dončić meant to the city of Dallas. Like many superstars before him, he embodied the hopes and dreams of the city he wore on his chest. But from her support of the divisive presidency of Trump – in a city wheremost of the population voted for Kamala Harrisin 2024 – to her backing of Israel as the Gaza campaign continues, to her ownership of the Mavericks, Adelson strikes me as someone who cares little about how her decisions affect others.There have always been NBA villains. But this may be the first time we’ve had one whose emblem you can wear on a jersey andwhose massive influenceshapes both the league and American legislation and policy.Explore more on these topicsDallas MavericksNBABasketballUS sportsLuka DončićcommentShareReuse this content"

The constitution has not been rewritten. Checks and balances have not been dissolved. The difference is a president who ignores those constraints, and the impotence of the institutions that should enforce them.Which is the true US, the one enshrined in law or the one that smirks in contempt of law? If the latter, should Britain welcome its embrace as a kindred nation? That is an existential question lurking in the technical folds of a potential transatlantic trade agreement.If JD Vance is to be believed, the prospects ofsuch a deal are looking up. The US vice-president reports that Donald Trump “really loves the United Kingdom”. The two countries are connected by a “real cultural affinity” that transcends business interests.This is a more emollient Vance than the one who earlier this year denounced Britain, alongside other European democracies, as a hotbed of anti-Christian prejudice and endemic censorship. In aspeech to the Munich Security Conferencein February, Vance told his audience that Europe’s greatest threat comes not from Russia or China, but “from within”. He saw a continent in retreat from the “values shared with the United States of America”. Vance returned to the theme whenKeir Starmer visited the White House, rebuking the prime minister for “infringements on free speech that … affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens”.It is difficult to imagine a post-American world. But imagine it we must | Nesrine MalikRead moreThat was a swipe at theOnline Safety Act, which makes social media companies, websites and search engines responsible for “harmful content” published on their platforms. The law had a tortuous genesis between 2022 and 2023. Its scope expanded and contracted depending on what was deemed enforceable and desirable under three different Conservative prime ministers.The version now on the statute book focuses on unambiguously nasty stuff – incitement to violence, terrorism, race hate, encouraging suicide, child abuse images. Technology companies are required to have systems for removing such content. Those mechanisms are assessed by the regulator, Ofcom. Inadequate enforcement is punishable with fines. Refusal to comply can result in criminal prosecutions.That was the theory. The question of how the law should be implemented in practice was deferred. The answer seems to be not much if Britain wants a trade deal with the US.Last month,Ofcom received a delegationfrom the US state department, which raised the Online Safety Act in line with the Trump administration’s mission “to affirm the US commitment to defending freedom of expression in Europe and around the world”. Last week, answering questions from the parliamentary liaison committee, Starmer confirmed thatdiluting digital regulation was on the tablein trade talks when he acknowledged that “there are questions about how technology impacts free speech”. The prime minister also conceded that theUK’s digital services tax, which aims to clamp down on international tech companies avoiding tax by hiding their profits offshore, could be up for negotiation.These demands from the White House have been flagged well in advance. In February,Trump signed a“memorandum to defend US companies and innovators from extortion overseas”. The administration promised to take a dim view of any attempt to raise taxes from US tech companies and any use of “products and technology in ways that undermine free speech or foster censorship”.Regulation that impedes the operation of US digital behemoths – anything short of blanket permission to do as they please – will apparently be treated as a hostile act and an affront to human liberty.This is an imperial demand for market access cynically camouflaged in the language of universal rights. The equivalent trick is not available in other sectors of the economy. US farmers hate trade barriers that stop their products flooding European markets, but they don’t argue that their chlorine-washed chickens are being censored. (Not yet.)That isn’t to say digital communications can be subject to toxicity tests just like agricultural exports. There is wide scope for reasonable disagreement on what counts as intolerable content, and how it should be controlled. The boundaries are not easily defined. But it is also beyond doubt that thresholds exist. There is no free-speech case for child sexual abuse images. The most liberal jurisdictions recognise that the state has a duty to proscribe some material even if there is a market for it.The question of how online space should be policed is complex in principle and fiendishly difficult in practice, not least because the infrastructure we treat as a public arena is run by private commercial interests. Britain cannot let the terms of debate be dictated by a US administration that is locked in corrupting political intimacy with those interests.It is impossible to separate the commercial and ideological strands of Trump’s relationship with Silicon Valley oligarchs. They used their power and wealth to boost his candidacy and they want payback from his incumbency. There is not much coherence to the doctrine. “Free” speech is the kind that amplifies the president’s personal prejudices. Correcting his lies with verifiable facts is censorship.That warped frame extends beyond the shores of the US. It is shared by Kemi Badenoch, who considers Vance a friend. Asked about the vice-president’s Munich speech, the Conservative leader said she thought he was “dropping some truth bombs, quite frankly”. Badenoch’s own speeches consistently fret about the capture of Britain’s elite institutions, especially the Whitehall bureaucracy,by repressive woke dogma.There is a school of militant leftism that is tediously censorious, stretching liberal piety to illiberal extremes, and there always has been. But it is very far from power. Maybe Badenoch ramps up the menace to appeal to a fanatical audience on social media. Perhaps she radicalised herself by reading about it there. Either way, to fixate on campus protest politics as the main threat to western democracy when a tyrant sits in the Oval Office requires an act of mental contortion that, if not actually stupid, does a strong imitation of stupidity.Britain doesn’t have to take instruction on political freedom from a regime that suffocates media independence with bullying and vexatious litigation; that demandsuniversities teach the ruling party’s orthodoxies; that courts dictatorships while sabotaging democratic alliances; that kidnaps and jails innocent people with no regard for due process, thenignores the court rulingsthat say they should be free.These are the “values” that Vance is talking about when he laments that Europe and the US are drifting apart. This is the model of “free speech” that a Trump trading partner is expected to endorse; to protect. Is that the stuff of “real cultural affinity” that earns Britain a deal? Let’s hope not.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationUS politicsJD VanceCensorshipKeir StarmerInternet safetycommentShareReuse this content"

But it must be remembered this is not an abstract debate; it concerns real peopleSam Fowles is a barristerWed 16 Apr 2025 12.50 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe supreme court, headlines say, has ruled on “the definition of a woman”. Except it hasn’t. As the court says, in paragraph 2 of itsjudgment: “It is not the role of the court to adjudicate on the arguments in the public domain on the meaning of gender or sex, nor is it to define the meaning of the word ‘woman’ other than when it is used in the provisions of the [Equality Act] 2010.”So what is the court’s decision actually about? In 2018, the Scottish parliament passed a law encouraging public boards to have 50% representation for women. For Women Scotland, a group thatdescribes itselfas “working to protect women’s rights”, asked the court to strike the law down because it included transgender women. There followed a series of legal challenges which eventually made their way to the supreme court.The essence of the court’s decision is (in broad strokes) as follows: a) the Gender Recognition Act 2004 states that a person with a GRC [gender recognition certificate] is to be treated as the sex stated in the GRC “for all purposes” unless a statute provides otherwise; b) although theEquality Act 2010doesn’t explicitly state otherwise, it contains various references to the word “woman” in contexts where it makes more sense if it is read as “biological woman”; c) the Equality Act therefore rebuts the presumption in the GRA and, for its purposes, “woman” means “biological” (“cis”) woman and, accordingly, the 2018 act must be read as excluding trans women from the class of “woman”.For Women Scotlandraisednearly £250,000 to fund its case. Yet the decision leaves the legal rights of cis women untouched. What it does do, however, is make the legal equalities landscape significantly more complex. Previously, the Equality Act was interpreted quite simply: people who were born women or had a GRC were women for the purposes of the act. Another section of the act provided protections for those undergoing “gender reassignment” (whether or not they had a GRC).The court’s decision means there are now multiple legal classes of “woman” and “man”, each of which invites a different interpretation of the act: cis women, trans women with a GRC, trans women without a GRC, cis men, trans men with a GRC, trans men without a GRC. The court acknowledged that, should a trans woman be discriminated against because someone thinks she is a cis woman, then she will still be entitled to make a claim for sex discrimination in the same way as a cis woman.And what of the practical impacts of the decision? As of 2020,there were reportedly no trans women serving on public boards. Trans people make up around 0.44% of the over-16 population in Scotland. The chances of a cis woman losing a public board position to an equally qualified trans woman are vanishingly small. The 2018 act will still permit the appointment of a trans woman ahead of an equally qualified biological woman if the appointment can be justified on the basis of their “particular characteristics or situation”.In terms of the broader effects of the decision, there is some suggestion that this might affect women-only groups that wish to exclude trans women. It won’t. The law permitted such exclusions already. (Although it may be that some groups would feel more confident in using them after this decision.)The court was clear that trans people (regardless of whether they have a GRC) remain entitled to protection under the Equality Act (generally the same as conferred on biological women). Some sections of the act, which refer explicitly to “women”, will now be confined to cis women. The vast majority of these, however, are either unlikely to affect trans people or else the protections are replicated elsewhere in the act. Section 17 of the act, for example, explicitly refers to “treating a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding” as an example of discrimination against women on the basis of sex. The court’s decision suggests that a trans woman is not protected by section 17. Such discrimination is still, however, probably prohibited by sections 7 and 13 (which prohibit discrimination against trans people).No trans people were represented during the case – and retired judge Victoria McCloudwas refused permissionto join the litigation. Yet despite the limited reach of the decision itself, it will no doubt have other effects.The court asked politicians and activists not to weaponise its decision for political gain. Moments after it was published, however, some politicians and activists did exactly that.It must be remembered that this is not an abstract debate – it involves real people. Trans people, for example, are nowtwice as likelyas cis people to be the victim of violent crime;62%-73% reportbeing harassed.That isn’t the supreme court’s fault. All the court can do is interpret the law set down by parliament. The judges’ analysis is forensic, balanced and rational. Their decision shows, however, that parliament urgently needs to look again at the Equality Act. If politicians focused more on legislating, and less on making cheap political capital, this case may never have been necessary.Sam Fowles is a barrister, author and broadcasterDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Phew. Our long national nightmare is over.Cripes. What a joke.Here we are in 2025, and the major political parties continue to say that the way to make homes cheaper is to increase the amount that people will be able to pay to buy a home.It’s not like we lack about 25 years’ worth of evidence that this approach has failed.In 2000, as a way of bribing people to think that they would be better off after the introduction of the GST, John Howard increased the long-running first homeowners’ grant to $7,000. A year later, with an election to win, he doubled it to $14,000.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterSince then, it has been the go-to policy by federal and state governments to solve the crisis of housing affordability. Pick your state,pick your grant. In New South Wales, for example, you can get $10,000 for newly built or substantially renovated homes.And that is why no one in Sydney has any problem buying a first home.Am I too cynical?In 1999 Howard also introduced a 50% capital gains tax discount that made investing in housing a speculator’s delight, and he laughed about how no one ever complained to him about the value of their house going up.If the graph does not display, click hereOn Monday, Peter Dutton told reporters that he wanted “to see [house prices] steadily increase”. And when asked on Tuesday if he wanted to see wages rise faster than house prices (the key to improving housing affordability, and something even his shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, admits is needed) he dodged the question and instead talked about wanting house values to rise.Nearly 70% of people born in 1947-51 owned a home when they were in their early 30s; now it is less than half.If you are not cynical, you are not paying attention:If the graph does not display, click hereWeirdly, first home buyers make up a pretty high percentage of new home loans:If the graph does not display, click hereBut they are getting older, and the number is falling.Back in June 2007, 30,607 people took out a first-home loan.

All it will do is help push up house prices.One good thing for first home buyers is that the size of their home loans (and presumably the price of their houses) has not increased as fast as it has for non-first home buyers.If the graph does not display, click hereBut this suggests they are buying fewer houses than in the past and more (cheaper) apartments, and that they are also buying them further away from the CBD.At least the ALP is planning to build more homes – 100,000 over eight years, reserved for first home buyers. It is good to see a government realise that building homes is a good investment. That used to be taken for granted; now it is rare:If the graph does not display, click hereThe aim to build 10,000 to 12,000 more homes a year has been met with scepticism by some –suggesting we don’t have enough people to do it. And yet in the past, building 10,000 public-sector dwellings was common. So, what happened?Well, one thing is we shifted what builders and construction workers were doing.If the graph does not display, click hereBack in the period where housing was much more affordable and more public-sector dwellings were built, about 46% of all construction work was building or renovating homes – now it is just 32%.The big change is how much work is now done on private sector engineering construction – especially mining.We do have a skills shortage in construction – there are roughly only 1.2 unemployed construction workers for every job vacancy in the industry. That’s essentially full employment.It means when governments approve new coal and gas mines or their extensions, they are not “creating jobs”; they are just taking workers away from building homes and getting them to build mines – mines that produce greenhouse gas emissions.We have housing policies that fuel demand and bipartisan policies of mining approval that reduce the supply of workers available to build homes and all the while neither the ALP nor LNP will touch capital gains tax.Excuse my cynicism, but after 25 years of the same policies it is justified.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsHousingGrogonomicsConstruction industryEconomicsAustralian election 2025commentShareReuse this content"

It’s not coming from the place you might thinkWed 16 Apr 2025 10.28 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 14.01 EDTShareFor all its talk of free speech, the Trump administration seems remarkably comfortable with censorship. Earlier this year, children studying at Pentagon schools (serving US military families) were prevented from accessing libraries for a week while officialsreviewed their shelvesfor titles that might be “related to gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology topics”. Trump’s presidency has injected new energy into the book-banning movement that has been simmering for years on the US right. You might think that censoring school libraries would be totally unimaginable in Britain. You’d be wrong.I worked as a librarian for 10 years, and now I teach on the library and information studies master’s programme at UCL. After the pandemic, I began noticing signs of an eerily similar trend. It erupted in the spring of 2022, when a Catholic school in Croydon invitedSimon James Green, a prominent gay children’s author, to give a talk. The US anti-LGBT website Catholic Truth ran a campaign encouraging readers to contact the school and protest against the event (one reader said, somewhat implausibly, that Green’s visit to the school was “100% as much of an issue as the ongoing war in Ukraine”). The commission responsible for the school released a statement suggesting the event should be cancelled, teachers went on strike, and thestory reached the national press.It got me thinking: how many school librarians had come under pressure to remove books from their shelves? Onesurvey conductedlater that year found 26% of librarians had “occasionally” been asked to censor materials. In 2024, meanwhile, Index on Censorshipsurveyed 53 school librarians, more than half of whom had been asked to remove books. I was keen to hear from librarians about where these requests were coming from, and how they were dealing with them, so I decided to do my own study. I interviewed 10 school librarians across the UK about the challenges they had faced. Their responses were interesting – and alarming.Most of the requests to remove books came from parents, and almost all of these requests related to books that explored LGBT+ themes. Some books came up repeatedly: Alice Oseman’s series of Heartstoppergraphicnovels, which centre on a relationship between two schoolboys; Billy’s Braveryby Tom Percival, about a boy who dresses up as his favourite superhero, Nature Girl, for World Book Day; and This Book Is Gayby Juno Dawson. Some librarians had received signed letters from parents asking them to remove particular books. Other times, the letters had been sent anonymously. One librarian told me they had found a leaflet produced by a rightwing religious American group, not dissimilar to Catholic Truth, on one of the desks in their library.Based on what I’ve seen and heard, it seems there has been an increase in these requests since the pandemic. Perhaps that’s because parents became more aware of what their children were reading during the intense period of home schooling. Perhaps it’s also a symptom of our febrile political culture. Over the last three years, drag queen story events – a popular format involving considerable amounts of glitter and storytelling aimed at children – have beentargeted by protestsorganised by Turning Point UK, a British offshoot of the far-right US political organisation, and by the white nationalist groupPatriotic Alternative. Would it be so surprising if the huge amount of coverage the British press has devoted to culture war subjects spilled over into some parents asking for certain books to be removed from school libraries?I find it hard not to see these requests as an insult to school librarians. These professionals undertake years of training and devote a huge amount of time and care to curating a selection of books that will enrich children’s learning and expand their horizons. They’re also careful about ensuring books are age-appropriate and respond to the curriculum (LGBTQ+ content is included as a statutory part of relationships and sex education teaching). Unfortunately, librarians are often at the lowest end of the school hierarchy. They’remostly women, and mostly on very low salaries. Their sector is vulnerable: some secondary schools haveclosed their librariesdue to funding pressures. A quarter of schools in Wales don’t have a library, while two-thirds of school libraries in Scotland have no library budget at all.It’s far easier to write a letter to a librarian asking them to remove a book than it is to address the truly inappropriate and harmful material that children are exposed to (which, by the way, has nothing to do with books such as Billy’s Bravery).Social media platforms have been blamed for encouraging bullying andeating disorders, and promoting influencers whodrive misogyny. Banning books will only drive young people online for answers, where they are more likely to encounter content produced by people who have no interest in equipping them with the information and skills they need to navigate the world. In this age of digital exposure and misinformation, librarians play a more vital role than ever. We should trust them to do their jobs.Alison Hicks is a lecturer in library and information studies at UCLExplore more on these topicsCensorshipOpinionLibrariesSchoolscommentShareReuse this content"

Why does this keep happening?Wed 16 Apr 2025 07.03 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 09.53 EDTShareIf you threw Blind Date, the opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan and the auction block into a blender, what you’d get isPop the Balloon or Find Love, a weekly hour-long Black dating show on YouTube.The show was created byArlette Amuli, an African American of Congolese origins, and her husband,Bolia “BM” Matundu, a Black Brit also of Congolese descent (he had a previous life as aUK rapperand then as aNdombolo musician). It has become an international sensation in an age where our fried attention spans have us addicted to short videos. The format is minimalist to the point of brilliance: each week, a line of eight or so balloon-clutching love hunters line up to court and be courted by a singleton of the opposite sex they have never met before.Should they not be interested, or be put off by anything – looks, values, religion, skin tone, children from previous relationships or lack thereof, economic status, tattoos, eyebrow shape – they pop their balloon. Expressing attraction, rejecting someone or being rejected in private is crushingly intimidating enough (to me at least). Immortalised rejection to the sound of an unexpected loud bang, followed by a full rationale and a right of reply? Utter genius TV.And then the inevitable happened:Netflixcame knocking. Fans of the show showered Amuli and Matundu with congratulations, excitement and absolute trepidation. Would Netflix ruin a beloved, groundbreaking and independent Black show by tampering with a winning formula, or would they make a few nips and tucks to elevate it to another level?Well, they did worse. They gentrified it.In the original Pop the Balloon or Find Love, Amuli (who also presents the show) and Matundu created a very modern dating show that is the perfect balance of righteousness and ratchetness, while simultaneously being a classy, funny, furious, flirtatious and sometimes intellectually curious affair. It reveals more than it might appear to about the psychology, values, methods and mannerisms of Black courtship within the confines of the west. Each of the 50 episodes posted to date has attracted more than a million views on YouTube, short clips from the show are social media dynamite, and it has spawned stars, at leastone marriage proposal, countless rip-offs, and parodies bySaturday Night Liveandpopular sports TVshows. An African American and Black British (via the Democratic Republic of the Congo) independent media dynasty is born.Based on the avalanche of disapproval for Netflix’s version (”or Find Love” was dropped from the title), fans’ worst nightmares came true. Gone was the wholesome insight into Black dating and love patterns; in stepped swearing, twerking, needless disrobing and even what many thought wasracism. Gone were the class, the intellectual insights and the Black “civilians” (of all shades) looking for love; in came a diverse (all of the “contestants” on the first episode of the Netflix show were either white or light-skinned), drink-sodden, rowdy affair including influencers and washed-up reality TV stars. Pop the Balloon or Find Love seemingly became Pop the Balloon and Find Clout. Despite the efforts of the new presenter, the comedian and actor Yvonne Orji (of HBO’s Insecure fame), it was genuinely painful to watch.On the bright side of things, for all it lacked, the Netflix version offered an inadvertent insight into the plight of Black creatives – especially upstarts – in predominantly white spaces.It’s hard, if not impossible, to nail down how the rot set in, but there are many other such instances of cultural upscaling or migration that fit this sorry pattern. No matter how much leverage you have as a cultural originator, the power (and money) in creative decision-making remains firmly in the hands of the organisations that, sadly, far too often just don’t get the culture they’re buying into. These organisations are also often not humble, introspective or honest enough to recognise this fact.But should you stand your ground too strongly, it could cost you your deal – or, even worse, it could unjustly earn you a bad reputation that could cost you your career. If you don’t stand your ground, your reputation could be attached to a project that will damage you as a creative. Importantly, as a Black creative who operates with a consciousness of the history of Black people in popular visual entertainment – much of it rooted in minstrelsy – the burden of representation rests massively on your shoulders. This catch-22 quite literally keeps Black creatives up (and tearfully panic-calling confidants) at night.Amuli and Matundu, a proudly Christian couple, were retained as executive producers of the Netflix version. Yet, given the nature of the original, it’s hard to see how they could be happy with this incarnation. This was not their warm, funny show; this was its more sensational viral clips re-imagined by veterans of the shock and awe world of reality TV. If those veterans really understood what made Pop the Balloon or Find Love such a sensation, they would have tried to replicate its knowing way of merging intellectual nourishment with fast-paced entertainment. What we have seen instead is the nutrition-free, social-media-virality-driven nature of influencers, reality TV stars and smut, which – in many circumstances – is a winner, if not a creative success.It’s not all about Netflix. The channel is usually a good partner for Black creatives; in fact, it’s one of the best in the business. But have Amuli and Matundu, or anyone who loved what they did, gained from the Netflix-isation of Pop the Balloon or Find Love?The second episode of the Netflix version airs on Thursday (Friday morning in the UK), and here’s a prediction: in our millions, we original devotees will stick with the original (ungentrified) YouTube version.

I used to pretend to be from somewhere else, but now I’m proud of my rootsWed 16 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 10.35 EDTShareIt’s curious, what escapes people’s idea of rudeness. For instance: pointing out someone’s weight is a unanimous no-go, but height – surely even more arbitrary – continues to be fair game. Ditto commenting derogatorily on where someone’s from – at least, as long as it’sBirmingham, England’s second city and first punchline for jokes about idiotic accents and general urban bleakness.As an unusually tall woman who grew up in that much-maligned metropolis, I have direct experience of both, and can confirm that while they’re equally annoying, the latter is much more pernicious. It is extraordinary what comes out of generally polite people’s mouths when I tell them I’m from Birmingham – fromhilariousfaux condolences to variations on, “Oh, I hear it’s horrible.”By far the most common reaction, though, is a caricature echo –“Biiirrrmmingum!” –the joke being that the accent is awful as well as the city (so, so funny!). All this, even though I never picked up the twang myself; not intentional, though I’m sure my lack of discernible Brummie accent has been protective, socially and professionally.WhenKate Adie revealedthe BBC’s (unofficial and historic) league table of the country’s least favourite accents, no one was surprised to see who came out worst – poor, picked-on Birmingham. Asked why he never used his native accent in reporting, Brummie journalistMichael Buerk apparently replied: “I didn’t want death threats.” And ina study from 2008, researchers found that people who spoke with a Birmingham accent were more likely to be perceived as stupid than those who didn’t open their mouths at all. Yikes.Birmingham accent ranked ‘most hated’ on BBC’s unofficial league table, Kate Adie revealsRead moreImagine if someone told you they were pregnant, and you said, “Oh what a shame, I hate children.” Or that they were a singer, and you said, “Music is so boring.” That unmediated negativity might sound ridiculous – but while I haven’t lived in Birmingham since I was 18, in the intervening years I don’t remember hearing one positive reaction after mentioning that I grew up there.Actually, that’s not strictly true – sharing my Birmingham origins did serve me well once, at a house party where a trio of Old Etonians somehow materialised, as in a fever dream. When I told them where I was from, their concern for my presumable lifetime of Dickensian deprivation was delicious to behold. One of them said: “Gosh, I hear it’s frightfully urban.”To be clear, I don’t expect anyone to reply “Wow! I love Birmingham!” when I say I’m from there – just to respond with the nonchalance that any other answer would elicit. I doubt anyone from Norwich or Exeter has encountered the baffling hostility that someone from Birmingham grows used to, but maybe we should turn the tables so they know how it feels. Chichester? Oh, you poorthing!York? A tragedy!What’s more, Brumphobia’s bizarre brazenness is only amplified by the realisation that none of its sufferers seem to have actually visited. It’s not that I’m encountering a parade of people who have travelled to my home town, been somehow traumatised and vowed never to return – on the contrary, they hate it blindly, with an astounding self-confidence normally reserved for bona fide bigots. It’s almost funny, except when it isn’t.When I first moved cities, the overwhelming anti-Birmingham sentiment led me to (briefly) fudge my own life story. Cast your mind back to the hell of freshers’ week and maybe you can forgive me. Newly independent and navigating crippling social pressure, I alternated between claiming London, where I was born, or Sydney, where my mum is from, for my origins. Look, there’s only so many“Biiirrrmmingum”s a teenager can take – but ultimately, neither cover story felt true, and I began to own my roots.Today, I declare them with relish, steeling myself for the inevitable”Biiirrrmmingum!”bait. “That’s so funny, no one’s ever said that before,”I reply, doing everything in my power to stop my eyes rolling out of my head. “Ever been?”If you haven’t, you should. Birmingham is great. The city is dynamic, diverse, open-hearted, andone of the friendliest placesin the UK. We’ve apparently gotmore miles of canal than Venice, and everyone knows that what makes a canal beautiful is how long it is. And as for the accent,it’s near enough Shakespeare’s, for God’s sake!Admittedly, 2025 is not our finest moment – the council iseffectively bankruptandthe ongoing bin strikemeans the city is full of cat-sized rats – but it’ll take more than that to sink the good ship Brum. Ironically, years of derision have made it impervious to outside criticism, and the accent will always feel like home to me. Its speakers don’t sound stupid, but after years of fielding their jibes, I can confirm that the people who mock them certainly do.

The foreign minister, Penny Wong, the defence minister and deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, have had a great time punishing the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, for his ill-judged foray into regional strategic affairs.A report on Tuesdaythat Russia had filed an official request with Jakartato base Russian military aircraft on Manuhua air force base in Biak island in eastern Indonesia tricked Dutton, a former defence minister who might have known better, into premature claims of catastrophic intelligence failure with monumental strategic consequences. But his political misadventure does prompt some consideration of the more serious issues at play.US president Donald Trump has created a massive opportunity for America’s adversaries to capitalise on his rare facility for ceding economic, political and strategic ground to China and Russia. China’s president is now making hay in the sunshine of Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia, while his trade minister was recently in discussion with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts on a joint approach to tariff imposts – three ancient enemies joined at last in common purpose.Albanese accuses Dutton of ‘verballing’ Indonesia’s president over reported Russian military encroachmentRead moreThe US has also given Russia virtual carte blanche in eastern Europe, as it combines duplicity with opportunism to kill Ukrainian civilians, smash their cities and exacerbate the apparent impotence of Ukraine’s western European friends.It’s not surprising that Russia seems to explore opportunities for influence and strategic display. And generating fear and loathing in Australia during an election campaign is an added bonus.But it’s not only autocrats like Xi and Putin who benefit from the vacuum created by Trump’s single-minded pursuit of American self-interest. Vacuums like this are opportunity rich – especially for those with the imagination and initiative to transform dependency into self-direction.The Indonesia that welcomed Soviet MiG-15 fighters in the 1950s (and, let’s remember, Russian Tupolev-95s transitedat the Manuhua airbase in Biak in 2017) is a fundamentally different country in 2025. It is making its own way in Asia and the world as a fast-growing and significant economy. It recently joined the Brics grouping comprising the leading economies of the global south. More significantly, it is an increasingly confident and independent nation pursuing its own agenda and exercising its own agency, remaining resolutely non-aligned.President Prabowo Subiantois much more aware than most Australians that Russia needs its relationship with Indonesia, not vice versa.Like the rest of the south-east Asian “tigers”,Indonesiais focused on economic growth and conflict avoidance. It is no accident that it hosts the Asean secretariat. It does not want to be caught between Beijing and Washington. Nor will it put the advantages of its long history of non-alignment at risk. But it will act in its own interests, with Russia on the outermost margins.Australia, however, is not marginal to Indonesia. We need to recognise and capitalise on that.A key consequence of Trump’s insistence on American interests at all costs is that the post-second world war alliances, such an important part of America’s strategic dominance until now, have collapsed. Australia and its European partners feel abandoned.Abandonment is not without advantage – it is actually a massive opportunity for Australia.For perhaps the first time since 1942, we can now set our own strategic direction, unencumbered by the imminent threat of war or the dominance of a great and powerful friend. As we recover from our infatuation with Anzus, we can now look at Asia and the Pacific as a region in which we can make our own way, in partnership with our neighbours instead of being a willing cats paw for America’s narrowly defined contest with China.The starting point for our brave new world is to understand that the opportunity of a lifetime lasts only as long as the lifetime of the opportunity. We need to get cracking. We need the leadership that recognises good luck rather than looks backwards at a lost world or, even worse, cries over spilt milk. We need the confidence to engage with our neighbours and to reinvest in the diplomatic tools that are critical to creating the geopolitical capital that is now so much in demand.And least of all do we need to start at shadows and indulge in the fear of unknown non-events and “agreements” from over-excited politicians who are making heavy weather of an election campaign.Allan Behm is special adviser, International and Security Affairs Program, at the Australia Institute in CanberraExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionIndonesiacommentShareReuse this content"

She had survived a malignant brain tumour diagnosis when she was 10, but her cancer was inoperable and sat directly on her hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for memory formation.My sister moved in and out of what I would call “reality”. She spent days talking to people I couldn’t see, laughing at jokes I couldn’t hear. I would cajole her into playing Scrabble with me, and after a couple of hours she might say something “normal”, like, “How are you, Jackie?” She just needed mental stimulation, I would think. If I could play Scrabble with her every day, she would come back to me.But she never stayed.She had a particular world in which she thought I was an impostor.

There might be some medicines which can ameliorate the symptoms, but overall,dementia is not currently reversible. Not by drugs, and not by playing 24/7 Scrabble.

Alzheimer’s disease is thought to cause about 60-80% of dementia cases, but there are other types, with different pathology trajectories.For example,Lewy body dementiacan cause visual hallucinations as one of the early symptoms, along with movement disorders which may look like Parkinson’s disease.Frontotemporal dementiacan lead to personality and behavioural or language changes, depending on which part of the brain is affected first.Vascular dementiasees step-changes, as the person has something akin to mini-strokes. For a while it may seem like the person has stabilised, but then the disease progresses.Now, as I spend my days working with people with dementia, I am better equipped at entering into their realityWhen my family first heard the word “dementia”, the internet as we know it now did not exist. I don’t remember receiving a pamphlet about dementia and what it would mean for my sister. Our understanding of dementia was limited to what we gleaned from other people’s experiences, almost exclusively with their elderly parents. We believed that dementia was a natural stage in ageing, and that my sister’s tumour had sped up the process.But now there are websites, videos, fact sheets and live helplines. I now know that dementia is not, in fact, an inevitable part of getting older: it’s been estimated thatone in 10 Australians over 65live with the condition. I think back to my shouting, pleading 20-year-old self and my sister, lost in her imagined worlds, and I feel compassion for both of us. I am glad that now, as I spend my days working with people with dementia, I am better equipped at entering into their reality, rather than policing them.‘It brings you back’: the suburban choir helping people living with dementia reconnectRead moreThe University of Tasmania’s Wicking Centreoffers some of my favourite resources. I am working my way through free online courses, which cover other brain conditions like Parkinson’s, motor neurone disease and traumatic brain injury.This year will mark my sister’s 10-year death anniversary. She would have turned 51. In the manner of younger siblings, I used to think that if she died before me, I would finally overtake her. But that’s not how it works. She will always be my big sister.These days, when I visit a resident and they call out for their mother, I don’t tell them that their mum is dead. Instead, I cry out with them.

Australia has a good health system that consistently ranks wellcompared withother wealthy nations – including on life expectancy, which is on the high side.Labor announces $10m to provide ‘inclusive, culturally safe’ healthcare for LGBTQ+ AustraliansRead moreMedicare remains the right infrastructure for funding primary care. But it is now more than 40 years old and needs to be updated and improved.Policy action is necessary on five fronts:financial barriers to care;managing chronic conditions;mental health and dental care;public hospitals; andthe workforcePriced out of careDespite Medicare’s promise of universality, aroundone in 10 people deferseeing a doctor because of the cost.And despite the provision of subsidised drugs via the PBS, people also report missing out on filling prescriptions.Labor has announced big-ticket measures to improvebulk-billing ratesandcap PBS pricesat A$25 a prescription. Given cost-of-living pressures are central to the election, it’s unsurprising the Coalition has pledged to match both policies.But, critically, neither party has announced anything to improveaccess to other medical specialists. The gap continues to grow between what specialists charge and what Medicare will cover. This means some patients are delaying or avoiding necessary care altogether.Complex chronic conditionsThe health system has not adapted to the rising prevalence of chronic disease in the Australian community. In 2023–24, 18% of the population sawthree or morehealth professionals. But for 28% of those people, no single provider coordinated their care.Medicare was designed in a different age and needs to be refurbished to respond to this new reality of more patients who are suffering multiple health conditions. Thestrengthening Medicare taskforceand theGP incentives reviewhave proposed new systems to fund general practices to facilitate multidisciplinary care.Work needs to continue in this direction, regardless of who forms the next government.Forgotten careDental and mental health are largely the forgotten sectors of health care. The number of people delaying access to oral health services because of affordability issues ismore than twicethe 10% who are missing out in other areas of the health system.Seeing a dentist is very much dependant on income. More than a quarter of Australians living in the most disadvantaged areas defer getting their teeth fixed because of the cost involved.Uncapped access to dental care,as proposed by the Greens, is not the answer. What is needed is a more sophisticated route towardsuniversal access.By contrast, the pattern for mental health care is different, with people in both poor and rich areas facing access problems. The Coalition has promised to restore the maximum number of Medicare-subsidised fee-for-servicemental health sessionsto 20, despite it being regarded asan inequitable policy.More fee-for-service mental health care is not the right approach. By contrast, Labor is making a$1bn commitmentto expanding services which are free to the consumer. This includes Medicare mental health services and Headspace clinics, which generally employ salaried professionals.Both parties should support another initiative already under way: theuniversal programfor people with low-to-moderate mental health needs, which doesn’t require either a referral or a copayment. Labor announced the plan in the last budget, scheduled to start in January 2026.Inadequate hospital fundingThe commonwealth share of public hospital funding has beentrending downfor the last few years, reversing the growth in its share over much of the last decade. Some states have fared worse than others, which means some hospitals have become squeezed and waiting times have blown out.The hard slog of change takes years and involves much more than a few carrots thrown to voters in an electionIn late 2023, national cabinet reached a newfunding dealwhich would lift the commonwealth share to 45% by 2035–36. But subsequent negotiations have become bogged down in a quagmire of claims and counter-claims.The Albanese government has responded with an interim one-year funding down payment. But both major parties need to address this issue and commit to implementing the full 45% in the agreed time frame.No doctor in the houseIn 2014, the Abbott governmentabolished Health Workforce Australia, the national agency responsible for health workforce planning. Ten years later, it’s no surprise we are in the middle of acritical shortageof doctors and nurses.The Albanese government has implemented changes to speed up the recruitment ofinternationally trainedhealth professionals. It is also offering incentives to encourage more clinicians to work in rural and remote Australia.But these are just more of the same, similar to the plethora of policies which have left us in the mess we are in. Ensuring we have the right workforce mix to address rural health needs requires a fresh approach. That includes revised funding models – as proposed in the GP incentives review – and allowing all health professionals to work to theirfull scope of practice.Reform hard slogAlthough health often ranks in the top three issues people say are important to them in elections, cost of living is the main focus of media and political commentary.The promise to increase bulk billing will help lower primary care costs. But genuine health care reform does not attract much media attention, which means it doesn’t get the profile necessary to prompt the right political promises.The hard slog of change takes years and involves much more than a few carrots thrown to voters in an election. It takes careful negotiation with stakeholders and getting the infrastructure right.Given the initiatives listed above, the health minister, Mark Butler, has done well on reform this term. Unfortunately, voters don’t see that and appear not to value systematic and coherent reform strategies.It is hoped that whoever is health minister after the election will continue on the reform path to a more sustainable and affordable health system.Stephen Duckett is honorary enterprise professor at the school of population and global health at the University of Melbourne.

His name was Luca Prodan, a Scottish-Italian rocker, and he had just finished the last of his methadone on the flight over. His arrival would soon send shockwaves throughArgentinawhen he started a band called Sumo, acquainted the country with post-punk, and became a national legend who lives on, his music still earning hundreds of millions of streams. “When I saw Sumo in 1982,” says Prodan’s younger brother Andrea, “I thought, ‘This is more than just a band. This is like the Velvet Underground.’”But, despite Prodan’s strong ties to Europe and his high esteem in Argentina, he is barely known outside of the country. That looks set to change – thanks to a forthcoming biopic called Time Fate Love, produced by Birdman co-writer Armando Bo. “Luca changed music history,” Bo says. “Here, he’s a god.”He sold a rifle to fund an escape from Gordonstoun – then evaded police across Europe for two and a half monthsProdan was like a grenade thrown into the stuffy Buenos Aires music scene, where musicians tended to wear their hair long and often noodled through adept but derivative jazz fusion or rock. “People were hungry for change,” says Sumo’s first drummer, Stephanie Nuttal. “And they loved Sumo. It was different. They were ready for it. And they took punk on board – big style.”Fronted by Prodan with his Ian Curtis-like crooning, idiosyncratic stage presence and completely shaven head, Sumo were dizzyingly funky and unbounded, playing not just post-punk but deftly hopping between new wave, reggae and cumbia. But, less than a decade after he arrived, and not long after the fall of the military junta, Prodan died at the age of just 34.View image in fullscreenRemembered … a mural dedicated to Prodan in Buenos Aires.Photograph: Prodan family archiveHe had already led a tumultuous life even before he landed in Argentina, bouncing nomadically around Europe. “An Italian guy reborn in England and reborn again in Argentina,” says Peter Lanzani, the zeitgeisty Argentinian actor who will play Prodan in the biopic, which he will also direct.Prodan’s wealthy parents met in pre-revolutionary China: his mother Cecilia Pollock was heir to Shanghai’s main tram company, while his father Mario was a well-known art dealer. In 1943, the two were imprisoned by the Japanese army in the Weixian internment camp before eventually fleeing to Italy, where Prodan was born in 1953. Younger brother Andrea – a musician and actor – says the children lived the high life in Rome, sailing the Mediterranean on the family yacht. But their aristocratic ways also meant that Luca was packed off aged 11 to the prestigious Scottish public schoolGordonstoun, where the future King Charles was a pupil at the time. “My parents wanted us to have a good education,” says Andrea. For Luca, this backfired. “He was unlucky – Gordonstoun was horrible.”At 17, Luca took up the family talent for escapology – and, according to popular mythology, sold a rifle to fund his getaway, heading back to Italy and sparking an international search by Interpol. “We had the police looking for him all over Europe for two and a half months,” says the younger Prodan. “He was a real rebel. Apparently, he had a fist fight with King Charles. I don’t know if this is just part of the myth, but I could see it happening.”View image in fullscreenRebel … Prodan, seated front right, with the Gordonstoun Pipe Band.Photograph: Prodan family archiveAfter Luca was located, he was then conscripted into, and deserted from, the Italian army. “He was always running away,” Andrea says. So his parents bought him a house in Chiswick, London, hoping he’d settle down. This also backfired: by now it was the punk era and Prodan became addicted to heroin. In 1977, he started his first band, the New Clear Heads, while working the singles section at London’s first Virgin Megastore, where, according to Andrea, Luca was fired by Richard Branson for stealing records.It was at this Chiswick house – where fans are campaigningfor a blue plaqueto commemorate the musician – that Prodan first met Stephanie Nuttal, who had been active in the Manchester post-punk scene with Manicured Noise. When bandmate Steve Walsh left Manchester for London, he encouraged Nuttal to move too. There, she was introduced to Prodan and moved into his place.“He was flighty,” says Nuttal. She didn’t see Prodan often, though he occasionally baffled her colleagues by turning up at her workplace to collect rent from her, so he could buy heroin. Nuttal says she couldn’t be in the same room as him when he was shooting up. “He was tall and well-built but was emaciated and literally yellow,” she says. “But he had so much creative energy, when he wasn’t completely under the influence.”Prodan’s addiction worsened when his sister Claudia killed herself. In despair, Prodan overdosed, fell into a coma and was briefly presumed dead. After recovering, he visited the mother of his former Gordonstoun roommate Timmy McKern, a Scottish-Argentine, and saw a photo of the Córdoba hills in Argentina, where his old friend was living with his family. This idyllic postcard, combined with the fact there was very little heroin in the South American country at the time, convinced Prodan to leave for Argentina, where he hoped to get clean.Beginnings … from left, Alejandro Sokol, Prodan and Stephanie Nuttal in 1981, on their way to Córdoba.Photograph: Courtesy: Stephanie Nuttal“He looked at that picture and saw hope in life,” says McKern. But he was in a bad state when he arrived, suffering from withdrawals, fevers, and sleeping all day. The two struggled to make a living on McKern’s family farm – they drank instead, and listened to Joy Division LPs that Prodan had brought with him, possibly the only such records in the country. “Luca said, ‘I’ve studied the Argentine music scene,’” recalls McKern, who would go on to manage Sumo. “‘Let’s start a band and get some money. It’ll be easy.’”With McKern’s brother-in-law, Germán Daffunchio, and his friend Alejandro Sokol,they almost had a group – but they needed a drummer. So on a return visit to London to buy instruments, Prodan decided to recruit Nuttal, who was unhappily ticking by in a haberdashery.With four pence in her pocket and a Gretsch snare drum, Nuttal arrived in Argentina, to the horror of her parents, who objected to its military government. The group settled in Hurlingham, the English quarter on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, and rehearsed on McKern’s farm in Córdoba, which Prodan called Happy Valley. “We rehearsed all night because it was cooler,” says Nuttal. “We got very drunk and when the sun came up, we’d go outside, get into the pool, and go to bed.”This chaotic energy fed into Sumo’s early songs. They quickly earned a reputation, performing in Buenos Aires pubs and bars such as Café Einstein, which Andrea describes as “the place where all the freaks hid from the dictatorship to freak out”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

And there’s Luca singing anything he wantsLife was hard in Argentina. Under the dictatorship, tens of thousands of political opponents were killed in clandestine “disappearances”. LGBTQ people were jailed and tortured in their masses. Inflation was so severe that products were listed with colour codes rather than price tags, because they could change so drastically from morning to afternoon. “It was a heavy scene with lots of people disappearing every day,” says McKern. “Then this guy arrived, Luca, who hadn’t lived under that – he was completely free.”Andrea adds: “Imagine, when he came to Argentina, he was singing in English during one of the most terrible repressions. People were being killed for being suspected of being anti-military. And there’s Luca singing anything he wants. He was so weird, the military didn’t know what to do with him.”Authorities sometimes detained entire audiences – but, risking their freedom and even their lives, fans turned up to Sumo shows anyway. Once, when the police had arrested everyone and asked who Luca Prodan was, the crowd defiantly burst into cheers, Spartacus-style. Prodan was briefly jailed, writing to McKern from prison: “He said, ‘It’s the same as being in Gordonstoun, but they don’t ask you to do anything.’”But whenthe Falklands war kicked off in 1982, Nuttal felt she had to return to the UK. Singing in English was forbidden. Her presence had caused locals to nickname Sumo “the English band”. The tabloids, she says, published stories about then PM Margaret Thatcher eating babies. “She may have done,” Nuttal laughs, but it was emblematic of the tension in the country.View image in fullscreen‘They put me in prison again’ … Prodan.Photograph: Prodan family archiveNuttal thought she might wait things out in neighbouring Uruguay, but returned to the UK, where she says people treated her like a traitor. She gave up music and becomes emotional when she describes how Argentinians still visit her to this day, thanks to her role in their country’s music history. “They won’t let go and I don’t want them to,” she says, “but I find it quite extraordinary because I was only there for a short time – I didn’t even record anything.”Sokol replaced Nuttal on drums and a bass player and saxophonist were added. The band put out their first record, Corpiños en la Madrugada (Bras at Dawn), in 1983. That same year, the military government fell. But just as Argentina started to open up, Luca was becoming disillusioned with music.He briefly returned to Europe, and visited his brother Andrea in Italy, where he played a small part in a biblical TV drama, Anno Domini, with none other than Ava Gardner. “I played Britannicus but they made him a jailer,” says Andrea. “I remember Luca said, ‘I came here on holiday and they put me in prison again!’”While Prodan’s European influences had given birth to punk rock in Argentina, the continent had changed while he was away. Yuppiedom was taking hold in the UK – and Italy, Prodan thought, was even worse. So he decided to return to Argentina and throw all his energy back into the band. They signed with CBS, now a Sony subsidiary, to release their first proper album in 1985 – Divididos por la Felicidad (Divided By Happiness), a Spanish-language homage to Joy Division. “All of a sudden, Sumo just exploded,” says Andrea. “It was amazing.”The band had complete artistic control. They played larger venues and their fame snowballed. Two more records, Llegando los Monos (Here Come the Monkeys) and After Chabon, were released in the following two years. Yet, while Sumo had this artistic freedom and Argentina had regained its liberty, Prodan’s alcoholism worsened. He was carrying a bottle of gin with him everywhere.La Rubia Tarada by Sumo, from album Divididos por la Felicidad“We tried to get Luca clean,” says McKern. “But you always had this feeling that this was going to end. In the beginning, Luca directed everything – all the music. In the final recordings, the band more or less presented him with the music, and asked him to sing on it.”In 1987, Prodan told a radio journalist that he expected to die soon. And just before Christmas, on 22 December, days after what would turn out to be Sumo’s final show, Luca was found dead at his home in Buenos Aires’ San Telmo neighbourhood, having suffered a heart attack. Sumo split into two bands, Divididos and Las Pelotas (the Bollocks), who became important for Argentina’srock nacionalin their own right.“He was bigger than life,” says Nuttal. Lanzani agrees: “We hope to get to the soul, the essence of Luca,” he says. He wants the biopic, which is still being filmed, to bring belated international exposure to Prodan. A documentary is also in the works by Italian film-maker and journalist Luca Lancise, to be released next year.But whether or not international awareness grows, Prodan will always be a hero in Argentina. “In only six years, Argentina accepted him as one of its own,” says Andrea. “I think about it every day. He had the strength to break into the Argentine myth machine. And he got in there – alongside Maradona and Evita Perón.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockArgentinaIndieBiopicsActivismPunkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So they left this life together’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 16 Apr 2025 07.56 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 14.02 EDTShareThis is a photo of my parents right after their deaths, in Assen, theNetherlands, on 1 May 2024. My father Klaas Roemers was 90, my mother Fenny Roemers-Visser was 86.They had a good life and a very happy marriage, but the last years were difficult. They were both sick and exhausted. Both had heart failure, my mother had a lot of pain. Both were in a really bad shape. They still lived in their own house but life was getting harder and harder, even with help. They did not want to go to a nursing home and neither wanted to live without the other – they wanted to step out of life together. They were afraid one would die naturally and the other would be left behind. They were very close, and did everything together, really everything – so it made sense they would leave this life together.My father was visibly enjoying his last dinner – that was goodIn the Netherlands, whereassisted dyingis legal, this is possible if you have a very good reason. My mother always said: ”We will stay with you as long as we can, until we can see no other way out.” Physicians have to be convinced that the patient is suffering unbearably and has no chance of recovery. My parents were independently evaluated by different doctors, and it was granted to both of them.It’s a very long process but once the decision was made, it all happened very fast. They picked a date, and it was a week later – much sooner than I had thought. My father wanted to go out to dinner somewhere, and on the last evening before they would die, we were able to do that. My father was a very optimistic and worry-free person who would always laugh at our jokes, until the end. He was visibly enjoying his dinner that evening – that was good.My parents were very involved with my work, and would come to my openings. This is an atypical portrait for me; I work on the boundary of documentary and art, photographing the changes in society. My current projectHomo Mobilisis about the intricate relationship between humans and their vehicles – I examine how mobility shapes our identities and societies. My parents were very much looking forward to the exhibition and book of this project. Sadly they will never see it. The presentation is at the end of this year.I had told them a few days before that I was thinking about making a portrait of them after they died, and that I might also bring it into the public space, and asked what they thought about it. They said immediately, yes, you should do it. I didn’t know at first what to do with it, as it is a very personal and private picture. This is the first time I have published it.All our family photographs were around them on the bed, at my mother's requestIn the Netherlands we are very liberal when it comes to assisted dying but in countries where it doesn’t work like that, I thought a photograph like this could be helpful, to illustrate what it means and to contribute to the debate. When I show it to friends they usually respond that it’s beautiful. I understand that, but I don’t see any beauty in it at all. For me it means loss. But I understand that reaction – if it wasn’t my parents perhaps I would see it that way too.This was a very sad event, but when people don’t want to live any more, I believe they should have the possibility to do this. My brother and I had the same feeling – we understood their decision and respected and accepted it. We did not try to stop them or delay it. From then on, we tried to make everything as comfortable as we could for them. I was with them as often as I could be, and importantly, I was able to say everything I wanted to say to them.“Duo euthanasia” is very rare. My brother, my wife and I were present in the room when it happened – our parents wanted us to be there. All our family photographs were around them on the bed, at my mother’s request. They lay on the bed, holding hands. The doctors gave them an injection to go to sleep, and after that the lethal injection. It is very strange and sad to see your parents lying there like that.I took several photographs. Strangely, at that moment, I acted as the professional that I am, making a composition, checking the light and so on. When I was done I looked at them for some time, kissed them each on the forehead and left the room.They died like they lived, hand in hand.Martin Roemers’ CVView image in fullscreenMartin Roemers.Photograph: Koos BreukelBorn:Oldehove, Netherlands, 1962Trained:AKI, Academy of Fine Arts, Enschede, NetherlandsInfluences:“Years ago, I was walking through Mumbai and enjoyed the chaos and hustle and bustle in that town – thousands of people who seemed not to be bothered by the noise, exhaust fumes and lack of personal space. I was wondering how to encapsulate all this energy and chaos in a single photograph. That was my first inspiration forMetropolis, my project about the world’s megacities. I can also be inspired by a conversation I have with someone, a book or a photo. My favourite photographer isAugust Sander, who in the early 20th century made a comprehensive photographic document of German people.”High point:“Having my work included in collections of museums and institutes around the world. I’m excited to present later this year my new bookHomo Mobilis, about the symbiotic relationship between individuals and their vehicles.”Low point:“I was a photography student when the Berlin Wall fell. I should have dropped everything and headed to Berlin, but I didn’t because of my part-time job. Although I made up for it later, it still frustrates me.”Top tip:“I see so many young photographers who work on projects about their own identity.

And its youthful cast are exceptionalLucy ManganWed 16 Apr 2025 16.35 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareTen-year-old Tanika (Kaydrah Walker-Wilkie) is encouraging her depressed older brother Tionne (Akins Subair) to get out of bed after their mother’s disappearance, lest social services notice something is wrong with the family and put them into care. “I’ll get adopted, because I’m young and pretty,” she says gently. “They’ll keep you in a home because you look like you’ve got problems.” Baby sisters – always keeping it real.The BBC’s new six-part comedy drama Just Act Normal is the creation of Janice Okoh, based on her 2011 play Three Birds. With their mother gone, the children are trying to fly under the radar of the authorities until the oldest, Tiana (Chenée Taylor), turns 18 and can officially look after them all. So far, the optimism and energy of youth has seen them – or at least the girls – through, and they are keeping Tionne braced between them. While Tanika gives pep talks, Tiana and her best friend, Shanice (Kelise Gordon-Harrison), are out stealing him the live chicken he apparently needs for an experiment.Once her poultry duties are discharged, Tiana must deal with the daily grind of meeting all the other domestic responsibilities that an eldest female sibling is heir to: breakfast; bills; barricading the door against her mother’s drug dealer, Dr Feelgood (Sam Buchanan), who is owed £200; and so on. Plus, she has to go to college, tout for business as a mobile manicurist, do her job as a cleaner (where she is stiffed on minimum wage because she needs to work cash-in-hand), cope with Shanice’s excesses (“I feel like I’ve been manifesting for two lately,” complains her friend) and perhaps also embark on a new romance with Jamie (Adam Little), whose potential has Shanice – and indeed us all – squealing in approval.But from the off – despite the comedy that runs from chicken-based slapstick to Tanika’s mordant wit, via Tiana’s teenage ability to find a laugh or snark in everything – there is the sense of tragedy pulsing at the heart of the children’s story. There is a creeping dread, once we know the truth of their mother’s absence, working its way through every scene as the net starts to close around them and their misery becomes more palpable. When Tionne’s mood briefly lifts after he gets a girlfriend (he has the chicken to thank for this, too), you want to stand up and cheer – and also sacrifice the bird if it would ensure a permanent happy ending for all the siblings.But danger lurks on every side. Not least from Tanika’s needy, overeager and overfond teacher, Miss Jenkins (Romola Garai), whose emotional maturity is several degrees lower than her charge’s but who nevertheless fills something of the maternal void in Tanika’s life in a way that is quite heartbreaking to watch. Indicative of the show’s endless subtleties and layered complexities, at one point the headteacher, Mrs Kitley (Penelope Freeman), tells Miss Jenkins that the phrase “inappropriate relationship” is not solely the preserve of “paedophiles and gym knickers”. Just Act Normal is very good at suddenly twisting the viewfinder.At home, Dr Feelgood moves in after his own mum throws him out. The sweetness of his and Tanika’s growing attachment to one another – while Tionne’s resentment of the man he blames for their situation festers away – is equally pulverising to the viewer, who by this point is prepared to storm the barricades to make sure these kids are not torn asunder by the state.The publicity material accompanying Just Act Normal describes it as “a celebration” of Black, working-class Birmingham life. Which would be true if the word didn’t carry a suggestion of artificial cheer and selection when what it feels most like is an authentic and unapologetic representation of the family’s life in the round. It incorporates racial differences (from Miss Jenkins’ stumbling over the children’s names, to Shanice’s joke about kissing white boy Jamie), mental health issues, class inequities (from Tiana’s careful tracking of every pound earned and spent, to Shanice – child of a rich and generous dad – not understanding what it is to live on an economic knife-edge, to the children sitting on a park bench and dreaming of living in one of the very ordinary houses on the edge of their estate). It rejects the notion that any person is just one thing and never another – Dr Feelgood is a refuge for Tanika; the children’s absent father is not evil or abusive, just “shit” and rueful – and much more.It is also, within each episode and over the entire series, beautifully structured and holds its many strands in perfect tension. Okoh’s work is done full justice by three extraordinary young actors – we are surely watching stars being born – and just as strong a supporting cast. It is altogether a wonderful thing.Just Act Normal aired on BBC3 and is available on iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

But not a unique one – Brine has made 21 such confections as part of his Living Record Collection project, which now brings These Are the Contents of My Head (TheAnnie LennoxShow) to Soho. If I found this one less remarkable an achievement, the feeling was offset by admiration that Brine’s Smiths show was clearly no fluke; that he’s created a striking and confident collage-cabaret genre all of his own.Maybethat last oneworked so well because Frankenstein described the form as well as the content. The fit is less neat here, as our drag-queen host splicesAnnie Lennox’s album Diva, a recording of Judy Garland at Carnegie Hall,Kate Chopin’s feminist novel The Awakeningand (I’m almost done …) tales from his own mother’s failed marriage. In this telling, both the novel’s heroine and Brine’s mum are women struggling to free themselves from marriage and societal convention. Tripping in and out of song, family anecdote and scenes from Chopin’s southern gothic, with additional characters played by scene-stealing pianist Ben Langhorst, Brine’s gumbo doesn’t stint on rich ingredients.The results can feel overcooked, the individual flavours hard to distinguish. In a show that trucks exclusively in big emotion, Brine’s mother’s experience (and his own, navigating his parents’ divorce and coming out) is rendered every bit as melodramatic as Edna Pontellier’s. The songs of Lennox and Garland sometimes illuminate those stories, and sometimes don’t. But they’re always delivered with limpid loveliness by our host, or with hella pizzazz should the moment require.That roof-raising voice of his, not to mention the sexual frankness, as Brine drapes himself over this audience member or that, may not be the perfect match for Chopin’s tale of clipped and frustrated womanhood. But why quibble, when it’s easier to be swept along by the bravura of the enterprise, a lush hymn to dreams of freedom and a feat of idiosyncratic connection-making to put Adam Curtis in the shade.Salty Brine: These Are The Contents of My Head (The Annie Lennox Show) is atSoho theatre, London, until 26 AprilExplore more on these topicsCabaretDragComedySoho theatreAnnie LennoxTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The implicit argument is that placing Thiebaud into a personal canon of artistic mentors and influences doesn’t diminish him but actually makes him better than ever before.“Thiebaud was a self-described ‘art thief’,” the show’s curator, Timothy A Burgard, told me as we walked through the exhibition together. “And I am a curator-detective, pursuing a thief.” For Burgard, the show was a complete no-brainer. Long a Thiebaud scholar, he spent months compiling a PowerPoint outlining many of the artist’s major works, along with their possible artistic antecedents, and one day sent it over to his director at the Legion of Honor for consideration. Within an hour he had a green light. “I think that’s the fastest I’ve ever seen a museum director approve a show,” Burgard told me.View image in fullscreenSupper at Emmaus, (after Rembrandt van Rijn), by Wayne Thiebaud.Photograph: Wayne Thiebaud FoundationThe list of influencer artists that Burgard has assembled is wide-ranging and fascinating. It includes fairly obvious choices, like Thiebaud’s good friend and fellow California artist Richard Diebenkorn, as well as old masters such as Rembrandt and Velázquez, modernists who at first blush may not seem like the best fits (among them Rothko, Joan Mitchell, and both Willem and Elaine de Kooning), and even an anonymous follower of the 19th-century landscape painter Thomas Hill.The show sets the tone up front with 35 Cent Masterworks, for which Thiebaud painted a shopping case of a dozen postcards of various masterpieces, each selling for 35 cents. Among the greats he pays tribute to here are Mondrian, Monet, De Chirico, Picasso, Degas and Cézanne. As well as being a kind of crib sheet to Thiebaud’s mentors, the work is also widely viewed as a critique of the commodification and consumerism that was then beginning to entrench itself in the art world. These are forces that Thiebaud’s work itself has become subject to, as the asking price for original works has shot up in the past decade.In addition to exhibiting the magnificent 35 Cent Masterworks and a stunning portrait of the artist’s wife, Betty Jean Thiebaud and Book, the show’s first gallery is packed with original works of art that Thiebaud collected, as well as copies that he made of masterpieces by the likes of Rembrandt, Frans Hals and Velázquez. This copying work helped Thiebaud figure out his own solutions to artistic problems. “To paraphrase, Thiebaud said: ‘I look to other artists for inspiration. I look to them for problem-solving,’” said Burgard. “‘Sometimes I’m having a problem with a painting, and I’ll go look at another artist to see what they did if they’re encountering a similar issue.’”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Photograph by Gary Sexton. Image courtesy of the Fine Arts Museums of San FranciscoAccording to Burgard, Thiebaud’s art collection decorated his home, while his copies were nested away in drawers, largely unseen until this show. Burgard speculated that as a young, impoverished artist, Thiebaud probably acquired his impressive collection through his longtime dealer, the art collector and gallerist Allan Stone. “Probably when the accounting was due from Allan Stone, he did something like a trade,” Burgard told me. “Stone knew a lot of the abstract expressionist artists and dealt a lot in William de Kooning, Franz Kline, Elaine de Kooning, all artists that are represented in Thiebaud’s collection. Otherwise, it would have been hard to acquire all this art, especially raising a family.”Moving past that opening gallery and through the show, Wayne Thiebaud:ArtComes from Art shows itself to be impressive in its size and range, showing aspects of Thiebaud not widely known. Yes, there are pies, vertiginous cityscapes and a delicious portrait of gumball machines, yet viewers also see Thiebaud doing a rendition of abstract expressionism, pastoral landscapes, nudes, still lifes, even a Kafkaesque electric chair. A intimate, late-career self-portrait that Thiebaud made in 2020, the year he turned 100, is poignantly titled One-Hundred-Year-Old Clown and shows an ageing, lonely Thiebaud saying his goodbyes to the art world. “When you walk through the show, all the series, the figures, the still lifes, the mountains, the [Sacramento] Delta paintings, the clowns, you can’t pin down any one subject or emotion or tenor or whatever,” said Burgard. “The thing he most wants you to do is just to feel them, to feel the paint, to feel the light.”View image in fullscreenWayne Thiebaud – Three Machines, 1963.Photograph: Wayne Thiebaud FoundationSpeaking of light, there is so much glorious negative space in these paintings, largely taken up by whites as thick and delicious as a wedding cake, ranging across so many subtle differences in hue and texture as to be an exhibition within an exhibition. “It’s a symphony of whites,” Burgard enthused again and again as we walked the show’s galleries, pointing out the radiant greens, yellows, blues and reds that Thiebaud subtly layered into the ostensibly “empty” space in his paintings, making his trademark halo effect. “It’s every single white known to humankind is practically how it feels,” Burgard said. “It’s a sea of white that you could fall into. If you tried to replicate it with a palette, it would take something like 100 colors. It’s one thing to do that many colors with a painting of a forest or something, but with just a woman in a bathtub. It’s absolutely magical.”As luscious and transporting as it can be just to bliss our over the surface effects that Thiebaud was able to conjure, Art Comes From Art encourages viewers to pore through the centuries of art history embedded into these works. “Thiebaud’s paintings are so sensual and so tempting to viewers that there’s a tendency to stop there on the surface and not dig deeper,” said Burgard. “Part of my job is to make more apparent the breadth and depth of our historical knowledge, our visual memory bank in these works. I think Thiebaud lets everyone in immediately on the surface, no matter who you are. And I hope that this show is a way of letting them understand that Thiebaud is deeper than that, he’s a thinking, feeling human being, and that it opens a window to art history.”Opening a window on to art history, and to the psyche of a great postmodernist, is key here. “I think he is really channeling those other artists while he’s working,” said Burgard. “I think that viewers walking through the exhibition are getting a chance to see Wayne Thiebaud think.” His hopes are that in leaning into the Californian’s artistic mindset, audiences will develop their own set of impressions, and draw their own conclusions about just what made Thiebaud’s artist brain tick. And if they disagree with the leaps and comparisons that Burgard has come to as curator, all the better. “I am making a case, and I am thrilled if somebody disagrees,” Burgard told me. “Because then they’re engaged. Then they win, the artist wins, we all win, because at that point they’re engaged. Apathy is the enemy of art.”Wayne Thiebaud: Art Comes from Art is on show at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco until 17 AugustExplore more on these topicsArtPaintingExhibitionsSan FranciscofeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Monday, Nikkei Asia reported on analysis from a major electronics supplier suggesting that the Nintendo Switch 2will be subject toTrump’s 145% tariff on goods imported to the US from China, despite his apparent decision to exempt smartphones and computers.This came after Nintendo announcedit would delayUS pre-orders on the console, “in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.” Meanwhile, the Guardian has reported onSony’s plans to increase the price of the PS5by 25% in the UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, citing “a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates.”The games industry is already struggling with the punishing economics of triple-A game development. The past two years has seen a slew of studio closures, mass layoffs and project cancellations; the traditional revenue model of premium priced games, sequels and downloadable content has been torn apart by the huge success of live service games such as Fortnite and Valorant, which are free to play and which generate revenue through cosmetic purchases (like fancy weapons skins and limited-edition costumes) and “battle pass” subscriptions.There is also controversy over the price of premium games. Nintendo’s decision to charge £74.99 and $79.99 for the Switch 2 launch game Mario Kart World is expected to set a new benchmark for other game publishers and has led to much handwringing. All eyes will be on the price of Grand Theft Auto VI when it launches later this year, with one reliable industry analyst, Matthew Ball of investment strategy firm Epyllion, predicting that other publisherswill follow suitif Rockstar opens the door to $80-$100 retail price points.View image in fullscreenGames like Grand Theft Auto VI and Mario Kart World may cost more than the going rate.Photograph: Rockstar GamesBeneath all of these epic financial tumults, however, is something much more important: the personal economic decisions all gamers make.PC Gamer recently reportedona Reddit threadwhere readers had discovered a little known feature of the dominant digital game store, Steam. By navigating to a section of the Help menu entitled “External funds used” you can see exactly how much you’ve spent on games since you started purchasing. The originator of the thread was in shock, realising they had spent $35,000. One member of PC Gamer’s staff discovered their total was $16,000 – “Oh god,” was their reported response.Here’s the thing: cost is relatively easy to calculate, but value isn’t – and value is what’s really important on an individual level. In the mid-90s, when people like me were buying imported games for the Neo-Geo and PC Engine consoles, we were paying between £80 and £120 for new titles – but then I got to play an arcade perfect version of R-Type in my own home, which was valuable tome. When I look at games in my collection, such as Minecraft, Mario Kart 8, Elden Ring and Call of Duty (sorry), I can’t even calculate how much joy they’ve brought me. We’re told these days to spend our moneyon experiences, not things, but video games awkwardly straddle those two concepts – they are consumer products that lead to stories and experiences that we couldn’t have predicted and that we can recall for years.It’s going to be sensible over the next few years to rethink our relationship with the mainstream games industry. To pick very carefully which triple-A titles we buy immediately at full price; to take a chance on a wider range of smaller independent titles that will offer very different experiences at much lower price points. Most open world titles are designed for many months of exploration, yet many players only see a fraction of the content laid out for them before they move on. In the past, when games were physical objects (remember manuals?), we had software clubs and games rentals; public libraries used to lend games. The industry hated all of these – but it survived.As a consumer and a player, I know I need to manage my own economy of fun. At times, that will mean divesting from the pipeline of big game and console purchases and speculating on more exotic markets such asItch.ioandPico8; it might mean retro gaming, going back to rinse old favourites. It’s OK to step off the treadmill. Sony and Nintendohaveto react to the whims of mad kings and markets, but we don’t. We can play a different game.What to playView image in fullscreenOriginal fun … Call of Duty WarzonePhotograph: ActivisionOK, I know, we usually like to highlight smaller indie titles and innovative newcomers in this section – but Call of Duty has always been my guiltiest of pleasures, so here we are.The new season of its Warzone battle royale mode brings back the game’s original Verdansk map, a sprawling killzone of high rise blocks, the legendary superstore and that old labyrinthine prison complex. A number of intricate changes have been made, but this feels like a return to what made Warzone interesting, in that it’s almost a survival game first and shooter second, with lots of exploring and looting between skirmishes.

The actor is in his New York home, preparing to talk about murder and manipulation, while listening out for signs that his wife, who is pregnant with twins, needs help getting their four-year-old son out of the door. She does; he excuses himself, and disappears for a few minutes. If Joe Goldberg, the serial killer Badgley portrays on the hitNetflix series Youis controlling, devoid of love and unable to form relationships, Badgley appears to have created a life that looks the opposite.His time as Goldberg – the role that has been his highest-profile after his big break on another hit series,Gossip Girl– is about to come to an end. The series’ fifth and final season is about to air, and after that, says Badgley with a smile, “I don’t have to speak about Joe Goldberg ever again, if I don’t want to,” before adding: “Of course, I’m sure I will.”Badgley was 30 when he took the role of Goldberg, the intellectual narcissist and obsessive, who stalks, captures and murders the women he claims to love. He will be 39 this year. “So my 30s have been officially defined by him,” he says. He had only recently married Domino Kirke, a singer and doula, and become stepfather to her son, when You began, then they had another son together around the same time the character became a father. “It’s possible that [Goldberg has] made me a better person because he’s caused a lot of reflection,” says Badgley. It was never meant to be a clinical portrait of a serial killer, he says. “Ultimately, the show is about misconceptions or modern myths about love and about masculinity. I’ve been reflecting on love and what that means, and what it means to be a man and a father and a husband, [while] all these things were starting to happen to me in real life as well.”It was inevitable, he says, that Goldberg “has been this exercise in understanding all the things I want to avoid”. He laughs and adds: “That’s kind of obvious to say, like, don’t kill, don’t manipulate, don’t be a predator. But what I’ve had to do is try to understand, in some manner, where these things come from. I’ve found similarities, and had to understand how it could have been possible for me to end up that way, rather than the way that I am.”View image in fullscreen‘Why do we make heroes of evil people?’ … Badgley as Joe Goldberg in You.Photograph: NetflixBadgley seems immensely thoughtful and reflective, in a way that sounds horrendously earnest written down. But, in person, over the weird intimacy of Zoom, he has a lightness and a refreshing lack of mock irony. He was a child actor who went on to find huge success with Gossip Girl, the teen drama that ran from 2007 to 2012. His has been an extremely abnormal coming of age, but his interest in the awkward period of transformation that happens in adolescence is one reason he started, and co-hosts, his podcast,Podcrushed, in which celebrities explore their teen years.In his mid-20s, Badgley was feeling alienated by fame, and unfulfilled by his outward success. It led him to the Baha’í faith, which originated in Iran and parts of the Middle East in the 19th century, and espouses the unity of religions and humanity. “I try to understand the principles I’m living by better, so that I can convert what I’ve been working towards into some kind of service,” he says. “That’s why I’ve tried to deepen the conversations around Joe Goldberg – it’s trying to offer something of meaning. We all have some small part to play, and I’m just trying to convert this part I’ve been given into something that I can make meaningful.”He knows he’s an actor talking about an overblownNetflixshow, but this is where he finds himself, and what if he could make it more? It’s the reason he has spent years talking about male violence, gender equality, and trying to widen his industry’s view on sex scenes. (On his podcast in 2023, Badgley talked about his dislike of sex scenes and said he had asked the You showrunner, Sera Gamble, to reduce the ones he had to do.)“Sexual violence has been rampant for a long time, there’s inequality between the sexes, there’s a lot of reasons we should be concerned with sexuality and want to explore it far more meaningfully than we have, but a sex scene is not doing that,” he says now. “Usually it’s there to titillate, and to say: ‘Ah, the thing you’ve been waiting to see, it’s finally happening.’” And, even then, he adds: “It’s just not the way sex happens, the falling against the wall and grasping at each other’s clothes, all this stuff. There’s no time for condoms, there’s no time for conversation. There’s no time for awkwardness, for real connection. It’s a narrow and simplistic way that we have done it so far, and I’m just not interested in that.”View image in fullscreen‘There’s no way to get past the superficiality of this work’ … Badgley.Photograph: Benedict Evans/The GuardianIn the most recent series of You, Goldberg had moved to London to reinvent himself as an English professor, but developed a new fixation on a woman. If it highlights misogyny, violence and whatever version of masculinity Goldberg is supposed to have, it’s also somewhat schlocky. “It is always ultimately satirical and, wearing the garb of social commentary, it’s never meant to feel utterly real,” he says. “The ways it’s exploring its themes feel truthful and meaningful, but I don’t think the journey there is meant to feel real. We use camp and absurdity in a way that I think saves us and the viewer from, I don’t know, a more grisly exercise.”In the books by Caroline Kepnes, on which the series is based, Goldberg is far less likable. One of the criticisms the show has faced is that it glamorises stalking and violence against women, and their version of Goldberg – embodied by Badgley, a man who always looks slightly embarrassed by his own beauty – has shades of the romantic hero despite his obvious monstrousness. To make him as unpalatable as he is in the book would have been too much to sustain a TV show, says Badgley, but the ethics of that has, he says, “been my concern throughout the entirety of this series. Has he been too likable? I personally always struggled with that question. I’ve always wanted to make him less likable at every turn that is possible and plausible, and in this moment, I actually don’t know what to say about that.”Why do we make heroes of evil people? “That’s what I’ve been trying to understand,” says Badgley. “I think we all have to wonder how much value is there in exploring the darker side of human nature. I do think we need to explore the ‘light’ side, and I don’t mean light in a way that is thin or has less gravity.” The show is of its time, he says. “It’s a politically intensifying world, and I don’t think this show would make sense starting right now. It’s ending right now. The way this show plays with questions of how we reward bad people, that was a more playful question eight to 10 years ago. It’s not as playful a question now, and it comes with way more stakes, and I’m glad we’re not going to be playing with it any longer.” He gives a small laugh. “And for that reason, I’m really glad it’s ending.”He takes a long pause when I ask him about how he feels about the state of US politics. “I think it’s more important than ever to understand how the process of unification actually works, because we’re an incredibly divided, massive population splintering more and more into groups who feel they are competing or opposing each other, and I just don’t see that as sustainable. People want to make a lot of comparisons to the past, but we’ve never actually beenherebefore. I take that seriously, and for that reason, I’m being very measured.” He smiles. “Because I don’t think it’s a time when celebrities have a lot to add, that’s for sure.”When Badgley was a child – an only child – his family moved to the “middle of nowhere” in Washington state. “I was very isolated for a time.” Getting involved in local theatre gave him the community he craved. When his parents separated, he moved with his mother to Los Angeles. At the age of 12, he started working and never stopped. “I would certainly not recommend it to anybody,” he says of being a child actor in Hollywood. Looking back at the people he grew up and worked with, most, like him, had come from disintegrated families, drawn to Hollywood as “an opportunity to put a pause on the collapsing family dynamic, sort of have this escape, or this fantasy”. And, for the majority of young actors, a successful career is unlikely, so they also have to deal with a sense of failure at a young age. “There’s a lot of ways in which I think it’s objectively negative, in terms of the value system, for a kid to be growing up around.” If you do succeed, as Badgley did, “you’re succeeding despite your own delusions that it would work. It’s a very weird thing.”View image in fullscreen‘What was that show other than aesthetic? That was its thing, the way we all looked.’ Badgley (second right) with the cast of Gossip Girl.Photograph: Warner BrosAt 20, he was playing the role of Dan Humphrey in Gossip Girl (the shocking twist was that Humphrey, the Brooklyn outsider, was the secret blogger writing about Manhattan’s elite teens; fans have linked the creepy obsessiveness of Humphrey to the psychopathy of Goldberg). Badgley, wary of his loneliness from childhood, found fame isolating and alienating. “Extremely unnatural, just the way that people want to relate to you. It’s not a new idea that fame has all these nefarious dimensions to it. And in order to even appreciate or utilise the privileges that come with it, one has to really grapple with the ways in which it’s completely disabled parts of you or your life, or your relationship to others and society.” He doesn’t expect anyone to feel sorry for him, he says with a laugh, but he points out “the privileges and the sacrifices are both extreme and obscene, and so you have to take them both. In order to be a decent person, a good father and a husband, a good friend, a responsible colleague, I’ve been grappling with all the ways in which this stuff is just not a good way for somebody to live.”As a child, Badgley experienced what he calls “body dysmorphia” – not diagnosed by any doctor or psychologists, he adds. “I know that I hated my body and simply wanted a different one.” He had put on weight – overeating as a response, he thinks, to his parents’ divorce and social isolation, but idolised the men he watched in films, feeling that he should look like them, although “that just seemed like an impossibility”. Becoming an actor, where what you look like is scrutinised, brought extra pressures. “There was just a period where, coming out of depression and isolation, I was jumping wilfully into, but also being thrust into, this world where the more conventionally beautiful I seemed, the more successful I might be, the more value I might have. There’s no way to get past the superficiality of this work, and if you recognise that, you can’t help but recognise the superficiality of our culture, because of the way it rewards this work.”With Gossip Girl in particular, a show about rich teens growing up in the Upper East Side: “What was that show other than aesthetic? That was its thing, the way we all looked.” It was huge for Badgley’s career, but, he says: “I didn’t particularly love the superficial celebrity aspect of the way I was perceived.” By his mid-20s, he realised that success, money and celebrity were not going to sustain him.For a while, he had considered leaving acting. Instead, he sought spirituality – and the Baha’í faith. “That is what allowed me to persevere through the disillusionment, all the things I’d been grappling with, and then come back to it all, but with hopefully some kind of inner transformation.” He says he prays and meditates every day, which has helped him maintain his sanity, along with “the simple stuff of life, like having a family, meaningful relationships with my friends”.Approaching his 40s, with twins on the way, as well as a book in the autumn (and a production company whose projects so far will not feature him as an actor), Badgley seems more than ready to purge himself of Goldberg. Filming the final scenes at about 2am, Badgley found it was something of an expulsion. Over the years, he has felt Goldberg’s rage in his body, particularly in the muscles of his neck. On that night shoot, he found he couldn’t perform, and had a strange feeling of having to cough or vomit up the words. “It was as though I couldn’t sustain the rage any more, couldn’t sustain the levels of artifice with him, just all of it.” He can’t say what happens to Goldberg, if there is justice even. Is it good enough (bad enough)? “Nothing is really good enough. There’s levels to it; it’s not just like: does he die? Does he go to jail? Is he tortured? Does he live and is he miserable alone? It’s really about how we get there.” He thinks, he says, that “we reached truly the best resolution for him”. And there, I think Badgley feels, he should stay.The final season of You premieres on Netflix on 24 AprilExplore more on these topicsTelevisionNetflixYoung peopleDramainterviewsShareReuse this content"

How did that go?Alexis Petridis, chief rock and pop criticOne day in the car I just listened to nothing instead of facing it again. When it plays me songs I like, it’s not what I want to hear at that moment. That’s not to say the music it was recommending wasn’t good. One morning it played Schizophrenia by Sonic Youth. I love that song but I didn’t want to hear it then. It played me Billie Holiday’s Riffin’ the Scotch followed by My Bloody Valentine, which clearly demonstratesthe great breadthof my music taste – but just because I like it all doesn’t mean I want to hear it all together. I didn’t like that it was untouched by human hands. I always think that the amazing thing about a record collection is that it doesn’t make sense to anybody other than you. And yet when it’s presented like that, I find it really jarring and difficult – it’s all over the place.LSThe algorithm is straining to find the data points that connect all those things, to close the net and make it coherent when it’s not.Mood Machine by Liz Pelly review – a savage indictment of SpotifyRead moreAPThe first one I tried had an AI DJ that kept saying “Ga-lax-ie 500”, which sounds like a laxative. I wonder how much of this is to do with my age and these things not having always been in my life, but I find it inherently creepy, both the AI voice and the narrow recommendations based on your own taste. I read enough science fiction in my teens to know that this is very much the thin edge of the wedge – one minute it’s all matey “would you like to listen to Galaxie 500?”, the next humanity’s enslaved, living underground mining uranium for a robot. There are generated playlists that are meant to be generically adjacent to the time of day you listen to it: “Wednesday Shoegaze.” Why? Then you have “70s rock hippie afternoon”, featuring a lot of music that isn’t from the 1970s. There’s I Am Waiting by the Rolling Stones, which is from 1965. Expecting to Fly by Buffalo Springfield is from 1967. Eight Miles High by the Byrds is from 1966. How do you generally use Spotify?LSI have mp3s of anything I care about. I pay for Spotify but I try to spend as much or more on Bandcamp or whatever every month, like carbon-offsetting. To some degree, you and I need to have Spotify, like a film critic needs Netflix. But also, artists don’t earn anything from me playing their mp3s; if I stream music I already own on Spotify, they’re at least getting fractions of a penny and the listener data they need to operate in that ecosystem. And I don’t have to listen to ads. How about you?APOrdinarily my listening isn’t centred on Spotify. I use YouTube more for work. I listen to a lot of physical records. Did you listen to a lot of different stuff as a result of not using Spotify for a week?LSSort of. I subscribe to a lot of music newsletters and inevitably open 20 Bandcamp links a week and shut 15 without listening to them, because there’s only so much time. But this week I went through most of them and really lovedan album by a Swedish composer called Hugo Randulv. I generally only use Spotify as a discovery tool to listen to albums I’ve never heard before that I’ve seen recommended elsewhere or to play old favourites out and about. The only time I cheated was when I ran out of fun music mid-run and put Doechii’s last mixtape on, but I bought it when I got home. I never use their playlists. I stopped checking my Discover Weekly because it often recommends things that would be logical for me to like, but I’ve already decided that I don’t. But that doesn’t compute with their algorithmic concept that one of these things is just like the other.APThat’s the thing – however good the algorithm is, there’s something about human taste that it can’t quite replicate. Let’s look at my “made for you”. I never usually browse this. Here’s my “reggae mix” … featuring folk legends Shirley and Dolly Collins.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus of Boygenius, pictured with Taylor Swift pictured at the 2024 Grammy awards.Photograph: David Swanson/ReutersLSWow. With playlists like “70s hippie afternoon”, it’s like their made-up Spotify Wrapped “genres”, where they’re named a) to mimic the language of memes, and b) as a reduction of music down to “vibes”, stripping away historical context. This might be getting a bit Adbusters, but I think the temporal playlists are also about syncing with consumer habits. Your “get ready with me” playlist, a “main character energy” walk to Starbucks. And the “coffee shop” vibe is so prevailing, it’s ended up dictating the types of music that get signed: you get more pop-ready, front-facing songwriters such as Phoebe Bridgers and Julien Baker on indie labels – they’re obviously great but they’re also products that work well in that ecosystem.APThe guy from the label Secretly Group says in the book that they couldn’t sign the experimental band Oneida now. It’s a really good example of how the competition markers of pop have been brought to bear on all types of music because of Spotify. It’s forcing everybody into competition with Ed Sheeran and Sabrina Carpenter, and that’s not always your motivation for starting a band or making music. It helps you get on in that world if you look like Sam Fender.LSIt can get even more granular. A lot of what I listen to on there is drone, the sound of one organ key being held down for half an hour. But Spotify’s idea of ambient is closer to what they call“perfect fit content” (PFC), as Liz Pelly found outin her book Mood Machine, where they commission muzak-style farms to produce chilled-out music to fit lean-back, mood-based playlists and allegedly pay a lower royalty rate than they do to traditional record labels. Filling playlists with that counts out the artists really invested in those sounds and disciplines who might otherwise stand a chance of making a living from them – there are examples of those playlists being overhauled and musicians losing out on money they had been earning. You found that several jazz playlists seemed to have next to no “real” artists on them.APThe jazz thing is the ultimate extension of that. On one level, yes, Spotify is giving work to the jazz musicians who produce PFC, and it’s hard to get work as a jazz musician. On the other hand, look at Ezra Collective. They’re playing Wembley. This is what can happen when listeners are exposed to something exciting and underground. A jazz playlist full of music apparently commissioned for the purpose is actively stopping listeners from being exposed to that sort of thing. Do you ever discover things from Spotify?LSDefinitely. I try not to let autoplay run after an album ends, but it has led me to good stuff. Sometimes its persistence has made me change my mind about something. I didn’t get Astrid Sonne at first, but I listened to so much Clarissa Connelly – they went to the same experimental Danish music school – that it kept feeding me her, and it clicked. Thinking of massive tech companies, with, say, Amazon, I think most people are aware of the moral conflict in using it – the conditions that packers and delivery drivers work in. Do you think there’s that same sense of compunction about what Spotify is doing to artists?APNo. I think there’s a vague sense that you don’t get paid very well, but the really big stars – the most visible artists – are doing all right.Kate Nash is doing OnlyFansto make money and it’s come tosomethingif you’ve got to do that to keep your career afloat. But in the broader scheme of things, most people see Sabrina Carpenter or the Weeknd and they’re doing really well. So I think there’s a disconnect in people’s minds about this notion that artists aren’t being correctly remunerated by Spotify.LSIt infuriates me that they’ve alsodemonetised any songs with fewer than 1,000 plays.Pay to get playlisted? The accusations against Spotify’s Discovery ModeRead moreAPAnohni makes a very good point in the book that a record can be really impactful but you only have to listen to it twice. There’s loads of music I like, such as extreme electronics, that I’m not going to listen to over and over again.LSI thought the only naive part of the book was the ending, which looks at potential alternatives to streaming. Pelly highlights public libraries in the US that have streaming platforms for local musicians. It’s a lovely idea but with the best will in the world it’s not the same thing. I think we’ve seen a lot of larger-scale alternatives collapse.APRight – who’s still talking about Tidal? It seemed to me to be completely unworkable, though I appreciate her trying to put a positive spin on it – “there is another way” – but I don’t think there is.LSI think the most likely outcome is that Spotify will move on from music to a different product, and other solutions will have to be found. It’s one reason I’ve never got rid of my mp3s, because this could all disappear too.Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist by Liz Pelly is published by Hodder & Stoughton (£22).

A few clicks of a form and a bunch of new books , selected by talented curators, turn up at your door – often with collectible perks such as special cover designs and art. In a world saturated by choice and trends, not only is the choosing done for you, but you’ll often have a less conventional, better rounded and precious bookshelf collection to show for it.This is presumably why there’s a strong appetite for such services: UK fantasy subscription box FairyLoot has 569,000 followers on Instagram alone, and many bookshops have started sending out their own boxes.Now, some of these businesses have decided not just to sell books, but to publish their own: In January, FairyLoot announced a collaboration with Transworld, a division of Penguin Random House, while last week Canada-based subscription service OwlCrate launched OwlCrate Press.Jordan Fleming, head of publishing at OwlCrate, has described publishing as a “broken industry”,telling industry magazine the Booksellerthat the publishing wing had been set up to “eventually address a lot of the issues the industry is facing”.Which issues they’re seeking to address is unclear. It’s fair to see where they could influence things – they have an understanding of their subscribers and can cater to that market well as a result. But curating is not the same as publishing; quality and influence are two different things. Could this mark a potentially monumental shift in the industry?“Book boxes and book subscription services are hugely valuable to publishers,” says Jon Petre, an editor at Profile Books. “Books can get a significant guaranteed sale on publication day through them … A big order of instant sales can land an author straight on the bestseller list. Even if it’s just for a week, the author will be Sunday Times-bestselling for the rest of their career.” Petre says.Hariny Vanniarajan, who is signed up to subscription service Illumicrate, feels that the books she receives in the box are “representative of marginalised voices that we don’t often find in mainstream publishing.”“As a south Indian, I truly enjoy the great variety of authors and cultures I’m being introduced to,” she says. “These are books I normally might not have picked up because I wouldn’t have known about them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The US-based authors say they have “cultivated a huge fanbase” in the UK specifically through editions sold by FairyLoot.It makes sense, then, that subscription services want to push their curation skills further, by commissioning, editing, and publishing titles that aren’t already in the world. They have a guaranteed customer base, a strong sense of the titles that work for them and the ability to create exclusive editions. It’s a pretty powerful sales pitch to any bidding writer.“In a market where customers are spending more money on fewer books, a guaranteed sale can be the difference between making a loss or breaking even for a debut author.” Petre says. Given thatbook ownership is also in decline, there are plenty of reasons to see such businesses as a stable alternative in a choppy industry. Those who do spend on books often “crave a gorgeous physical edition to hold in their hands and display on their shelves,” Elizabeth and Helen say.From beer to books: 16 subscription services to save you time and moneyRead moreWhile you can argue that putting a book you’ve commissioned and published into the hands of a dedicated audience isn’t any more of a bestseller manipulation than choosing a book that already exists, there’s a point to make about the magic and purity of a subscription service being lost by such a move.You can consider this pivot an equivalent of Netflix or Mubi launching original works instead of merely curating them. Has that been a success? Not entirely. While they present new opportunities for individuals, they also present monopolies at large. As with all things art, it’s subjective: Vanniarajan says she wouldn’t necessarily be put off if Illumicrate started putting books it had published itself in her box. “They have built a huge following and seem to understand their audience well, so I assume they’d continue this integrity when choosing authors to work with,” she says.But if you’re after an expert’s recommendations to bolster and surprise your library, as opposed to a powerhouse choosing titles for you, consider supporting a local bookshop’s services instead.Explore more on these topicsBooksPublishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hackman is believed to have died about a week later of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer’s disease.The partly mummified remains of Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, were found in their Santa Fe home on 26 February, when maintenance and security workers alerted police.According to the newly released report, a review of Arakawa’s computer showed she was actively researching medical conditions related to Covid-19 and flu-like symptoms between 8 February and the morning of 12 February. The searches included questions about whether Covid-19 could cause dizziness or nosebleeds.She also had mentioned in an email to her massage therapist that Hackman had woken up on 11 February with flu or cold-like symptoms but that a Covid-19 test was negative and she would have to reschedule her appointment for the next day “out of an abundance of caution”.Arakawa’s search history also showed a query for a concierge medical service in Santa Fe on the morning of 12 February. A review of her phone records by investigators showed she had a call with the service that lasted less than two minutes and missed a return call later that afternoon. Investigators also reviewed a call history to Hackman’s home phone along with voicemails and security footage from stores that Arakawa had visited on 11 February.Authorities also released more redacted police body camera footage from inside the home as sheriff’s deputies and investigators tried to piece together what had happened to the couple. Investigators found one of the couple’s dogs sitting in the bathroom near Arakawa’s body. The officers then walked around the house to where they said Hackman was found dead.“Two totally separate areas of the house,” an officer comments in the footage. “Mhm, it’s strange,” another responds. The officers, worried about a possible gas leak, then begin opening doors and windows around the house. Subsequent testing showed there were no leaks.The footage shows them going through rooms of the home and finding nothing out of the ordinary and no signs of forced entry, with the couple’s art collection still adorning shelves and walls throughout. The investigators can also be seen counting cash that was found around the home and looking at the prescription medication on the bathroom counter as one of the couple’s dogs barked in the background.The footage, photos and reports are being released with redactions as the result of a recent court order that mandated any depictions of the deceased couple would have to be blocked from view. All photos, video and documents from the investigation had been restricted from release by an earlier, temporary court order. The Hackman estate and family members had sought to keep the records sealed to protect the family’s constitutional right to privacy.A report by the New Mexico Department of Healthshowed an environmental assessment of the Hackman property found rodent faeces in several outbuildings and live traps on the property. The inside of the home was clean, with no evidence of rodent activity. Nestled among the piñon and juniper-covered hills overlooking Santa Fe, the Hackman home is not unlike others in the area as mice are common in the area.One of the couple’s three dogs was also found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs were found alive. A state veterinary lab tied the dog’s death to dehydration and starvation.An attorney for the estate, Kurt Sommer,argued during a hearing last monththat the couple had taken great pains to stay out of the spotlight during their lifetimes and that the right to control the use of their names and likenesses should extend to their estate in death. The Associated Press, CBS News and CBS Studios intervened in the matter, saying in court filings that they would not disseminate images of the couple’s bodies and would blur images to obscure them from other records.Explore more on these topicsFilmGene HackmanNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

Addressing the audience, which included Brin and Zuckerberg as well as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Rogen appeared to refer to Elon Musk (who was not present) by saying: “It’s amazing that others [who have been] in this room underwrote electing a man who, in the last week, single-handedly destroyed all of American science.”The Hollywood Reporter said that Rogen added: “It’s amazing how much good science you can destroy with $320m and RFK Jr, very fast.”However the remark was not included in the “full” 99-minute film of the event that the Breakthrough prize posted on YouTube and on its own website.In a statement to the Hollywood Reporter, the Breakthrough prize foundation said: “This year’s ceremony lasted longer than the prior few years, and several edits were made in order to meet the originally planned run time.”Trump’s assault on the US science establishment has been unrelenting, resulting inan open letter signed by 1,900 prominent scientistsin March, condemning the Trump administration’s threats to universities, federal grants and funding, and triggering mass layoffs, resignations and censorship.Musk supported Trump’s re-election campaignwith nearly $300m, and subsequently became a “special government employee” with the remit to gut government agencies to save money. Robert Kennedy Jr, one of the US’s most prominent vaccine skeptics, was appointed health secretary in February and, among other controversies, has beenaccused of giving Americans “false hope”that the cause of autism would be discovered before the end of 2025.Zuckerberg, Bezos and Altmanalso donated $1m eachto Trump’s inauguration committee.Explore more on these topicsFilmSeth RogenAwards and prizesDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

They have nothing but admiration for him and wish him the very best for his future.”The Who’sRoger Daltreyis a patron of TCT and until 2024 acted as curator for their annual gig series at the London venue.But areview of the band’s March gig in the Metrosuggested that Daltrey was complaining onstage about Starkey’s performance.It said that the frontman paused their final song, The Song Is Over, and told the audience: “To sing that song I do need to hear the key, and I can’t. All I’ve got is drums going boom, boom, boom. I can’t sing to that. I’m sorry guys.”Starkey, son of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and Maureen Starkey, appeared aware that the news was coming – and not on the warm terms shared by the Who’s representative – when he shared a tongue-in-cheek post on Instagram this weekend.Beneath a photo of himself and Daltrey, Starkey wrote in all caps: “Heard today from inside source that Toger Daktrey [sic] lead singer and principal songwriter of the group unhappy with Zak the drummer’s performance at the Albert Hall a few weeks ago is bringing formal charges of overplaying and is literally going to Zak the drummer.”‘It ain’t over till one of us is gone’: the pop stars who refuse to bury the hatchetRead moreStarkey joined the band full time during their 1996 Quadrophenia tour. He was introduced to drumming by the Who’s original drummer, Keith Moon, a family friend who gave him a drum kit for his eighth birthday.Starkey has also played with Oasis – although the lineup for the band’s upcoming reunion tour is yet to be officially announced – Johnny Marr, the Lightning Seeds, Sly and Robbie, and his father.He performs in the recently formed supergroup Mantra of the Cosmos, also featuring Shaun Ryder and Bez of the Happy Mondays and Black Grape, and Andy Bell of Oasis and Ride.Explore more on these topicsThe WhoPop and rockRoger DaltreynewsShareReuse this content"

I am quite shameless. Yours ever, Bram Stoker.”View image in fullscreenBram Stoker.Photograph: AlamyOliver Bayliss, of Bayliss Rare Books in London,who sold the letter, said the note was personal, informal and revealing. Stoker was better known for his reserved and professional tone in the few letters that have survived but this one suggested an awareness of his book’s gothic extravagance and, perhaps, a playful pride in its dark theatricality. Bayliss said letters by Stoker were rare and ones in which he mentioned Dracula by name virtually unheard of.“Less than a handful are known to exist, and those are typically formal acknowledgments. By contrast, this letter is informal, insightful, and dated just weeks after the book’s publication, making it one of the earliest and most candid authorial commentaries on the now-legendary novel.“This letter gives us something we’ve never really had before: Stoker’s own voice, responding to Dracula around the moment it entered the world – not as an icon of horror, but as a new, uncertain work.“Stoker’s humorous aside, ‘Lord forgive me. I am quite shameless’ has the ring of an artist knowingly pushing the boundaries of the gothic and enjoying it. It’s theatrical, cheeky, and utterly authentic. That tone simply doesn’t appear in his other known correspondence on the subject.”Bayliss said there was what could be another word – or just a squiggle – in the “shameless” sentence: “I struggled with that but from deep review and looking even with a magnifying glass, I think it is just a squiggle, a typo. However, it could be ‘now’ which makes the quote all the more potent.”Bayliss, who sells to institutions and private collectors, said: “Given the extraordinary rarity of this letter, it will have strong appeal to both. There’s also crossover with film and pop culture collectors, especially those with an eye on iconic 20th-century monsters.“I could also see investor interest. Dracula is one of the most sought-after first editions in rare book collecting, and a letter signed by Stoker, directly referencing the vampire and revealing his early thoughts on the novel, is essentially one in a billion.

Studied movements take on life; a living other emerges. Bad acting achieves no such uncanniness. Excessively self-conscious, the failing actor never dissolves into their role. We watch them watching themselves act.Although we rarely see her on stage, the actor narrating Audition, Katie Kitamura’s unnerving, desperately tense fifth novel, never stops watching herself perform. Even passing, offhand phrases seem to fray under the strain of an unsustainable self-awareness. “You might think that people wondered how we did it,” she says, describing the comfortable Manhattan lifestyle she shares with her husband. The perspectives are tortuous, unmanageable. Who is this “you” that might imagine their way into the opinions of unseen others? As the novel progresses, these gazes are experienced as social roles both longed for and resisted. “How many times had I been told how much it meant to some person or another, seeingsomeone who looked like meon stage or on screen,” she says, one of many moments in the novel in which ethnicity is both present and absent at once: acknowledged, but never explicitly named.The novel’s opening pages establish a nervy, fraught physicality. The narrator is meeting a man at a restaurant. She is anxious, hyper-vigilant. Narrowing her gaze to the terrain of the body, she invests even the solicitations of a waiter with portentous significance: “He inclined his head and held the door open, and because of that small courtesy – an invitation or injunction to enter – I went inside.”Waiting at the table is a young man, Xavier, self-assured and faintly discomfiting. The meeting is edgy and awkward, rendered in a tapestry of small gestures. Initially, we wonder if we are being subjected to the prose equivalent of bad acting: a surfeit of fussy movement, signifying nothing – an impression heightened by the stumbling gait of the narrator’s run-on sentences.But admirers of Kitamura’s previous novel,Intimacies, will recall the taut discipline of that book’s prose, and trust that, here, the language has been loosened by design. Sure enough, when the churn of movement and syntax is disrupted – appropriately, by the smallest of gestures – a deeper existential dread emerges. Xavier sits back, exhales. The narrator, with a sense of shock, recognises the movement as her own, “lifted from my films, my stage performances, and copied without shame. A piece of me, on the body of a stranger.” Xavier has studied her, she believes, then performed her back to herself.Later, Xavier repeats the movement, and a further layer of meaning is added. It is, we learn, a gesture the narrator has disowned, a tic she fell back on “when I did not know how to work my way out of a scene, when I was uncertain of what was happening with a character at a particular moment”.We see ourselves for what we are: actors on a bare stage, performing scenes without meaning, for an audience who were never thereXavier’s appropriated mannerism lays bare the artifice of the narrator’s performance, trapping her in her own self-consciousness. In doing so, it exposes in turn the artifice of her narration – of the veryactof narration. The tissue of internal coherence has been rent. Reality, fragile bothin terms of the narrator’s psyche and the novel’s self-reflective structure, cannot hold.Auditionis a novel of mirrored halves, angled towards an absent centre. In the first, Xavier tells the narrator that he believes himself to be her abandoned son – something she makes clear is impossible. In the second, heisher son, or, at least, he is willingly performing that role. In the first half, the narrator recalls with sadness her affairs, after a miscarriage. In the second, it is her husband who has strayed. It’s not so much a question of which is real; this is a novel about the suspension of disbelief necessary for life to be tolerable at all.Key to these coexisting realities is a mysterious central scene in the play the actor is to perform – the “black box” that changes the audience’s entire understanding of the character. In the novel’s first half, she is rehearsing it, and struggling. In the second, she has mastered it – the play is an unqualified success. This scene is never described. Instead, the narrator details what she finds within it: a realm of “infinite contingency”, “wholly private”, in which, briefly, she is able to locate a “single, unified self”.Critically, this enigmatic scene may not contain any meaning of its own. Much like the overused gesture appropriated by Xavier, it is revealed to be little more than a creative device, a strategy deployed in the face of uncertainty. Discussing it during a rehearsal, the narrator realises that the playwright has “no idea what she had written, no idea of how it would work in the play … the scene she had written was nothing more than a placeholder”. That the narrator finds such freedom, such self-coherence, suchsensein this scene only after she has discovered inside it no such sense or meaningis key to this novel’s deeply radical thesis. It is into the unwritten, into meaning’s absence, that we are free to project meaning of our own.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBy Audition’s end we are in the darkest black box of all: the catastrophe that results when the self’s illusory nature is laid bare. Just as the mirage of a character arises from the coherence of an actor’s gestures, so from the false coherence of the self arises the mirage we mistake for a world. When the self is unmasked as empty, the world it has projected collapses, and we see ourselves for what we are: actors on a bare stage, performing scenes without meaning, for an audience who were never there.Most novels shrink from the vertiginous depths of this absence; to accept it is to allow to disintegrate the basic precepts of the novelistic form: stability of character, dependability of meaning, linearity of event. Acutely aware of the very real trauma that attends the loosening of personhood, Audition nonetheless thrills at the freedoms made possible through collapse. The result is a literary performance of true uncanniness: one that, in a very real sense, takes on life.Audition by Katie Kitamura is published by Fern (£18.99).

It works best when the living legend is on stage, cheerfully and unselfconsciously performing just like it’s 1972 and regaling the whooping audience with his comments: “Steve Stills gave me this guitar – I wrote a lot of songs on this sucker!”; “I’m so happy I was here before AI was born!” He really is utterly open and unpretentious.But the movie itself tests the fanbase loyalty to the limits by being pointlessly and uninterestingly shot in arthouse black-and-white (though it exasperatingly bleeds out into colour over the closing credits) and by including an awful lot of material on the tour bus which is – how to put this? – not very interesting. Neil likes to ride up front with the driver, Jerry Don Borden by name, who becomes almost this film’s star. Bafflingly, Hannah uses a huge amount of tour bus footage from a locked-off camera position, not next to Neil, but at the driver’s seat right by Jerry, whose beaming face and steering wheel loom into the screen almost interminably. At one stage, we hear from him at some length on the subject of Howard Hughes, while Neil nods along, way in the background.Though Jerry Don Borden is undoubtedly a nice guy, he’s frankly not who we’ve come to see. The other vital aspect of Neil’s backstage/tour bus existence, and the personal story that this director is uniquely qualified to tell – namely, his and Hannah’s relationship – is more or less completely absent, because Hannah is behind the camera and can’t or won’t find a way to turn her camera on herself and her own part in Neil’s life. Yet it’s always good to witness Young’s authentic acoustic presence.Neil Young: Coastal is in cinemas on 17 April for one night only.Explore more on these topicsMusic documentaryNeil YoungDocumentary filmsDaryl HannahPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

But it is a big pile of random whimsy with very little coherent narrativeJack SealeWed 16 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Apr 2025 02.23 EDTShareIn the blurb promoting Government Cheese, Apple TV+ describes it as “surrealist”. It isn’t, but it does have plenty of what is becoming the streamer’s signature style. Is your dramedy quirky, kooky and kind of cartoony? Is it set mid-century in the US, away from the big cities, where humble but smarter-than-average folk arch deadpan eyebrows at unusual events? Yes? You’ve got a full-season commission! Don’t worry about an engaging premise or a coherent narrative – we just want those zany indie vibes.We are in the San Fernando valley, California, 1969. After a riot breaks out during a flood, a burglar and petty fraudster, Hampton Chambers (David Oyelowo), is released from prison, strolling back into his home town of Chatsworth in his one sharp suit, with the rolling, bouncing gait of a born huckster who has fatally high self-esteem. While incarcerated, he has invented a self-sharpening drill, the proceeds from which he hopes will aid him as he reconnects with his family and goes straight. But his neglected wife and sons are frosty and he needs to earn money faster than his supposed wonder tool can make it, so a return to criminality beckons – bringing with it all the lying and cheating that alienated his loved ones in the first place.Government Cheese looks beautiful: the cars, the dresses, the rotary telephones and chunky appliances, the hairstyles, the shoes and the panelled interiors. All are sumptuous, whipping us back to a time when objects were reassuringly weighty, the air was clear and hope for the future came in quarter-gallon cups. If you turn the sound off, the co-creator Paul Hunter, known for music videos and adverts, has nailed it.But, a little like Apple TV+ goofballs such asThe Big Door Prize,Physical,Palm RoyaleandHello Tomorrow!, Government Cheese lacks the storytelling substance to go with the attractive surfaces. It’s not even trying to go anywhere with purpose: it would rather just mosey eccentrically.There is a touch of Wes Anderson, a dollop ofI’m a Virgo’s Boots Riley and a whisper of the Coen brothers in the way characters greet reality with an angular insouciance. Hampton’s wife, Astoria (Simone Missick), has been left to run the household alone and has been the victim of some of her husband’s deceptions, but instead of receiving him with anger, she gives him a bemused, robotic smirk and pours herself another cocktail, mixed roughly in the glass. Their elder son, Harrison (Jahi Di’Allo Winston), is hostile, but his resentment is a caricature of late-teen grumpiness; in any case, he is more concerned with obtaining an eagle feather to service his interest in the local Indigenous Americans.View image in fullscreenEinstein (Evan Ellison) takes a leap of faith, watched by Harrison (Jahi Di’Allo Winston), Hampton (David Oyelowo) and Astoria (Simone Missick).Photograph: Michael Becker/AppleThen there is Hampton’s other son, Einstein (Evan Ellison), who greets his father’s return with the cheerful news that he has turned down offers to study at Harvard and MIT because he is dedicating himself to pole vaulting, which he pursues on the front lawn. “I’m going to break the world record!” he says, before once again arcing miles under the bar.Toss in a gang of bullying French-Canadian brothers who are intimidating in a left-field sort of way; Sunita Mani (Arthie from Glow) as a wise stranger who meets Hampton when she is stuck in a hatch (for several minutes, she is just a pair of legs); an unreliable partner in crime who convinces Hampton to help him rob a synagogue; and the fact that the town’s primary employer is Rocketcorp, a manufacturer of gleaming chrome gadgets for the space race, and you have a giant pile of random whimsy.The cast do nothing wrong, particularly Oyelowo. As the captain of this paper ship, he is exceptional, often telling the whole story – such as it is – with his facial expressions in closeup. He embodies the restless optimism of a man who refuses to accept the hand he has been dealt, instead using every situation as inspiration for a new scheme, which is guaranteed to be more outlandishly unwise than the last one. But Oyelowo can’t use his formidable skills to dig for a deeper meaning: with the drama always preferring a weird coincidence or exotic digression to a meaningful interaction between characters, there isn’t anything for him to find.The title refers to a processed cheese distributed by the US government since the second world war to feed poor people and which is mentioned in a line of dialogue. As she observes Hampton tinkering confidently with crude metalwork in the garage, Astoria recalls that he inherited his resourcefulness from his mother, who “made the best sandwiches out of nothing but government cheese and white bread”. The show could have benefited from a bit of old Mrs Chambers’s simple approach – as it is, it’s all garnish and no food.Government Cheese is on Apple TV+Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDavid OyelowoApple TV+reviewsShareReuse this content"

(When its trailer first dropped, online hordes were even convinced – wholly incorrectly – that its relatively low-budget world-building must be the product of generative AI tech.) But all of these non-AI techniques, as well as vivid location shooting in Romania, have been pulled together with an immense and immersive craft that could serve as an inspirational visual-effects demo reel for those jaded with CG gunk.The setting reflects a hybrid approach, too. The movie takes place on a fictional island of the Black Sea called Carpathia that exists somewhere between a centuries-old village and a more contemporary small town. (It accommodates both a wealth of natural forest and a brightly colored, well-stocked minimart.) Isolated from much of the world but not its instincts toward violence, Maxim (Willem Dafoe) trains a group of young boys, halfway between playing dress-up and serving in an actual militia, to hunt the Ochi, supposedly fearsome creatures who menace local farms. But when Yuri (Helena Zengel), Maxim’s withdrawn daughter, comes across a baby Ochi, she quickly realizes that, despite its prominent fangs and hissing, it’s not any more inherently dangerous than any number of animals (man included). In fact, this Ochi needs her help, and she sets out to return the creature to its family.In a movie of visual effects wonders, the Ochi puppet stands out; like Gizmo from Gremlins and Grogu from The Mandalorian, both clear reference points for the design, the baby Ochi represents an apex of engineered cuteness. The film-makers understand that this quality is only enhanced by allowing the creature some animal instincts; it’s adorable, but it’s got teeth. Yuri, then, makes a strong spiritual guardian to the Ochi; though she’s a quiet character, Zengel has a serious-faced unruliness about her that holds the screen – and makes her character a clear relation toEmily Watson, who turns up as Yuri’s estranged mother.The Legend of Ochi recalls some 80s sorta-classics in less flattering ways, too. For some adults rewatching mainstream or cult classics of the era such as The NeverEnding Story or Return to Oz, the sheer imagineering on display may no longer fully obscure the limitations of the human performances or, honestly, the tedium of the trundling, episodic storytelling style. (Return to Oz is a gorgeous movie that spends a solid 20 minutes dithering around in a cave for its climax.) The acting isn’t a problem in Ochi; it scarcely could be, with Dafoe and Watson on hand. But is it churlish to suggest that around the time it should be kicking into gear, with Yuri and the Ochi on their perilous journey through the wilderness, the movie gets a little … dull? Rather than building to an ET-like emotional crescendo, it loses momentum as it goes.Sinners review – Ryan Coogler’s deep-south gonzo horror down at the crossroadsRead moreThough it’s admirable that Saxon doesn’t attempt to stack the deck by anthropomorphizing the Ochi more than necessary, it also means that the emotional core of story stays slightly remote. Yuri and the creature are clearly attached to one another while lacking a signature locked-in emotional bonding scene. The closest moment is when Yuri realizes, with much glee, that she can communicate with the creature through birdcall-like sound, something she later learns that her mother has been studying, too.This should be a deeply touching moment of intergenerational, cross-species understanding. Yet it’s treated more as a technical triumph than a truly emotional one, and that’s true of the film as a whole. The soul of the movie isn’t particularly in the human/creature relationship at its center, but in the stunning craftsmanship that surrounds (and in the creature’s case, creates) them. If that makes the movie less of a high-water mark than a masterpiece like ET, it’s also an anomaly in a world where US children’s films are so intent on prodding and goading their audiences into predetermined reactions. Sometimes genuine awe is enough.The Legend of Ochi is released in New York and LA on 18 April and nationwide in the US and in the UK on 25 April, with an Australian date yet to be announced.Explore more on these topicsFamily filmsAction and adventure filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsWillem DafoeEmily WatsonArtificial intelligence (AI)reviewsShareReuse this content"

The awkward longing, the spots, the insecurity: it’s enough to cringe yourself into oblivion. For John Patrick McHugh, however, it is a rich seam to squeeze – not only for humour, but for a nuanced examination of burgeoning masculinity.John Masterson, the main character of McHugh’s debut novel, is in the limboland of a post-exams summer, playing football and hooking up with a slightly older colleague at the hotel where he has a part-time job. In this way, Fun and Games stalks the same emotional and geographical territory as McHugh’s 2021 short-story collection, Pure Gold, also set on an island off the Irish mainland in County Mayo, and also knee-deep in the turmoil of young lads, painted with tenderness and menace in equal measure.Here, though, we are pinned specifically in time, in the summer of 2009. It’s an age of pre-smartphone texts, with low-res images pinging from pocket to pocket. One image in particular has caused John no small share of distress. Prior to the events of the novel, his mother’s breasts “floated around the Island” – a wonderfully lyrical image to describe a sext gone wrong. John’s dad has moved out as a result, and John has acquired the nickname “Tits” from his male friends. I say friends, but the borders between amity and enmity are at the heart of the novel, particularly in the relationship between John and his supposed best friend, Studzy.It’s the male relationships that are most vivid: the complex bullying and reliance on each other, nuanced and knottyStudzy, John and a couple of other boys in his year have been accepted on to the island’s senior Gaelic football team. They find themselves among adult men, and their jostling to place themselves within the group as they move towards the championship forms one of two main threads to Fun and Games. The other is John’s relationship with his 19-year-old colleague, Amber. The pair have already begun a tentative sexual relationship, although the prospect of full intercourse is what motivates John to keep it going through the summer. “Sex was a league table,” the narrator tells us, and achieving victory is a toxic little engine that powers John’s motivations in a way that’s all the more shocking for being understated.John’s shifting feelings for Amber, and how they play into wider power dynamics in his life, form the emotional and dramatic core of the book. There are some deliciously agonising scenes of laboured texting and tension at the hotel as the lovers navigate the uncertainties of their relationship. But it’s the male relationships that are most vivid: the complex bullying and reliance on each other, nuanced and knotty. John’s mixed feelings for Studzy, who is more athletic, more outgoing, but less academic and, it is implied, poorer, raise questions of class. How does dominance in one kind of game stack up against the opportunities provided by wealth in the broader social arena? John feels protective of Studzy at the same time as being pushed around by him, a capricious balance of masculine forces that changes as their wider group teeter on a world beyond Leaving Cert results.When these elements come together, the novel excels. A particularly tense scene between John, Amber and a manipulative Studzy is a standout. It’s a shame, then, that the final third somewhat loses its nerve in challenging that central triangle, in favour of letting other narrative threads play out more or less as expected. Amber also at times comes across more as a vehicle for testing John’s desires and prejudices than as a rounded character in her own right. But McHugh layers John’s mind with care. For example, during a practice match in the July sun, we’re told that “the ball was rimmed violently, then blurred to a mauve colour, then hoary, and then it was that familiar white once more”. Later we learn of John’s interest in art history, his feeling for colour and light; a meeting of perspective and character that McHugh handles deftly.John’s way of seeing the world is shown to be sensitive, impressionable to others, challenged as our teenage protagonist faces the consequences of his actions. “Until someone gets hurt” may be the implied response to the novel’s title, and indeed there are pains aplenty in the agonies of John’s late adolescence. But in McHugh’s hands there is also warmth and sensitivity, and a skilful humour that sends up the rituals of a schoolboy’s final summer while shining light on the cruelty and vulnerability of young men.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

No, not me, but a big, beautiful hen harrier, scouting for love, or breakfast. I’ve only been here 10 minutes, and I’m in a mild state of shock. Aren’t these precious, threatened birds of prey so vanishingly rare that seeing one is hugely improbable?I’m walking with Sonja Ludwig, RSPB species and habitats officer for theForest of Bowland, andshe knows these harriers. “They’re ‘traditional’ birds,” she says. “They tend to come back to more or less the same place. We always see them here. Rookies always notice the males first. Their plumage, white rump and the black tips on the wings are unmistakable.”Map of Forest of BowlandHen harriers are sometimes nicknamed “grey ghosts” or “ghosts of the moor”. When I spot a second male above the moor top, I’m delighted. “Now you have to try to find the female,” says Ludwig.We scan some more and, remarkably, after just a few minutes, there she is, brown and white, all striations and streaks – and an owlish face when seen from the front.“I’ve got them well trained, haven’t I?” says Ludwig.View image in fullscreenA hen harrier in flight.Photograph: Andy Hay/RSPB/PAI won’t share a grid reference. Hen harriers – themost persecuted bird of preyin these islands – need peace and security, especially in spring, when they pair up, nest and rear chicks. The key point is, if you want to see them, they’re right here. As Ludwig puts it: “Bowland takes a bit of effort. Hillwalkers like it, but it’s not really the kind of place where you roll up in a car and light a portable barbecue by the roadside.”The Forest of Bowland intrigues me. I see it every morning from the kitchen, having relocated to an area just outside the national landscape (formerly known as an area of outstanding natural beauty) four years ago. I drive through it to get to Lancaster when the M6 is jammed, and sometimes motor along its edges en route to the Yorkshire Dales or Lake District, the two national parks on either side of Bowland. But I don’t go there often, and I’m not alone – it’s probably the most overlooked, bypassed rural landscape in the north of England. The Lakes get 18 million visitors a year, the Dales more than 6.5 million; Bowland doesn’t record visitor numbers, but historically it was in thetens of thousands– despite being just north of densely populated east Lancashire and close to Preston and Blackpool.What Bowland offers is not gushing beauty, photogenic peaks or well-trodden footpaths, but moments of wildness in a man-made landscapeThere’s something mysterious about this landscape. Formed by ancient seas, glaciation and erosion, and shaped by wet and windy weather, the Bowland Fells look like a cross between moorland and mountain massif. They are covered in heather and blanket bog, not particularly shapely, and the highest point, Ward’s Stone, is a mere 561 metres (1,841ft) above sea level. Pendle Hill, an outlier of the national landscape, is more handsome than any of the fells.Walking along the higher paths is a bit like being on a raised steppe, barren-looking and exposed to the elements. When artist Rob St John, who is developing a series of installations for the national landscape under the titleAre You Lost?, asked local people who didn’t routinely visit the area what they imagined it was like, their answers were often along the lines of “bleak”, “scary” and “cold”.Access is a challenge. The north-south Bentham to Chatburn road takes a highish line through agricultural areas. More dramatic – and trafficked – is the winding, diagonal road through the Trough of Bowland, the geological feature of the region that many know. Other roads skirt Bowland or suddenly peter out into motorbike/walking tracks, as happens with the Roman road between Slaidburn and Hornby. Parking is limited and bus services few – though thenumber 11 bus, launched a year ago, has been a huge success, connecting some of the most scenic spots with Clitheroe and Settle, which have railway stations.View image in fullscreenThe Marshaw Wyre near the Trough of Bowland.Photograph: Jon Sparks/AlamyIn September 2004, much of Bowland was opened up to walkers for the first time when the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 gave general right of access to the public to “access land” for the purposes of open-air recreation on foot. But people can only walk, run and – where permitted – ride bikes where there are paths. Many of Bowland’s upland areas are boggy and only the hardy, or foolhardy, would want to negotiate steep-sided cloughs (valleys) and slopes cloaked in knee-deep heather, riven by deep gullies.But limited access and smallish visitor numbers bring benefits for nature. A large central section of the 775 sq km (300 sq miles) of the national landscape is designated as a site of special scientific interest because of the habitats it protects and its internationally important bird populations, particularly the hen harrier and merlin. The latter is the UK’s smallest bird of prey, about the size of a thrush. I probably wouldn’t have spotted one during my visit if Ludwig didn’t know where to look. With binoculars, we could just identify a greyish dot seated – pointedly – on top of an old grouse butt.As spring rolls on, keen-eyed birders will see pied flycatcher, redstart, wood warbler, lapwing and rare black grouseAs I was focusing, another bird flashed across the valley where we were seated. It was a male peregrine falcon, apparently returning to a nesting area where a female was either incubating eggs or readying the site to lay them. I had never seen a peregrine before, though I had seen their food refuse in urban areas. To watch the fastest bird in the world – capable of 240mph during a hunting dive – slowing down to salute its mate was special.View image in fullscreenLimited visitor numbers bring benefits for nature, such as the merlin – the UK’s smallest bird of prey.Photograph: SMWPHOTO/Getty Images/iStockphotoWhile looking out for the birds of prey, I saw plenty of other species: meadow pipits, skylarks, curlews, a stonechat, a greylag goose. The star turn was a couple of ring ouzels – a red-listed (meaning “of high conservation concern”) member of the thrush family that dwells on the uplands. As spring rolls on, keen-eyed birders will see, in the reedbeds and on heathlands, pied flycatcher, redstart, wood warbler, lapwing and rare black grouse – plus common sandpiper and dipper down on the riverbanks. Bowland also supports a large colony of lesser black-backed gull, for which the UK is an internationally important territory.Parts of Bowland are used for driven grouse shooting between August and December. A divisive pastime, it arouses passions among conservationists. Every year raptors are illegally killed in areas where shoots are frequent, and in late 2024 one of Bowland’s female hen harriersdisappeared “in suspicious circumstances”, despite being fitted with a satellite tag. While Bowland has a long history as a hunting area – the ancient word “forest” refers to a royal hunting ground rather than tree cover – the grouse-hunting business began in the middle of the 19th century. It is the management of the fells for the rearing of the shooters’ targets – little red grouse, whose bubbling calls I heard often as we walked – that has shaped the Bowland we see today.View image in fullscreenSonja Ludwig, RSPB species and habitats officer for the Forest of Bowland.Photograph: Chris MossBut JMW Turner’ssketches of the Troughand other areas, from 1816 – pre-dating modern moorland management – show bare-topped fells and only a few native trees on the becks and lowest slopes. In fact, most upland trees were probably felled when agriculture arrived thousands of years ago, and the Normans didn’t require tree cover when they first created the hunting grounds for deer.What Bowland offers is not gushing beauty, photogenic peaks or well-trodden footpaths, but moments of wildness in a man-made (the gender is not accidental) landscape. Visiting it, as well as a simple joy in itself, is a way of staking a claim on behalf of the region’s most vulnerable inhabitants – the raptors.The “summit” of my mini-safari with Ludwig was when the male hen harrier began to perform what is known as a sky dance. Against a big, clear-blue backdrop and above a patch of chocolate-coloured heather where a female lurked, he shot upwards and began to pirouette, and then fall, and then flip, and twist and, frankly, show off like billyo – to impress her, to warn younger males to stay away and, perhaps, because flying like that must feel just ace.Download walks and cycling routeshere.

But with more than 10% of the country’s laying flockculled in the last 12 months, an industry-wide move away from battery farming andrising consumer demand, prices are surging and supplies are tight – with some reports suggesting the shortfall could continue to 2028.Supermarkets Coles and Woolworths still have purchase limits on eggs, so for the egg-reliant times might feel tough – but vegans and those with allergies have long since developed a host of no-fuss alternatives. Here, they share their advice.For whippingSince theexperiments of a French musician and an American software engineergave the world aquafaba a decade ago, the unlikely substitute for the humble goog has become ubiquitous in vegan cuisine. A viscous byproduct of cooking legumes (usually chickpeas), aquafaba is most famous for its ability to be whipped up into convincing meringues, but as hospitality consultant and former sous chef of the acclaimed Sydney vegan restaurant Yellow, Elijah Attard, points out: “You can also use it to make sauces, emulsionsand mayonnaises.”View image in fullscreenTom Hunt’s vegan macaroons made from aquafaba (leftover bean cooking liquid).Photograph: Tom Hunt/The GuardianAttard, who has been vegan for nine years, says you can get two small eggs’ worth of aquafaba out of one can of chickpeas, making it very cost-effective – and it’s even cheaper if you’re soaking and boiling the beans yourself. Whether from the can or homemade, the solution can be stored in the fridge for up to a week. If you’re going to DIY it, remember that it’s the cooled cooking water that makes aquafaba, not the soaking water. With a cult following, recipes for its multifarious uses abound online – frommacaroonstoveggie snags.Meera Sodha’s vegan recipe for apple pudding cake | The new veganRead moreFor bakingAttard says that while there’s never going to be a true substitute for the “eggy egginess of an egg” there’s certainly a few reliable sub-ins when baking.One of the most economical and effective, Attard says, is made by mixing ground flaxseeds with boiling water. For one egg, “you’re going to want to do around one tablespoon of flaxseed [meal] to three tablespoons of boiling hot water”. Then it’s a matter of mixing it together and letting it sit for five to 10 minutes. The end result is a gel-like substance that costs about 25 cents per egg equivalent, or around half the price of a free range egg from the major supermarkets.View image in fullscreenVeet Karen recommends chia seeds for making fritters.Photograph: Huizeng Hu/Getty ImagesVeet Karen, a vegan cooking school facilitator and podcaster who has enjoyed a plant-based diet for close to four decades, recommends a similar concoction made of chia seeds. When used in recipes for things likefritters, she says it has the added benefit of “fluffing up” as an egg would. Karen’s ratios and method are the same as Attard’s, as are the savings.For bindingAttard says that while bananas make a great binding substitute, “there’s good and bad times to use them” when it comes to “reimagining the structure and texture of an egg”.Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email“When they’re green or pale yellow, that’s when most of the starches are there; that’s when you’d use it as a [more neutral] binding agent, whereas when they’re spoiling and brown those starches have converted to sugars which will impart more of that rambunctious, funky banana flavour.View image in fullscreenBananas make a great binding substitute, but avoid overripe fruit which will impart more funky flavour.Photograph: Zoonar GmbH/Alamy“Whenever you’re replacing something, you’ve always got to be a little bit intuitive. But I would say roughly half a large banana will do the work of one egg.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While probably not cheaper, it offers a “beautiful balance of healthy fats and protein”.“All legumes are great. Even low-sodium store-bought baked beans I recommend for an easy breakfast, lunch or dinner – you’re getting all the benefits of the plant protein, fibre and lots of vitamins and minerals.”While these options won’t provide exact nutritional matches, O’Hanlon reassures us that while we have become accustomed to having “all sorts of food on tap”, we don’t need to eat any one ingredient daily to stay healthy. “It’s not what you have in today’s meal or yesterday’s meal. It’s what you have over the course of weeks, months and years that’s most important.“And it’s good to have a little bit of scarcity and to get creative with other options now and again.”Explore more on these topicsEggsAustralian food and drinkAustralian lifestyleFoodVegan food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not only do these old-fashioned canapés look and taste great, but, as we’re belatedly remembering, the boiled egg, in particular, is a nutritional powerhouse far superior to a mere bowl of crisps. Make up to a day ahead, if necessary.Prep15 minCook12 minMakes84 eggs(see step 1)1 tsp softened butter1 tsp mustard powder3 tbsp mayonnaise, at room temperature (see step 8)¼ tsp flaky celery saltA generous shake of hot sauce½ tsp white-wine vinegar(see step 6)Black pepper, to taste1 small bunch chivesCayenne pepper, to finish1 A note on the eggsIf possible, make these with room-temperature eggs, stored on their side for as long as possible before cooking to centre the yolks and to make for a prettier finished dish. I prefer to buy mixed-sized boxes (large eggs can be painful for the hens; small and medium are kinder), but the timings here will work regardless.View image in fullscreen2 Boil the eggsPut the eggs in a pan large enough to hold them in a single layer and add cold water to cover by about 2cm. Bring to a boil, then immediately turn down the heat to a bare shimmer and leave to cook for 12 minutes. Scoop out into a large bowl or pan of cold water (once cool, the boiled eggs will keep in the fridge for up to a week).3 Peel the eggsTo prepare, lightly rap the eggs against a hard surface to crack the shells all the way round, then, starting at the blunt end, where there’s an air pocket to facilitate matters, peel carefully. I like to do this in a bowl of cold water, because this helps the shell come off even more easily.View image in fullscreen4 Halve the eggsIf you really want to impress your audience, trim a little from the roundest point on each side of the egg, so it will sit flat on a plate (keep the trimmings), then cut in half – use a long, thin knife, dipped in cold water first, to give a neater result.5 Mash the yolks and prep the mayoView image in fullscreenScoop out the yolks into a small bowl and mash with a fork (add the finely chopped egg white trimmings, too, if you have those).View image in fullscreenIn a separate bowl, beat the butter with a fork to soften it further, then gradually beat in the mustard powder and mayonnaise (see step 8 for a quick homemade option), until thoroughly combined.6 Flavour the mayoStir the celery salt, hot sauce and vinegar into the mayonnaise mixture and season with a little pepper.View image in fullscreenMost types of vinegar will work here, but anything dark such as balsamic will give your eggs a less than appetising colour, while malt has a whiff of the chippie. Swap in any other flavourings (for example, miso, curry powder, capers, fish roe, etc) as you fancy.7 Add the mashed egg yolkStir in the crumbled egg yolks. Finely chop the chives, stir into the mix, then taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.View image in fullscreenUsing a small spoon, divide the egg yolk mayo between the hollowed-out egg whites or, if you’re feeling very fancy, pipe it in using a bag and a star-shaped nozzle. Arrange on a plate, dust with cayenne pepper and serve.View image in fullscreen8 How to make a quick mayo …To make a quick mayonnaise, you’ll need a stick blender and a jar or jug that’s barely larger than the head of the blender.View image in fullscreenPut an egg yolk in the jar with a tablespoon each of mustard and cold water and a teaspoon of vinegar. Pour in 225ml of neutral oil followed by 25ml extra-virgin olive oil, then leave to settle for 30 seconds.9 … finish the mayoPlunge the stick blender into the base of the jar and turn it on, keeping it hard against the bottom until you see white mayonnaise begin to billow out from underneath. At this point, very slowly draw the blender up through the remaining oil until it’s all emulsified, then season to taste.Explore more on these topicsEggsFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodSnacksStarterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Food styling assistant: Laura Lawrence.EasterChocolate pudding and apple bars: Helen Goh’s recipes for Easter dessertsA spiced chocolate and hazelnut hot cross bun-inspired pudding with boozy amaretto whipped cream, and apple and rhubarb crumb barsHelen GohWed 16 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTShareThis easy-to-share crumb bar is inspired by the apple pie at the Polish cafe near my children’s school, and it’s the perfect treat for a relaxedEastergathering. A golden pastry base, which cleverly doubles as the crumble topping, holds the tender apple and rhubarb fruit filling, and a thin meringue layer strikes just the right balance of buttery, sweet, and tangy. Meanwhile, a pudding that creates its own sauce while baking always feels magical. The secret lies in the different densities of the batter and the liquid poured over it just before baking – during its time in the oven, the two layers separate into a cake with a rich, molten sauce beneath. It’s a clever (and delicious) trick.Apple and rhubarb crumb barsThe apple filling should be made in advance (up to two days), giving it plenty of time to cool before being spooned over the base. Serve these bars on their own with tea, or warm with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream for a sweet finish to a feast.Prep15 minMacerate30 min+Cook2 hr 10 min, plus coolingServes8-12For the apple filling1½kg apples(4 large granny smiths and 4 large pink ladys), peeled, cored and cut into ½cm-thick pieces (1kg net)80g caster sugar2tbsp lemon juice2tbsp apple cider vinegar1 tsp ground cinnamon¼ tsp ground nutmeg⅛ tsp fine sea salt2tbsp unsalted butter2½ tsp cornflour200grhubarb,cut into 1cm pieces, or whole blackberriesIcing sugar,for dustingFor the pastry400g plain flour150g caster sugar,plus 70g for the meringueFinely grated zest of 1 lemon1 tsp baking powder¼ tsp fine sea salt180g unsalted butter,cold and cut into 6-8 pieces, plus 10g, softened, for greasing4 eggs;1 whole, 3 separated1 tsp vanilla extractPut the apples, sugar, lemon juice, vinegar, spices and salt into a large bowl and toss to combine. Set aside to macerate at room temperature, tossing occasionally, for at least 30 minutes (and up to two hours). Strain the apples, reserving the juice in a jug – you should have about 100ml (top up with water if you’re short).Put a large saute pan over a medium heat and add one tablespoon of butter and half the strained apples. Cook, tossing regularly, for about 10 minutes, until the apples begin to soften. Tip them into a bowl and repeat with the remaining butter and raw apples. When the second batch of apples has softened, return the first batch to the pan. Whisk the cornflour into the reserved strained juice then stir into the pan. Cook for a minute until the juices thicken, then scrape the apples into a bowl. Stir in the rhubarb/blackberries and leave to cool completely.For the pastry, put the flour, 150g sugar, lemon zest, baking powder and salt in a food processor and pulse to combine and aerate. Add 180g butter and pulse again until it’s barely visible. Whisk the whole egg, yolks and vanilla together, then stream into the food processor, pulsing until the pastry starts to come together. Tip out on to a clean bench and knead gently to bring it together. Roll into a fat log, then slice it into two pieces, one weighing about 500g and the other 300g. Put the smaller log into the fridge.Heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/380F/gas 5½ and grease a deep baking tray of about 33cm x 23cm x 4cm with the extra 10g softened butter. Slice the larger pastry log into 1cm-thick discs and lay in one layer on the base of the baking tray. Press the pastry together to form an even layer, then spoon the cooled fruit filling on top.In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the whisk attachment on medium-high until soft peaks form. Drizzle in 70g caster sugar and continue whisking until firm peaks form. Spoon the mixture on top of the apple layer, and level with a small spatula. Remove the smaller pastry log from the fridge and crumble it evenly the meringue layer (you could also grate it on the large holes of a box grater). Bake for one hour, covering loosely with foil if the pastry gets too dark. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes, before slicing into large squares. Dust liberally with icing sugar and serve with cream or ice-cream.Spiced chocolate and hazelnut pudding with amaretto whipped creamView image in fullscreenHelen Goh’s spiced chocolate and hazelnut pudding with amaretto whipped cream.Here, I’ve infused the pudding with the warm spices of hot cross buns and paired it with an alcohol-spiked cream for an indulgent finish to an Easter feast. The ingredients list looks long, I know, but rest assured it is simple to make.Prep10 minCook1 hrServes660g unsalted butter,plus 10g extra, softened, for greasing120g self-raising flour¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda15g cocoa powder1 tsp ground cinnamon¼ tsp ground ginger¼ tsp ground nutmeg⅛ tsp ground allspice⅛ tsp ground cloves¼ tsp fine sea salt60g finely ground blanched hazelnuts100g dark chocolate(70%), roughly chopped70g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 1 orange120ml milk1 tsp vanilla extractFor the topping80g light brown sugar10g cocoa powder,plus extra for dustingA pinch of fine sea salt300ml very hot water from a recently boiled kettleFor the serving cream300ml double cream1tbsp icing sugar1tbsp Amaretto or dark rum(optional)Heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/380F/gas 5½ and grease the base and sides of a deep ovenproof dish (about 22cm in diameter) with the 10g softened butter.Sift the flour, bicarb, cocoa powder, spices and salt into a large mixing bowl. Add the ground hazelnuts, stir well to combine, then set aside.Put the chocolate and butter in a small bowl and put over a small pan of barely simmering water, making sure that the base of the bowl does not touch the water. Stir occasionally until melted, then remove from the heat.Add the sugar and orange zest, whisk gently to combine, then add the milk and vanilla extract. Whisk again to incorporate, then pour the mix into the dry ingredients. Stir until fully combined (it will be quite thick), then scrape the batter into the buttered dish and level the surface with a small spatula.For the topping, put the brown sugar, cocoa powder and salt into a small bowl and whisk to combine. Scatter this mixture evenly on top of the pudding to cover in a thick layer, then carefully spoon the hot water all over the top. Bake for about 35 minutes, until the pudding forms a slightly crusty, shiny top and the centre springs back when tapped lightly.Meanwhile, put all the ingredients for the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat with the whisk attachment on medium speed until soft waves form. Refrigerate until ready to serve.Remove the pudding from the oven and while the sauce is still molten, sieve a little cocoa powder on top, then bring to the table. Scoop large spoonfuls into serving bowls and serve with the whipped cream on the side.Helen Goh is a recipe developer and co-author ofOttolenghi Comfort(Ebury, £30) andSweet(Ebury, £35)Explore more on these topicsEasterDessertFoodFruitChocolateBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"
