He repeatedly claimed during his election campaign that he would end the war within 24 hours of taking office.The US president insisted that he was applying pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the war, claiming that an agreement by Moscow not to take over the entire country would be a “pretty big concession”.“We’re putting a lot of pressure onRussia, and Russia knows that,” he said.Trump accuses Zelenskyy of jeopardising imminent peace dealRead moreRussian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov told CBS news the Kremlin was ready to “reach a deal” with the US onUkraine, but there are some “elements of this deal which need to be fine tuned”.The attack onKyivwas the biggest and most deadly this year. Two children were among the dead and at least 90 people were injured. Russia also carried out strikes against Kharkiv and other cities.Waves of drones as well as ballistic and guided missiles struck the Ukrainian capital early on Thursday. There were explosions for much of the night, beginning at about 1am local time, and the rattle of anti-aircraft fire as Ukrainian defences tried to shoot the missiles down.Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said rescuers searching for survivors had found one man alive and recovered three bodies. Zelenskyy said two of the victims were a brother and a sister, 21-year-old Nikita and 19-year-old Sofia. “To our great regret, there is destruction and loss in our capital,” he said.The injured included six children and a pregnant woman, with more than 40 peopletaken to hospital.A house, other buildings and cars were set on fire and extensive damage was caused by falling debris in several districts.Dozens of people killed in Russian air and missile attacks“Russia has launched a massive combined strike on Kyiv,” Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Telegram.Zelenskyy said early on Friday that Russian forces had tried to use mass air strikes as cover for intensified land-based attacks.“When our forces were concentrating to the maximum on defending against missiles and drones, the Russians went ahead with intensified ground attacks. But they were repelled in worthy fashion,” he said on the Telegram messaging appZelenskyy said Russia fired a North Korean ballistic missile at an apartment block in Kyiv’s Sviatoshynskyi district. Video showed the missile, which Reuters said was a North Korean KN-23, plunging into the building, followed by a huge orange explosion and a boom.Ukraine’s interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, said a big rescue operation was under way at the scene of the strike, involving dogs and engineering teams. “Mobile phones can be heard ringing under the ruins. The search will continue until everybody is got out. We have information about two children who cannot be found at the scene of the incident,” he said.Earlier on Wednesday evening, drones could be seen buzzing in the sky above the north-east Kharkiv region and flying over a forest. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, was hit by seven missiles and 12 kamikaze drones in strikes throughout the night as black smoke plumed overhead.According to Kharkiv’s mayor, several private houses, a factory and a high-rise apartment block were hit. “One of the most recent strikes hit a densely populated residential area. Two people were injured there,” Ihor Terekhov said, urging people to be careful.View image in fullscreenRescuers and civilians worked to pull victims from the rubble of a residential building in Kyiv on Thursday.Photograph: Libkos/Getty ImagesOn Thursday Trumppostedon Truth Social: “I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5,000 soldiers a week are dying. Let’s get the Peace Deal DONE!”The day before, he hadlashed out at Zelenskyyfor failing to support a US “peace plan” in which Crimea and other Ukrainian territories would be handed to Russia.Trump accused Ukraine’s president of prolonging the “killing field” and making “very harmful” statements. Zelenskyy has ruled out recognising Crimea as Russian and says a complete ceasefire is needed before any settlement can be discussed.Zelenskyy said he was cutting short a trip to South Africa because of the attack. “It has been 44 days since Ukraine agreed to a full ceasefire and a halt to strikes … And it has been 44 days of Russia continuing to kill our people,” Zelensky said in a post on X. “The strikes must be stopped immediately and unconditionally.”According to Bloomberg, Washington will push back on Russia’s demand that Ukraine is “demilitarised” as a part of a peace deal. The news agency said the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, would insist during his next meeting with Putin that Kyiv has its own army and defence industry.View image in fullscreenRescuers at the site of a building hit by a Russian ballistic missile strike in Kyiv on Thursday.Photograph: Valentyn Ogirenko/ReutersThe Ukrainian foreign minister, Andriy Sybiga, said Russia’s “maximalist demands for Ukraine to withdraw from its regions, combined with these brutal strikes, show that Russia, not Ukraine, is the obstacle to peace”.He added: “Moscow, not Kyiv, is where pressure should be applied. Putin demonstrates through his actions, not words, that he does not respect any peace efforts and only wants to continue the war. Weakness and concessions will not stop his terror and aggression. Only strength and pressure will.”Posting on social media as Russian bombs fell around them, Ukrainians criticised Trump’s one-sided approach and his apparent indifference to Ukrainian civilian casualties. The massive attack suggested the Kremlin was not remotely interested in peace, they suggested.Olga Rudenko, the editor of the Kyiv Independent newspaper, wrote on social media: “Can’t begin to explain how surreal it is to be sitting on the floor in the safest place of my apartment hearing an extremely loud Russian missile+drone attack – after having spent entire day discussing and editing coverage of the US effectively demanding Ukraine’s surrender.”Euan MacDonald, a freelance journalist, said: “Great big bang in Kyiv, and another – incoming missiles. Shaheds also in city, just heard anti-aircraft guns. And two more big bangs just as I write … Not been this noisy for a while.”1:22Zelenskyy calls for more pressure on Russia after massive Kyiv attack – videoThere were further attacks in the cities of Pavlohrad and Zhytomyr, as well as in the Zaporizhzhia region.In Kyiv, some residents spent a sleepless night in the subway, which doubles as a missile shelter. According to the photographerKostyantyn Liberov, Shahed drones struck the same district twice as rescuers and civilians were trying to free a young woman who was trapped in a collapsed building.“Honey, we’ll get you out no matter what. We’re right here,” one of the rescuers reassured her as a Shahed drone buzzed overhead, Liberov reported.Anton Shtuka, a videographer whofilmed the difficult rescue operation, said: “Sometimes it looks like these strikes hit our homes because Putin feels US support and begins to pressure Ukraine even more.” He added, ironically: “Thank you, partners.”Kyiv was last hit by missiles in early April, when at least three people were hurt. It has been the target of sporadic attacks since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelenskyy’s office, said: “Putin shows only a desire to kill. The attacks on civilians must stop.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineKyivRussiaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

US consumer confidence levels havefallen sharplyin recent weeks.The inflationary impact outside the US is not as clear because exports from US trading partners could be rerouted elsewhere, and a glut of goods arriving in those places could cause prices to fall.However, growing numbers of companies are warning that the disruption to supply chains could force them to put up prices, while consumer inflation expectations are also rising.According to the latest snapshot from GfK, the measure of UK consumer expectations for the general economic situation over the next 12 months fell by eight points to -37, a significantly worse reading than in April 2024.The forecast for personal finances over the next 12 months also slipped by four points to -3, which is five points worse than this time last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While itnow stands at 2.6%, the Bank of England expects a rise to 3.7% this summer before slowly falling back to its 2% target over the next two years.Bellamy questioned whether Britain was “on the verge of another round of rapidly increasing prices” on the back of Trump’s tariffs.“If so, consumer confidence is likely to collapse, and the broad gains seen since the disastrous September 2022 mini-budget – when confidence hit a record low of -49 – could quickly be eroded.”Explore more on these topicsConsumer spendingTrump tariffsHousehold billsUK cost of living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Israeli authorities confirmed last week thatNsasrah was in custody, but under emergency war legislation the whereabouts of detainees from Gaza can be kept secret and they can be barred from meeting a lawyer for 45 days. Nsasrah is not allowed legal counsel until 7 May.In Israeli political news on Thursday, the supreme court grantedBenjamin Netanyahuan extension until Sunday to file an official rebuttal to an affidavit from his fired Shin Bet chief, Ronen Bar.The Israeli prime minister was expected to accuse the head of the general security service of lying, in an affidavit that was supposed to be submitted by the end of Thursday in response to claims made by the security chief in his own 31-page affidavit earlier this week.Israel’s supreme court halted Bar’s controversial firing after a cabinet vote last month, widespread protests and a petition from the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, on the grounds it may be unlawful. The battle between the two men is pushing the country to the brink of a constitutional crisis.The Shin Bet has been investigating Netanyahu’s close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including leaking classified documents to foreign media, and allegedly taking money from Qatar, which is known to have given significant financial aid to Hamas.In his affidavit, Bar accused Netanyahu of moving to sack him after his refusal to fulfil requests including spying on anti-government protesters and helping the premier postpone his testimony in his criminal trial. Bar also claimed it had been made clear to him that he was expected to be “personally loyal” to the prime minister.Netanyahu has said he lost trust in Bar’s capacity to lead the Shin Bet. He escalated his attack on Bar on Wednesday night, before his expected filing, by sharing a recording of a phone conversation between a Shin Bet agent and a police officer allegedly proving that the agency “persecutes rightwing activists”.The relationship between the two men, already strained, deteriorated further after the release of a Shin Bet investigation pointing to policy issues in the run-up to the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack.Netanyahu has never accepted any responsibility for Israel’s worst national security disaster, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, led to 251 being abducted and held hostage in theGazaStrip, and ignited the devastating war in the Palestinian territory.The head of Israel’s powerful Histadrut union, Arnon Bar-David, threatened on Thursday to call a nationwide strike if the government disobeyed a potential high court order to reinstate Bar, describing such a move as a “red line”.Two previous Histadrut strikes have put Netanyahu’s far-right coalition under significant pressure. One in March 2023 was triggered by the prime minster’s decision to fire the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, over his opposition to a proposed judicial overhaul. Strike action in September 2024 took place in favour of a hostage deal and ceasefire in the war in Gaza after Hamas murdered six captives.In Gaza on Wednesday, Israeli airstrikes across the strip killed at least 28 people, according to the territory’s health ministry, whose data the UN assesses to be accurate.Explore more on these topicsIsraelIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardianthis week reportedOfwat and the independent water commission are investigating water firms for spending up to 10 times as much on their sewage works and piping as comparable countries.Bills in England and Walesare rising by £123on average this year, and will go up further over the next five years, so that companies can fix ageing sewage infrastructure and stop spills of human waste from contaminating rivers and seas. Several water firmshave complainedto the Competition and Markets Authority because they want the regulator to allow them to increase bills even further.Only 1% of water companies’ actions to improve environmental performance, such as improving sewer overflows, have been inspected by theEnvironment Agency, the authors of the NAO report said. They also found there was no regulator responsible for proactively inspecting wastewater assets to prevent further environmental harm.The report, which audited the three water regulators, Ofwat, the Environment Agency, and the Drinking Water Inspectorate, as well as the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, also found the regulators did not have a good understanding of the condition of infrastructure assets such as leaking sewers and ageing sewage treatment facilities as they do not have a set of metrics to assess their condition.Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “Given the unprecedented situation facing the sector, Defra and the regulators need to act urgently to address industry performance and resilience to ensure the sector can meet government targets and achieve value for money over the long term for bill payers.”Despite the huge costs of infrastructure, the water companies have moved slowly meaning that at the current rate, it would take 700 years to replace the entire existing water network, the report found. Regulatory gaps and a lack of urgency about replacing old and malfunctioning infrastructure has caused a “rising tide of risk” in the sector, which is contributing to increasing bills for customers, the report warned.It also criticised the lack of a national plan for water supply and recommended that Defra must understand the costs and deliverability of its plans, alongside the impact they would have on customers’ bills.Several of the issues raised by the NAO, including concerns about weak infrastructure, have come to the fore in the debate over the future of Thames Water, the country’s largest water company with 16 million customers. Thames, which is under significant financial pressure with almost £20bn in debt, needs to secure fresh investment within months.Questions over the state of Thames’s infrastructure and regulatory punishment it could face for its failures have dogged the process ofwinning fresh funds. Meanwhile, Ofwat has also rejected its requests to raise bills by as much as 59%, insteadallowing a 35% increase over the next five years.The government set up the independent water commission (IWC) last year to investigate how the water industry operated and whether regulation was fit for purpose.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the Tory chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said: “Today’s NAO report lays bare the scale of the challenges facing the water sector – not least the real prospect of water shortfall without urgent action.“The consequences of government’s failure to regulate this sector properly are now landing squarely on bill payers who are being left to pick up the tab. After years of under-investment, pollution incidents and water supply issues, it is no surprise that consumer trust is at an all-time low. Having not built any reservoirs in the last 30 years, we now need 10.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Defra and the regulators must focus on rebuilding public confidence and ensure the sector can attract the long-term investment it desperately needs.”An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “We recognise the significant challenges facing the water industry. That is why we will be working with Defra and other water regulators to implement the report’s recommendations and update our frameworks to reflect its findings.”An Ofwat spokesperson added: “We agree with the NAO’s recommendations for Ofwat and we continue to progress our work in these areas, and to contribute to the IWC wider review of the regulatory framework. We also look forward to the IWC’s recommendations and to working with government and other regulators to better deliver for customers and the environment.”A Defra spokesperson said: “The government has taken urgent action to fix the water industry – but change will not happen overnight.

Changing the US Constitution to allow a third presidential term would require a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. An amendment would also need ratification by at least 38 of the 50 US states, another slim possibility.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

The amendments renew a planned change of the law under the Conservatives that was derailed by the general election.Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, plans to close a loophole whereby reckless cycling was caught under legislation dating back to the 1860s.View image in fullscreenMatt Briggs, widower of Kim, who was killed when a cyclist hit her in 2016.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianCampaigners have welcomed the new legislation. Matt Briggs,whose wife, Kim, 44, was killed by a cyclist nine years ago, told the Telegraph: “After losing Kim in 2016, I began campaigning the following year to have these laws enacted.“The use of the ‘wanton and furious’ charge for so many cases has been inadequate and archaic.“I’m absolutely delighted that this Labour government has followed through with our calls for new legislation.“This isn’t just a victory for me and my family, it’s also a victory for all the families who have worked tirelessly through their unbearable tragedies to have these laws changed.”The amendments have been criticised by some cyclists. Chris Boardman, the former Olympic cyclist and national active travel commissioner for England, said the new laws could prevent people from cycling.Labour has promised“unprecedented levels of funding”to encourage more people to cycle as it aims to meet its net zero targets.A DfT spokesperson said: “Dangerous cycling is completely unacceptable, and the safety of our roads is a key priority for this government.“The government is proposing new offences and penalties for dangerous cycling, updating legislation that is over 160 years old, to ensure that the tiny minority who recklessly disregard others face the full force of the law.“These are being brought forward as part of the crime and policing bill and will be debated in due course.”Explore more on these topicsCyclingTransport policyTransportHeidi AlexandernewsShareReuse this content"

Rather than taking it on faith that the woody biomass burnt for energy is a sustainably sourced low-carbon alternative fuel, it is long past time a true assay was made of what taxpayers are getting for their money.”The industry was plunged into controversy last year when the FTSE 250 owners of the Drax power plant agreed to pay a£25mfine after an investigation by the energy regulator found “an absence of adequate data governance and controls” to monitor the sourcing of biomass pellets.The company was also accused by a former employee of “misleading the public, government and its regulator” over its sourcing of wood for biomass pellets, in a claim for unfair dismissal filed against Drax at an employment tribunal earlier this year.Drax denied the claims, and the litigation ended after the company and the whistleblower “reached a mutually agreeable position, without admission of liability”, it said.Clifton-Brown said the government must do more to establish full confidence in the biomass industry’s supply chains “to truly satisfy itself that biomass is not a white elephant”.He added the report had raised further questionsabout the future role of biomass plants fitted with carbon capture technology – known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or Beccs.Earlier this year, Drax said it wouldslow its investment in Beccsunless the government provided clarity over the returns it could expect from the upgrade. The comapny signalled the slowdown despite securing an extra three years of government subsidies and earning record profits of more than £1bn last year.Clifton-Brown said although Beccs has been “long-viewed as crucial for net zero” there is “no movement visible on the horizon to start to build it into the UK’s infrastructure”.A Drax spokesperson said its biomass was “certified as sustainable” through the Sustainable Biomass Programme (SBP), a certification scheme that has been criticised by some for not being “robust”, according to the PAC report.The spokesperson added: “Our regulator, Ofgem, has tested and benchmarked the SBP against the government’s sustainability requirements for woody biomass, alongside other programmes.”Explore more on these topicsDraxEnergy industryBiomass and bioenergyRenewable energyEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

The Environment Agency, which investigates water companies in England, has identified hundreds of such cases since 2020.Steve Reed, the environment secretary, said: “Bosses must face consequences if they commit crimes – there must be accountability. From today, there will be no more hiding places.“Water companies must now focus on cleaning up our rivers, lakes and seas for good.”Water companies dumped a record amount of sewage into rivers and coastal waters last year, mostly because wet weather threatened to wash sewage back into people’s homes.Datareleased last monthby the Environment Agency revealed companies had discharged untreated effluent for nearly 4m hours during 2024, a slight increase on the previous year.But companies have also illegally dumped sewage during dry weather. Data released to the Telegraphlast yearunder freedom of information rules shows regulators had identified 465 illegal sewage spills since 2020, with a further 154 under investigation as potentially illegal spills.Britain’s polluted waterways became a major issue at last year’s election, with Labour promising to end what it called the “Tory sewage scandal”.Government sources say one reason illegal spills have been allowed to continue is that regulators have faced obstruction when investigating them.In 2019, three employees at Southern Waterwere convictedof hampering the Environment Agency when it was trying to collect data as part of an investigation into raw sewage spilled into rivers and on beaches in south-east England.The maximum punishment available in that case was a fine, but none of the individuals were fined. Several of the employees said at the time they were told by the company solicitor not to give data to the regulator.Two years later, Southernwas givena £90m fine after pleading guilty to thousands of illegal discharges of sewage over a five-year period.New rules coming into force on Friday will give legal agencies the power to bring prosecutions in the crown court against employees for obstructing regulatory investigations, with a maximum sanction of imprisonment.Directors and executives can be prosecuted if they have consented to or connived with that obstruction, or allowed it to happen through neglect.The rules were included in the Water (Special Measures) Act, which came into law in February. The act also gives the regulator new powers to ban bonuses if environmental standards are not met and requires companies to install real-time monitors at every emergency sewage outlet.Philip Duffy, the chief executive of the Environment Agency, said: “The act was a crucial step in making sure water companies take full responsibility for their impact on the environment.“The tougher powers we have gained through this legislation will allow us, as the regulator, to close the justice gap, deliver swifter enforcement action and ultimately deter illegal activity.“Alongside this, we’re modernising and expanding our approach to water company inspections – and it’s working. More people, powers, better data and inspections are yielding vital evidence so that we can reduce sewage pollution, hold water companies to account and protect the environment.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironment AgencyRiversSteve ReedWater industrynewsShareReuse this content"

National output has come close to stagnation in the second half of last year amid weakness in consumer confidence.The IMF downgrade followed similar deep negative revisions by the Bank and the government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. However, recent figures showed the economy recovered at afaster rate than expected in February.While Labour has made rebooting economic growth its number one mission for government, experts say Trump’s increasingly erratic trade wars could torpedo the world economy, including sapping growth in Britain.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is expected to discuss theprospects for a US-UK trade agreementwhen she meets the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, this week but she said on Wednesday that the UK was“not going to rush”into a deal.Britain is hoping to persuade Trump to relent on a 25% tariff on UK car imports to the US, which British manufacturers have warned could lead to imminent job losses if it is not lifted.It is unclear whether Washington is prepared to discuss exemptions from the 10% base tariff it has imposed on all countries, including the UK.Reeves signalled she would be prepared to cut tariffs on imports of some US products if it helped to seal an agreement, but she has insisted food standards and other regulations are not up for negotiation.The UK has already offered other concessions, includingreducing the £1bn digital services tax, which hits US tech firms.Bailey, speaking to CNBC television, said he would be “very encouraged if the UK does make a deal” but stressed that as an open economy, the UK would still be hit as global growth slows down.He said the Bank’s policymakers would have to weigh the risks to growth against an expectation of rapidly rising inflation. “We’ve got to balance those two. But I think the trade issue is the new part of that story,” he said.Speaking at an IMF panel event, Reeves said she shared some of the White House’s concerns about persistent trade deficits in the global economy, and accepted that Trump had a mandate to change things.“There’s been a feeling in my country, and in America and in many other developed countries, that the system we have today delivers for some but not for all, and jobs have been hollowed out in some sectors of the economy,” she said. “It does matter where things are made and who makes them, and we can’t be agnostic or naive about that.”But she said tariffs were “blunt instruments” for dealing with imbalances, calling instead for dialogue.She also confirmed that the UK has no intention of retaliating against US tariffs. “We think that ratcheting up benefits no one, and instead we’re approaching the dialogue with cool heads and a pragmatic realism about what we want to achieve,” she said.Appearing on the panel alongside Reeves, the IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, praised the UK’s growth policies. “What Rachel is doing to lift up growth in the UK, she’s tackling very tough issues: getting reprioritisation of spending, getting the regulatory environment to be more rational, and then taking on the battle to get it done – and it’s really impressive.”Explore more on these topicsAndrew BaileyBank of EnglandInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)EconomicsGlobal economyTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Spells of sunshine and a high of 17C are expected.London Marathon organisers boycott X over ‘descent into gutter’ under MuskRead moreOli Claydon, of the Met Office, said conditions were expected to remain favourable. “It’s looking like the marathons for both Manchester andLondonwill be dry. Temperatures shouldn’t be a problem for the morning, but the temperature will build during the day.”The broader UK outlook is varied. Rain is expected to move across Northern Ireland and into the far west of Scotland and Cornwall overnight into Friday, accompanied by a southerly breeze.Central and eastern regions of the UK are likely to remain dry, though areas of low cloud, patchy mist and frost may develop overnight under clearer skies.By Saturday, a band of patchy rain is forecast to move eastwards across Scotland,Englandand Wales, followed by bright spells, particularly farther north. Conditions are expected to become increasingly warm and settled.On Sunday, southern and eastern parts of the UK will experience dry weather and long spells of sunshine, while northern regions may continue to see scattered showers and increased cloud cover.Highs of 24C are possible in the south-east of England by Monday, with further rises expected as warmer air is drawn up from continental Europe due to a blocked weather pattern – a mixture of high pressure to the east and low pressure to the west of the UK.By midweek, temperatures are forecast to reach 25-27C in parts of south-eastern and central England, potentially marking the warmest weather of the year so far.While such conditions are not unprecedented for April, they would be the highest recorded since 2018. The UK’s April temperature record of 29.4C, set in London in 1949, is likely to remain intact.The spell of warm weather is expected to persist through next week, though a shift in the pressure systems may bring cooler conditions and the possibility of showers to some areas by next weekend.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherLondon MarathonLondonManchesterEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Garnett says it is the scabbard of a sword or dagger. Monk insists it is a male member.“I am in no doubt that the appendage is a depiction of male genitalia – the missed penis, shall we say. The detail is surprisingly anatomically fulsome,” Monk said.The Bayeux Museum in Normandy, home to the 70 metre-long embroidery, says: “The story it tells is an epic poem and a moralistic work.”View image in fullscreenThe two historians disagree on what the black shape emerging from this figure’s tunic represents.Photograph: Bayeux MuseumThe historians, whose academic skirmish takes place in theHistoryExtra Podcast, both insist that – beyond the smutty jokes and sexual innuendo – their work is far from silly. Garnett said it was about “understanding medieval minds”.“The whole point of studying history is to understand how people thought in the past,” he said. “And medieval people were not crude, unsophisticated, dim-witted individuals. Quite the opposite,.”He believes the unknown designer of the epic embroidery was highly educated and used “literary allusions to subvert the standard story of the Norman conquest”.He said: “What I’ve shown is that this is a serious, learned attempt to comment on the conquest – albeit in code.”In theBayeux tapestry, size did matter, Garnett said. He pointed out that the battle’s two leaders – Harold Godwinson, who died at Hastings with an arrow in his eye, and the victorious Duke William of Normandy, AKA William the Conqueror – are shown on steeds with noticeably larger endowments. “William’s horse is by far the biggest,” Garnett said. “And that’s not a coincidence.”Monk insisted the running man’s dangly bits are the tapestry’s “missing penis”.Dr David Musgrove, the host of the podcast and a Bayeux tapestry expert, said the new theory was fascinating.“It’s a reminder that this embroidery is a multi-layered artefact that rewards careful study and remains a wondrous enigma almost a millennium after it was stitched,” he said.Explore more on these topicsBayeux tapestryFranceEnglandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Washington also wants lower UK tariffs on American cars.UK officials were blindsided by the report and are increasingly playing down the prospect of a speedy economic deal with the US. Reeves said on Wednesday she was“not going to rush” into an agreementand ruled out watering down agricultural standards – though ministers are open to slashing tariffs on cars.Behind the scenes, the erratic and unpredictable nature of Donald Trump’s administration is causing frustration inside the UK government and giving weight to arguments that ministers should focus their energies onrebuilding bridges with the EU.Starmer met Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, in London on Thursday in advance of a UK-EU summit next month.As part of their wider reset in relations with Brussels,ministers are pursuing an agri-food agreementthat would reduce border checks and boost trade. Tory critics have warned this would cause problems in the US talks. But that may prove a price ministers are willing to pay, particularly given Labour’s manifesto commitment to maintaining high food standards in any trade deals.The EU and UK, meanwhile, have been subject to increasing overtures fromChinasince Trump came to power. Xi Jinping has launched a charm offensive seeking closer ties with countries alienated by Trump’s belligerent tariff policy.The UK has signalled it is open to those overtures and ministers have been unapologetic in their pursuit of closer ties with Beijing despite security and human rights concerns. Reevesargued last week it would be “very foolish” not to engagewith the world’s second largest economy.The government is alive to the possibility of Washington turning its ire towards London’s rapprochement with Beijing. There have been reports the US will demand that countries sever ties with China as the price of securing tariff reductions.But there are differing views in government and diplomatic circles over how big this problem will ultimately be, given there is no sign of a coherent US policy towards China yet. Trump has simultaneouslyexpressed optimism about improving trade relations with Beijingand triggered a trade war by imposing huge tariffs.China, meanwhile, looks poised to lift sanctions on EU parliamentarians as part of efforts to revive a trade deal with the bloc. UK officials say they are expecting no such move when it comes to British parliamentarians under sanctions, who include the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith and the Labour peer Helena Kennedy, but that their cases have been raised in talks with the Chinese government. A UK-China trade deal still looks far off, but Beijing’s efforts to gain greater access to the EU market will fuel speculation that talks with Britain could be revived.UK economy faces growth shock from Trump tariffs, says Bank governorRead moreThe challenges of riding three horses are not just international. Ministers are increasingly contending with domestic pressure when it comes to relations with all three powers.Senior MPs including Liam Byrne, the business and trade committee chair, and Emily Thornberry, the foreign affairs committee chair,have called for any trade deal with the US to be subject to a voteby parliament. Dozens of MPs have written to ministers this weekurging them to strike a youth mobility deal with Brusselsdespite Home Office concerns about the impact on migration numbers.The government hasbowed to backbench pressureto ban the UK’s national energy company from investing in projects that use solar panels linked to Chinese slave labour. And the government’s decision this month toseize control of British Steel from Jingye, the Chinese company that owns it, triggered a furious response from the Chinese embassy and demonstrated the limits of economic cooperation with Beijing.Trade-offs are unavoidable, but ministers will nonetheless seek to postpone them for as long as possible.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyForeign policyInternational tradeKeir StarmerRachel ReevesInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)European UnionanalysisShareReuse this content"

Or the French president, Emmanuel Macron, or Brazil’s leftist leader, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, or any Iranians that might appear? There may be relief that Vladimir Putin has said he will not attend, but will everyone expect front row seats?View image in fullscreenJacques Chirac kisses Condoleezza Rice’s hand as President George W Bush and Laura Bush look on as they attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II.Photograph: Dan Chung/The GuardianThe pope’s funeral provides an unexpected opportunity for impromptu international diplomacy and uncomfortable encounters. The 10am start means most heads of state and political leaders will arrive in Rome on Friday evening, with a brief window for meetings if desired.“There will be some potentially really interesting dynamics at the funeral,” said Francis Campbell, who was the UK’s ambassador to the Holy See between 2005 and 2011.The last comparable occasion, the funeral of Pope John Paul II in April 2005, was the “diplomatic event of the year”,according to the Center on Public Diplomacyat the University of Southern California. It “brought numerous world leaders together, including many that would not normally appear in the same country, let alone the same room”.View image in fullscreenTony Blair, Cherie Blair, Charles Kennedy and Michael Howard take their places for the funeral of Pope John Paul II.Photograph: Dan Chung/The GuardianThe funeral came amid the intensity of the Iraq war – which John Paul II had opposed. When a closeup image of President George Bush’s face appeared on large outdoor television monitors,jeering erupted from the crowd.Bush found himself sitting close to the leaders of Iran, Syria and Cuba. He and his ally Tony Blair gave them the cold shoulder.In contrast, Prince Charles committed a diplomatic faux pas byshaking the hand of Zimbabwe’s pariah president Robert Mugabe, who had side-stepped an EU travel ban to attend the service. Charles was apparently caught by surprise when Mugabe leaned over to greet him. A statement later noted “the prince finds the current Zimbabwean regime abhorrent”.Another handshake, between the presidents of arch-enemies Israel and Iran, was seen as a potentially historic moment – until Mohammad Khatami of Iran laterdenied the handshake ever happened.Meanwhile, China boycotted the funeral because of the attendance of the Taiwanese president. The Vatican is one of only a handful of nations to have diplomatic relations with Taiwan – though itspresident will not be in Romeon Saturday.View image in fullscreenPrince Charles shakes hands with Robert Mugabe, who had flown in from Zimbabwe unannounced.Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty ImagesThe Holy See has envoys in most countries of the world. Known asnuncios, they have a diplomatic and a religious role.“They know things that a normal ambassador doesn’t,” said Campbell. “People tend to trust priests more than diplomats, so thenuncioshave access to huge amounts of information – especially outside capitals or in countries where there is conflict.”The Holy See has on occasion intervened behind the scenes to try to resolve a crisis, said Campbell. “But it doesn’t advertise that,” he added.In 2007, Pope Benedict helped secure therelease of 15 British sailors captured by Iran. “He asked for their release at Easter as a goodwill gesture,” said Campbell. The intervention only became publicly known when aconfidential briefing was leakedthree years later.View image in fullscreenMoshe Katzav (left), then the president of Israel, and Iran’s Mohammad Khatami (right), with Queen Rania of Jordan (centre) at the funeral for Pope John Paul II.Photograph: Lefteris Pitarakis/APMore recently, the Vatican has been involved inefforts to end the war in Ukraineand hasadvocated for peace in GazaandSouth Sudan. Earlier this year,the Vatican brokered a deal with Cubathat led to the release of hundreds of people jailed for taking part in anti-government protests.Pope Francis also reached out to the Muslim world, signing ahistoric declaration of fraternitywith the grand imam of al-Azhar in the first ever papal visit to the Arabian peninsula, in 2019.“Some western countries have assumed that, because religion didn’t matter in their country to the same extent that it once did, therefore it didn’t matter to the rest of the world,” said Campbell.“But the Roman Catholic church has a massive global spread. It has diplomatic relations with nearly every country, and almost 20% of the world’s population identifies as Catholic.“The church’s diplomacy is deep and it is wide, but often it is invisible to the naked eye. The Holy See has a unique convening power that will play out on Saturday.”Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismThe papacyVaticanItalyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Under the direction of Marc Bruni, it starts big, in sound and look, as the world of spoiled old-money couple, Tom (Jon Robyns) and Daisy Buchanan (Frances Mayli McCann), collides with that of the self-made Jay Gatsby (Jamie Muscato).But it has nowhere to go from there: with every ostrich-filled scene and iceberg-sized setting, designed by Paul Tate DePoo III, it appears more like a Las Vegas casino with bursts of lurid light and ever more showboating sets.The music by Jason Howland, and lyrics by Nathan Tysen, comprise cruise-liner material too, by turns trite, tinkly and bombastic, from the opening number, Roaring On, onwards. It is unfortunate, given the strong vocal capabilities of the cast.The unfettered parties at Gatsby’s swanky mansion are antiseptic despite the eye-catching array of costumes designed by Linda Cho (a dazzle of beaded frocks, flapper headdresses and glittery Mary Janes). Dominque Kelley’s choreography gives period moves (Charlestons galore) Beyoncé-style inflections but it looks sterile for the lack of emotional drama around it, while the book, by Kait Kerrigan, merely tells you what is going on, and who is who.View image in fullscreenA bit too relatable … Corbin Bleu (Nick Carraway) in The Great Gatsby: A New Musical.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianFitzgerald’s central couple fizz with charisma on the page, lighting up every room with their smiles, but here they are smoothed to two dimensions, as slick and empty-eyed as those of Doctor TJ Eckleberg’s in the advert that looms behind them. They all seem breezy and rather amicable, including the supercilious Tom, while Gatsby is something of a cypher. That is no fault of the cast – the mood is simply too perky, the pace brisk and breezy, the story’s heart subsumed by the mission to put on a high-octane musical.Puttin’ on the Fitz! The Great Gatsby: A New Musical – in picturesRead moreThere is no depth of emotion to the love story between Jay and Daisy, no sultriness to Tom’s affair with the wife of petrol pump attendant, Myrtle (Rachel Tucker), and no icy heat to the romance between Jordan (Amber Davies) and Nick Carraway (Corbin Bleu). Here, she excitedly asks for his hand in marriage – but why? Gatsby’s dodgy business is flat-footedly conveyed in the song, Shady, while his associate, Meyer Wolfsheim (John Owen-Jones) is about as sinister as a Bugsy Malone extra.Then there is the problem of Nick. The show’s narrator is far removed fromthe voice of Fitzgerald’s lone observer. He resembles a relatable, hapless type from a modern relationship TV drama – quite literally the guy next door. He squirms when things turn bad and talks of journalling about his post-traumatic stress disorder from the Great War. The babbling tone of his narration turns Fitzgerald’s prose – full of poetic restraint – into rambles.And despite the glut of vocal and visual crescendos, the peaks of the story flatline, from the violence by Tom that breaks Myrtle’s nose to the shooting at the ending. Fresh from Broadway, this production encapsulates the worst of peacockingly splashy entertainment – the kind whose soul has been suctioned out in the making.At theColiseum, London, until 7 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreF Scott FitzgeraldreviewsShareReuse this content"

Pakistan has denied any involvement.Among a string of punitive measures announced since Tuesday,Indiahas downgraded diplomatic ties, suspended a crucial water-sharing treaty and revoked all visas issued to Pakistani nationals.In retaliation, Pakistan has closed its airspace for all Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines, and suspended all trade with India, including to and from any third country.Why is Kashmir so sensitive?The region, in the foothills of the Himalayas, has been disputed since India and Pakistan came into being in 1947. Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world’s most heavily militarised borders: the “line of control” based on a ceasefire border established after the 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999.A map showing the Kashmir regionThe dispute stems from the partition of colonial India in 1947, when small, semi-autonomous “princely states” across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan, and the local ruler chose to become part of India despite the fact the area had a Muslim majority.Armed insurgents in Kashmir have resisted Delhi for decades, with many Muslim Kashmiris supporting the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India accuses Pakistan of backing militants – a claim Pakistan denies.What has happened in recent years?In 2019 Narendra Modi’s government launched a severe security crackdown in Indian-administered Kashmir and revoked the region’s special status, which had granted it limited autonomy since 1949.The move fulfilled a longstanding Hindu-nationalist pledge and was widely welcomed acrossIndia, but angered many in the territory itself. Against a backdrop of widespread repression, insurgent violence tapered off and tourists returned to the region.New rules were implemented that allowed outsiders to buy land in Kashmir for the first time, which many saw as an attempt by the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) to dispossess them from their land and change the Muslim demography of the region.Under its special status Kashmir had been able to define who its permanent residents were, preventing incomers from other parts of India from applying for jobs, scholarships or buying land.With the new domicile rule, India widened who was eligible to live and work in Kashmir, leading to accusations that it was trying to change the demographic make-up of the region. The Resistance Front cited this claim when it claimed Tuesday’s attack.Why has India reacted so forcefully to the attack?The attack – in the midst of a visit by the US vice-president, JD Vance – was highly embarrassing for Modi and his BJP party, which has been boasting since 2019 about the success of its security policies in Kashmir.The anger in India has been exacerbated by the sectarian nature of the attack, during which some of the male tourists were reportedly asked to recite Islamic verses to determine who would be killed.1:10Tensions escalate between India and Pakistan after Kashmir attack – videoWhat is the significance of the Indus Waters treaty?While some of the bellicose rhetoric that has been visible in the past few days is familiar from past crises between India and Pakistan that have fallen short of war, India’s decision to suspend the 1964 Indus Waters treaty is a very big deal.The treaty, which has survived endless crises over the years, is one of the world’s most successful water-sharing agreements, allowing for sharing the waters of a river system that is a lifeline for both countries.Pakistani agriculture’s massive reliance on the Indus system’s waters for irrigation makes the treaty crucial for the country. Pakistan has said any interference with water flow would be treated as “an act of war”.How bad could this get?The last major conflict fought between India and Pakistan was the 1999 Kargil war, which was limited in comparison with previous conflicts.While much is made of the fact that both countries retain nuclear weapons, conventional wisdom is that this has tended to limit rather than exacerbate the danger of serious conflict in recent decades.However, past militant attacks – in 2016 and 2019 – have resulted in Indian military retaliation. Many observers believe that bar means that India will like launch airstrikes on militants across the border as a minimum response.Explore more on these topicsKashmirIndiaPakistanSouth and central AsiaexplainersShareReuse this content"

Welsh director Gareth Evans is the action maestro who rocked our world with his superb skull-rattling thrillersThe RaidandThe Raid 2; this new one for Netflix certainly has its fair share of OTT gonzo mayhem. Shootouts in cramped interiors and in the open air sometimes seem to go on so long that the gunfire feels like an extended drumroll. Dozens of people get riddled with bullets from automatic weaponry; they all go into that shoulder-rolling, arm-waving, blood-spurting choreography. At one stage, a comatose and heavily bandaged person in a hospital bed gets the same machine gun treatment, and even this poor guy has to jitterbug, infinitesimally and horizontally, in his hospital pyjamas as he gets filled full of lead.But frankly the action and the violence is too chaotic and almost meaningless and the CGI-Gotham-type cityscape where the drama takes place feels too artificial to me. (The film was actually shot in Cardiff.) Tom Hardy, doing his wheezy-nasal and faintly Cagney tough guy voice, plays Walker, a disillusioned but basically decent cop, who has found himself coerced into doing dirty work for corrupt politician Lawrence Beaumont, played byForest Whitaker.When Beaumont’s son Charlie (Justin Cornwell) is wanted for involvement in drug running and apparently slaying a pampered young prince of the Chinese gangs, it is Walker who has to somehow rescue Charlie both from the police and the vengeful triads. He has the help of a smart young rookie cop Ellie (Jessie Mei Li) but must face a horribly corrupt and cynical officer, Vincent, played by the reliably malign Timothy Olyphant.Evans certainly brings the craziness and the violence but, for me, without the stylish martial arts of his Raid films and without any plausible sense that anything is believably at stake.Havoc is on Netflix from 25 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsTom HardyForest WhitakerGareth EvansreviewsShareReuse this content"

Oceanic Feeling (2021)If you wanted to take Lorde’s third album, Solar Power, as a farewell to chasing mainstream stardom, closer Oceanic Feeling was strong evidence: her trademark “cherry black lipstick” was “gathering dust in a drawer / I don’t need her any more.” Instead, she offered a beautiful, sun-kissed paean to stepping off the treadmill: “I just had to breathe,” she explains.19. Yellow Flicker Beat (2014)Between her first and second albums, Lorde performed with the surviving members of Nirvana, and essayed an astonishing Brit awards tribute to David Bowie. She also absolutely crushed her contribution to the Hunger Games: Mockingjay soundtrack – Yellow Flicker Beat is ominous and powerful, and it works both as part of the movie’s plot and entirely separate from it.18. Mood Ring (2021)Amid Solar Power’s seemingly earnest paeans to taking it easy came Mood Ring, a song that suggested Lorde’s capacity for snark wasn’t diminished. Just as she did with pop culture on Royals, she fixes her satirical gaze on millennial wellness trends, with splendid results: “Let’s fly somewhere eastern! They’ll have what I need!”17. Buzzcut Season (2013)If you want evidence of the cool, this-is-me self-confidence that powered Lorde’s debut album, you could do worse than listen to Buzzcut Season. Its memories of past summers are set to music eerily sparse by the standards of 2013, an era of DayGlo pop maximalism, EDM, Miley Cyrus’s Wrecking Ball and Katy Perry’s Roar.View image in fullscreenLorde plays the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury festival, 2022.Photograph: Harry Durrant/Getty Images16. Stoned at the Nail Salon (2021)A grumbling electric guitar plays a folky figure (vaguely evocative of Nico’s celebrated These Days), backing a plethora of worries about the passage of time: youthful beauty fading, relationships withering, tastes in music changing. An existential crisis or just a mind wandering under the influence of THC? Lorde isn’t sure, but it sounds beautiful either way.15. Royals (2013)Lorde’s breakthrough hit wasn’t the best track on Pure Heroine, but it might be the most striking: the sound of pop’s target market answering back, with an incisive skewering of the glaring disparity between the unattainable lifestyles it projects and the realities of teenage life – and beating it at its own game.14. The Louvre (2017)Her second album, Melodrama, depicted the debauchery and emotional chaos of late teen lives so brilliantly, the fact the late teen in question was a huge pop star seemed beside the point. The Louvre reports from the dizzy height of an inadvisable romance: “We’re the greatest, they’ll hang us in the Louvre / Down the back but who cares – still the Louvre.”13. Perfect Places (2017)The sparkling big-chorused pop of Perfect Places sounds buoyant, but it jars against the lyrics. They paint a picture of Lorde partying – she drinks, drugs, cops off and throws up – and ending up not in hedonistic nirvana but in hollow, hungover regret, wondering “what the fuck” the point is.12. Team (2013)The key line on Pure Heroine might be Team’s snotty riposte to pop’s then-current obsession with partying in the VIP area: “I’m kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air,” it snaps, fabulously. The sound of a kid who has heard one Black Eyed Peas hit too many.11. Liability (2017)A limpid melody and a raw, close-miked vocal, as if someone who has had a few drinks is detailing their romantic woes inches away from your face, replete with I’ll-never-love-again misery and a resolution, of sorts: “You’re all gonna watch me disappear into the sun.” Intense, but beautiful with it.10. What Was That (2025)A strikingly effective update of Melodrama’s angst-ridden-yet-euphoric banger approach, Lorde’s brand new single comes complete with a lyric that compares sexual desire to smoking a cigarette on MDMA. Charli xcx recently announced the coming of a “Lorde summer”: if the rest of the next album is as good as this, she might have a point.9. Tennis Court (2013)Packing one of the most fabulously surly (and very teenage) opening lines in pop history – “Don’t you think it’s boring how people talk?” – Lorde stares down the prospect of fame with an equivocal eye. The irony is that the song itself is so perfectly constructed it makes huge success seem inevitable.8. Supercut (2017)It’s one of the few songs on Melodrama to reference Lorde’s fame, albeit obliquely (“continents and cars … the stages and the stars”). But Supercut’s real currency is more breakup-fuelled distress, this time set to music that slowly builds to a delicious, dizzyingly effective pop chorus, then collapses into racked silence before gradually rebuilding itself again.7. Hard Feelings/Loveless (2017)If Melodrama seemed more straightforwardly poppy than its predecessor, Lorde’s oddball side took charge here. This is two entirely different tracks jammed into one: the first stately, punctuated by screams and scraping noise, the second a kind of creeped-out nursery rhyme that borrows the drums from Phil Collins’s In the Air Tonight.6. A World Alone (2013)A beautiful, complex portrayal of the friendship between two adolescent weirdos. Brutal self-assessment coexists with take-us-or-leave-us swagger – “Maybe the internet raised us, or maybe people are jerks” is a particularly great line – perfectly mirrored in the song’s musical shifts from fragile solo electric guitar to dancefloor-engaging four-four thud.5. Homemade Dynamite (2017)View image in fullscreenLorde in 2025.A masterclass in how to make a fantastic 21st-century pop track, everything about Homemade Dynamite is inspired: the spiky staccato arrangement at odds with Lorde’s cooing vocal, the vaguely military beat, the earworm chorus, the stammering hook. Also fantastic:the all-star remix featuring SZA, Post Malone and Khalid.4. Writer in the Dark (2017)This is Melodrama’s killer breakup ballad, at turns despondent, stoic and savage, its sudden shifts in mood utterly believable. The orchestration is subtly done – all the drama comes from Lorde’s lyrics and voice, which starts as a bitter snarl, gradually gathers itself and transforms, stunningly, into swooping, Kate Bush-esque catharsis as it reaches the chorus.3. 400 Lux (2013)The perfect example of Pure Heroine’s ability to transform the mundane into something gripping. It’s a song about “killing time” by driving aimlessly around with a pal, but the vocals are surrounded by occasionally off-key synths: a strange, faintly uneasy counterpoint to the lyrics about friendship and suburban contentment.2. Green Light (2017)A thrillingly explosive introduction to Lorde’s second album. Fuelled by extraordinarily bitter sentiments – at one point, she wishes her ex could be mauled by a shark – and hands-in-the-air house piano, Green Light abandons Pure Heroine’s slow-burn sound in favour of careering along, dragging us with it.1. Ribs (2013)Ribs sharply evokes both a house party’s hungover aftermath and the weird, liminal nature of adolescence, the disquieting moment when you’re struck by the realisation that your childhood is over and you’re entirely unprepared for whatever is supposed to happen next, no matter how much you pretend you are: “We can talk it so good … it drives you crazy getting old.” Perfectly, the music is all about anticipation: one long build to a climax that never arrives. The startling brilliance of Lorde’s debut album – a teenage audience’s concerns addressed directly by another teenager, albeit a preternaturally smart one – is encapsulated in four minutes.Explore more on these topicsRankedLordePop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Run for the hills!John CraceAs some polls put the Reform party ahead of Labour and the Tories, it might just be time to think the unthinkableThu 24 Apr 2025 11.58 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 15.07 EDTShareWith two opinion polls giving the Reform party a clear lead over Labour and the Conservatives, it may be time to start thinking about some practicalities. Like, just who will be doing what job in a Reform-led government?It can probably be taken it as read thatNigel Faragewill be prime minister, but that leaves three MPs – make that two, as James McMurdock isn’t trusted enough by his colleagues to be allowed out in public – to fill the remaining 20-plus cabinet posts. Unless we take it that two dozen or so newly elected MPs with no experience of anything will be drafted in by Nige after the 2029 election. Run for the hills, everyone.It’s probably fair to assume that Richard Tice has his eyes on becoming chancellor. Dicky likes to think that a spell on the graveyard shift of the shopping channel flogging sunbeds makes him the ideal man to be in charge of the national finances.He has the misplaced confidence of a man in possession of a small fortune. Mainly because he started out with a large one. No one will ever love Dicky quite the way Dicky loves Dicky. A man who gets an erotic thrill from his own reflection. The embodiment of levitas. One budget from Dicky and the country will be pleading for the return of Kwasi Kwarteng. Reform’s collision with economic reality will make us all poorer.As for Lee Anderson, the Ashfield MP who has crashed and burned his way through Labour and the Tories before – for now – aligning himself with Nige, that probably leaves the Foreign Office. 30p Lee, masquerading as the UK’s senior diplomat. A man who can always be trusted to handle delicate situations with tact and sensitivity. A new era in legitimised plain-speaking Islamophobia. There’s just the one problem. Anderson has no understanding and no interest in foreign affairs. His world ends at the white cliffs.There was certainly no sign of Lee during Thursday’s urgent question in the Commons on the ongoing peace talks to end the war in Ukraine. There again, probably easier for Reform to stay away. No point in pointing out that Nige is sometimes reluctant to criticise Trump and Putin. Put it this way. Unlike many of the MPs from both sides of the chamber, Nige, Dicky and Lee are never going to find themselves on a Russian sanctions list.The session itself was a looking-glass affair. One where you had to pinch yourself to make sure you hadn’t slid into an alternative universe. One where Tory after Tory – including James Cleverly – stood up to condemn Agent Orange for trash-talking Volodymyr Zelenskyy and for unilaterally conceding Ukrainian territory, while the Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty repeatedly insisted the US had nothing but Ukrainian interests at heart and that the talks were going swimmingly despite the Americans having walked out. “The talks had been productive because they were productive,” he said. Thank you and good night, Steve.Nige himself was also missing from the Commons. That was because he was out and about in Dover giving yet another press conference at which he had nothing new to say. Farage is convinced he will shrivel up and die if he isn’t standing in front of a camera at least once or twice a day.His narcissism is ravenous; never satisfied. So it no longer matters what he says. All that counts is that he is saying something and that someone is there to record it. One day we will discover there is a portrait of him ageing by the day tucked away in an attic.Still, one mystery was solved on the Kent coast. Because it emerged that Nige thinks Nige is best-placed to be home secretary. After all, being prime minister is very much a part-time occupation. So Farage has volunteered himself to double up. He might even go for the hat-trick and take on the Department for Work and Pensions as well. Why deprive himself of the fun of cutting people’s benefits? The highlight of any politician’s career.First, though, Nige wanted to have a serious talk about immigration. And to everyone’s astonishment, he had come to the conclusion there are far too many foreigners in this country. Not that he didn’t like foreigners. Some of his best friends were foreigners. Though these were all foreigners who had done the decent thing and stayed in their own foreign country.Here was the thing about foreigners who had landed up in the UK. They were all pathologically lazy. Just here for the freebies and to make real Brits poorer. To steal social housing from white people. White people were not to be confused with Albanian white people. Albanian white people were all criminals. They come over here, steal our phones, sell us drugs and take up all the spare places in our jails.But if there was one thing worse than foreigners, it was remainers. What you had to remember about remainers was that they were all closet traitors. The only true patriots were the Brexiters. Because nothing shouts “I love Britain the most” than voting to make the country poorer.Nige got slower and slower as he ran through his greatest hits until his batteries ran out. He ground to a halt mid-crocodile smile. His minders hastily plugged in the charger as some questions from the media came in. He wanted to re-industrialise the whole of the UK to kickstart employment. It was as if the AI revolution had escaped him. He would get rid of all diversity, equality and inclusion criteria. May the best white Brit win. A man, preferably.Kent council should close all its migrant hotels. Who cared whether that was legal or not? He went out on a high. Children were being overdiagnosed with special educational needs. Kids with autism should just pull themselves together. They should learn to do a proper day’s work rather than sponging off the state. No one could say Nige wasn’t all heart. Could they?Explore more on these topicsReform UKThe politics sketchNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

A figure lying on its back, in this show of his early works, is made of solid sheets of lead, welded neatly into the form of a man, based like so much of his work on the dimensions of Gormley’s own body. Two small holes at the nose are the only perforations in an otherwise uniform metal structure. They’re not nostrils though, oh no: “Two holes at the nose reinforce the notion of the body as a conduit between physical and transcendent realms.” Gesundheit!It’s the kind of overblown over-justification that has always blighted the work of Gormley. His body forms dot the country, peering out to sea along Crosby Beach, standing with wings spread at Gateshead, looming out at you from the lobbies of countless bank HQs. For the past 30-odd years, Gormley has been everywhere, his simple, stark figures acting as cyphers for the very act of existence in the modern world. Where you see a Gorm, you see yourself, you see humankind, persevering, surviving in nature, in the sea, in banks.White Cube is focusing on his first steps towards becoming a household name, with early experiments in lead. These are the first footprints left by a giant of contemporary British art. The earliest, Land Sea and Air from 1977-79, is three boulder forms plopped on the ground, all grey and weathered and wrapped in lead. One is a granite rock from a beach in Ireland, the other two are water and air from the same place, though you’ll never know which is which unless you pick them up or give them a quick toe punt (don’t try it – the security guards are extremely vigilant at White Cube).View image in fullscreenUsing the material of bullets … Close I, 1992 Lead, fibreglass, plaster and air.Photograph: Photograph by Stephen White & Co © the artistDespite its obvious poisonous qualities, the lead wrapping acts as a form of preservation, saving these elemental materials from destruction. And destruction at the time the work was made must have felt imminent, with Europe haunted by the cold war, nuclear annihilation a constant threat.So Gormley turned to lead, the material of bullets, to save, record and preserve what we are. The middle of the gallery is filled with objects arranged in size, starting at a pea then a banana, a grenade, a lemon, a lightbulb, a club, a squash, a ball, each wrapped in lead. Next to it, lead bullets have been left a pile, a grey shape on the wall is a lead-wrapped machete. Violence, death, injury – Gormley saw it everywhere. The symbolism is incredibly heavy-handed, appropriately enough for lead, but it works.Downstairs things get more familiar, as the gallery gets filled with Gorminators, the body-shaped statues that have become his signature. One lies face down with legs spread on the cold concrete, another pulls its knees into its chest and buries its head in its arms. The largest, a walking figure in the middle of the space, has had its head swapped for a huge 5m-long building. Each work is made of lead, the welding lines acting like enormous scars across their bodies. They’re desolate, desperate things.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These can’t just be left as bodies preserved against imminent death. Instead, he says things like: “I have always thought of the darkness of the body as being equivalent to the darkness of the universe.” The insistence on the universal and transcendent, the idea of Gormley’s body as a metaphor, a stand-in for wider humanity, has always grated. It pulls it all out of the real and shoves it into the realm of existential nonsense. It makes the reasoning behind the work so vague and overblown, leaving it pretty meaninglessness in the process.Which is a pity, because if you can manage to wade through the fog of waffle that engulfs these early pieces, there’s something quite special here. These are works of profound fear and paranoia. The lead that has replaced the flesh on these bodies is the material of war. They are human munitions now, bullets waiting to be fired, shields ready to be sacrificed. They cower in fear or lie prone waiting for inevitable annihilation. Everywhere he looks, he seem to see death looming. The work might be a product of its time, but it still feels upsettingly relevant todayAnthony Gormley: Witness is atWhite Cube, London, until 8 JuneExplore more on these topicsArt and designAntony GormleyExhibitionsSculptureArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

But for Charlotte Proudman, only one opinion matters: that of the women and children she defends in the family courtsAmelia GentlemanThu 24 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 10.15 EDTShareAt lunchtime, when she is working at her barristers’ chambers in central London, Charlotte Proudman, a specialist in family law, faces a confronting choice. Should she nip around the corner to Pret a Manger or join her colleagues at the Middle Temple dining hall? It’s not so much a question of whether she feels like a sandwich or a sit-down meal, but a more existential decision, requiring her to analyse who she is and where she belongs.It is 15 years since Proudman qualified as a barrister, but she still feels a sense of alienation when she walks into the formal dining halls. “It’s largely a sea of male, pale, stale figures sitting there, all in their suits. They all look identical, and are probably from similar demographic backgrounds. As a woman, you already stand out,” she says when we meet at her deserted offices on Good Friday. “It feels like a pocket of establishment elitism. In Pret you’ll have a mixture of solicitors, some paralegals, maybe some judges popping in and out; it’s more cosmopolitan.”Since she started eating at Middle Temple, Proudman, 36, has repeatedly been surprised by the questions the mostly male diners lob in her direction. When she began her career at the bar, she found that it was “by some distance, the most male environment I had ever encountered”. Often the men begin by remarking that she has an accent, and start hazarding inaccurate guesses about where she’s from.“They suggest Leeds or Yorkshire and I’m not from any of those places – but it’s almost as if they’re making a point of the fact that I don’t belong, that I’m an outsider,” she says, adding that almost no one has heard of Leek, the market town where she grew up, near Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire.When she first qualified, she would be asked where she had studied at university; older barristers, she says, were nonplussed when she said Keele. Occasionally they asked her what her father did for a living; she avoided saying that he was an alcoholic who died in a car crash when she was four. She was unsettled by their shared cultural reference points. “I know it sounds funny, but everyone’s gone skiing, everyone goes to the opera. They have these extracurricular activities which I’ve just never done.”You can understand why Pret might begin to seem the logical choice.Proudman’s unease echoes that felt byBrenda Hale, the first female president of the supreme court, when she moved from Yorkshire to London to start at the bar, and found herself surrounded by men she privately called “quadrangle to quadrangle to quadrangle boys” – lawyers who had been at independent boarding schools, then Oxbridge and the Inns of Court in London, their lives bounded by similar architecture and privilege.She took a screenshot of his message and posted it online. Within 24 hours her face was on the front of the Daily MailInstead of bowing her head and quietly assimilating, Proudman has spent the past decade calling out misogyny in the legal world, managing in the process to alienate many of her male colleagues as well a number of female newspaper columnists, while also triggering a career-threatening disciplinary tribunal. This week she publishes a book on the work to which she has devoted her professional energies: supporting women with violent or controlling partners as they navigate the family courts.Proudman’s achievements in this sphere are notable. One campaigner for greater openness in the notoriously untransparent family system (where critical decisions are made about how to organise care of children after divorce) pays effusive tribute to her work, characterising her as a “brave and persistent disruptor”. A senior colleague at Proudman’s chambers, Goldsmith, describes her as an excellent barrister who has achieved remarkable results by championing difficult issues such as coercive and controlling behaviour, by challenging the notion of parental alienation (a claim often used damagingly by fathers against mothers in response to accusations of domestic violence) and focusing attention on marital rape.But Proudman’s book, He Said, She Said: Truth, Trauma and the Struggle for Justice inFamilyCourt,is also a memoir that attempts to understand the sea of acrimony that she has provoked.“Why do they dislike me so much?” Proudman wonders, laughing but sounding momentarily puzzled. “They think I’m rocking the boat, maybe, causing trouble, pushing the boundaries of the law. Or maybe it’s something about exposing the misogyny within the legal system, especially in criticising judges.”The bar has yet to have a #Metoo reckoning. Proudman describes two occasions when she was groped by male barristers, one of whom had been assigned to her as a professional mentor. She cites research indicating that four in 10 female barristers have experienced sexual harassment and sees this as the direct result of a “predominance of men and male attitudes”.Although more women than men now study law at university, the bar has been slow to catch up; 41% of barristers are women, but just 21% of KCs (senior barristers). Junior women at the bar earnon average 77% of what junior men earn; female KCs earn on average only 67% as much as their male colleagues. In 2024, 62% of court judges in England and Wales were men, rising to 69% in the high court and 75% in the court of appeal.View image in fullscreenProudman arriving at her misconduct hearing, backed by supporters, last December.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAProudman, who completed a doctorate at Cambridge, says: “Women have to work much harder to stand out and show that we are very good at what we do. Look at how many mediocre white blokes there are that seem to be doing just fine.” Comments like these have not won her allies.She emerged into public consciousness a decade ago, when she called out a much older lawyer, a senior partner at a London solicitors’ firm, who sent her a message on the business network LinkedIn, complimenting her on her profile picture. “I appreciate this is probably horrendously politically incorrect but that is a stunning picture!!! You definitely win the prize for the best LinkedIn picture I have ever seen,” Alexander Carter-Silk wrote. She replied that she found his message offensive, and that she was using LinkedIn for professional reasons, “not to be approached about my physical appearance or to be objectified by sexist men”. She took a screenshot of his message and posted it on Twitter, asking other female lawyers if they were getting similar messages.Within 24 hours her face was on the front of the Daily Mail, flagging an article by columnist Sarah Vine addressing the “glam lawyer and the Feminazis who hate men who praise their looks”. Vine’s article said: “Heaven help the poor man who actually tries to ask her out on a date, let alone try to get her into his bed. He’d have better luck propositioning a porcupine.” She was on the Mail’s front page for two days in a row.The online abuse this unleashed was standard, depressing mid-2010s fare for Twitter (as it then was): she was swiftly dismissed as “rabid”, “humourless”, “dumb”, “a blockhead”, “whiny”, “malicious” and “batshit insane” by anonymous trolls.But she was surprised to find some of the worst comments came from male barristers, tweeting under their own names. One wrote: “If you want to be a shock jock, apply to a radio station. If you want to be a barrister, stop being a cunt.” Another described her as a “self-publicist who cynically uses women’s suffering to promote herself”. Others called her mentally ill and a “wanker”.She removed herself from social media, but later returned because she recognised that her online profile helped her reach clients in areas she was interested in. For a while she was hurt by the criticism she provoked, but she says she no longer cares very much, having mostly worked out a way to divert the hostility into positive attention for causes she feels strongly about.Along the way, Proudman has concluded that likability is an overrated character requirement unhelpfully foisted on women and girls. “I think I’m quite a likable person, when you get to know me,” she says. She spends some time amiably attempting to get the coffee machine started, and when this doesn’t work she sets off to search the building for glasses of water, determined to be hospitable. “But as young girls and young women, we are taught towantto be liked, and, for me now, wanting to be liked has largely gone by the wayside. I’m aware some people don’t like me and I don’t care. I’d rather be understood than liked.”In 2022 she typed a 14-part Twitter thread expressing frustration about a judgment by Sir Jonathan Cohen – who, like a handful of judges and dozens of senior barristers, was a member of the then men-only Garrick Club. Proudman felt the judgment had not taken the allegations of domestic abuse sufficiently seriously; she wrote that she was troubled by Cohen referring to the relationship between a woman and her ex-husband, who was a part-time judge and barrister, as “tempestuous” and describing the alleged domestic violence as “reckless”. She wrote that the case had “echoes of the ‘boys’ club’ which still exists among men in powerful positions”.The Bar Standards Board responded by launching disciplinary proceedings, on the grounds that the thread “inaccurately reflected the finding of a judge on a case in which she was instructed”, and that Proudman had behaved in a way “which was likely to diminish the trust and confidence which the public placed in her and in the profession”. She faced a 12-month suspension and £50,000 fine, but in December, after three years, all charges against her were dropped and the case was dismissed. The panel ruled that her tweets were protected under freedom of expression rules, and that they did not “gravely damage” the judiciary.She has since launched proceedings against the Bar Standards Board. “Frankly, I’d like an apology and a sum of money to reflect the pain and distress that I’ve been put through,” she says. She would also like to understand why her male colleagues who abused her online have not been subject to similar proceedings.Proudman only has just over a decade’s worth of career to cover, so her book doesn’t have the heft of solicitorHarriet Wistrich’s excellent recent memoir Sister in Law, which also tackles the need to remodel the legal system to offer better justice to women. But He Said, She Said is revealing about the hidden world of family courts, where she argues attitudes lag behind other courts because of the absence of routine scrutiny. She wrote it because she wanted to “expose how the family justice system is failing women and children”, and because she felt frustrated at seeing the same systemic failings repeated in case after case.View image in fullscreenProudman: ‘Often this feels like a game that women cannot win.’Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian“A broken relationship and a family court case can happen to anyone,” she writes, “and almost no one is prepared for what that is like. Nor is there nearly enough recognition of when and how the family court gets it wrong, and the shocking consequences of those decisions on the lives of women and children.”She has acted in cases where a judge has dismissed domestic violence, shrugging it off as “just a bit of DV”, and she has heard judges indulge in victim blaming, diminishing the significance of rape. One judge described an incident of strangulation as a prank, she says. She has secured judgments that recognise gaslighting as a form of domestic abuse, and that acknowledge the dangerous tactic of “darvo” (deny; attack; reverse victim and offender) that perpetrators use to avoid being held accountable.“It is women who make up almost three-quarters of domestic violence victims in the UK, and who will more often be asked to recall the painful details of how their partner verbally abused, coercively controlled, physically assaulted or raped them,” she writes. “It is women who are mostly bringing forward the most serious allegations and who must prove what they are saying, while male respondents can sit back, poke holes in their arguments and cast doubt. And it is women who must face judges who are predominantly male, relying on their understanding of the nuances of domestic abuse and coercive control. Frequently, this feels like a game that women cannot win.”Not that it is a game, as far as Proudman is concerned. She is disparaging about colleagues who have “jocular conversations” about their cases over lunch before moving on to the next job without a second thought. She dislikes the legal profession’s readiness to view wrongdoing as a “matter of technical debate” that should “never be viewed through the lens of fairness or justice”. If her passion gets under some people’s skin, so be it.The same goes for her high public profile: she sees self-promotion as an important part of carving out her practice. She takes care not to look too formal and stuffy in photos, occasionally posing in legal gowns and bare midriff, in order, she says, to show younger women that there is a place for them at the bar, in deliberate opposition to “all these male, crusty white barristers”. She wants students to look at her and think: “She looks cool. She’s a barrister. I could do that.”He Said, She Said: Truth, Trauma and the Struggle for Justice in Family Court by Dr Charlotte Proudman is published on 1 May by W&N (£20).

They built the homes that we live in, they built the studio that I am recording in … the spaceships that all of these rich celebrities are flying around in.” The difference between Cooper and feminists, she says, “is I choose to acknowledge that and celebrate it and be grateful”.TheBlue Originflight was prime fodder for Cooper, a bubbly, fast-talking 23-year-old with silky espresso brown curls and colorful Pinterest-friendly prints on the wall behind her. She posts biweekly videos commenting on hot-button social and cultural issues. Thumbnails on YouTube depict her – eyebrows raised quizzically, mouth agape in faux surprise – alongside titles like SNOW WHITE EPIC FAIL and CAPTAIN AMERICA HATES AMERICA? in yellow all caps. These cultural flashpoints serve as her evidence that young women are finally “waking up” to the lies feminism has apparently told them.View image in fullscreenBrett Cooper has gained over 1.5m subscribers on her YouTube channel, through which she uploads right-leaning commentary on pop culture topics.Photograph: Brett CooperThere is a sizable audience for Cooper’s brand of disarming anti-feminist content. She had the second-fastest growing political YouTube channel in the first quarter of 2025 with over 900,000 new subscribers, according todata analyzed by researcher Kyle Tharp. Her Spotify audience is about 60% female, a spokesperson toldSemafor.‘There were no warning signs’: what happens when your partner falls into the ‘manosphere’?Read moreAnalyses of the 2024 election widely heralded the “manosphere” – the coalition of bro podcasters and YouTubers popular with male audiences – as key to deliveringDonald Trump’s victory. According to an AP poll, 56% of men under age 30 went for Trump compared with 41% four years prior. By meeting young men where they were at, Trump and his surrogates were able to reach voters who are typically among the least politically engaged segments of society.Now, there are the beginnings of an organized effort to create a similar alternative rightwing media ecosystem targeting young female US audiences – one of the few demographics that has, until now, leaned substantiallyDemocratic.This new “womanosphere” includes Cooper’s channel as well as lifestyle magazines like the Conservateur and Evie, Candace Owens’s Club Candace, Alex Clark’s Maha (“Make America Healthy Again”) talkshow Culture Apothecary, conservative Christian influencer Allie Beth Stuckey’s Relatable,andswimmer turned anti-transgender activist Riley Gaines’s podcast Gaines For Girls. Draw the circle a bit wider and you get the “tradwives” posting homemaking content on Instagram, the edgelord It Girls of Red Scare, and“femcel” influencerspositioning themselves as the female answer to Tate.While the women behind these outlets all have different styles and tactics, they are mostly aligned in their desire to return to a gender-essentialist worldview: women as submissive homemakers, men as strong providers.Like the manosphere influencers, these outlets are animated by a grievance against “wokeness” and the belief that conservatives are the real oppressed minority. They claim that the liberal media and Hollywood are promoting feminist propaganda, and so they must fight back.Though they present themselves as independent thinkers, their ideology lines up neatly with theTrump administration’s quest todismantlereproductive rights,roll backprotections for LGBTQ+ people, and advance ananti-scienceagenda that puts the health of millions of Americans at risk.You want to go back and sit in a cubicle when you could have this, like, beautiful amazing child that you’ve created with the love of your life?Brett Cooper, rightwing commentatorIt’s not only rightwingers who have gripes with contemporary feminism. Many on the left have beencriticalof shallow “girlboss feminism” (the bipartisan backlash to the embarrassing Blue Origin flight being a case in point), noting that impossible expectations are placed on women in a crassly capitalist society that offers little support for working mothers. According to a 2023 survey run by the non-profitCatalyst, four in 10 women said they felt they would need to change jobs in order to manage childcare demands, and the US is still the only rich country in the world without a national paid parental leave policy. Yet for this new womanosphere, the response is not advancing policies like paid family leave or affordable childcare, but to return to an idealized, illusory past where being a wife and mother was viewed as a woman’s sole purpose.Young women are particularly vulnerable to these appeals. Like their peers in the manosphere, these commentators are capitalizing on a real crisis of loneliness and economic precarity facinggen Z. “Social media has truly given gen Z a warped sense of reality,” said Cooper, who has described dating apps as “treacherous” and a “barren” landscape.The alternative vision these influencers are proposing is scarily retrograde and would strip women of their freedom and economic independence. “You want to go back and sit in a cubicle when you could have this, like, beautiful amazing child that you’ve created with the love of your life?” Cooper asked rhetorically on a recent podcast appearance.Instead of trying to have it all, women, she said, need to change their priorities because “if you aren’t going to the gym, if you aren’t taking care of yourself, if you don’t like children, if you only care about your career, and you hate the patriarchy” then a desirable man is “not going to go for you”.The type of woman these commentators valorize is thin, straight, fertile, traditionally feminine, conventionally attractive to men and white – though they try to avoid overt racism, instead opting forsentiments like, “as a minority woman, I’m here to say that you’ll be happier and more fulfilled if you aren’t consumed by thinking about your race.” Anyone who falls outside of this narrow mold is subject to relentless mocking and disparagement. Though they have different tactics and tones, like their cohorts in the manosphere, they play with the idea that calling women fat or ugly is fun and transgressive – framing it as part of a virtuous quest to rid society of woke, feminist ideals.View image in fullscreenFemale members of the crowd dance as they wait for Donald Trump to begin speaking at a campaign rally in Indiana, Pennsylvania, on 23 September 2024.Photograph: Rebecca Droke/APYoung women have been hailed asthe saving grace of the Democratic party, the force that will deliver us from all those angry young men spending all their time listening to podcasts, but that’s not a given. While young women still went blue in 2024, Joe Biden’s 35-point lead in 2020dwindledto a 24-point lead for Kamala Harris. Other demographics, like Black and Latino men, broke with historical trends to shift to the right this election. Emily Amick, an influencer and political analyst who has been observing the trend on herSubstack, said that people might underestimate the womanosphere’s impact at their peril. “What we saw in the 2024 presidential election was that the manosphere had a lot more impact than a lot of people expected,” Amick said. “I believe that the conservative movement is running the same play with women, and in 2028 we are going to see a massive impact of the messaging machines they have been building.”A ‘conservative Cosmo’Flipping through the homepage of Evie magazine – which launched online in 2019 and is now in print – you might mistake it for a regular glossy women’s magazine. There are pieces about the best nail color for fall and what to ask your stylist if you want Sabrina Carpenter’s hair.View image in fullscreenThe cover of Evie’s 2024 print issue featured Hannah Neeleman, a homesteading influencer who lives in Utah with her husband and eight children. Her posts showcasing a ‘traditional’ lifestyle have garnered her 10m Instagram followers.Photograph: Evie magazineBut read deeper and you’ll notice that the Cosmo-esque sex tips about the art of oral sex and mastering cowgirl come with a disclaimer that they are “intended for married women” only. You’ll see headlines like Want Your Husband To Get You Pregnant? Cook Him These 10 Dishes and What Do JD Vance’s Blue Eyes And Sydney Sweeney’s Curves Have in Common? America Misses Classic Beauty And Wants It Back.These pieces are written in a chatty, knowing tone designed to make it seem like everything they are saying is common sense, while dispatching their enemies with high school-bully cruelty. A recent piece called Why I Love Being A Hot Mom oscillated between glib declarations like “skinny sex is the best sex” and diatribes from the author about how she despises “mediocre motherhood” and the “lack of self-control, unattractiveness, and state of disease” that results from embracing body positivity. (Disagree with her? You’re probably a “sorry, sad, chronically online gutter goblin”.)In the past two decades, mainstream women’s outlets have made attempts to emphasize overall wellbeing instead of outer beauty and valorizing thinness above all. Evie sees this as wokeness run amok. They want to bring back your mother’s – or your grandmother’s – women’s magazine, in which it was OK to celebrate a certain body type over others. “When we encounter a heavily tattooed, blue-haired, obese, gender-neutral individual with a bull-ring, that person is communicating to us that they actively disregard the standards for normality that the majority of people agree on,” read a 2021 piece titled Objective Feminine Beauty Is Not A Relic Of The Patriarchy.Evie was started by married couple Brittany and Gabriel Hugoboom as a sort of “conservative Cosmo”. As Brittany Hugoboom told theNew York Timesin a March profile, their goal was to build a “one-stop shop for femininity” that runs counter to the “casual sex, careerism or ideological activism” she attributes to feminism.Introducing TOXIC BREAKUP, the world's first 3-in-1 Birth Control Detox.Developed by holistic doctors and leading hormone experts to detoxify, replenish, and restore balance to your hormones after getting off birth control.Women everywhere are breaking up with their birth…pic.twitter.com/VGjSjTcpDr— 28 (@28wellness)February 29, 2024In addition to Evie, the Hugobooms run a menstrual cycle wellness app backed by Peter Thiel that encourages fertility planning through cycle-tracking. Along with ads for the app in their print issue, their content frequently extolls the dangers of the pill and IUDs. “Our reproductive organs are made for just that – creating new life – not warding off sperm and altering our insides to make conception close to impossible,” read a recent Evie piece. Though some young women may recoil when conservative men like JD Vance and Elon Musk opine on birthrates and fertility, outlets like Evie are able to repackage a similar message in a more approachable way.Maggie Bullock, a women’s magazine veteran who co-writesthe Spread, a newsletter about the industry, said she saw outlets like Evie as trying to be something of a “gateway drug” into more extreme conservative ideologies. “Like, we’re nice and we’re pretty and we’re not that radical, don’t worry, we’re just telling you the truth,” she said. “It feels like a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”A lot of people are moving toward the conservative movement because we’re realizing that our grandparents had these very beautiful valuesJessica Marie Baumgartner, writerJessica Marie Baumgartner, a 41-year-old former Evie freelancer and self-identified “conservative pagan” mother of five based outside St Louis, Missouri, said that though she had written for other rightwing outlets before Evie, she was attracted to “being able to write specifically about women’s issues” like breastfeeding, home birth and home schooling. She was turned off by what she saw as an “obsession with sex” in mainstream women’s magazines. “They started writing articles about younger and younger sex, with younger and younger underage minors. And that was when I was just like,ew, what’s happening here?”Baumgartner, like many of Evie’s writers, looks nostalgically to the past as a solution for society’s ills. “I think a lot of people are moving toward the conservative movement because we’re realizing that our grandparents had these very beautiful values that gave us a lot to look forward to,” she said. “We’re all working multiple jobs. We’re all so tired, we’re barely able to keep up with our kids. We barely know our neighbors. Everybody is so stretched thin because our values have shifted away from what really matters.”Evie’s reach shouldn’t be overstated – it has 210,000 followers on Instagram, compared with Cosmopolitan’s 4m, and has only put out three print issues in four years – but they’re increasingly finding new ways to garner attention. The cover of Evie’s 2024 print issue featured Ballerina Farm influencer Hannah Neeleman – whose posts about homesteading and home schooling her eight kids on their Utah farm have garnered her 10 million Instagram followers – milking a cow in a bonnet and white peasant dress.While quitting one’s corporate job to bake pies, milk cows and raise beautiful babies while wearing flowing nap-dresses may look like an appealing form of escapism, Bullock said this lifestyle propaganda was serving a much more sweeping and nefariousconservative agenda.As she put it: “If you’re going to tell a generation of young women that it’s bad to be a feminist, the Trump administration is pro-woman, that they should be having babies immediately and more of them and the pill is bad for them, that is a huge setback you’re proposing for American women.”‘A real parasocial relationship’From Phyllis Schlafly in the 1970s, who helped mobilize young Christian women against the Equal Rights Amendment, to Ann Coulter and Moms for Liberty, women have long played a role in spreading conservative propaganda. But what sets these new voices apart is that they don’t all market themselves as political commentators. In this sense, they are cribbing from the success of the manosphere, which won new Maga converts in part because most of its leading figures weren’t explicitly partisan. Multi-hours-long podcast episodes and Twitch streams from the likes of Rogan, the Nelk Boys or Theo Von are typically much more weighted to cover sports, gambling, drugs and dating than they are to talk about which bill is passing in the Senate.The leading voices of the womanosphere are using a similar strategy. As Brittany Hugoboom put it in an op–ed for the rightwing outletQuillette: “Conservatives will never win if they imagine themselves as combatants atop defensive battlements, hurling abuse on the mass media. We need to involve ourselves in the creation of pop culture.”But while Maga has piggybacked on the manosphere’s existing popularity in fields like wrestling and comedy, many of the loudest voices in the womanosphere have already been political media operatives. Cooper, Candace Owens, Allie Beth Stuckey and Alex Clark all have longstanding ties to conservative media outlets like the Blaze and the Daily Wire as well as the conservative activist groupTurning Point USA, which was instrumental in turning out the vote for Trump.Over the past few years, Turning Point haspoured millionsinto cultivating an alternative rightwing media space. After the election, the group told theNew York Timesthat they had incubated about 350 rightwing influencers. “We made long-term investments in creators and in influential voices that we believe will be the opinion shapers of tomorrow,” executive director Charlie Kirk told the outlet.“Influencers are not advertisements. They are in the bathroom with you, they are holding your hand when you break up with your boyfriend, they are helping you make dinner for your kids. You have a real parasocial relationship,” said Amick.View image in fullscreenPhyllis Schlafly, the national chair of Stop ERA, leads members rallying against the Equal Rights Amendment in 1978.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveTake Candace Owens. Over the past five years, Owens has become a polarizing figure even on the right. In addition to vitriolic criticism of Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, Owens’s controversial claims that, for example, theJewish mystical practice Kabbalahis a “pedophile-centric religion” have drawncondemnation from Jewish advocacy groups.But her new site Club Candace, looks, at first glance, like a completely different venture. With a pleasing orchid purple color scheme, a cutesy cursive logo and slick interface, the Club Candace website marks Owens’s attempt to brand herself as a more mainstream women’s lifestyle influencer, offering a book club and fitness app specifically targeted at new mothers.Like Cooper, Owens has figured out how to ride the coattails of the algorithm by choosing subjects that will shoot to the top of people’s social media feeds. She has become one of the leading commentators on the Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni scandal. On a recent YouTube video, which has garnered more than 2.5m views, she riffed: “Ryan Reynolds obviously has to be deported back to Canada,” saying this was the rare issue in which the left and right can “come together”. With a scrappy muckraking style that includes digging up documents and hunting down first-person sources – she recently shared a message she claims she received from Reynolds’s childhood teacher – Owens’s content is perfectly targeted to the era of the obsessive TikTok sleuth. Yet her defense of Baldoni is of a piece with her longtime quest to take down the #MeToo movement, which she has derided as “a witch-hunt on men”.View image in fullscreenCandace Owens speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, on 25 February 2022.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesViewers who initially tuned in for Owens’s dissection of Lively’s lawsuits will soon find themselves mired in conspiracy theories that the French president Emmanuel Macron’s wife is trans – “I would stake my entire professional career” on the fact Brigitte Macron “was born a man”, Owens has said – and claims that Chrissy Teigen’s pro-choice advocacy is an attempt to “glamorize child sacrifice”.Likewise, people who come to Club Candace looking for another book club like Oprah’s or Reese Witherspoon’s will find themselves exposed to texts like The Assault on Truth, a controversial book attacking Sigmund Freud (which Owens hascited to claim: “Sigmund Freud was a homosexual man whose best friend was a pedophile”). Yet her rebrand seems to be working. As EJ Dickson wrote inthe Cut, this segue into celebrity content has found her a much broader audience of listeners that cuts across the political spectrum, with her views quadrupling since this time last year. She’s hot on Cooper’s heels as the fourth-fastest-growing political YouTube channel.Wellness influencers go MahaAlex Clark is a 32-year-old influencer who used to host the podcast POPlitics, from which she garnered a loyal fanbase of “cuteservatives” who came to her for conservative takes on pop culture topics like: Who’s the Bigger Crybaby: Colin Kaepernick or Prince Harry?But during the pandemic Clark became obsessed with wellness, and last year, she launched her new series, Culture Apothecary. Now, half a million subscribers tune in twice a week to see Clark – perched on a fuzzy pink armchair in a cozy olive green and gold-accented living room – interview guests on the harms of artificial food dyes and how to raise your kids to “love biblically” amid ads for brands like Cowboy Colostrum.The coalition drawn to fringe wellness ideas is multifaceted: from the “crunchy” moms frightened of toxic chemicals they believe are in our food and pharmaceuticals, to the chronic illness sufferers frustrated with a medical system they feel has let them down. Yet the savvy voices of the womanosphere have responded by weaponizing genuine anxieties – which have complex roots and few easy answers – and serving up far-right propaganda on a platter. “It’ssneaky,” Clark told theWashington Post. “I want to be seen as: Alex Clark, cool girl, loves health and wellness,happensto be conservative. I’m not trying to beat people over the head with that. I don’t think that’s persuasive.”IT’S HERE 🥳💚🌿🌱: Elated to announce ‘Culture Apothecary with Alex Clark’, where each guest provides their own remedy to heal a sick culture- physically, emotionally/relationally, and spiritually...TWICE A WEEK! Same show new name. An apothecary was the original place in the…pic.twitter.com/1wKcjWioUV— Alex Clark (@yoalexrapz)September 9, 2024Mikayla Hantula, 25, from Fresno, California, said she felt a lot of judgment from her doctors for her opposition to hormonal birth control and her skepticism around vaccines (the latter led her pediatrician to refuse to give her care). Listening to Clark’s podcast, however, she found what she wanted to hear. “Wanting to do things naturally, they kind of look at you like you’re wackadoodle,” she said. “The difference is someone like Alex is willing to bring someone on that’s willing to say: ‘Here are all the harms in birth control that we’re seeing. Why are we not talking about this?’”The titles of Clark’s videos take a harmless just-asking-questions tone that invites people to click and see for themselves. Yet far from providing options for women, Clark allows her guests to peddle scientifically dubious claims in service of a Christian conservative worldview. An episode called To Vax or Not to Vax: Educating Parents on the Options features an interview with the outspoken anti-vaccine doctor Bob Sears, who hasbeen disciplined by California’s state medical boardfor wrongly exempting a two-year-old patient from vaccinations. It also doesn’t take long for Aaron Kheriaty, the Catholic thinktank fellow interviewed on Is IVF a Huge Ethical Mistake, to tell listeners that there is no such thing as an ethical way to perform IVF. (“While it may be uncomfortable or inconvenient to hear the things that you’ve said today in this interview, the facts are on your side,” agreed Clark, nodding solemnly.)Clark’s crusades against topics such as birth control – that it “accelerates ageing”, “induces abortion”, causes cancer and fertility issues – make more sense in light of the Trump administration’spro-natalistpolicy agenda, which organizations like Turning Point USA and Project 2025 have spent years crafting.“It’s all tied together with the goal of shaming women who have sex and who might get pregnant, and ensuring that they really are forced into the idea of this nuclear family because it preserves current power structures,” said Dr Jennifer Lincoln, an OB-GYN in Portland, Oregon. “They come at it from this Maha angle of ‘we have to protect women,’ and then they legislate away people’s choices to use these medicines that are literally life-saving for so many people.”They are feeling pretty good about how far they’ve come. In a recent interview with Lara Trump on her Fox News show, Cooper said that it was “incredibly cool” for young people to be conservative now. As she put it: “I think Democrats have their work cut out for them.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsWomen (Society)Women (Life and style)PodcastsMagazinesFeminismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Who wouldn’t want to plan out their ideal urban community, like Sim City and its many video game imitators, or Babar the elephant building Celesteville with its palace of work, palace of pleasure, perfect jobs for each citizen and a lake for swimming and sailing? Our king had great fun devising his Poundbury model town. The lucky members of the government’snew towns taskforcehave been dreaming up a modern generation of new civic places, and are due to unveil their plans in July.They work in the shadow of the great 1946 New Towns Act, and plans drawn up under a similar committee, chaired by Lord Reith, which led to the building of Stevenage, Harlow, Crawley, Corby and others. In the next waves came the ambitious city of Milton Keynes, Peterborough and others.The new committee has been travelling the country, looking at the successes and errors of the past. It looks, too, at lessons to be learned from the great failure of the last Labour government,which pledged to create 10 eco towns. Only one very small development came to fruition in North West Bicester and “disappointing” was the verdict. Built on an isolated greenfield site, with no shops or buses, contrary to what was promised in its desirable original masterplan, residents are totally reliant on cars.This time, from talking to those close to the action, I sense real urgency, not just a nice-to-have addition to Labour’s housing plans, but flagships of growth and regeneration in a nation stymied by a lack of homes. Michael Lyons, ex-chair of the BBC and with enormous experience in building, planning and local government, heads the committee, whose members likewise have deep knowledge of what has and hasn’t worked in the past. Can they summon up the spirit of 1946, or of the earlier garden cities, or of Milton Keynes, which is now highly popular? Can they keep the government on track to follow through a massive programme, and trust that it will be farsighted enough to know it takes years to deliver, with many obstacles?The taskforce conducts its work in strict secrecy, for very good reasons. No one knows where it has been or what it has looked at. The moment it announces recommended sites, the land values will soar: it needs to move fast to secure land at agricultural prices and establish development corporations to own it. The entire financing depends on that, so it can borrow to build, and eventually sell to homebuyers and businesses at far higher new town prices than the old pre-planning permission agricultural value to recover the cost. The added value of the development and all its facilities needs to be captured for the benefit of the new town, not landowners, developers and speculators. Development corporations were how previous new towns were built, and how Michael Heseltine financed his Liverpool and London dockland regenerations. It requires developers’ buy-in too: another risk is that they get cold feet, only wanting to build a few houses to stop prices falling.One reason for Labour’s eco towns failing to get off the ground was that the Treasury tried to finance most of the scheme, with private developers who never want to build amenities bidding for plots. But building new towns will always require that public development corporations control land, building and finance. So the great question now is how much will the Treasury put up in this summer’s spending review? This shouldn’t be in competition with any other funds, as it’s essentially a loan, an investment, most of which will be paid back eventually. Nor is this analagous to the plea made by every department that a pound spent now will prevent a £10 cost later. This really is a mortgage on land, but the Treasury may refuse to put it on its books as an asset, not a debt.The other reason for top secrecy is to avoid giving early warning to inevitable local opponents. Scouting their favoured sites, the taskforce quietly seeks local political buy-in, but even so opposition is guaranteed, and will be noisy even if coming from a minority: forget any hope of cross-party agreement. The government has to stand ruthlessly firm on the side of the silent many who will live in the new towns, not the noisy few already living in the vicinity.The taskforce’s prescription for a good new town sounds like this: at least 20,000, preferably 60,000, homes, intensively built at high-enough density with a critical mass of population to support good transport, shops and services. The taskforce was delighted that 120 zoneswere put up in answer to its call for applications, with a fair spread around the country. Inevitably some were uselessly unsuitable sites for which developers or landowners had tried and failed to get planning permission many times over many years, which had been refused with good reason. Brownfield sites in or near large towns and cities will be chosen mainly, not the out-of-the-way green fields favoured by private developers. There must be jobs nearby. The design must have character; the community must have libraries, sports and arts facilities, parks; the towns must be easy on the eye. The pledge is 40% social and affordable homes, though as the Treasury will know, social housing doesn’t repay like the rest, even with decades of rent, as so many tenants draw housing benefit.These new towns will be rolled out gradually, so the upfront money can be spread across time and the scarcity of construction workers accounted for. The plan is for much of the housing to be system-built in factories. Really? Legal and General’s pioneering modular housing factory just closed with culmulative losses of more than £350m, as have others. Ah, that was because they relied on erratic orders from developers, who refuse to build many at a time. New towns will be system building’s salvation, offering a reliably steady flow of orders for years that should kickstart the industry, ending the reliance onexpensive building skills that have remained essentially unchanged since ancient times, creating factory jobs instead.How long-termist is Keir Starmer? He has always talked of a 10-year focus. Only a few early spades will have broken any ground by the time of the next election, but towns should be springing up halfway through the next parliament – if government has the patience. If Labour loses, these plans could suffer the fate of the few eco towns instantly cut by the incoming housing minister, Grant Shapps, like everything else in 2010. But if the government hits its ambitious target of 1.5m homes, which the Office for Budget Responsibility predicts will bring housebuilding to itshighest level in 40 years, and new towns sprout as symbols of new life, it might help ensure Labour does get re-elected.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionLabourCommunitiescommentShareReuse this content"

All that ended on Friday nightThu 24 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 14.33 EDTShareMy cousin Ziyad was too young to die. He was sleeping at home in Khan Younis refugee camp when the bombs fell just before midnight on Friday. After they heard the explosion, my cousins Mohammed and Moatsem ran to save him, they told me, but he had already died in his bed. He was 44.Ziyad was a social worker for Unrwa, working with vulnerable families in Gaza’s refugee camps. Every summer when I visitedGazafrom my home in Canada, he would buy my little son candies from Asa’ad’s shop – now gone with Asa’ad (who was killed in October 2023) – insisting that Gaza’s candies were the best in the world. Everyone in Khan Younis knew him for his calm presence, gentle spirit and warm smile. He was always ready to help – the words “no” or “I can’t” were never part of his vocabulary. The night before he was killed, he visited the wounded and sick, including my uncle, Kamal.These attacks come mostly at night, when people steal what sleep they can from the endless explosions and cries for help. Since Israelcut off the electricity supplyto Gaza, their light and noise pierces the intense darkness that falls after sundown. And it was the middle of the night when a missile struck the home of Ziyad’s family. The multistorey building had five apartments, all filled with people – three of Ziyad’s siblings and their families, and several displaced family memberswho had sought shelter there after losing their homes. Khan Younis camp is wheremy grandparents sought refuge in 1948after the Nakba, and my family has lived there ever since.Ziyad seems to have been killed instantly. His wife, Samah, and four children – Abboud, Duha, Leen and Obada – were wounded.View image in fullscreenZiyad with his son Obada before the war.His brother Islam was severely injured, and remains unconscious in the partially functional Nasser hospital. Islam’s wife, Du’aa, was killed instantly. One of their children, Ahmed, was thrown from the second floor to the ground by the force of the explosion – doctors are talking about fractures in his pelvis and legs. Ziyad’s sister, Hala, was also wounded, along with her children – Malak, Nour and Muhammad. Three of Muhammad’s limbs were amputated. I’ll never forget the video I saw on Telegram of Hala, walking the corridors of Nasser hospital, her face carrying more grief than any heart should bear.Another of Ziyad’s brothers, Imad, and his entire family – his wife, Nihal, and their seven children, Muhammad, Muhand, Mu’ayyad, Mu’min and their triplet girls Dima, Rima and Rita – were also injured. In total, 15 children under the age of 15 were injured in my family, in this single strike. According to Unicef,15,600 Palestinian childrenhave been killed in Gaza since 7 October 2023;nearly 600 childrenhave been killed and more than 1,600 injured since Israel resumed its assaults on 18 March. Entire family lines have been erased, homes turned into graves.My cousins tell me that among the children killed on Friday was 20-month-old Kenan, the only son of the photojournalist Ahmad Adwan, whose family had sought shelter in Ziyad’s home. Kenan was born after 18 years of his parents’ struggle with infertility and countless costly medical treatments. His life was stolen before it had even begun.Months earlier, Ziyad was abducted by the Israeli army from the home he eventually died in, and held for several months. When he was finally released, he couldn’t recognise Khan Younis, where he grew up. The destruction was so complete it obliterated most familiar landmarks of the city and camp. The streets he had once known were unrecognisable ruins. But what he recognised was the tenacity of the people who face up to any danger to bring hope and healing.The circumstances of Ziyad’s own death demonstrate this. When the attack occurred, Mohammed, 26, was sitting with his father and his young brother Moatsem, 17. They heard the whistle of a missile – a brief few seconds – then a devastating explosion shattered windows, doors and lives. Stones and debris rained down on their roof, injuring Mohammed’s arm. Without hesitation, Mohammed and Moatsem bolted outside, into the darkness. Their father shouted for them to stay inside, fearing a “double-tap” strike –a tactic that targets first responders.This British-Australian doctor has seen the unspeakable in Gaza. He wants to shout from the rooftopsRead moreThe boys told me how they ran toward the thick smoke and dust. At least 20 other people were already gathered, searching desperately in the dark with nothing but the weak glow of their phone lights. There were small shovels to help with the rescue, but most survivors and neighbours were left to claw through the debris with their bare hands. Large slabs of ceiling had collapsed; anyone trapped beneath them stood no chance. Yet people charged into the wreckage without pause, pulling the wounded from the rubble, cradling lifeless children, and shouting out names into the chaos.This isn’t the first time my family has been hit. On 26 October 2023,bombs rained downon our residential quarter in Khan Younis without warning, killing more than 60 people – 45 of them members of my family. Back then, Ziyad was one of the first to rush to try to rescue his relatives. This time it was too late to rescue him. I’ve long since stopped counting those I’ve lost.My family’s story echoes those of countless families across Gaza whose lives have been shrouded in the darkness of this genocide. I believe that to tell their stories is to defy the darkness. To demand justice is not to ask forcharity – it is a moral obligation. My family was not collateral damage. They were teachers, doctors, students, engineers, social workers, mothers and children – each one snuffed out too early.What offers me solace is that, in the face of this unimaginable cruelty, Palestinians still run to save one another. In pitch darkness, even amid falling rubble and suffocating dust, the light of Palestinian dignity refuses to be extinguished. These lights call all of us to be witnesses to the brutality, and are lights of hope that the suffering of Palestinians can be brought to an end immediately.Ghada Ageel, a third-generation Palestinian refugee, worked as a translator for the Guardian in Gaza from 2000 to 2006.

Surprisingly, almost all the reaction to the conversation has ignored this bombshell – Engelbert apparently not such a big player in the culture war world; best focus on your Middle Easts, your Bravermans, your impartialities, Brian.Of course the job of news outlets is to pick out headlines but it does appear almost no one has watched the whole programme. It’s essentially a nice wide-ranging interview covering the career of one of the best English footballers and football broadcasters of all time.Pundits’ showy partisanship reflects football’s embrace of fan-centric populism | Jonathan LiewRead moreWe learn that his parents weren’t that pushy, that his life changed after that hat-trick against Poland in ‘86. He discusses Diego Maradona and the state of that pitch at the Estadio Azteca, the terrible foul on Glenn Hoddle just before Barry Davies talks us through one of the greatest goals of all time: “You have to say that’s magnificent.”We learn about his views on gambling, the secret to scoring goals, his incredibly moving testimony about almost losing his son to leukemia.He talks about being thrust into the Grandstand presenter’s chair when Des Lynam was at Aintree the day the Grand National was abandoned because of a bomb scare, and explains that those lines whenever England are knocked out of a major tournament are off the cuff. There’s hilarious footage of him running away from paps half his age to catch a train during the Match Of the Day debacle.But then comes the headline-grabbing stuff: on being stood down from Match of the Day that Friday in 2023, onsigning a letterto have a Gaza documentary put back on iPlayer, and ultimately on whether the BBC wanted him to leave.Depending on your political allegiance this is just one bigBBCcircle jerk, or Lineker has taken Auntie to the cleaners.The usual suspects line up to have a go at one of their favourite targets. “Arrogant BBC interview proves he still just doesn’t get it,” saysthe Telegraph. TheDaily Expressquotes a body language expert who says he showed signs of “anger and unhappiness”.

Presumably because it would be a monumentally stupid waste of a question.View image in fullscreenGary Lineker attempts to walk his dog near his London home amid the scrutiny that followed his suspension from Match of the Day in March 2023.Photograph: Niklas Halle’n/AFP/Getty ImagesOn Gaza, theJewish Chronicleopens its opinion piece: “One of the BBC’s biggest problems can be summed up in two words: Gary and Lineker.” While at the other end of the spectrum, onhis YouTube channelthe Guardian’s Owen Jones entitles an episode: “Gary Lineker shames BBC over Gaza.”I’m not sure Lineker does that. He appears very sympathetic to the BBC bosses who have to make difficult editorial decisions. But he remains adamant that he was right to sign the letter to have Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone reinstated on the iPlayer despite the 13-year-old narrator’sdad being a Hamas official. Can the wrong messenger still tell you the right message? “I think you let people make their own minds up,” Lineker said. “We’re adults. We’re allowed to see things like that. It’s incredibly moving … I think [the BBC] just capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot.”The word lobbying is problematic, inadvertently invoking the trope of some secretive cabal of Jewish people pulling the strings behind the scenes. But Lineker appears to take the rational view that the7 October massacrewas abhorrent, but that history didn’t begin on that date. And it is incorrect to see all criticism of the Israeli state as antisemitic, especially given how many innocent people, including so many children, have been killed. As I have mentioned before, my family changed our name because of antisemitic threats in the 80s. I’d be an odd antisemite – like Lineker, I’d just like the killing to stop.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But as someone with an (albeit much smaller) platform, the question of which subjects to speak about on social media and on air are interesting.My impression from broadcasting across the BBC, Sky and TalkSport among others over the past 23 years is that most bosses would prefer you just talked about sport – although I’ve never been told what to say, or perhaps more importantly what not to say. Just keeping numerous TV channels or radio stations on air is hard enough before worrying about what your presenters have tweeted or said on air. Even managers want an easy life.But you have to push back sometimes. I had a producer once say: “Can we not talk about domestic violence today? It’s Friday.”I was once co-hosting a radio show with a former professional footballer. During the show I got another ex-pro, the former Australia international Craig Foster, a human rights activist, on air to raise awareness of a campaign to free a footballer from a Thai jail, from where he was due to be extradited to Bahrain on false charges. My co-host’s response: “I’m not really into those things.” Human rights, it’s not just not my thing.BBC impartiality views to one side, do we expect people in sport to have no view on the outside world? They are still humans, being humans in the world like everyone else. Surely the key is balance and timing.Lineker has never talked about Brexit or the plight of the Palestinian people before introducing Jonathan Pearce at Selhurst Park for Crystal Palace v Bournemouth. Perhaps it’s no surprise that one woke snowflake lefty agrees with another one but in this interview, and in our very occasional meetings, he comes across as a guy who is good at what he does and cares about other people. It actually feels so dramatically uncontroversial.Match of the Day will be fine without him – it is in the hands ofthree brilliant broadcasters. Perhaps now people will leave Lineker to do his podcasts rather than obsessing about every tiny little thing he did yesterday.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s time to break up the companyCourtney C RadschTwo recent US cases have found the search giant is functioning as an illegal monopoly. This should be a turning pointThu 24 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 08.25 EDTShareIn less than a year, US courts have ruled that the world’s most powerful tech company broke the law – twice.In August,a federal judge in Washington ruledthat Google illegally maintained its search monopoly by locking up defaults on browsers and devices. InApril, a federal judgein Virginia found that Google illegally monopolized the digital advertising market, manipulating auctions, restricting and stifling competitors. These two rulings, the most significant antitrust wins against a tech giant in decades, should be a turning point in the digital economy.The rulings against Google’s illegal monopoly in digital advertising offer a once-in-a-generation chance to redesign the infrastructure of surveillance that underpins Google’s ill-gotten dominance. But if regulators settle for symbolic fines or behavioral tweaks, it will do nothing to structurally reform the business model and incentives that underpin Google’s illegal dominance. In a three-week hearing that began this week,the US justice department is urging a judgeto break up the company. Whether we seize this moment to break up these concentrations of power will shape the future of markets, media and democratic governance.Google is emblematic of the platform economy in which we now live. The Silicon Valley corporation and its platform brethren provide core infrastructure – for advertising, for information access, for the economy at large. Google’s control of the search ecosystem, from its Chrome browser and Android operating system to its dominance in digital advertising and search, gives it unrivaled power over who gets heard and who gets paid. That power has stifled competition,undermined journalismand distorted the digital economy.The courts have now recognized what myfellow criticshave arguedfor years and whatregulatorsaround the worldhave similarly determined: Google illegally leverages its dominance in one market to reinforce its control in another.As addressed in the ad tech case, Google manipulated auctions and structured its business to advantage its own services at the expense of publishers and rivals, turning its ad exchange into what one employee called an “authoritarian intermediary”. As a result of its illegal monopoly, and by its own estimates, Google pockets on average more than 30% of the advertising dollars that flow through its digital advertising technology products; in some transactions and with certain publishers and advertisers, it takes far more.As discussed inthe search case, Google paid billions annually to be the default search engine on devices and browsers, effectively shutting out competitors and securing its control of 90% of the search market. And Google is now usingthe data generatedthroughout these products and its monopoly profits to secure its dominance in AI.Regulators around the world have converged on similar verdicts and would like to see structural changes, though they seem to have been waiting to see what happened in the US cases. In 2023, the European Commissionconcludedthat only divestiture could remedy Google’s ad tech conflicts of interest. Googleoffered to sell its AdX exchange, but European publishers and regulators rejected the move as insufficient. In the UK, Google is nowfacinga £5bn class-action lawsuit for abusing its search dominance along with acompetition strategic market statusinvestigation, which could result in structural or behavioral remedies.These global actions reflect a growing consensus: Google’s power is infrastructural and self-reinforcing. It controls the tools that decide what we know, what we see and who profits. The implications are especially acute for journalism, which has been hollowed out by Google’s ad market manipulation and search favoritism. In an era ofgenerative AI, where foundation models are trained on the open web and commodify news content without compensation, this market power becomes even more perfidious.Meaningful remedies require structural separation supported by behavioral changes to prevent future anticompetitive behaviors, including in the market for artificial intelligence. First, Google should be required to divest parts of its ad tech stack, spin off Chrome and ensure interoperability. Vertical integration has allowed it to dominateevery layer of digital advertising, from the tools publishers use to the auctions that determine ad placement. Breaking up that stack would create space for competition and innovation.Second, regulators should enforce interoperability and transparency. Let competitors have access to or build on Google’s core infrastructure. Let users choose and switch search engines and browsers easily, enabling them to take their data and easily shift providers. RequireGoogleto disclose how it trains its AI models and how it uses publisher content.Third,global coordinationshould be built into enforcement. Antitrust remedies must be aligned across jurisdictions to prevent regulatory arbitrage and make retaliatory American actions more difficult. The US cases should embolden regulators elsewhere to act swiftly.Finally, we must recognize that these antitrust cases are not just about prices or innovation. They are about power. Who sets the rules for how knowledge circulates? Who profits from public discourse? Who benefits from the infrastructure of the modern economy? If we allow Google to keep its hydra-headed corporation intact, the same dynamics will replicate themselves under the guise of AI innovation.The courts have shown that Google broke the law. Now, governments must show that the law still has teeth. That means structural remedies, not settlements. Transformation, not tinkering.If we fail to act now, we may not get another chance.Dr Courtney C Radsch is director of the Center for Journalism and Liberty at Open Markets InstituteExplore more on these topicsGoogleOpinionLaw (US)Search enginesAlphabetcommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s how Labour will achieve itNick Thomas-SymondsThis isn’t about politics – it’s about pragmatism. Working with our allies will make British people safer, more secure and more prosperousThu 24 Apr 2025 06.47 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 08.41 EDTShareLabour has been determined to negotiate a new partnership with the EU. The benefits it could unlock are clear – reducing barriers to trade, driving economic growth and keeping us safe in an increasingly dangerous world. It is the sensible, pragmatic thing to do. We want to put more money in the pockets of working people and provide Britain with long-term stability and security; we won’t be defined by debates and arguments of the past.We are equally confident in what the UK can offer in return. It is a politically stable country, and the government has a huge mandate, with more than four years left to deliver our policies. This stability has already inspired the confidence of businessesacross the world, unlocking tens of billions of pounds of long-term investment. This month, Universal announced a multi-billion-pound investment for anew theme park, expected to create 28,000 jobs. We have shown that Britain is back on the world stage, and that it has a lot to offer.The events of recent weeks have seen the UK step up alongside its European partners and play a leading role in the global response to a series of historic events. Russia’s continued aggression in Ukraine has required a momentousresponse from Europe. It has seen European nations come together in defence of our continent, going further than ever on defence spending to keep Ukraine in the fight for as long as it takes. I am proud that the UK has contributed £15bn in support of Ukrainian sovereignty.Labour is rising to meet the challenges in this new era of global instability. It has pumped money into defence, and its first budget restored economic stability.The government needs to work with Britain’s allies on solutions that will minimise the impact of these global shocks. Today, Keir Starmer ishosting Ursula von der Leyenat Downing Street. They will be discussing how countries can work together to deliver energy security, as well as the progress made strengthening the UK-EU relationship since the election.Their meeting is a clear example of global leaders working together on issues that matter to people – such asUkraine, energy security and the global economy. It will also be an opportunity to take stock of the progress made in our negotiations for a better deal with the EU, and make sure teams are meeting our aspirations – to grow the economy, boost living standards and keep the UK safe –when we kicked off this work last October.Pursuing a new partnership with the EU is about meeting the needs of our times. This is not about ideology or returning to the divisions of the past, but about ruthless pragmatism and what works in the national interest. For me, that means working with our allies in the EU to make people across the continent safer, more secure and more prosperous. The EU is our largest trading partner and this government is determined to work to reduce barriers to trade across the economy to help drive growth. Just last week, for example, we saw major retailers such as Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Lidl and Ocadosupporting the government’s aimto negotiate an agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) with the EU, to reduce paperwork and checks, making it easier to do business.There is a way to turn Trump’s chaos into an opportunity. Here is what European leaders must do | Paul TaylorRead moreWhen it comes to security, Nato is the cornerstone of our defence. Now is the time for us to unite across our continent in order to guarantee the best outcome for Ukraine, protect European security and secure our collective future. In the UK we are stepping up, and I know European countries are doing the same. This year we expect the UK to provide £4.5bn in support to Ukraine, more than in any previous year. But there is more the UK and EU can do together to rise to this moment.We are also determined to keep our streets safe. As part of our plan to do this, we have already increased the UK’s presence at Europol to tackle cross-border crime, such as the scourges of human trafficking and drug smuggling.I want us to go further to work with our partners across the continent to smash criminal gangs operating across Europe and smuggling contraband into the UK.All of this will be framed by the very clear red lines we set out at the election. We won’t return to the arguments of the past: there will be no return to the single market, the customs union or freedom of movement. We will only agree an EU deal that meets the needs of the British people and respects the 2016 referendum result. By doing this we will seize the opportunities in front of us to deliver a better future.Nick Thomas-Symonds is paymaster general, minister for the Cabinet Office and minister for the constitution and EU relationsExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionEuropeUkraineLabourKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

We know because Keir Starmer told usThu 24 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 06.50 EDTShareThose of us who try to defend wildlife are horribly familiar with bad laws. But we’ve never seen anything like this. The government’splanning and infrastructure billis the worst assault on England’s ecosystems in living memory. It erasesdecades of environmental protections, including legislation we inherited from the EU, which even the Tories promised to uphold.The rules defending wildlife and habitats from unscrupulous developers areweak enough already, which is partly why, as Labourreminded us in its manifesto, Britain is “one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world”. But this bill will make it much, much worse.At present, builders aresupposed to followa “mitigation hierarchy”: avoid, minimise, mitigate, offset. Ideally, they should avoid building in places of high wildlife value, especially irreplaceable habitats. If that isn’t possible, they should minimise the harm inflicted. Then they should mitigate that harm, by restoring the habitats they’ve damaged. Only if all these options are exhausted should they seek to offset the damage by creating habitat elsewhere. This final gambit is generally themost expensive and least successful.The new bill scratches all that, jumping straight to option 4: offsetting. By paying a “nature restoration levy”, developers will be allowed to trash whatever habitats – woods, meadows, wetlands, streams – stand in their way. Once they’ve paid, the bill states, they can “disregard” the impact of destroying a protected feature. The details are remarkably, horrifyingly vague: the secretary of state merely needs to believe that the levy is “likely”, one day, to create new habitat to deem the damage “outweighed”.Some ecosystems, such as ancient woodlands, ancient meadows and chalk streams, simply cannot be replaced. But the bill pretends that everything is tradeable. You can destroy an ancient woodland,as long as you deliveran “overall improvement” in woodland cover, namely saplings in plastic tubes. Anyway, we won’t even know what we are losing, as the new legislation negates the requirement to conduct ecological site surveys. How can you measure an “overall improvement” if you don’t have a baseline? Without surveys, no one can be charged with wildlife crime for destroying habitats and species, as there will be no evidence. It’s the kind of anti-scientific, pro-corporate scrubbing of expertise we see in Donald Trump’s US.Even if a huge impact is somehow identified, the bill insists that the levy for offsetting habitat destruction cannot be high enough to make the development “economically unviable”. So developers have no incentive to avoid trashing rare and beautiful places, as their profits will be protected by law.Inevitably, this will reduce the provision of urban green spaces. Building land is expensive; farmland much cheaper. It will always be in a developer’s interest to build over urban habitats while paying for restoration in the countryside. Asevidence gatheredacrossthree decadesshows, this will haveserious impactson local people’s physical and mental health. Like austerity, deregulation tends not to save money, but to shift costs from the rich to the poor and the private sector to the state.Across my long and largely futile career, I’ve read innumerable reports by professional bodies. But neverone as scathingas the note last month by the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management. “It is evident that the broad consensus of concern raised by a wide range of environmental professionals, professional bodies, NGOs, learned societies and developers” has been “entirely disregarded in the bill drafting process … no meaningful inclusions have been made to address the significant issues identified”. The government hasintroduced the billwithout an evidence base, truncating its own consultations and expert assessments. Its “lack of transparency”, and “failure to follow an objective, evidence-led, democratic process” is “reckless”.So who has the government listened to? Astonishingly, Keir Starmerhas told us. His attack on environmental regulation, he states, has been inspired by “my conversations with leading CEOs”. He seems blissfully unaware that this is the bit you are not supposed to say. Politicians are meant to sustain the illusion that governments exist to enact the will of the people, not the will of the corporations.If you listen only to corporations, you’re a dupe. Of course, they will produce justifications for the harmful things they want. Of course, they will tell you that rules are too onerous, taxes too high and subsidies too low. It takes spectacular political naivety to take them at their word. But Starmer seems happy to be conned.The story they have told him, which he recites like an automaton, is that development is beingimpeded by “blockers”,“time-wasting nimbys”and “zealots”. The case that he and the billionaire presscite repeatedlyis HS2’s £100m tunnel to protect bats. How’s that for regulator overreach? But had ecologists been brought in at the beginning of the planning process, they would have advised avoiding the ancient woodland the railway bisects, saving HS2 a ton of money and trouble.Planning bill ‘throws environmental protection to the wind’, say UK nature chiefsRead moreA combination of a lack of foresight andthe dire undercapacityof local authorities and government regulators, caused by austerity, are the main impediments to development, not ecological surveys and consultation. As ecological consultants explain to me, many of the delays developers bemoan are actually caused by the companies themselves, commissioning surveys at the last minute, rather than designing them into the process. Nature is ever the afterthought. And afterthoughts are expensive.In its manifesto,Labourpromised “to restore and protect our natural world” and “to unlock the building of homes … without weakening environmental protections”.Well, I guess you could argue it isn’t weakening them. It’s deleting them.Like the government’snew anti-protest law, exacerbating the Conservatives’ draconian measures, this bill betrays an undemocratic impatience with the people, motivated by the blatant appeasement of corporate power. Just as the US iscaptured by a billionaire death cult, our government is opening the door to the same forces.All this is supposed to promote economic growth, which appears to be Labour’s sole remaining principle. Trashing the living world to stimulate growth is like sacrificing virgins to secure a good harvest: it’s cruel, ignorant and ineffective. If anything, it willhave the opposite effect.Environmental defenders were wary of Starmer’s Labour party, though I don’t think anyone believed it would be worse than the Tories. But here we are. Its legacy, if this terrible bill is approved, will be a grimmer, greyer, unhappier nation.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPlanning policyOpinionWildlifeEconomic growth (GDP)Keir StarmerLabourConstruction industryPropertycommentShareReuse this content"

Bill Maher did: who’ll be next?Emma BrockesAfter the apparent defanging of the once critical talkshow host, can the president get more stars onside? Some nuts will be tougher to crack than othersThu 24 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 21.48 EDTShareIf President Trump invited you to the White House, would you go? This is the question US hacks and other media personalities have been asking themselves since the inauguration, an American version of that self-flattering British perennial: when Buckingham Palace calls, will you be buying a fascinator to accept the OBE? In both cases, no matter how pluckily anti-establishment an individual may have been to that point, the answer is often a resounding: you bet!First, the rationalisations. In the US context, respect for the “office of the president”, for which there is no British equivalent that doesn’t prompt sniggering, is taken seriously enough that if the president calls, you don’t turn him down. There’s the standard argument in favour of engagement over boycott as a more constructive path to account-holding. And there is, for hacks, the perfectly reasonable rationale of pursuing the story. Ofcourse,you’re going to say yes if Trump calls. How could you not?The question is what happens next – and it’s a tricky one, isn’t it? One minute you’re hurtling towards Washington DC on the Acela Express train fully intending to speak truth to power, the next you’ve tripped on the rug and somehow become Albert Speer. It isn’t known what Bill Maher, the comedian, talkshow host and, until recently, fierce critic of Trump, thought he was up to last month when he accepted an invitation to dine with the president. But after the event, he treated us to alove letterto a man he found to be full of “good humour”, “generous”, “without animus”, as well as “gracious and measured” – almost as if successful politicians have the ability to turn on the charm. “Just for starters,” said Maher, “he laughs!” Like Garbo!Trump chose his target well, promoting the encounter as a robust piece of engagement with a foe – “a man who has been unjustifiably critical of anything, or anyone, TRUMP”,posted the presidentbefore the meeting – when in fact Maher’s been a creepy little men’s rights guy dispensing fat jokes and gags for some time that turn on the punchline “retarded”. He’s not Stephen Colbert or even Bill Burr, and it’s significant that Trump hasn’t, for example, taken up Jon Stewart’s offer to publicly debate him. Instead, this meeting, apparently“brokered” by Kid Rock, was another example of Trump’s ability to spot an easy mark. “That’s how it went down, make of it what you will,” said Maher whimsically, and what people havemade of itis that Bill Maher’s an idiot.‘I must say, mein Führer, I’m so thankful I came’: Larry David spoofs Bill Maher’s fawning White House visit with TrumpRead moreMaher is only the starkest example of a general softening since January of the cultural resistance to Trump. Remember when George Clooney wrote hisstirring little op-edfor the New York Times urging his fellow Americans to ditch Joe Biden? No follow-up piece since then, from George, or much in the way of public protest from any of the other celebrities who stumped for Kamala Harris. Clooney didshow upthis week on Gayle King’s CBS show, but that was to promote something, namely the “huge responsibility” of his new Broadway play about Edward R Murrow. Clooney, a man whose charm you imagine even Maher might find himself able to see through, responded toTrump’s mockery– “a second-rate movie ‘star’ and failed political pundit” – with the words, “My job is not to please the president of the United States. My job is to try and tell the truth”, before King moved the subject on to the colour of his hair.Anyway, back to Maher, who got his comeuppance. Whatever you do in life you really don’t want Larry David writing asatirical pieceabout you in the New York Times that includes the line: “Göring, with his mouth full, asked what was so funny, and Hitler said, ‘I was just telling him about the time my dog had diarrhea in the Reichstag’.” And it remains the case that pushback against Trump can be hard to get right.I say, let’s hear it for Rosie O’Donnell for making good on her threat to move countries if Trump got elected: she is now living in Ireland. Likewise for Ellen DeGeneres, whomoved to the Cotswolds, while we must assume that Cher, Sharon Stone, Miley Cyrus and Whoopi Goldberg are still waiting on a third quote from movers – but the three Yale professors who moved to Canada for the same reason havecopped some flakfor leaving the fight. You can’t win, perhaps. But watching Maher this week, there are better ways of losing.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionCelebrityGeorge ClooneyUS televisionTelevisionBill MahercommentShareReuse this content"

In St Peter’s Basilica, where he now lies in state, Francis’s bodyrestsin an unelaborate coffin and has not been placed on the traditional elevated bier. Thetombin which he will be buried is to be underground and unadorned, carrying only the plain inscription “Franciscus”, again on his instructions.The final grace notes of a remarkable papacy will add to the pathos of Saturday’sfuneral, which hundreds of thousands of mourners are expected to attend. The Argentinian pope’s plain, direct style endeared him to millions of non-Catholics as well as to the faithful. But the ecclesiastical politics of what happens next, in a divided church, will be anything but straightforward.The papalconclavedue to commence in May will play a crucial role in determining the durability of Francis’s reforming legacy. Traditionalists railed bitterly at the pope’s pastoral approach to questions of sexuality and diversity, his disdain for hierarchy and dogma, and his emphasis on social and environmental justice. They will see the chance of a conservative reset.For cardinals from the global south – appointedin large numbersby Francis as he sought to reflect the geographical realities of 21st-century Catholicism – the conclave is an opportunity to exert influence on behalf of the church in Africa and Asia. That may point towards the election of a pope sharing Francis’s passionate emphasis on addressing global inequality, the climate emergency and defending the rights of migrants. On the other hand, the morally conservative outlookdominantin many African churches could lead to alliances with western traditionalists, to the benefit of a theological hardliner able to garner support from both constituencies.At this stage, “runners and riders” lists of the supposedly “papabili” are stimulating sources of gossip, but not much more. Many of the newer cardinal electors are unknown quantities in Rome, and unknown to each other. As the Oscar-winning filmConclavevividly portrayed, the political dynamics that play out in the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel are generally shifting and impossible to predict. No one, for example, saw Karol Wojtyla of Krakow coming in the late 1970s.The impact of the subsequentpapacyof John Paul II serves to highlight the potential stakes for non-Catholics as well as believers. The 1980s saw the church under his leadership play an influential role in the tumultuous period leading to the collapse of communism and the end of the cold war. Although theologically conservative at a time when secularisation in the west was accelerating, the Polish pope was in tune with changing times when it came to the victorious struggle against authoritarian regimes in eastern Europe.In contrast, Francis sometimes cut an isolated figure as he opposed a new authoritarian turn in the politics of the west.Deploringthe rise of aggressive nationalisms and the erosion of democratic norms, he became a lonely but vital bulwark of resistance in the name of universal rights and values. Progressives inside and outside the church must hope that, in an unstable and dangerously volatile era, that witness can be built upon by the next pontiff. But ahead of an unusually large and an unusually unpredictable conclave, all bets are off.Explore more on these topicsThe papacyOpinionCatholicismPope FrancisReligionChristianityConclavePope John Paul IIeditorialsShareReuse this content"

It is an old topic given fresh impetus by the revelation that Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, discussed the prospects of a “coalition” to “unite the right” at a meeting of Tory activists last month.Whether that means a formal deal or some looser alignment, there is an obvious electoral rationale for the proposition. But its public endorsement is still taboo in a party that sees itself as the natural ruling authority in Britain, only occasionally and temporarily forced to sojourn in opposition.The Tories do not like to share power and yet, as the third-placed party in opinion polls, they don’t have an obvious alternative route to victory. In many constituencies the combined Conservative and Reform vote shares at the last election exceeded the victorious Labour candidate’s majority. Basic arithmetic makes chatter about alliances inevitable.The calculus of a pact is more complex than simply adding two numbers. There is very considerable ideological overlap between Reform and Tory platforms, but their potential support does not come from a single pool of interchangeable voters.There are people whose trust in the Tory party is irretrievably broken and who are attracted to Nigel Farage because he represents rupture from the old two-party system. The Reform leader has no incentive to indulge talk of a tactical coalition that would only dilute his brand as the scourge of a Westminster establishment. There are also former Conservatives who rejected the party in 2024, oftenin favour of the Liberal Democrats, because Rishi Sunak’s government looked chaotic, incompetent and plain nasty. Those voters might not be lost to the Tories forever, but their concerns are compounded by proximity to Mr Farage.Conservatives speculate about deals with Reform because it is easier than finding a strategy to rebuild a broad base of support.Kemi Badenochhas failed comprehensively to address this problem. Her analysis of last year’s election result is incomplete at best, more often incoherent. She offers no insight or contrition when it comes to the role that the decline in public services played in voter rejection of Tory rule. She seems drawn to culture war battles and febrile, polarised digital discourse at the expense of real-world policy development. Mr Jenrick, who was beaten by Mrs Badenoch in last year’s leadership contest, and who scarcely hides his ambition to replace her, has nothing new or more substantial to say about his party’s predicamentMuch discussion of electoral pacts is really a diversion from the broader question of whether the UK’s voting system is capable of turning public preferences into fair parliamentary representation. The evidencesuggests not. The disparity between Labour’s huge Commons majority and modest national vote share testifies tounderlying volatilityand ongoing decay of the traditional affiliations that once made British party politics a duopoly.Mr Jenrick is not the first politician to grasp what that means in terms of third-placed parties ever being in a position to form a government. That is an insight of sorts, but Conservative energies might better be spent understanding the reasons why their time in office led to a collapse in support so extreme that they struggle now even to be the main party of opposition.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Sorry, but I’m not convinced, theguardian.com, 17 April). But the voting age of 18 is an arbitrary threshold. Quite a recent one too – until 1969 the minimum voting age in Britain was 21. Other countries have minimum voting ages from 16 to 21. In Vatican City, voting for a new pope is restricted to cardinalsunderthe age of 80.The usual argument for denying the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds hinges on their supposed lack of certain capacities such as political awareness or powers of reasoning. But if we accept this, perhaps we should also put a ceiling on voting age too, as they do in the Vatican. After all, for every 16-year-old too clueless to understand what they are doing in a voting booth, there must be several geriatrics (and several more not so geriatric) who are just as incompetent.Moreover, while some 90-year-olds have pin-sharp minds, so too are there plenty of 16-year-olds who easily clear any reasonable cognitive threshold we might set for voting rights. Of course they should be able to vote if they want to.Robin PriorWargrave, BerkshireSimon Jenkins questions the case for votes at 16 without acknowledging the existing statutory subject that helps prepare young people for democratic life: citizenship.Citizenship has been a national curriculum subject since 2002. It equips pupils with essential knowledge about democracy, law, rights and how to engage critically and responsibly in civic life. It also directly supports the development of media and information literacy – skills urgently needed, as highlighted in recent findings by the NASUWT teaching union on the harmful influence of social media in schools (Teachers warn of rise in misogyny and racism in UK schools, 19 April).This context makes the currentDepartment for Educationcurriculum and assessment review a vital moment to reassert the importance of citizenship education. A coherent, statutory citizenship curriculum from primary age through post-16 would give all students the tools to understand complex issues, challenge harmful narratives and participate meaningfully in society.If society wants young people to vote, contribute and take responsibility, we must ensure that they are taught to have an understanding of how democracy works. Citizenship education is the best foundation we have – and it already exists. Let’s recognise it, strengthen it and give it the place it deserves in our education system.Liz MoorseChief executive, Association for Citizenship TeachingSimon Jenkins suggests that many 16-year-olds may not vote. There are many reasons why young people may not wish to engage in politics, and they are as vulnerable to misinformation as any other group. But with general elections every four or five years, the first opportunity for them to vote in one may be when they are 21 or 22. By this time, they will have been excluded from the democratic process for so long that they will not feel they can shape the laws that we are supposed to respect.I know from debates with sixth formers that many of them are as well qualified as any other age group to engage sensibly in informed political discussion. Nobody is suggesting that it should be compulsory for them to vote, and we should not block their participation because they might vote the wrong way.ChrisRennardLiberal Democrat, House of LordsHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

A homegrown talent, the 19-year-old winger has done well in his Conference League outings and is in contention for his first start in the league when Enzo Maresca’s side host Everton in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off. Fast, direct and sharp on the ball, George has quickly become a favourite with supporters and he lifted some of the pressure off Maresca after coming off the bench to score an excellent equaliser inChelsea’s comeback win at Fulhamlast weekend. Thrown on as a striker, George made it 1-1 with a fine shot from the edge of the area. It was the latest in a series of positive contributions from the teenager. His enthusiasm could make a difference against Everton.Jacob SteinbergChelsea v Everton,Premier League, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)2Hürzeler needs to snooze, not lose“I have been trying to improve my sleep but it doesn’t happen overnight,” said Fabian Hürzeler this week. The Brighton manager – “dressed head to toe in Stone Island” for his interview with GQ Magazine – revealed he had employed a sleep expert who recommended changing his daily routine. “Because of that I bought an electric bike for the half-hour commute to work. It helps me relax more than going by car.” With West Ham visiting the Amex Stadium on Saturday, Brighton supporters will be hoping that Hürzeler’s peace of mind can inspire a turnaround in their fortunes after a miserable few weeks that have derailed their push for Europe. Graham Potter’s side have a terrible record against his former club, having beaten them once since Brighton were promoted in 2017, although that came the last time this fixture took place, at the start of last season.Ed AaronsBrighton v West Ham, Premier League, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenFabian Hürzeler (second from left) is seeking a first victory in six league games for his Brighton side.Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters3Can McKenna prolong inevitable drop?Should Jack Clarke start for Ipswich or, more likely , step off the bench, he can be expected to be greeted by resounding boos. That is the fate of any former Sunderland player appearing at St James’ Park. But Clarke might welcome a bit of recognition after a season in which his newfound status as a bit-part player has served as a microcosm of the gulf between the top and second tiers. The winger starred at Sunderland last season, prompting the initial £15m transfer fee that transported him to East Anglia. The only problem was that Premier League full-backs have proved far less susceptible to his advances than their Championship counterparts. While his old friends at Sunderland prepare for the playoffs, Ipswich will have their relegation rubber-stamped unless they beat Champions League-chasing Newcastle. All eyes will be on Liam Delap, Kieran McKenna’s much-coveted centre-forward. Chelsea andManchester Unitedmay be favourites to sign Delap this summer but Newcastle retain an interest and this could prove a timely audition.Louise TaylorNewcastle v Ipswich, Premier League, Saturday 3pm4Saints look to dodge unwanted recordCould this be Southampton’s day of glory? After reaching the monumental heights of 11 points last week with aninjury-time equaliser at West Ham, Simon Rusk’s side could surpass Derby in 2007-08, the worst team in Premier League history, if they avoid losing against Fulham. The first positive for Saints is they did just that atCraven Cottage in December with a goalless draw, one of four league games they have not lost away from home this season. Unfortunately, their home form is somehow even worse. They have won once, againstSean Dyche’s appalling version of Everton, and battled todraws with IpswichandCrystal Palace. With Manchester City and Arsenal to come in their final Premier League games at St Mary’s for a while, this is a fantastic opportunity to put the points tally concerns to bed. Better news for Saints fans is that Fulham have endured a late-season wobble, losing their past two matches to leave them potentially eyeing up their summer holidays.Will UnwinSouthampton v Fulham, Premier League, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenLesley Ugochukwu’s late leveller at West Ham means Southampton have picked up more points away than at home this season.Photograph: Tony O Brien/Reuters5End of an era for Vardy and LeicesterJamie Vardy’sexit at the end of the seasonmarks the end of an era for Leicester City, with the 38-year-old the last remaining member of the 2015-16 title-winning squad. Relegation this campaign will invariably trigger change and there are big decisions for the chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, to consider. Ruud van Nistelrooy is unlikely to start next season in charge, while the work of Jon Rudkin, the director of football who began at Leicester as a part-time academy coach, is the subject of much disillusionment. If Vardy plays every remaining game this season, starting at Wolves on Saturday, he will break the 500-game mark in a Leicester shirt. His achievements will go down in club folklore. Vardy is worthy of the statue mooted after he announced his departure on Thursday – but now Leicester need new heroes.Ben FisherWolves v Leicester, Premier League, Saturday 3pm6Emery finds himself in another dogfightConsidering the teams Aston Villa have beaten this season, including Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain andManchester City, it will irk Unai Emery that in three matches against Crystal Palace they have failed to win, losing away and drawing at home in the league, and losing at Villa Park in the League Cup. It has been almost 30 years since Villa last won a major trophy and playing a team five places and 12 points below them in the league should be an ideal situation. Oliver Glasner seems to be one step ahead of Emery at the moment, though. Even in the 2-2 draw at Villa Park, Palace were the better team and repeatedly hit the hosts on the break. It will be up to the Villa manager to find a way to counter the speed of Eberechi Eze and Ismaïla Sarr, or Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final could be the biggest disappointment of the four meetings with Palace this term.WUCrystal Palace v Aston Villa, FA Cup semi-final, Saturday 5.15pm7Amorim should know the kids are all rightRuben Amorim will use more of his youngsters in the coming weeks as heprioritises the Europa League semi-final against Athletic Bilbao. Manchester United desperately need to qualify for the Champions League and this is the only route back to European football next season. Amorim showed his intent by starting the highly regarded Tyler Fredricson and Harry Amassagainst Wolves. On the bench, however, the only academy player present was Chido Obi. That seems strange considering Jaydan Kamason, Godwill Kukonki and Jack Moorhouse were named as substitutesagainst Lyon. There were even three centre-backs for the Wolves fixture, including Jonny Evans, whose time at the club is rapidly running out. If Amorim is to take his policy seriously, he needs to back the kids.WUBournemouth v Manchester United, Premier League, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenTyler Fredricson (right) started for Manchester United at home to Wolves, but will more youngsters join him?Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA8Don’t expect Spurs to spoil Anfield partyOne point, just one point, and Tottenham will leapfrog Wolves into 15th providing Vítor Pereira’s in-form side suffer a surprise home defeat against Leicester the day before. Apologies for the flippancy, but that sums up the meagre opposition standing in the way ofLiverpooland a monumental party on Sunday. Anfield awaits a second Premier League title in five years, although it will be the first time since 28 April 1990 that fans will be able to join the celebrations when Arne Slot’s side get the job done. They could not have picked a more inviting opponent than a Spurs team who have endured 10 away defeats in the league – only relegated Leicester and Southampton have more. Liverpool have already beaten Spurs 6-3 and 4-0 (the latter in the League Cup) this season, and Tottenham have a Europa League semi-final first leg to come next Thursday. Having won the league by beating Spurs at Anfield twice before, in 1981-82 and 1987-88, it would register as a seismic shock should the hosts fail to make it a hat-trick on Sunday. Anfield has waited long enough.Andy HunterLiverpool v Tottenham, Premier League, Sunday 4.30pm9Gibbs-White gears up for City auditionMorgan Gibbs-White has been linked with a move to Manchester City this summer as Pep Guardiola seeks a creative replacement for Kevin De Bruyne. The England international’s majestic skills as an attacking midfielder are a key reason behind Forest’s challenge for a Champions League spot and progress to an FA Cup semi-final. The 25-year-old has scored five and assisted nine in 29 Premier League appearances. It is this level of output that has attracted City; it shows he has the dynamism and physical attributes to make a difference for an elite team. Forest have a previous Wembley hero, their former manager Steve Cooper, to thank for his arrival at the City Ground. Despite Wolvesnot budging on their £35m price, Cooper did not want second-best. Gibbs-White will have another chance to show Guardiola what he has in his locker and how he can perform on the biggest stage.WUNottingham Forest v Manchester City, FA Cup semi-final, Sunday 4.30pm10Fans left for dust by overuse of WembleyThere are tickets still available to buy in the Manchester City end at Wembley on Sunday. It is even possible for supporters to buy four seats at a time, although that might not be advisable with many priced at £90, £120 and £150 each. There should be plenty of room to spread out without snapping up extra seats for the sake of it. Partly, the issue is that City have been to Wembley more times recently than anyone cares to remember. The prospect of another expensive day out, including a lengthy trip to London on unreliable trains, is not the enticing prospect it once was for their fans. Besides, hosting a semi-final between teams from Manchester and Nottingham in northwest Londonis pointless and inconsiderate. The FA needs to reconsider their strategy and utilise the country’s many top-class and more convenient stadiums because, once again, it looks like no one cares about supporters.WUPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3344792Arsenal3434673Man City3423614Nottm Forest3314605Newcastle3318596Chelsea3318577Aston Villa345578AFC Bournemouth3312499Fulham3334810Brighton3304811Brentford3364612Crystal Palace34-44513Everton33-63814Man Utd33-83815Wolverhampton33-133816Tottenham Hotspur33103717West Ham33-183618Ipswich33-382119Leicester33-461820Southampton33-5411Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendFA CupLiverpoolArsenalManchester CityNottingham ForestNewcastle UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The gallery is less than 100 in number. Still, there is extra pep in the starter’s voice. Those last four words carry such weight, they conjure such images. Masters champion, Rory McIlroy. An introduction he had waited a lifetime to receive. It somehow felt inadequate that it was over in a split second. “Very nice,” said McIlroy later. “I could get used to it.” He will be afforded that very privilege.Rory McIlroy shaken by scale of ‘absolutely amazing’ reaction to Masters triumphRead moreA 329-yard drive flew down the fairway. The latest chapter of McIlroy’s thrilling, fabled career was under way. Dressed all in black, 11 days after he may as well have worn Superman’s cape. Records will show McIlroy, in partnership with Shane Lowry in better ball format, started life as a grand slam winner with an eight-under-par 64 at the Zurich Classic. Back in the old routine.McIlroy has never needed to chase popularity. The way he plays, the way he talks and, to an extent, the heartache attached to parts of his career means he is the people’s champion. McIlroy is relatable. Unlike Tiger Woods in his prime, he does not pretend to be infallible. It is just that the adulation has been cranked up a notch. Crowds quickly multiplied as McIlroy and Lowry went about their business.Theirs was a subdued round until McIlroy rolled in a lengthy birdie putt at the 1st, the pair’s 10th, and hit an outrageous second at the next to set up an eagle. They will fancy their chances of a successful Zurich defence albeit this was a day on which the Højgaard twins, Rasmus and Nicolai, posted a 59, only to be headed by the 58-shooting Kevin Velo and Isaiah Salinda. Crazy golf.“Shane got off to a really good start,” McIlroy said. “I didn’t do anything. Shane joked I could have had a couple of extra hours in bed if I wanted to. But yeah, I played a bit better coming in. It was OK. We felt like we left a few shots out there.”View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler holds the Green Jacket for Rory McIlroy after Augusta glory.Photograph: John Angelillo/UPI/ShutterstockThere will come a time when Rory’s story will have to project forward. More majors, Ryder Cups, the pursuit of Olympic medals. The US PGA Championship is only three weeks away. It is just that what played out at Augusta National on 13 April was so extraordinary that it requires ongoing analysis.In becoming just the sixth man in history to complete the grand slam, McIlroy was central to one of the most noteworthy major finishes of all time. Events in Georgia mean the 35-year-old is again the hottest ticket in sport. The g-word is overused but McIlroy is indeed a great. He feels “responsibility” in holding the Green Jacket for a year. It is one of McIlroy’s attributes that he has never outwardly changed, despite the inevitable impact of fame and fortune. Masters glory will not alter McIlroy’s values or approach.“It’s another really big tournament, one I had wanted to win for a long time and hadn’t been able to do it so there is a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction,” he said. “That is really nice but I don’tfeeldifferent. I didn’t expect to feel different. I am glad of the experience and glad to have got through it but it wasn’t like I was ever going to wake up the next morning and … ” Hence here he was, on a cloudy morning in Louisiana, back at work.Predictions that McIlroy would end his Masters wait arrived from illustrious observers on the morning the tournament began. Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tom Watson all tipped McIlroy. The man himself acted as if he was unaware what had been said by the honorary starters, when in reality he knew straight away. “I don’t think there was anything that could have happened that I hadn’t heard before,” McIlroy said. “It’s all just noise. I got really used to dealing with noise that week.” McIlroy pauses. “It was nice to prove them right.”McIlroy’s euphoric celebrations on the 18th green at Augusta were instinctive. Something that happened next was not. McIlroy turned to his four-year-old daughter, Poppy, during the prize-giving ceremony and delivered a simple message: “Never, ever, give up on your dreams.” The theme had been scripted.“I hope Poppy had a little clue about what was going on,” McIlroy says with a smile. “That was directed at her but I had also always thought about, if I did win the Masters and completed the slam, what did I want my message to be.

McIlroy could never properly articulate what he went through in round four, where he looked to have the Masters in his grip, wobbled, hauled himself back to the summit but faced a playoff against Justin Rose. What if he had not actually won it?“I don’t even want to think about that,” says McIlroy. “It is hard for me to even watch it back. Just the feelings … aargh.” Still? “Still. I think back to the playoff and don’t know how I hit those three shots. I don’t have a clue. It will be the hardest round of golf I’ll ever have to play. I’m glad I have it behind me.”Private celebrations included a trip home to Belfast, from where McIlroy’s parents had watched the Masters unfold. McIlroy almost tears up when asked about the moment he set eyes on Rosie and Gerry, whose role in the development of a history-maker should never be underplayed. From humble roots, they have seen their only child etch indelible marks in record books. “Emotional,” he says. “It is still emotional. Hopefully they are very proud of their boy.”Had McIlroy won theMasters in 2011, when he collapsed so painfully over the last nine holes, the reaction would have been nothing like what transpired 14 years later. The tension, the drama, the reaching of this promised land turned heads way beyond golf. When Donald Trump contacted McIlroy on the Monday, the US president wanted to analyse the champion’s final round. The broader response to this win was humongous.“While it was happening, I had no idea,” McIlroy says. “I was just trying to win the tournament. Afterwards, yes. People could see the emotion and how much it meant to me.”Elton John was amongst those to get in touch with McIlroy to offer heartfelt congratulations. Rory’s still standing … better than he ever did.Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyGolffeaturesShareReuse this content"

You’re not actually a human. You’re not a person. You don’t have a mum, a dad, a partner who’s going to read that sort of stuff. It’s very bizarre.“It affects my mumway more than it affects me. Whereas for me, I’ve become pretty numb to it. The only reason I call it out is that I have a lot of young kids who follow me, and I don’t want them to think that the reason I’m breaking the British record, or I’m fast, is because I starve myself to do it or that skinny means fast.”However, McColgan admitted that she was stunned that people who hadn’t hidden their identities were also prepared to abuse her.“I always find it bizarre when people have their name and face on there and they’re fully brazen,” she said. “One woman actually said something about my body shape, who was a teacher, and she had a young girl in her profile picture. So I wrote to her to say that the fact that you are openly writing this on my page as a school teacher with a daughter is a disgrace. And then obviously they vanish. They delete it because they panic.“There was one guy who had three young daughters, and one of the comments he made was quite sexualized. I wrote back to him saying: ‘Could you imagine someone saying this to your daughters?’ They don’t think.”But despite all the abuse, McColgan insisted that she would stay on platforms such as Instagram.View image in fullscreenEilish McColgan after winning the 10,000m final at the Commonwealth Games in 2022.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian“Someone said to me, you should just come off social media,” she said. “But would you tell kids that if they get bullied at school to stop going? Or to stop doing what they enjoy because one person is ruining it for you? Why should I change what I do just because of somebody that’s irrelevant for me? That is my mindset.“I’ve had a couple of people message me saying they get bullied at school because of the way they look, so it’s helped them,” added McColgan, whose non-profitGiving Back to Trackhelps young athletes. “It gives them a little bit more confidence to fight their corner. So that’s really the only reason I do call it out.“I would have loved to have been able to pop Kelly Holmes a message. But it’s also trying to get it across to the next generation that in order to get longevity in your career, your utmost priority is looking after your body. And it doesn’t matter what these people online think. They’re not your family, they’re not your friends, they’re people who are irrelevant.”McColgan has set her sights on beating her mum’s personal best of 2hr 26min 52sec in what will be her debut marathon. In reality she may run several minutes quicker, although she admits she is nervous about running the distance for the first time. “I’m absolutely bricking it,” she said. “I’ve never been this scared. It’s just a complete unknown. I’ve run 21 miles in training. We’ve never got anywhere near 26, so what happens after 20 miles? I don’t know, but there’s 55,000 other people on the start line all thinking the exact same thing.“I’m super nervous, but there’s really an overriding feeling of excitement. I can’t wait to be on the streets with people cheering us, and having that sort of buzz in a race.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsLondon MarathonSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

Woollaston, 37, the world No 44, is competing at the Crucible for the first time since 2013. His wife is the snooker referee Tatiana Woollaston.Ronnie O’Sullivan ‘scared about playing’ before beating Ali Carter in world championshipRead more“I didn’t deserve to win,” Selby said. “Ben played some great stuff, his safety was unbelievable at times but I still had my chances. It was pathetic really from me, to play like that is disappointing.“It’s the same old story, I try too hard and stop myself from playing. I love Ben to bits, I’ve known him for years. I grew up with him and have seen him progressing.”Selby appeared far from his normal cool self and an indication of his mood came at the end of the 13th frame, when he grabbed the yellow ball that was over the corner pocket and slammed it across the table before storming out of the arena. Needing snookers, he had erred in leaving the yellow over the pocket.Woollaston, in contrast, was calm and composed throughout as he maintained his 5-4 overnight advantage, to lead 7-6 at the mid-session interval. The next two frames were shared, before Woollaston went 9-7 ahead.Selby pulled one back but the underdog held his nerve to seal the greatest victory of his career, 21 years after he turned professional.Woollaston has struggled with his health and has had enduring blackouts during matches. For several months he struggled with basic tasks, such as standing or staying awake for any length of time.Although not officially diagnosed, Woollaston believes these health issues began after a Covid vaccination nearly four years ago. “I passed out after having it. I couldn’t stand for about six months. I’d never passed out in my life but I had that same feeling for about six months. Standing in the garden, standing in the shower, I felt like I was going to pass out,”he told Leicestershire Live.“I couldn’t sleep enough. I literally woke up to eat because I was sleeping 18 to 20 hours a day. I put loads of weight on because I was just eating and sleeping. It was awful. I’d hit the ball and forget, just for a split second.”View image in fullscreenBen Woollaston was calm and composed as he completed a shock 10-8 win over his friend and fellow Leicester cueist Mark Selby.Photograph: Phil Duncan/Every Second Media/ShutterstockLuca Brecelcompleted an impressive comeback to beatRyan Day10-7 and avoid becoming the latest former champion to exit.The 2023 winner was 5-1 down to Day during the first session. But Brecel won the final three frames on Wednesday to make it 5-4 and get himself right back in the match.Welsh qualifier Day, a three-time Crucible quarter-finalist, made a ­century in the opening frame of Thursday’s second session to put Brecel on the back foot once more. The Belgian then took charge of a scrappy contest, winning three successive frames again to take a 7-6 lead into the mid-session interval.Although Day won the next frame to level at 7-7, Brecel went back in front at the next opportunity before edging a tight 16th frame – which was decided by a black-ball shootout – thanks in no small part to an audacious long double on the green with just the colours remaining.Needing one more frame for ­victory, Brecel wrapped it up by a scoreline of 55-14 and will face Ding Junhui in the second round. The result was also a significant milestone for the No 7 seed – the first match he has won at the Crucible outside his surprise run to the title in 2023.View image in fullscreenLuca Brecel revived memories of his amazing 2023 title when he came back from 5-1 down to beat Ryan Day 10-7.Photograph: Eleanor Hoad/Every Second Media/Shutterstock“It’s good to win, I was expecting to win, to be honest,” Brecel said. “Last night, when I got back to 5-4 from 5-1 down, I played some good stuff. If that goes 7-2, I’m going to lose. That was a turning point but, even at 5-1 down, I still felt OK and relaxed. I never really panic, especially here as it’s so long. I’ve made so many comebacks here, so it wasn’t surprising. ”Thursday afternoon marked the start of the second round matches, withMark Allenin early trouble againstChris Wakelin. After falling 2-0 behind, Allen steadied things with a break of 100 but a missed red allowed Wakelin to clear up and take a 3-1 lead at the mid-session interval.An excellent snooker behind the black helped Allen cut the gap to 3-2 but his English opponent struck back with an 84 break. Wakelin, the world No 20, then took the last two frames of the session to build a commanding 6-2 lead in the first-to-13 contest.Four-time world championJohn Higginsis locked at 4-4 with China’sXiao Guodongafter a nip-and-tuck start to their last-16 encounter.

Last year, Russia began to convict people charged with displaying pro-LGBTQ+ imagery. While travelling the world for her profession, already competing under a neutral flag in the grim shadow of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the 27-year-old spent much of her time ruminating over whether it was time for her to depart.Even so, it came as a big surprise at the end of last month when Kasatkina finally made her move, announcing that she had gainedpermanent residency in Australiaand would be representing her new country going forward. Speaking before her participation at the Madrid Open, Kasatkina explains that, as a gay woman, her determination to live freely was key in her decision to become an Australian citizen.Australia teenager Maya Joint breaks Ash Barty’s record with win on Madrid Open debutRead more“It is tough,” she says of not being accepted by her former country. “Honestly, it was one of my main reasons why I had to make this step and change my nationality because if I wanted to live a free, open life as I wanted, unfortunately I couldn’t do it in Russia. I had to find another place. And I did.”Once the first discussions were held a few months ago, it did not take long for Kasatkina to acquire permanent Australian residency. As she prepared to announce her new country to the world, she agonised over how her move would be received internationally. Kasatkina has been pleasantly surprised by the outpouring of goodwill, including from her own peers and new compatriots.“It was emotional and I was nervous, of course, because I didn’t know how the reaction was going to be,” she says. “But the feedback was very good, honestly, from all the international media. It was great. Also, the feedback from Australia was good. After I realised that, I became much more calm.”A key moment in Kasatkina’s detachment from Russia was in July 2022, when she was interviewed in a Russian YouTubedocumentary exploring Wimbledon’s ban on Russian players. In the same emotional segment, Kasatkina bluntly opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and came out as gay.She has been stuck in an extremely difficult position since. Kasatkina had long been Russia’s highest-ranked women’s tennis player – she is now the world No 14 after reaching a career high of No 8 in October 2022. At the same time, both her personal identity and views were essentially illegal in her homeland. She has faced criticism from various politicians and public figures, including a member of the State Duma sending a letter to the Ministry of Justice calling for her to be classified as a foreign agent.View image in fullscreenDaria Kasatkina in action at the Australian Open in January, two months before she gained permanent residency in the country.Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Getty ImagesAlthough the fact that she could no longer live freely and safely in Russia due to her sexuality was the primary reason for her nationality change, it is impossible for Kasatkina to ignore the significance of the war on her decision. She notes that Australians are “living in peace with each other”, a stark comparison to Russia’s conflicts, and that the invasion of Ukraine was the catalyst for the other issues that dictated her decision. “The war affected many things,” she says. “Also the political way of Russia. Before, it was not that bad. But after this trigger, it’s become much worse. So it’s all connected.”Now a veteran of the professional tennis circuit, Kasatkina is one of the most popular players in the locker room, loved for her humour and integrity. She and her girlfriend, the Estonian-Russian former figure skater Natalia Zabiiako, publish a popular YouTube vlog about life on the tour. Around the grounds at tennis tournaments, the pair are inseparable. While most players conduct their media duties alone or else with an agent or manager, Kasatkina is accompanied throughout by Zabiiako, who patiently waited out of earshot for her partner to finish.During her career, Kasatkina has become known for her principles and heart but most of her decisions have simply been based on her determination to be a good person and do what she believes is right. Asked what message she hopes send, Kasatkina shrugs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It didn’t affect anybody except for me. So the only example which I want to give to people, it’s to take responsibility and action for your own life. And if you want to change something, you have to change something. If you feel great where you are, you have stay where you are. You just have to be responsible for your actions and for your own life. That’s all.”View image in fullscreenDaria Kasatkina with her partner, Natalia Zabiiako, after winning the Silicon Valley Classic in California.Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA-EFEThis is still the first page of a new chapter and there will be many more things to resolve. The question of whether she will be able to represent her new country in the Billie Jean King Cup, a trophy Kasatkina won with the Russian team in 2021, remains open. Although the InternationalTennisFederation’s rules forbid players from competing for a second nation, individuals can receive exemptions. Few circumstances are as exceptional as the reasons behind Kasatkina’s defection.At some point, she will also have to look towards establishing a home in her new country. Since her announcement, her phone has been flooded with messages from Daria Saville, a Russia-born player who became an Australian citizen in 2015, who has been searching for apartments for her friend close to her own home in Melbourne.“I’m [a] one-month-old Australian,” says Kasatkina, laughing. “It feels nice, honestly, just to think of myself as an Aussie now and playing under the Australian flag, representing Australia on the big stage. I’m very proud of that.”Explore more on these topicsTennisAustralia sportinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But Burgess set the bar so high in his first season as a head coach last year by reaching both major finals that the very sight of the Wolves being as low as ninth with a third of theSuper Leagueseason gone suggests something is not quite right.Jacob Umaga and the English rugby players driving Benetton to successRead moreHow he would have feared another miserable evening here at certain stages too: but by the end, he was left celebrating a win that will rank as one of his proudest – and potentially one which could ignite their stuttering start to the season. Without his talismanic half-back and England captain, George Williams, due to injury, the sight of his half-back partner going off before half-time with what was confirmed post-match as a fractured eye socket left the Wolves bereft of any attacking direction.At that stage, they had crafted a well-earned 16-14 half-time lead but you felt thatSt Helenswould surely be able to run out winners from that point. But instead, the Wolves cobbled together an attacking spine at the interval and arguably improved even more to register a seventh straight win over their local rivals: inflicting more misery on them in the process.“We had so much go against us with a lot of adversity to overcome,” Burgess said. “I didn’t think I had any players left at half-time. I’m lost for words because they’re so resilient and made some real hard choices. I reckon it’s my proudest day as a head coach so far with this group.”This could end up being a season-defining evening for both teams. While the Wire were magnificent, this was another tepid display from a St Helens side who look a shadow of the team that won four successive league titles between 2019 and 2022.“There’s no getting away from the fact we were poor,” their coach, Paul Wellens, said. That, unfortunately, is a drastic understatement. They were lucky to only be two behind at the break, having trailed 16-4 following Warrington tries from Toby King and a brace for Matty Ashton, before the Saints centre, Mark Percival, plucked two individual moments of brilliance from nowhere to narrow the deficit.You would have assumed Marc Sneyd’s withdrawal would have buoyed the Saints. Instead, they continued to flatter to deceive, with Warrington going further ahead when Ashton completed his hat-trick six minutes after the restart. The visitors’ attack huffed and puffed with little success, with their senior players continuing to struggle in the big games yet again.They have now lost 15 consecutive games against the teams who finished in last year’s top three: Warrington, Wigan and Hull KR. Tai’s try as the game entered the final quarter here, with the contest in the balance, provoked a huge reaction from Burgess on the touchline, with it opening up a crucial 12-point gap as time began to run out on the Saints.Warrington then scored again through their full-back Matt Dufty, as the away support began to make their feelings clear. St Helens scored a consolation through Jon Bennison but by then this contest had long since been decided.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueWarringtonSt HelensRugby leaguematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” policy has also included attacks on efforts to transition to cleaner energy and unwind support for it by the Joe Biden administration despite sources like solar being cheaper and far less polluting than coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, an industry which the president recently announced executive orders trying to revive.Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, told the New York Times that the moves were a “sweeping curtailment of all meaningful public processes”.He added: “This is manifestly illegal if for no other reason than this is all a fake emergency. We’ll be in court and we will challenge it.”The permitting reviews will be drastically reduced using emergency powers in National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationFossil fuelsDonald TrumpUS politicsEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Newcodes of practice issued by the watchdog on Thursdayhave ignored her concerns, she said.“I made it very clear last year that its proposals were not strong enough to protect children from the multitude of harms they are exposed to online every day,” de Souza said. “I am disappointed to see this code has not been significantly strengthened and seems to prioritise the business interests of technology companies over children’s safety.”De Souza, whose government-created role promotes and protects the rights of children, said she had received the views of more than 1 million young people, who said the online world was one of their biggest concerns. The codes of practice would not allay those fears, she said. “If companies can’t make online spaces safe for children, then they shouldn’t be in them.Childrenshould not be expected to police the online world themselves.”Measures announced byOfcominclude:Requiring social media platforms to deploy “highly effective” age checks to identify under-18s.Ensuring algorithms filter out harmful material.Making all sites and apps have procedures for taking down dangerous content quickly.Ensuring children must have a “straightforward” way to report content.From 25 July, sites and apps covered by the codes must implement those changes – or use other “effective measures” – and risk fines for breaching the act. The measures apply to sites and apps used by children, ranging from social media to search and gaming.Last year de Souza published a response to an Ofcom consultation on protecting children from online harm in which she made several recommendations including regular consultations with children.The Molly Rose Foundation, a charity established by the family ofthe British teenager who took her own lifeafter viewing harmful online content, also criticised the measures, which it said were “overly cautious”. The foundation said flaws in the codes included a lack of annual harm reduction targets.Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer and online safety campaigner, said the measures would mean “significant changes” to what children see in their feeds in terms of content related to pornography, suicide, self-harm and eating disorders, but the approach of Ofcom was “timid and unambitious”.Ofcom rejected de Souza’s criticism. “We don’t recognise this characterisation of our rules, which will be transformational in shaping a safer life online for children in the UK,” said a spokesperson.Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s chief executive, saidthe measures were a “reset”and companies failing to act would face enforcement. “They will mean safer social media feeds with less harmful and dangerous content, protections from being contacted by strangers and effective age checks on adult content,” she added.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex called for stronger protections for children online after unveiling a memorial in New York to young people who lost their lives due to the harmful effects of social media. The duke told BBC Breakfast “life is better off social media” and said “enough is not being done”.The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, revealed he was considering a social media curfew for children after TikTok’s introduction of a feature that encourages under-16s to switch off the app after 10pm. Kyle toldthe Telegraphhe was “watching very carefully” the impact of the curfew feature. “These are things I am looking at,” he said.Kyle said the Ofcom codes should be a “watershed moment” that turned the tide on “toxic experiences on these platforms”.Under the children’s codes, online platforms will be required to suppress the spread of harmful content, such as violent, hateful or abusive material and online bullying. More seriously harmful content, including that relating to suicide, self-harm and eating disorders, will need to be kept off children’s feeds entirely, as will pornography.The codes require age-checking of users by platforms at risk of showing harmful content to children, such as social media networks. Those age checks could take the form of facial age estimation or matching a face to an uploaded ID document. Once the platform has gauged whether a user is under 18 it can then deploy measures to ensure they have a safe online experience.Legal experts said some of the measures indicated a tougher approach than under initial Ofcom proposals. Companies are now expected to exclude from children’s feeds content that “potentially” fits into the most damaging category of material. “This reframing will likely cause more content to be captured by this measure,” said Ria Moody, a managing associate at the law firm Linklaters.If companies fail to comply with the requirement to protect children from harmful content, Ofcom can impose fines of up to £18m or 10% of global revenue. In extreme cases, Ofcom can ask a court to block the site or app in the UK. Senior managers at tech companies will be criminally liable for repeated breaches of their duty of care to children and could face up to two years in jail if they ignore enforcement notices.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetySocial mediaOnline abuseOfcomChildrenInternetEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

That is the change we need. We won’t wait – we will accelerate.”Starmer’s speech – made in front of the European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, and the US senior energy official, Tommy Joyce – made clear that the prime minister sees renewable energy as core to the UK’s future prosperity and national security.“We’re paying the price for our over-exposure, over many years, to the rollercoaster of international fossil fuel markets, leaving the economy and therefore people’s household budgets, vulnerable to the whims of dictators like Putin,” he said. “It’s our determination that working people should not be exposed like this any more.”Boosting renewable power generation would, he said, “make energy a source not of vulnerability, but of strength. We will protect our critical infrastructure, energy networks and supply chains, and do whatever it takes to protect the security of our people.Energysecurity is national security.”View image in fullscreenEd Miliband, Keir Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen speak to delegates on the first day of the Future of Energy Security summit at Lancaster House.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAFor several months,Labour’s commitment to net zero has come under question. The chancellor of the exchequer, Rachel Reeves, isre-examining spending commitmentson low-carbon infrastructure, and Ed Miliband, the energy security secretary who has championed climate action and low-carbon power, hasbeen the target of unfriendly briefings from within his own party.Miliband and net zero have been subject to growing criticism in the past few weeks, as thecrisis in the steel industrywas blamed by Nigel Farage and others on net zero, despite the fact the UK’s high energy prices areoverwhelmingly driven by reliance on gas.But Starmer’s words were a clear vote of confidence. He said: “Some in the UK don’t agree with [net zero]. They think energy security can wait. They think tackling climate change can wait. But do they also think that billpayers can wait? Do they think economic growth can wait? Do they think we can win the race for green jobs and investment by going slow?”Von der Leyen echoed Starmer’s words. “Reliable and affordable energy is the lifeblood of our economies, it underpins our national security, and it sustains our industrial and economic competitiveness,” she said. “Clean homegrown renewables not only strengthen our resilience, they of course also spur new jobs and more innovation within our own economies. As our energy dependency on fossil fuels goes down, our energy security goes up. That is the lesson we have learnt in Europe.”Not all countries were convinced. Joyce, acting assistant secretary in the office for international affairs, in the US Department of Energy, attacked the goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 as “harmful and dangerous” and in “the interest of our adversaries”.He claimed: “When and where energy is scarce or restricted, humans suffer. Unfortunately, the focus during the last administration was on climate politics and policies, leading to that scarcity. These policies have been embraced by many, not just the US, and harm human lives.”Joyce’s words were received in near silence in contrast to the applause for fellow speakers who warned that dependence on fossil fuels was playing into the hands of Russia and Vladimir Putin, described by several speakers as having “weaponised” gas supply in his invasion of Ukraine.Joyce struck more of a chord, however, when he warned that China controlled the supply of critical minerals essential to renewable energy technology. Delegates had a separate session on this.China’s government was not represented at the conference, but the country’s president, Xi Jinping, gave a pointed private address to several other world leaders at the UN earlier this week in which hevowed to press ahead with climate policies, in contrast to the US.More than 60 countries, and about 50 private sector companies, were represented at the talks at Lancaster House in London, which will continue on Friday. King Charles was not present, but sent a message of support.Starmer also gave the green light to a £2bn carbon capture and storage (CCS) project located 20 miles off the coast of Liverpool, the first phase of which is designed to store 109m tonnes of CO2 from industrial plants near Liverpool and Manchester in the East Irish Sea.Explore more on these topicsEnergyKeir StarmerUrsula von der LeyenRenewable energynewsShareReuse this content"

What that looks like is slightly above my pay grade at the moment.”His comments came after Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, was recorded saying he wanted tounite the coalition on the right of politics “one way or another”. Jenrick’s team insisted his comments had been about “voters and not parties”.Making plans for Nigel: tense Tories wonder whether Badenoch has what it takes to see off Reform | Pippa CrerarRead moreKemi Badenoch, whobeat Jenrick in last year’s leadership contest, has said she was “very clear that there will be no pact” and argued there was no rift between the pair.She said on Thursday that she did not back the Liberal Democrats’ proposed bill amendment of £1,000 penalties forpeople who play loud music on public transport, suggesting “people who do those things” would not be able to afford the fine.Having initially said she was unaware of the Lib Dems’ proposal, she said: “I’m not somebody that looks at the Lib Dems for policy ideas. I think they have a lot of silly people there who don’t necessarily understand how things work.”She added: “What I would say, though, is that nuisance is a problem. It is very, very irritating having people playing loud music and just being antisocial for all of the other passengers on public transport and more should be done around that.”Farage gave a speech in Dover on Thursday promising a new “minister for deportations” andcaused a backlash among charitiesby questioning the level of special needs diagnoses for children.He rejected the idea of forming a pact with the Tories but did not rule out power-sharing arrangements at council level.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Butler has worked for the NASUWT for seven years and before that was a teacher and member for three decades. The application for the injunction was in his name.A spokesperson for the NASUWT said the union was “not able to comment” on the legal action.NASUWT members who spoke to the Guardian said their complaints about Wrack’s candidacy had gone unanswered. Wrack, who was the general secretary of the FBU for 20 years until losing a re-election campaign in January, would be the first leader in the NASUWT’s history never to have been a qualified teacher or lecturer.Daniel Pearn, a teacher and NASUWT member, said ordinary members had been kept in the dark about the appointment process.“We know that [Matt Wrack] has never been a teacher, and for a teacher-led union that doesn’t sit right with me. I feel that the person who goes to speak for us, and for our working rights, should be a teacher,” Pearn said.“In the past we’ve had general secretaries who have been in the profession, one way or another, as teachers or lecturers. It feels like a really odd appointment to me.”Pearn said “the biggest sticking point in the process” was the lack of an open vote among members: “If it got put to a vote and Matt Wrack got voted in, it would be a fair, democratic process. But my problem is that they’ve blocked us from that.”Barking at female staff and blocking doorways: teachers warn of rise in misogyny and racism in UK schoolsRead moreWrack’s nomination also caused unease among the estimated 1,000 Jewish teachers within the NASUWT, with some arguing that he was insensitive to allegations of antisemitism within the Labour party during Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.The Partnership for Jewish Schoolssaid Wrack’s nomination was “deeply troubling”, adding: “The many Jewish members of the NASUWT are likely to find this appointment particularly challenging. Educational unions must represent the interests of all members without prejudice or bias.”Wrack’s nomination also raised fears of a merger with the National Education Union. While the NEU’s annual conference passed a motion calling for merger discussions “on or off the record”, the NASUWT’s delegates debated a motion ordering its executive to “reiterate publicly that there is no desire by NASUWT to consider any union amalgamation or merger”.Explore more on these topicsTeachingTrade unionsSchoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

I have to say, for my own money, when you get to 18 and you put somebody on a disability register, unemployed, with a high level of benefits, you’re telling people aged 18 that they’re victims,” he told a local elections press conference in Dover.“And if you are told you’re a victim, and you think you’re a victim, you are likely to stay [a victim].”Farage said: “So many of these diagnoses, for Send before 18, for disability register after 18 – so many of these have been conducted on Zoom, with the family GP.”12:57How children with special educational needs are being failed in England – videoThe National Autistic Society said this was “incorrect, wrong, fake news”.Assessments for conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism cannot be done by a GP and statistics suggest that waiting times for mental health are significantly longer than for physical problems.Analysis by the charity Rethink Mental Illness suggests that eight times as many people wait at least 18 months for mental health treatment compared with patients needing physical care.Farage suggested that GPs might be under pressure to confirm a patient had depression or anxiety. “I think you’re the family GP, and I’ve known your family for generations, and you’re saying to me there’s a real problem here with depression, or whatever it may be, it’s quite hard for me as your GP to say ‘no’,” he said.“I don’t think any of these allocations should be done by family GPs. I think it should be done independently.“And I think we are massively – I’m not being heartless, I’m being frank – I think we are massively overdiagnosing those with mental illness problems and those with other general behavioural disabilities. And I think we’re creating a class of victims in Britain that will struggle ever to get out of it.”Mel Merritt, the head of policy and campaigns at the National Autistic Society, said: “Nigel Farage’s comments are wildly inaccurate and show that he’s completely out of touch with what autistic children and adults have to go through to get a diagnosis or any support at all. For the record, absolutely no one has got an autism diagnosis through the GP – this is just incorrect, wrong, fake news.“Children with Send and disabled adults, including autistic people, are not victims who are being ‘overdiagnosed’. They are people who face huge delays and long fights to get the most basic support across every aspect of their lives, including diagnosis, education, health and social care.“Spreading misinformation only perpetuates stigma and makes life harder. We’re calling on all politicians to drop the political point-scoring and stand up for their autistic and other disabled constituents.”Brian Dow, the deputy chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said: “If Nigel Farage has a medical degree, he clearly hasn’t been keeping up with his continuous professional development.“Rather than overdiagnosing young people, we’re abandoning a generation in crisis. Armchair analysis won’t fix a broken system. What we need from political leaders is commitment to finding serious solutions.”English local elections 2025: is your council up for election and what’s at stake?Read moreFarage also said it was possible that any councils won by Reform in the local elections on 1 May could ban hotels from housing asylum seekers.Robert Hayward, a pollster and Conservative peer, told ITV on Wednesday he believed the Conservatives would lose up to 525 seats and Farage would win up to 450.Labour would be expected to stand still, gaining some from the Conservatives but losing some to Reform, the Greens and independents. The Lib Dems also hope to pick up seats from the Conservatives in areas where they won at the general election.Conservatives are at a high-water mark at next week’s local elections because the elections were last held in 2021 when Boris Johnson was enjoying his “vaccine bounce”.Asked whether he believed his party could win 450 seats, the Reform UK leader said that outcome would be “quite a political revolution”.Key targets for Reform include the Runcorn and Helsby byelection, where the seat was held by Labour until the conviction of the former MP Mike Amesbury, and two regional mayoralties in Lincolnshire and in Hull and East Yorkshire. These would give the parties significant new platforms. Reform could also win Doncaster and Lincolnshire councils.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageMental healthHealthSpecial educational needsLocal electionsEnglandLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

The commission, which has new powers to sanction unauthorised felling, could impose fines and potentially launch a private prosecution over the incident.Hayman said: “Toby Carvery said the tree needed to be felled because it was already dead and posed health and safety concerns. The Forestry Commission is now carrying out the investigation into exactly what happened and whether or not the tree was dead or not. Clearly, it looks like a very heavily pollarded tree at the moment. The question, is it dead or not, is one for us to consider further.”Experts who have investigated the tree’s remains say it was alive when it was felled. Last year a veteran tree survey conducted by Tottenham Hotspur football club, which has financial links with MBR,described it as a “fine specimen”.That survey, conducted by the Tree and Woodland Company, includes maps showing the tree was located on land owned by Enfield council, just outside land leased by the council to Toby Carvery.Experts claim that if it is confirmed that MBR did not lease the land in question, the company could be prosecuted for criminal damage.Sarah Dodd, the founder of Tree Law, a firm that specialises in legal disputes over trees, said: “If the tree was on someone else’s land, then the argument that Toby Carvery was acting as a responsible leaseholder and keeping users of its car park safe falls away. If it is on land outside their leasehold interest then it could be trespass and criminal damage. It could potentially reopen the issue with the Metropolitan police.“The Forestry Commission also has powers to pursue criminal cases … It does pursue private criminal prosecutions when it is in the public interest to do so, and this is very easily going to tick that public interest box. But they would need to be rock solid on where the land boundaries lie.”The incident was referred to the Met but the force concluded it was a civil dispute after establishing there was no tree preservation order in place.Dodd said that even if MBR could prove it was leasing the land on which the tree stood, it could be liable for a civil claim of breaching the terms of the lease. Enfield council has alreadythreatened MBR with legal action.The Forestry Commission investigation will also establish whether MBR had a felling licence to take down the tree. Under the commission’s rules, a licence is required to fell 5 cubic metres of wood every calendar quarter. In the absence of a licence, the commission can impose a fine.Hayman was responding to questions from the Liberal Democrat peer Claire Tyler. She asked: “Doesn’t it show that current protections even for nationally significant trees are totally inadequate? Indeed they are described as a gaping void by the Woodland Trust. What specific steps is the government taking to ensure this outrage will never happen again? Does the minister agree that a national list of heritage trees that would have intrinsic protections akin to ancient monuments and listed buildings would be a very good thing to introduce?”Hayman said the government was looking at recommendations from a report by theTree Council and Forest Researchon measures to improve protections for ancient, veteran and culturally important trees. She said: “We are going through those recommendations. We are aware that there are great concerns … Clearly, so many people were shocked by the felling of this tree.”MBR declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsTrees and forestsLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s how Labour will achieve itJessica ElgotDeputy political editorThu 24 Apr 2025 14.50 EDTFirst published on Thu 24 Apr 2025 06.49 EDTShareThe UK’s new deal with the EU will be a break from “debates and arguments of the past”, the UK’s chief negotiator,Nick Thomas-Symonds, has said, pledging that growth will be the highest priority of the talks.Meanwhile,Keir Starmerheld talks with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in London, as momentum builds towards a crucial EU-UK summit in May.In the most positive language yet about the talks, No 10 said Starmer and von der Leyen had agreed to aim for “as ambitious a package as possible” at the first UK-EU summit next month.“The prime minister was clear that he will seize any opportunity to improve the lives of working people in the United Kingdom, drive growth and keep people safe – and he believes a strengthened partnership between the UK and the EU will achieve this,” No 10 said after the meeting.Amid pressure from MPs to agree a youth mobility deal despite a cabinet split on the proposal, the Cabinet Office minister Thomas-Symonds saidin an article for the Guardianthat the negotiations should move on from the turmoil of the Brexit years.“Pursuing a new partnership with the EU is about meeting the needs of our times,” he wrote. “This is not about ideology or returning to the divisions of the past, but about ruthless pragmatism and what works in the national interest.”The government is expected to seek far closer regulatory alignment with the EU on trade, a key source of division in theBrexityears, where Eurosceptics sought the furthest possible divergence from Brussels.“We want to put more money in the pockets of working people and provide Britain with long-term stability and security; we won’t be defined by debates and arguments of the past,” Thomas-Symonds wrote.In a hint the government acknowledges how crucial the reset will be for both sides, with a recession fuelled by Donald Trump’s tariffs looming and support for Ukraine wavering, Thomas-Symonds said Labour was “rising to meet the challenges in this new era of global instability”.“The government needs to work with Britain’s allies on solutions that will minimise the impact of these global shocks,” he said.It is understood the UK is on the verge of agreeing to enter into negotiations on three key topics: the youth mobility scheme, a sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) deal to eliminate checks on food and drink being exported to the EU and entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, and a deal on carbon emissions.It is thought the SPS deal would be based on a deal the EU struck with Switzerland in 2023 but with substantial changes. A defence pact is almost sealed after the EU’s white paper on defence in March paved the way for British defence companies such as Babcock and BAE Systems to bid for money from the new €150bn (£129bn)EU defence fund.UK and European sources also expect an announcement on trafficking and intelligence sharing as a way of signalling a tough approach to irregular migration.Von der Leyen, who was attending the international energy summit in London, lavished praise on Starmer in a press conference, as she urged the prime minister to “team up” to build a joined-up regulatory framework for investors backing renewable energy infrastructure in the North Sea.“Dear Keir, this is something where the two of us should team up and deliver on what is needed for the investors,” she said, hinting at another potential element in a package to be agreed at the first UK-EU summit.Thomas-Symonds said the emphasis in the talks would be on the benefit a new relationship could bring people and businesses, and he said the time was right for the EU to fully reset its approach to the UK after years of political division.“Britain is a politically stable country, and the government has a huge mandate, with over four years left to deliver our policies,” he said. “We’ve shown that Britain is back on the world stage and that it has a lot to offer.”The minister said Starmer and von der Leyen would take stock of the progress made towards the 19 May summit “and make sure teams are meeting our aspirations: to grow the economy, boost living standards and keep the UK safe”.But he said it would also mean sticking to the red lines of no return to the single market, the customs union or freedom of movement. “We will only agree an EU deal that meets the needs of the British people and respects the 2016 referendum result. By doing this we will to seize the opportunities in front of us to deliver a better future,” he said.One key aspect of any deal is likely to be a youth mobility visa for Europeans. More than 60 Labour MPs urged Starmer to allow thousands of young Europeans to live and work in the UK, in a letter published by the Guardian on Wednesday.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said discussions on a potential scheme were continuing, in the clearest hint yet that the government is preparing to do a deal.Cabinet differences remain on the shape a youth visa deal could take. Reeves is said to be in favour of a deal that includes time-limited youth visas, the highest priority for Brussels, but the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has insisted on a cap on numbers, with a time limit of one year.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyForeign policyBrexitKeir StarmerNick Thomas-SymondsEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

This included 2.4m incidents of bank and credit account fraud, and 1.1m incidents of consumer and retail fraud, which rose by 35% compared with a year earlier.The consumer group Which? called on the government to “halt the flood of online scam adverts” through full implementation of the Online Safety Act.“It’s also vital that the government announces plans for tough regulation of online advertising more widely, to tackle the wave of bogus celebrity-backed investment schemes and other scam adverts that appear on popular websites,” said Rocio Concha, the director of policy and advocacy at Which?.Explore more on these topicsCrimeRetail industryOffice for National StatisticsPoliceEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Following the consultation, she was told she would be sent pills for an early medical abortion at home.Opening the case against Packer, Felix said police had obtained phone searches from around the time she took the pills, which included “difference between miscarriage and abortion” and “can abortion pills work later in pregnancy?”“If Nicola Packer thought she was early in pregnancy, why was she concerned to know whether abortion pills work later in pregnancy?” Felix asked the court.She also highlighted searches from Packer on 6 November including “medical abortion from 10 weeks to 24 weeks”, “can abortion pill be detected in urine”, and “how long does a later stage miscarriage take”.Other searches on her phone around the same time into how long an abortion would take suggested she had not started bleeding, or delivered a foetus, Felix said.“All of these searches were all at a time when Nicola Packer could not have known what the foetus looked like nor its size,” Felix told the court. “Yet the searches suggest that she knows that the foetus she is carrying is more than 10 weeks old.”At 5.07am in the morning on 7 November, Packer had searched “if you late miscarry at home what do you do with the foetus”, Felix told the court, “which suggests that by now Nicola Packer had miscarried”.Packer called 111 several hours later to report that she had had a “late-stage miscarriage”, estimating the foetus to be about 18 weeks, but did not report that she had taken abortion medication.“The crown says that she gave at least a misleading account and indeed a dishonest one,” Felix told the court.Packer was advised to go to hospital, and did not initially disclose to medical staff that she had taken abortion medication.It was only after she was told by a senior midwife, Claire Baker, that “she was there to care for her, that her safety was their priority and that what whatever happened they were there to support her”, that Packer told staff she had taken medication supplied to her by MSI, the court heard.“She was advised that the police would be called and the coroner would have to be informed,” Felix said.“In this case, because she is likely to say that she honestly believed that she was less than 10 weeks gestation,” Felix told the court, “then it will be for the crown to prove that she did not honestly believe that she was less than 10 weeks pregnant”.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The most common type of breast cancer – accounting for about 70% of cases – are hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative tumours.TheNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence(Nice) said the drug, known under the brand name Kisqali, would be available to NHS patients with cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes and met at least one of these criteria:Cancer present in at least four lymph nodes.Cancer present in one to three lymph nodes that is either grade 3 (more advanced), or has a primary tumour at least 5cm in size.Ribociclib targets and blocks proteins called CDK 4 and CDK 6, which play a role in cancer cell growth and division, helping to slow or stop tumour growth. It is taken as two 200mg pills once a day, alongside an aromatase inhibitor, a hormone therapy that reduces oestrogen levels in the body.Clinical trials show that combining ribociclib with an aromatase inhibitormay extend the time before cancer returns by up to 29%, compared with using an aromatase inhibitor alone.The decision followsNice approval earlier in April for capivasertibto treat advanced hormone receptor (HR)-positive HER2-negative breast cancer that has spread, which could benefit as many as 3,000 women a year.But some cancer charities said they were disappointed Nice did not approve ribociclib’s use for those with other forms of early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence.Claire Rowney, the chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, said: “We’re deeply concerned that thousands of people with early breast cancer could miss out on access to a vital type of treatment due to uncertainties around cost-effectiveness.“Despite the promising potential for adjuvant ribociclib to cut the risk of cancer coming back by almost a third (28.5%), today’s decision means only certain people with high-risk node positive disease, and none with high-risk node negative disease, would receive it.“While drug approvals are always welcome, it’s disappointing that so many people could be denied access to this vital treatment and the chance to alleviate some anxiety about their cancer returning.“Nice and Novartis must urgently work together to resolve the uncertainties around cost-effectiveness, to ensure a swift change to guidance so that everyone who could benefit can receive adjuvant ribociclib.”Explore more on these topicsBreast cancerCancerWomen's healthHealthEnglandNational Institute for Health and Care ExcellenceNHSShareReuse this content"

The attack took place at around 12.30pm (11.30am BST), before teachers overpowered the boy. One female student was killed. At least one other student is in a critical condition in hospital.“This tragedy shows once again the endemic violence that exists in a part of our youth,” Bayrou said in a statement. “Fundamental questions must be asked in terms of education, values and respect for human life.”He ordered checks inside and around schools to be intensified immediately. He also said a commission would look into how to deal with teenage knife crime in terms of weapons sales, and the owning and carrying of knives. It would study best practice in other countries across the world.Praising the “bravery” of the teachers who intervened, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the whole nation shared in the school’s shock and grief.A police source told France Info that the boy had first targeted a pupil on the second floor of the school and had then attacked three others coming down the stairs. He had gone into two classrooms, the source said. France Info also reported that the boy was carrying two knives.The boy was in police custody and a psychiatric assessment was being carried out, France Télévisions reported.The education minister, Élisabeth Borne, and the interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, travelled to the school to show “solidarity with victims and the school community”.Images from the scene showed police and troops surrounding the school as the investigation began.An official at the school, which is part of a complex housing a primary and middle school, would not comment on what happened. They said the school was concentrating on caring for the students who were on campus at the time.The school administration sent a message to the families of the 2,000 or so students who attend the school, informing them of the incident. Students had been immediately confined inside the school.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

This is the next version of ‘the big lie.’”ActBlue is the main platform used to collect donations for Democratic candidates and causes. The move is among several actions the Trump administration has taken to “cripple the left”, the New York Timeshas reported, part of a “series of highly partisan official actions that, if successful, will threaten to hobble Democrats’ ability to compete in elections for years to come”.The memo comes amid ongoing unsubstantiated claims on the right about the fundraising platform. Elon Musk has tweeted about ActBlue multiple times since Trump took office. “Something stinks about ActBlue,” he said in one post.Republican lawmakers havecalledon the treasury department to investigate ActBlue. Representative Darrell Issa wrote to the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in March,sayingthe department should investigate whether ActBlue facilitated donations from “terror-linked organizations and non-profits”, based on reporting in rightwing media that the platform had cut ties with a Palestinian organization that advocates for divestment in Israel.Congressman Bryan Steil, the chair of the committee on House administration, requested documents from ActBlue in October “related to the platform’s donor verification policies and potential vulnerabilities that foreign actors may exploit to illegally participate in the US political process”. Those documents showed that the platform had updated its policies to automatically reject certain donations from gift cards and other avenues, Steil said.The organization has seen internal strife, the New York Timesreported, leading to departures of senior officials. Republicans demanded more documents from ActBlue based on the departures, the paperreported.The attack on the fundraising platform comes asDemocratsprepare efforts to win back majorities in Washington in the midterms. On Thursday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced a plan to revitalize state Democratic parties by sending monthly donations from the national party to the states, with more funding going to red states.“Donald Trump’s memorandum targeting ActBlue is designed to undermine democratic participation – and it’s no wonder why,” the heads of the DNC, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Governors Association wrote in a joint statement.“He knows Americans are already fed up with his chaotic agenda that is driving the economy off a cliff, so he’s trying to block lawful grassroots donations from supporters giving just $5 or $10 to candidates who oppose him while further empowering the corrupt billionaires who already control his administration.“As Democrats, we’re unified in standing with the millions of Americans who are fighting back against Trump’s dangerous abuses of power.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsDemocratsUS political financingnewsShareReuse this content"

So perhaps the pop culture icon would not be too upset to know that in the hands of one Dutch municipality, one of his artworks went the other way and was thrown out with the rubbish.Maashorst town hall on Thursday confessed that a rare silkscreen print by Warhol, who died in 1987, was among 46 valuable artworks that were “most likely” taken away with the bins during extensive renovation work last year.“This is not how you treat valuable items,” the mayor, Hans van der Pas, told the public broadcaster NOS. “It is a serious matter when public property, especially art with cultural and historic value, is treated so carelessly … But it happened. We regret that.”British artist claims he has created paint in ‘new’ colour announced by scientistsRead moreThe town hall said the works, including a 1980s Warhol silkscreen print of the then Queen Beatrix of theNetherlands, were part of a collection from the borough of Uden, which merged with others three years ago to form Maashorst.Before the reorganisation, an inventory was made of the borough’s collection, which was then split up. Some pieces were loaned to a local museum, others placed in the new town hall and some returned to the artists. In the process, 46 went missing.“It’s most likely that the artworks were accidentally taken away with the rubbish,” Maashorst town hall said after receiving a report from an independent investigations agency it had hired to find out what had happened.The agency concluded there were several reasons why the artworks could have been taken out with the trash, including a complete absence of any policies, procedures or guidelines for “the registration, storage, conservation and security of artworks”.Many of the artworks were stored in a town hall basement during the renovation work “but were not handled with care”, the agency reported. Several had sustained water and other damage when they were last seen in 2023.Queen Beatrix was part of Warhol’s1985 series Reigning Queens, a series of 16 colourful prints of four monarchs: Elizabeth II of England, Beatrix of the Netherlands, Margrethe II of Denmark and Ntombi Twala of Eswatini (formerly Swaziland).The artist based the silkscreens on the queens’ official state portraits, choosing them because they were often mass-produced, including on stamps and currency.Maashorst said it was unlikely the missing artworks would ever be recovered.Explore more on these topicsAndy WarholNetherlandsArtEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Our economy is thriving because we invest in people, prioritize sustainability, and believe in the power of innovation,” Newsom said in a statement.The state has outperformed the world’s top economies with a growth rate in 2024 of 6% compared with the US’s 5.3%, China’s 2.6% and Germany’s 2.9%. This week’s new rankings come six years after California surpassed the United Kingdom and became the world’s fifth largest economy.Newsom noted, however, that the Trump administration’s agenda endangers California’s economic interests.“And, while we celebrate this success, we recognize that our progress is threatened by the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration.

In one case, a Tufts University doctoral candidate,Rümeysa Öztürk, was handcuffed by federal agents on a Massachusetts street, shrieking in fear as shown in widely circulated surveillance footage. The former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil and current student Mohsen Mahdawi, both permanent residents, are fighting deportation after being arrested in March and April, respectively.Twelve national Jewish organizations, including J Street and T’ruah,condemned the Trump administration’s detention of Khalil in March, warning that using antisemitism as justification for suppressing political dissent threatens both Jewish safety and democracy.More than 200 Israeli academics similarly signedan open letterlast week accusing Trump of “fostering anti-Jewish sentiment” by targeting students and “weaponizing Jewish students’ safety as grounds to silence, harass, suspend, punish, or deport pro-Palestinian members of US academia.”The Trump administration has defended its actions, claiming in some high-profile cases that students were “engaged in activities in support of Hamas” without providing specific evidence. A state departmentpost on Facebookin March warned: “We continuously check visa holders to ensure they follow all US laws and immigration rules – and we will revoke their visas and deport them if they don’t.”Susskind said Jews should be skeptical of the administration’s rhetoric on antisemitism.“American Jews are not fools. We’ve watched Trump cozy up to antisemites for years. We see Jew haters serving in prominent roles in this administration,” Susskind added.The senators requested answers to a list of questions by 30 April, including details on the criteria used to target specific institutions and an explanation for the 50% reduction in staff at the Department of Education’s office of civil rights.Legal challenges to the visa revocations have seen mixed results, with federal judges in several states issuing temporary restraining orders in some cases while denying similar requests in others.“This Senate letter is an important move to unmask Trump’s cynicism,” Susskind said. “We need to see more such efforts, otherwise the costs – in terms of free speech and the safety of Jews – will only mushroom.”Explore more on these topicsAntisemitismUS educationDonald TrumpTrump administrationUniversitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

It promptedIndiato renew its blaming of Pakistan for sustaining “cross-border terrorism”, a claim Pakistan denies.“Pakistan declares the Indian defence, naval and air advisers in Islamabad persona non grata. They are directed to leave Pakistan immediately,” a statement from the office of the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, said after he had convened a rare national security committee meeting. It also said visas issued to Indian nationals would be cancelled.“Any threat to Pakistan’s sovereignty and to the security of its people will be met with firm reciprocal measures in all domains,” the statement added, ordering the closure of borders, the cancellation of trade and the closure of airspace to Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines.“India has taken irresponsible steps and levelled allegations,” Pakistan’s foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, told the Dunya News TV channel.MapDar said “any kinetic step [military action] by India would see a tit-to-tat kinetic response” from Pakistan, rekindling memories of February 2019 when a car suicide bombing in Kashmir brought the two countries to the verge of war.The toughest language, however, was aimed at India’s decision to suspend the decades-old Indus waters treaty – the world’s most durable water-sharing agreement – which is vital for Pakistani agriculture.“Any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan as per the Indus waters treaty … will be considered as an act of war and responded [to] with full force across the complete spectrum of national power,” Islamabad said on Thursday.1:17Manhunt launched after 26 tourists killed by suspected militants in Kashmir – videoIndia suspended the treaty on Wednesday, when it also accused Pakistan of supporting “cross-border terrorism” and downgraded ties with its neighbour with a series of diplomatic measures. Pakistan has denied any role in the attack.In response, Pakistan suspended the Shimla accord, the 1972 treaty that for decades formed the foundation of peace with India that was signed by the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, and Pakistan’s Zulfikar Ali Bhutto after the 1971 war that resulted in Bangladesh’s creation.India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, vowed to pursue those responsible for Tuesday’s attack “to the ends of the Earth”.Twenty-six men were killed in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam, in the deadliest attack on civilians in the contested Muslim-majority territory since 2000.“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” Modi said in his first speech since the attack.Pakistan’s top diplomat in Delhi, Saad Ahmad Warraich, the charge d’affaires at the Pakistan embassy, was summoned by India’s ministry of external affairs on Wednesday evening, according to a diplomatic source and local media reports.India had already closed a key land border with Pakistanand barred Pakistani citizens from entering under a visa exemption scheme.Police in Kashmir published notices on Thursday naming three suspected militants alleged to have been involved in the attack, and announced rewards for information leading to their arrest. Two of the three are Pakistani nationals, according to the notices.Kashmir attack sparks fear of fresh conflict between India and PakistanRead moreModi has called for a meeting with opposition parties on Thursday to brief them on the government’s response to the attack.Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence in 1947, with both claiming the Himalayan territory in full but governing separate portions of it.The Indus waters treaty, mediated by the World Bank, splits the Indus River and its tributaries between the neighbours and regulates the sharing of water.

This isthe company’s first earnings report sinceDonald Trumpleviedtariffson trade partners around the world.Despite the upheaval for Alphabet, it exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, reporting revenue of $90.23bn, up 12% since the same time last year, and $2.81 in earnings per share. Analysts had projected first quarter revenue of $89.2bn and earnings of $2.01 per share,according to consensus estimates. The global tariffs were not expected to create much of an impact for Alphabet, since they were mostly instituted after the end of the quarter.Alphabet’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, said the first quarter results “reflect healthy growth and momentum across the business” and that underpinning this growth is the company’s emphasis on artificial intelligence.Alphabet’s stock jumped more than 7% in after hours trading.Alphabet is one of the world’s most valuable companies, worth nearly $2trn. But economic headwinds that include high tariffs and possible trade wars, along with various legal battles brought by governments worldwide, could eventually hit the tech behemoth.Google is “not immune to the macro environment”, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. He added that Google’s ads business could be effected by Trump’s decision to end the de minimis trade loophole on 2 May, which allows for duty-free shipments to the US for items less than $800. But, Schindler said, “we have a lot of experience in managing through uncertain times.”Earlier this week,Google returned to court in Washington DC for theconclusion of a lawsuitbrought by the US Department of Justice. The government sued Google in 2020 alleging it acted illegally to maintain a monopoly of the search engine market. The justice departmentwon that caseafter a trial last year and now the two parties are in court again to decide whether Google will be forced to break off parts of its company, including its Chrome browser.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nearly a quarter of women (22.3%) who suffered sexual violence said it had taken the form of virtual or digital sexual abuse.Taken from questionnaire results from 312 women, the figures form the basis of the study calledAfter the Silence: the Impact of Sexual Violence and Abuse Against Women in the Film and Audiovisual Industry.A parliamentary inquiry in France found this month thatsexual violence, harassment and bullying were “systemic, endemic and persistent”in the country’s culture and entertainment industries.Although sexual violence was prevalent “from casting session to festivals”, the Spanish report detailed an enduring culture of shame and impunity, with 92% of victims not reporting what had happened to them.“For all the progress that’s being made to raise general and personal awareness of the different forms of sexual violence, there remain important obstacles that demonstrate the difficulty women have in reporting it within the workplace,” the report said.“Fear of reprisals, shame, revictimisation, a lack of knowledge about reporting mechanisms, and the burden and responsibility placed on women, rather than on abusers within the industry, paves the way for silence and impunity.”Speaking at the report’s presentation in Madrid on Thursday, one of the authors, the political scientist and feminist researcher Nerea Barjola Ramos, said the “naturalisation and normalisation” of such violence had created a sense of impunity.“That happens because there’s a structure that generates and protects this violence, from acting schools to production offices,”Barjola said in remarks reported by El País. “There are even narratives in scripts that leave no place for feminism.” Young women, she added, suffered a twofold violence “because of their age but also because of their precarious economic position”.The report concluded that urgent steps were needed to “reinforce the mechanisms that lead to the disclosure of violence … and to put into effect compulsory and effective measures that guarantee and protect the right of all the female professionals in the sector”.It suggested special training on sexual violence be offered across the sector and also called for public awareness campaigns and the strengthening of workplace inspections.Explore more on these topicsSpain#MeToo movementGenderWomennewsShareReuse this content"

Iran is the second highest incarcerator, with 43, down from 49 a year earlier, although those released had been freed with conditions that forced them into silence.Israel is in fifth place, with 21 writers behind bars, including eight in administrative detention – statistics at odds with the country’s self-proclaimed status as a democracy that tolerates dissent. Other prominent incarcerators are Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey, a Nato ally and ostensibly still a democracy under the leadership of its strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.Majority of attempts to ban books in US come from organised groups, not parentsRead moreThe index has been published for the past six years and has hitherto generally highlighted the dangers faced by writers living under repressive regimes, although Israel also appeared in the previous year’s report.While making no explicit mention of threats to free speech under the US president following a spate of arrests of foreign students who have campaigned for Palestinian rights and accusations of trying to curtail academic freedom, its text clearly hints at the potential for a future clampdown.“As geopolitics continue to shift and authoritarian tendencies spread to countries that were once considered safely anchored in openness, we are seeing that free expression, and therefore writers, are increasingly in the crosshairs of repression in a much wider range of countries,” says the index.“[Governments] recognize the power of words to affirm historical truths, give voice to those whose narratives have been excised from the historical ledger, develop or maintain culture, and hold institutions to account … Democracies have been slow to understand that attacks on writers are both the precursor to and a consequence of broader attacks on human rights, democracy, and free expression.”In an interview, Karin Deutsch Karlekar,PENAmerica’s director of writers, said the comments reflected a fear for writers on the domestic front, saying that the US had not witnessed such a “broad and deep attack on ideas” since the McCarthyite anticommunist witch-hunts of the 1950s.She cited the case ofRümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University in the US on a Fulbright scholarship, who was detained and earmarked for deportation after co-authoring an opinion article criticizing Israel’s military offensive in Gaza.“People are being detained for their ideas and their writing in the US. This is definitely worrying,” she said.“I would say it’s only probably a matter of time when writers that we would include in our database and index in the US being detained as well. I fully expect that next year, we may well have cases in the United States in our index.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If the US is really stepping back in terms of its role of defending free expression and being a standard bearer for this issue, that’s big blow in terms of global trends and getting writers out of jail in other countries.”Explore more on these topicsPENCensorshipChinaIranIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We step inside their hidden worldBarbara SpeedThu 24 Apr 2025 11.02 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 18.19 EDTShareAfew years ago, a Hollywood studio approached the tech giant IBM with an idea. Perhaps it would be fun if Watson – the company’s artificial intelligence system – analysed its new film about an artificial humanoid gone rogue, and created a trailer for it. The technology was duly “trained” on 100 horror trailers, fed the 90-minute film, and a human editor helped stitch its chosen clips together.The result, billed as “the first movie trailer made by AI”, is awful. The exchanges are slow and pause-filled, as though filmed underwater. Toby Jones raises his eyebrow sagely at nothing. The screen flashes to black for no reason. At the end, the title card apologetically fades in: “Morgan … September 2.”View image in fullscreenWatch the eyebrows … Toby Jones in Morgan.Photograph: Aidan Monaghan/20th Century Fox/AllstarThe director may have had a vested interest in the trailer going wrong – the film was, after all, about the dangers of this kind of technology. Yet as interest in AI-generated trailers grows, including Netflix recently being granted a patent forpersonalised algorithmic trailer technology, and cinema attendance still in the post-pandemic doldrums, the Morgan trailer was a masterclass in whatnotto do – and a testament to the anonymous army that has perfected the art of making good trailers.Trailers are an entirely different discipline from long-form cinema; made not by the film’s director, as is often assumed, but by highly skilled specialist editors. They are credited nowhere, yet responsible for selling the film to audiences in 150 seconds or less (the maximum allowed by the US Motion Picture Association, though somecinemas have asked that they stick to two minutesflat).“My dad is always asking me, when will I see your name in lights?” says Zoe Carey, an editor at Create Advertising, whose trailer and teaser credits includeNomadland,Paddingtonand the latest season ofThe White Lotus. “I’m like, never.”At school, Carey would spend her lunch breaks in the computer lab watching trailer after trailer, and as a student she acted as “the videographer” of her shared house. “I got hooked by the craft of editing and storytelling, and how something that can be shapeless can become so awesome. I realised that was my calling.”Create Advertising editor Zoe Carey’s trailer for The White LotusIf making a feature film is like writing a novel, Carey compares trailer-editing to writing poetry. Presented with a cut of the film that might be finished, or may be more like a bundle of rushes, editors – who may work alone or in a bigger team – distil the project’s essence and mood, adding music (which often, to viewers’ frustration, isn’t in the film itself because of licensing restrictions) and ordering dialogue into a narrative. Some may watch the whole thing on mute, then listen to the whole audio track, picking out the key moments from each. Once a first cut is presented, the back-and-forth with the client kicks into gear.Despite their invisible creators, trailers have been central to the history of film, with huge sums spent on their creation. Mike DiBenedetto, whose notable edits include the trailer forEnchantedand many Marvel movies, got a job in the early 2000s driving tapes of potential cuts all over town and then worked his way up. Agencies would be pitted against one another to land the job: “Warner Bros might have 16 trailers commissioned for a movie, and only one of them is going to win. It was very sports-like – every big assignment you got put on to was like a cup competition.” As a biography for DiBenedetto on an industry website notes: “Some of his trailers were beautiful. Some were bombastic. Some were hilarious. Most of them died.”Mike DiBenedetto’s trailer for EnchantedThat level of competition could result in a toxic atmosphere. Earlier in Carey’s career, her boss would ask to present her cuts as his own in meetings with clients. “I would say yeah, that’s fine – it wasn’t because he was trying to take credit for my work, it was because there was a predetermined idea of what an editor should look like.” (While the industry is still pretty male-dominated, she says: “There’s no way that would happen now.”)When DiBenedetto started out, the voiceover-led trailer was still king, and editors tended to be technical specialists, often hired from post-production editing houses. “But then my generation of trailer editors came along, and we were just nerds – the guys who recorded trailers on their VHS at home. I grew up on skateboard videos and Tarantino. We were coming at it from a completely different direction.” Over time, the voiceover declined in popularity, in order to let the film speak for itself, rather than “pulling people out of the experience. It was really exciting – you could no longer just write a script, put music underneath it and call it a day.”View image in fullscreenMonica Brady and Evelyn Watters, co-founders of the Golden Trailer awards, at the 2019 ceremony.Photograph: Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images for Golden Trailer AwardsA few years before, sisters Monica Brady and Evelyn Watters were trying to make their first feature film, and wanted to make a trailer to tempt investors (a common, but lesser-known function of the format). “My sister said: ‘There must be an awards show for trailer editors, we’ll find the best ones there.’ But there wasn’t,” says Brady. So they decided to create one, and managed to lure Quentin Tarantino and the British film-maker Stephen Woolley on to the Golden Trailer awards’ first judging panel in 1999.Now in its 25th year, the awards show is fittingly short – “Eighty minutes this year,” Brady says; “Seventy to 80,” Watters adds: “I have an extremely short attention span.”The pair are themselves true trailer heads. In college, Brady once let her car battery die in order to watch them: her cinema companion pointed out that she’d left the lights on, and “I was like: ‘Ah, someone will jump-start me later. We’re not missing the trailers.’”Categories include best feature, best animated, best action and scores more (though trashiest trailer, awarded for the best use of sex or gore, was relegated from the main show after the sisters’ aunt, a nun, came to the ceremony). But a perennial favourite is the Golden Fleece award, given to the best trailer for a bad film. It’s part-joke, part-tribute to the essence of what a great trailer editor can do: make a film appear as the best version of itself.Carey was proud to be nominated for a Golden Fleece in 2019 for her trailer for Welcome to Marwen, a Steve Carell-led biopic of a photographer who dealt with PTSD by building a second world war-era village out of dolls. The film bombed, and wassummarised in these pagesGuardian as “Steve Carell on icky form in straightwashed misfire”.The trailer, Carey says, “was … hard to crack”. As the trailer begins, the film does indeed seem baffling – poorly animated dolls fire machine guns, and Carell shows a neighbour his Nazi-doll torture scene. But as the Foo Fighters’ Learning to Walk Again” fades in, and a plasticky Carell booms “If I can be a hero, so can you,” I find myself … moved. Smiling. Wait, am I crying?You would think that being landed with a bad film – or even one you don’t like – might be offputting, but the editors I speak to don’t see it that way. John Piedot, whose agency’s drug-and-expletive-filled trailer for the Irish film Kneecap won a Clio advertising award, points out that it’s a “service industry” – finding something appealing in any project is the essence of the job. DiBenedetto sees his role as “working out who the person who wants to watch this is, and how do I tell them that it’s great? My ex-father-in-law loved Baby Geniuses, the terrible movie with the talking babies. Getting him in front of that film – that was a win for everybody.” Of course, this can be taken too far: the trailer for Kangaroo Jack lured children to the cinema expecting a talking kangaroo, only to find it was an action film in which the titular marsupial raps, but only in a dream sequence. Fan disappointment can have consequences – two Ana de Armas stansunsuccessfully took the creators of Yesterdayto court after the actor appeared in the trailer, but not in the film.View image in fullscreenAna de Armas appeared in the trailer for Yesterday, but didn’t make the film’s final cut.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamySince the glory days of the 2000s, budgets and bidding wars have contracted a little, and the time given by studios for a first cut of a trailer by an agency has generally shrunk from two weeks to one. When I ask about Cameron Diaz’s character, Amanda, in The Holiday, perhaps the biggest portrayal of a trailer editor in popular culture, her mansion with its onsite editing suite raises some smirks. “I once worked for an editor with a huge house in the Palisades – the money in the trailer industry was no joke,” DiBenedetto says. Carey rolls her eyes – “if I had a dollar for every time someone asks me about The Holiday …” – and is forced to point out that Amanda isn’t a trailer editor – she’s a trailerproducer,and “an annoying one at that”, hovering over the shoulder of John Krasinski’s character, the actual trailer editor. Later, though, Carey sends me a photo of a poster for The Holiday on her wall: “Since it was the first movie that shone a light on trailers, I felt like I had to have some artwork honouring it!”The growth of streaming, and the disruption to the more traditional path of films from cinema to home video or DVD, has injected some uncertainty, too.A recent N+1 pieceabout Netflix’s strategy laid out that marketing for individual titles is far less important than simply getting people on to your platform in the first place. As DiBenedetto puts it: “Netflix realised there wasn’t a lot of return on investment on cutting a full-blown trailer when you can just pull a single snippet of the show out instead.”But most of Carey’s work now is for streamer-released shows: “More platforms mean more content, which means more trailers, more work for everyone.” Cutting the White Lotus trailer was a career highlight: “It was such a big cultural moment, and I love the show so much.” As with a big cinema releases, big streaming releases may now see a number of agencies competing for the commission. The Golden Trailer awards, accordingly, now have awards for TV shows and for “digital” trailers.View image in fullscreenA shot from the specially filmed Terminator 2 teaser trailer, with Arnold Schwarzenegger.Photograph: TristarThanks in part to the sorry efforts achieved so far, none of the editors I spoke to are too worried about AI. Dan Noall, who works mostly with independent film studios, points out that large language models “by definition produce an average approximation of what you ask it to do”, having been fed, say, 100 comedy trailers; or told to find scenes that represent the overall message of a film. says: “Clients don’t want average, they want something that stands out. AI would produce something incredibly lazy.” Brady and Watters haven’t detected much anxiety, either. Brady says: “It’s like clothes – you can buy a suit at Macy’s or wherever. But then there will always be the people who need Savile Row. You’ll always still need the person that cuts the suit to perfection.”Attack of the spoilers: are trailers giving away too much?Read moreThe problem with the AI trailer for Morgan, ultimately, is that it doesn’t make you feel anything. The best trailers are ballets of condensed emotion; shots of what you might experience over two or three hours in the cinema. Piedot vividly remembers hiring the VHS for Total Recall from Blockbuster in 1991, not because of the film, but for the specially filmedTerminator 2 teaserthat preceded it; the camera crawling up a robotic body until it reaches Arnold Schwarzenegger’s face. “I must have watched and rewatched it 100 times.” Looking back on his favourite trailers, DiBenedetto reflects that they often age badly, as they land so squarely in their moment, playing on the references, experiences, memoriesand excitement of the people sitting in the cinema that day.Brady and Watters are still hoping to develop that original film project, the one they needed a trailer for. The book they want to adapt contains a scene about a character desperate to ditch his date at a drive-through cinema, until he sees the trailers come on. “And he says something like: ‘I always have to watch the trailers,’” Brady says, eyes lit up, “Because they give me hope there’s something coming in the future.”Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

The 67-year-old has long been one of the most politically outspoken artists of his generation, even in the face of government pressure over his criticism of its human rights violations.View image in fullscreenAerial view of Franklin D Roosevelt Four Freedoms state park.Photograph: Iwan BaanIn 2010, the Chinese government held him in a secret detention center for 80 days and repeatedly interrogated him for charges of tax fraud. He left the country in 2015, and maintained studios all over the world, including in London and Berlin. He now lives and works in Portugal, and is currently the subject of a large retrospective at the Seattle Museum of Art including four decades of work.His new project at the Franklin D Roosevelt Four Freedoms state park, a place on the southernmost tip of Roosevelt Island that memorializes the 32nd president’s famous speech on human rights, embodies the artist’s “personal commentary on what is unfolding politically and culturally in our time”, Weiwei told theNew York Times. It is the first commission by Art X Freedom, which provides an annual budget of $250,000 for works altering the 3.5-acre park. Each artist will also receive a $25,000 prize.“Public art is a mirror to our times,” said the initiative’s co-chair, philanthropist Agnes Gund. “Art X Freedom speaks to the urgent need to protect freedom for all, including freedom of speech, expression and the right to dissent – values that are the bedrock of democracy and justice.”Added Allison Binns, a venture capitalist who serves as Gund’s co-chair: “Ai Weiwei is globally renowned for his provocative and thought-provoking body of work and his staunch and unwavering advocacy for human rights. We could not have found a more perfect partner or resonant project to help us introduce Art X Freedom to the world and inspire park visitors.”Camouflage will remain on view until 1 December 2025. The conservancy will announce finalists for the September 2026 installation in the fall of this year.Explore more on these topicsAi WeiweiNew YorkDesignnewsShareReuse this content"

We deliver the programme to you in a way you want to watch it.” Declining box office takings forced the question, he continued, of “What is the consumer trying to tell us?” Sarandos’s verdict: “That they’d like to watch movies at home.”Asked whether he felt making movies for people to watch in cinemas as a communal experience was increasingly obsolete, Sarandos said, “I believe it is an outmoded idea, for most people – not for everybody.”In 2019, Netflix took over the last single-screen movie theatre in Manhattan, but since the pandemic, the streamer’s primacy has accelerated – although a much-coveted best picture Oscar still eludes the company.Sarandos went on to credit Netflix for making consumers more broad-minded, saying subscribers frequently view numerous different genres. He then noted that a promotional event for wrestling event WWE Monday Night RAW included a live chamber music performance inspired by Netflix’s bodice-ripping hit Bridgerton.Earlier on Wednesday, Saranos had said that the entertainment industry often gets “thrown under the bus” when it comes to trade deals. He later expanded on this, saying that free trade agreements with other territories might include an exception for entertainment, requiring a minimum investment obligation that only the entertainment businesses have to follow.“What I was saying is, it’s often that the entertainment industry doesn’t get treated like a real business, and that’s one of the examples of it,” he said.There are fears in Hollywood that Donald Trump’s tariff battles may affect the reach of entertainment such as TV shows and films.Earlier this month China announced it will further curb the number of US films allowed to screen in the country, in response to Trump’s imposition of heavy tariffs on Chinese imports.“The wrong action of the US government to abuse tariffs onChinawill inevitably further reduce the domestic audience’s favourability towards American films,” the China Film Administration said. “We will follow the market rules, respect the audience’s choice, and moderately reduce the number of American films imported.”Explore more on these topicsFilm industryTed SarandosNetflixTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

But president Michael I Kotlikoff wrote in a public statement: “In the days since Kehlani was announced, I have heard grave concerns from our community that many are angry, hurt, and confused that Slope Day would feature a performer who has espoused antisemitic, anti-Israel sentiments in performances, videos, and on social media. While any artist has the right in our country to express hateful views, Slope Day is about uniting our community, not dividing it.”Kehlani, whose first two albums reached the US Top 3 in 2017 and 2020, has publicly supported Palestine a number of times. She appeared in front of Palestinian flags in the video to her 2024 song Next 2 U, wearing a suit stitched with keffiyeh scarf material. The video also features the words “long live the intifada” at the outset, a phrase which has been chanted at protests over the Israel-Gaza war.“Intifada” has been used to name particular armed conflicts between Palestinians and Israelis, and also to general Palestinian resistance to Israel. Some US politicians and academics have equated the term, which translates as “shaking off”, with calls for violence, even genocide, against Jewish people.In an Instagram post announcing the song, Kehlani quoted US artist-activist Toni Cade Bambara’s aphorism “the role of the artist is to make the revolution irresistible”, and added: “As an artist, i was nervous [to release Next 2 U]. terrified … paired with the crippling wonder of what music is appropriate to drop during the most historical tragedies of our generation.” A T-shirt made in Palestine was sold alongside the song to raise funds for aid organisation Operation Olive Branch.In a video in May 2024 castigating some of her music peers for their lack of comments on the war, Kehlani said “fuck Israel, fuck Zionism”.The Guardian has contacted representatives of Kehlani for comment.Kotlikoff acknowledged that “my decision will be celebrated by some and criticised by others. I believe it is the right thing to do and the decision I must make to ensure community and safety at this high-profile event”.Numerous US university campuses have seen pro-Palestine protests on their grounds since the October 2023 outbreak of war, and in March this year, 60 universities were sent warning letters by the Department for Education, telling them to “fulfill their obligations … to protect Jewish students on campus”. Secretary of education Linda McMahoncharacterisedthe campus protests as “relentless antisemitic eruptions”.In a subsequentNew York Times op-ed, without making direct reference to the warnings, Kotlikoff defended Cornell’s handling of a protest during an event with Israeli and Palestinian speakers. “Universities, despite rapidly escalating political, legal and financial risks, cannot afford to cede the space of public discourse and the free exchange of ideas,” he wrote. “Democracies are not silent places, and neither are universities. They are vibrant, active and sometimes unruly; differences are aired, disagreements argued, voices raised.”Earlier this month, the Trump administration froze $1bn in federal funding for Cornell university, with university officials acknowledging they had received “more than 75 stop work orders” relating to various research grants.The proposed Kehlani concert is the second live music event this week to face criticism over artists’ support for Palestine and condemnation of Israel, following the performance ofIrish rappers Kneecapat California’s Coachella festival.Their performance featured a backdrop with the words: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people” and “Fuck Israel. Free Palestine.”Pro-Israel groups, Fox News presentersand Sharon Osbourneall criticised Kneecap, with Osbourne calling for their US work visas to be revoked and accusing them of “aggressive political statements … this band openly support terrorist organisations.”Kneecap responded by saying: “Statements aren’t aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.”Explore more on these topicsKehlaniR&BPop and rockUS universitiesFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

Circa’s acrobats, five women, five men, look like classical statues slowly coming to life in the Introduction, as their lifts and dives become ever more vertiginous. The Danse Guerrière became a spectacular contest of prowess between two men on a climbing frame, and in Chloé’s Danse Suppliante, a woman hovered and swung with supreme grace in bolts of cloth high above the orchestra. The interlocking bodies of Lever du Jour, suggestive of ancient Greek friezes, were particularly beautiful, though the final Bacchanale, where the music turns orgiastic, eventually coalesces into an aggressive, unresolved standoff between two men.View image in fullscreenSupreme grace … Circa and the LPO perform Daphnis et Chloé.Photograph: Pete WoodheadThe sudden ambivalence, in fact, marked the transition to La Valse with its underlying sense of society careering towards its own destruction. The atmosphere was markedly different. Tracksuits and skirts replaced the clingy lacy outfits worn in Daphnis, and where the latter was danced in pools of light, all pastel shades and purple, the platform now glowed red.The choreography was again spectacular, if more closely woven: we’re now aware of tautness and tension throughout. Routines began and ended in the formality of ballroom hold, which felt increasingly like a constraint, and Gardner ratcheted up the pressure as the waltz itself moved almost imperceptibly from suave elegance to something infinitely more troubling. Lifschitz’s ending, meanwhile, with the 10 acrobats simultaneously performing a different spotlit dance was astonishing, but we were also suddenly and shockingly aware how isolated each had become. Powerful, beautiful stuff, and a most extraordinary evening.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBalletreviewsShareReuse this content"

In some cases, as these readers told us, they might replace things altogether.

It arrived a week later with some good advice about how to prolong the life of its graters: don’t put them in the dishwasher and always store them in the holder they come with.Aideen‘Hands down my favourite bit of kit’: 13 kitchen gadgets top chefs can’t live withoutRead moreExposure bike lightView image in fullscreenStrada MK12 bike light£325 at Exposure Lights£437.99 at AmazonA rubber band that covers the USB charging port on my bike light broke.

To my surprise, replacement zips were offered for free so I duly packed it up and returned it. Within a few days I received a phone call apologising for the fact that it no longer stocked zips of the exact colour of my grey top, but it could offer a black zip or a repair at the bottom of the zip, which is what I opted for.

Can a new global ‘upcycling’ scheme change not only the industry, but how we think about dressing?Chloe Mac DonnellThu 24 Apr 2025 12.00 EDTShareIn 1942, the British government’s Board of Trade launched a Make Do and Mend scheme. It was one of several campaigns encouraging the public to save resources during the second world war by learning basic sewing skills alongside taking on bigger projects such as remodelling men’s clothing into womenswear. Today,Fashion Revolution, a non-profit social enterprise founded in the wake of the 2013Rana Plaza factory disasterin Bangladesh, is gearing up to launch its ownMend in Public Day. This weekend participants from all over the world will be able to join free local community classes to learn how to mend and stitch.However, this scheme is aimed at addressing not scarcity, but overconsumption.Cheap prices and a fast-paced trends cycle has made fashion the most polluting industry after oil and gas, causing10% of global carbon emissions. Microfibres from synthetic clothing arefound in food chains, while in 2023 a photo taken from space ofa mountain of clothesin Chile’s Atacama Desert went viral. We live in an era of social mediaclothing haulsand a “wear once, then toss” mentality. It’s often cheaper to buy a replacement of a stained item than it is to get it dry cleaned, and the same is true for rips and tears. Even the threat of tariffs on fast-fashion giants such as Shein and Temu is unlikely to significantly deter garment gluttony – their prices are so low (Temu once sold boots for $0) that they will still be deemed cheap with higher duties added.View image in fullscreenProtest vest … Ahluwalia’s spring/summer 2025 collection, featuring tops made from upcycled doilies.Fashion Revolution describes the scheme as a protest. “In an age of throwaway fashion, repairing our clothes is a revolutionary act,” they say. “While the fashion industry operates on a global scale, its impacts and required solutions can vary by region, calling for localised action.” But this collective action is not just about repairs. They are also encouraging upcycling – reusing existing garments or discarded materials to transform them into new products. Luxury designers such asAhluwalia, whose knitted ribbed tops made from deadstock fabrics have been worn by celebrities such as Doechii, and the French designer Marine Serre, who transforms old terry cloths and silk scarves into dresses and jackets, are proof that upcycling is cool not crusty.Many smaller independent UK brands are driving the change.World Secretsmakes clogs using antique kilim rugs, whileHelen Kirkumsources secondhand trainers from charity retailers and then deconstructs and remakes them into shiny new versions. Then there’sPikol Clothing, which crafts White Lotus-esque holiday shirts from vintage tablecloths, andSpilt Milk, which makes everything from fisherman vests to bishop-sleeved blouses from pretty vintage textiles.For those who are staring at moth-eaten cashmere jumpers (’tis the season) or party dresses with ripped hems, a newly launched upcycling app,Loom, is hoping to be part of the solution. The platform lets you upload a photo of your damaged or unworn item then connects with you designers offering everything from visible mending to dyeing and redesign.In a world where fashion trends take off then burn out within days, repairing and reworking something you love could just be the ultimate act of defiance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It makes sense, right?”This year brings the centenary of the chocolate digestive, with the biscuit having been made by McVitie’s since 1925.They were a follow-up to the plain digestive, first manufactured in 1892 but conceived much earlier by two Scottish doctors who believed the sodium bicarbonate ingredient would aid digestion.Consider the biscuitRead moreThey now regularly come top of Britain’s favourite biscuit lists and were followed in a 2020 poll by shortbread, chocolate fingers, jaffa cakes (not a biscuit) and chocolate hobnobs. Chocolate digestives were also named as the best dunker in 2009.In his travel book, Notes From a Small Island, the American-British writer Bill Bryson asked: “What other nation in the world could possibly have given us William Shakespeare, pork pies, Christopher Wren, Windsor Great Park, the Open University, Gardeners’ Question Time, and the chocolate digestive biscuit? None, of course.”The centenary has led to McVitie’s launching one of its biggest ever marketing campaigns, which includes a pop-up chocolate digestive store in Piccadilly Circus, London, from 2-5 May.It is not known whether the store will tell people how to eat their biscuits but, even for factory boss Coulson, old habits die hard.“I still do [eat it chocolate side up] if I’m totally honest,” he admitted.Explore more on these topicsBiscuitsFoodShareReuse this content"

And, thus, my no new things challenge was born.At first, the premise scared the crap out of me. I thought I would be chomping at the bit for the one-month mark to arrive. But the challenge welcomed so many incredible benefits and ushered so much ease into my life that I carried on – for nearlytwo years. Yep, 683 days of shopping my own closet, gifting experiences and thoughtful secondhand finds, outfitting my life with creative upcycles, and thoroughly enjoying an inbox free from constant promotions and receipts.I saved about $36,000 and paid off debt, which were awesome results, but I had expected the financial benefits. What I didn’t anticipate was how much time I reclaimed, how much my stress level dropped, and how much more creativity and focus I had. Life was genuinely better once I got off the consumerist hamster wheel.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jason RadfordA lot of people think they need to be in major financial straits or tussling with a clinical shopping addiction to embark on such a project, but that just ain’t true. Here are seven reasons why buying no new things might be for you.Reason 1:your stuff is stressing you outFor every item we bring into our lives, we become its inventory manager. From the moment of purchase, you are responsible for its upkeep, repair and end life.If the popularity of organizing television shows hasn’t driven it home for you, we are buckling under the weight of our stuff. Americans live in homes nearly triple the size ofthose of the 1950s, featuring expansive attics, garages, basements and walk-in closets. And yet, in 2016 the US boastedmore self-storage facilitiesthan Starbucks, McDonald’s and Subway restaurants combined.It’s been estimated that there are enough garments on the planet to dress thenext six generations, butwe buy64 new clothing items and seven and a half pairs of new shoes each year. That expression “The things we own, own us” isn’t wrong –we’ve just been conditioned to not clearly see how freaking owned we are.Perhaps most importantly, 54% of us genuinely believe our stuff is a root cause of our stress, and 70% of uswant to buy less. In one study, women who saw their homes as cluttered had much higher levels ofthe stress hormone cortisolthroughout the day.Go ahead – look around your space. Do you feel awash with calm and contentment, or are you annoyed by the mental load that accompanies the piles of items you need to return, put away, clean, or get rid of? Seventy-eight per cent of us feel so overwhelmed that we don’t even know where to start.Reason 2:you want to better steward your moneyYour goal might be to spend less, aggressively save, or generate more income. Inflation is raging and the price of groceries has folks weeping in the aisles. But has that stress stopped us from impulse-buying useless things? Nah. Here are the sobering facts: according to a 2015 report, 80% of Americans were in some form ofconsumer debt, and yet we keep buying, with the average adultspending $18,000 a yearon nonessentials alone.The quest for stuff also comes at the expense of our security and future prosperity; 56% of Americansdon’t have enough savingsto cover a $1,000 emergency, and 25% haveno retirement savings, including nearly half of all baby boomers.We don’t even enduringly enjoy the stuff we buy. Sixty-four per cent of us ultimatelyregret short-term purchaseslike clothes, cars and electronics.Reason 3:overconsumption is killing the planet, and you want to helpBetween 1945 and 1992, industrial productivitysoared by 96%in almost every area – goods, agriculture, services and fuel – to keep pace with our consumerism.This rise in production has spiked harmful global emissions. According to one 2014 report, the atmospheric concentration of CO2, just one of the many gases that hastens climate change,increased by 43%since the second world war.As our purchasing habits have shifted from moderation to overconsumption, industry has kept pace. At our current consumption levels, we will neednearly two Earthsto provide the necessary resources and absorb all that waste. It’s even estimated that by 2050, the ocean will containmore plastic than fish.Look around your home and in your trash cans right now and play I Spy with plastic. You might see soft shopping and food bags, bottles of soda and tubs of yogurt, mailers, bubble wrap, cling film, Styrofoam, tape, pens, kitchen tools, clothing made from synthetic fibers, phone cases, the cheaply made must-have crap you were influenced to buy on Temu. For a relatively young material that’s only been on the consumer scene for about 70 years, we’ve created demand that’s led industry to supply us with 9bn tons since 1950, none of which ever fully biodegrades.Not buying new stuff relieves the resources used and pollution caused from production of new items; extends the utility of existing things, diverting them from landfill; and lends valuable intel to retailers about the kind of future you want because you’re voting with your dollar.Reason 4:you want to reclaim your timeYou’ve probably heard that the average American wastesnearly two and a half hours a dayon social media and another three hours zoning out in front of the tube (both of which are monetized to the max to sell us products, by the way). But did you know that in the 2010s, we spent nearly one and a half hours each dayshopping, and 55 minutes a dayjust looking for things? That’s right – sifting through stuff to the tune of nearly 14 days a year. Getting into gendered data, it was estimated that the average woman spent about400 hours a year shopping. That’s nearly eight and a half years in a lifetime.What would you do with a few extra hours every day, or better yet, extra years in your life? Spend more time with your kids? What about that novel you wanted to write or that race you were going to train for? Or maybe you’d just get more sleep.I highly doubt many of us would use that extra time to shop. If you’re among the 80% of Americans who feel that there arenever enough hours in the day, it’s worth removing the rose-colored “Shopping is fun!” glasses to see how consumerism has siphoned time away from the pursuits and moments that actually make your life worth living.Reason 5:you want more contentment, creativityand clarityDo you feel like you’re operating on hard mode most days – just going through the motions, not really feeling inspired or fulfilled? Or maybe you struggle to access your creativity or contentment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Individuals makeupward of 35,000 decisionsa day. If that sounds staggering, that’s because it is – what to eat, when to make a phone call, which route to take, what color shirt to wear.This “paradox of choice” is not great for us. It requires our brains to work harder, causing stress and indecision, and is even shown to make it moredifficult to exercise self-control.When we’re overwhelmed by choices, we aren’t thinking clearly. So it should come as little surprise that shopping less, especially online where we’re bombarded by constant suggestions and endless options, can markedly reduce the clouded thinking that accompanies daily decision burden.Reason 6:you want to stop conflating your worth with stuffConsumer culture requires that we use material items as benchmarks of our identity, sense of belonging, and social status. Under this arrangement, we never have enough stuff, or the right stuff, and thus are stuck in a toxic compare-and-consume trap that creates significant distress and undermines our sense of self.Whether we want to admit it or not, modern marketing has turned us into creatures who shop our insecurities and fears. For instance, folks who feel uncertain about their socioeconomic position tend to buy items they feel willelevate their status(at least in the eyes of others), with more than half of luxury items being purchased bypeople in low- or middle-income brackets. If we’re self-conscious about our skin or weight, we’re more likely to buy hoards of products geared toward “fixing” those issues.According toone survey, 96% of us engage in “retail therapy” as a way of momentarily silencing our emotions. And yet this supposed cure is also the cause. Stuff-related issues like compulsive shopping and hoarding, a DSM-recognized clinical disorder, have increased exponentially in just thepast few years.Depending on how we’re feeling and what we need, buying stuff can be conflated with security, entertainment, and enrichment. About 42% of US adultslist shopping as a hobby(remember those “Shopping is my cardio” shirts?).How often have we heard someone justify a big-ticket or luxury splurge by saying, “I’m investing in myself”? Don’t get it twisted; stuff is never an investment toward you becoming more of who you’re meant to be. These warped rationales cause us serious distress, with 71% of buyers reporting theyactually feel worse shortly after buying things. Under a system that benefits from us never feeling like we have or are enough, using stuff as a goalpost of our worth and growth is a fool’s errand. What we’re really seeking isn’t sold in a store.Reason 7:you want to regain control over your impulsesWhen I hear from challenge participants, they’ll sometimes defeatedly say: “Ugh, I have no willpower.” Nope, you’re just a perfect product of conditioned consumerism. And that is by design.Since the boom of postwar industrialization and the rise of modern-day advertising, we’ve become habituated to what I callconditioned consumerism(and when I’m feeling extra spicy,coerced consumerism). Shopping replaced baseball as the great American pastime, and having bigger, better, more luxurious and futuristic things supplanted the “make do and mend” ethos that got us through the Great Depression and global conflict. The result is a manufacturing system that stopped repairing items and a populace of consumers hungry for newness in the form of convenient, off-the-rack, cheaply overproduced, on-demand crap.Marketing has kept pace, with many companies today aiming to reach you (on social media, on TV, on the internet, on billboards, on your phone, in the middle of your favorite podcast or show) to get you to buy even more stuff. They know you, they know your feelings, and they weaponize that intel to make you feel less than so you’ll buy more.Doesn’t it piss you off that they’re using personal data to manipulate you and make you feel crummy? That sucks. And it happens all day, every day – so deftly, so artfully, so strategically, you don’t even know it.Imagine your life with more of what you want and less of what you don’t. Maybe that’s more time, more peace, more stability. Perhaps it’s reduced clutter and eased money woes. Getting time, energy, and control back was and continues to be the most attractive part of No New Things for me – and the great news is that if you’re yearning to exert control over coerced consumerism and reap many or all of these ancillary benefits, you can.FromNo New Things: A Radically Simple 30-Day Guide to Saving Money, the Planet, and Your Sanityby Ashlee Piper.

To mark its anniversary, our writer takes on a particularly wild sectionPhoebe SmithThu 24 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 02.02 EDTShareHigh on the ridges of the Pennines, somewhere between the waters of Malham Tarn in the Yorkshire Dales and Kirk Yetholm in the Scottish Borders, a 31-year-old woman stands amid a group of mainly male walkers. She’s wearing bell-bottom jeans, a fitted long-sleeve top and an Alice band to keep her hair out of her face in the prevailing westerly wind. Her name is Joyce Neville and the year is 1952. She’s in the middle of a walk along a proposed national trail – the Pennine WayJoyce had seen an advert for this self-described “Pioneer Walk” in the Sunday newspapers a few months earlier. It was placed by the writer and campaignerTom Stephensonwho was requesting “accomplished walkers, fit and over 18” to take part in a 15-day hike on the “long green trail” he was suggesting be created in Britain (inspired by the US’s 2,200-mile Appalachian Trail). Few women wore jeans back then, according to Joyce’s notes (which were passed on to me by Paddy Dillon, author of Cicerone’sWalking the Pennine Wayguidebook), and the whole trip cost just £25.Pennine Way between Middleton and GreenheadMore than 70 years later, my friend Cerys and I are standing in the Pennines, at the lip of a feature known as High Cup Nick. This glacially scoured U-shaped valley, known as England’s Grand Canyon, sits above the village of Dufton in Cumbria. We are on the first day of a three-day walk on the Pennine Way (which officially opened in 1965) to celebrate its diamond anniversary. We’d begun on a cold but sunny day in February at the waterfall-rich town of Middleton-in-Teesdale, and already scrambled alongside the torrent of Cauldron Snout, listened to the call of corncrakes in the farmland of the Eden Valley, bog-hopped along the path beside MOD Warcop training ground (out of bounds to hikers without prior permission), and arrived at this – one of the geological highlights of the entire 268-mile trail.View image in fullscreenJoyce Neville’s notes from her 1952 Pennines walk.Photograph: Phoebe SmithThe landscape would have been the same when Joyce trod it in the 1950s, though some things have definitely changed.“Back then it was a damn tough walk because all the blanket bog would be trodden into a filthy morass that got to waist-deep at times,” said Paddy when I called him pre-trip to ask advice about the section we had decided to walk, between Middleton-in-Teesdale and Greenhead, inspired by the same three-day trip Stephenson made in 1948 to publicise his cause. He was accompanied by five MPs, among them Barbara Castle (one of the longest serving female MPs in British history) and Arthur Blenkinsop (a Labour MP for South Shields who went on to become vice-president of the Ramblers). “You could have worn waders and it might have kept you clean. Now, thanks to the flagstones, you can do it in carpet slippers.”Joyce noted that when women were expected to wear long tweed skirts for walking, her outfit was regarded as quite scandalousWe weren’t quite so bold as to ditch our hiking boots, but our gear was definitely changed from Joyce’s day. At the time, she notes, when women were expected to wear long tweed skirts for walking, her outfit was regarded as quite scandalous. In a way, we have Joyce and other women like her to thank for the fact that we can now wear warm, dry fleece-lined trousers without offending anyone. We also had our lightweight waterproof jackets, and didn’t have to carry heavy canvas bell tents like they did. When Joyce was walking this route, hikers had to negotiate with farmers to camp in their fields; later, after the path’s official opening, there were about 20 YHA hostels along the route. There are only a handful left, so guesthouses, pubs with rooms, the occasional campsite and Airbnbs are the way most people do things.View image in fullscreenHigh Cup Nick was one of the early highlights of the writer’s walk.Photograph: Phoebe SmithAs we stand gawping at the crumbling buttresses and pinnacles that line the edges of High Cup, we meet a hiker called Mike, 73, with his dog Ringo, who says he lived along the trail at Earby when the Pennine Way opened.“I remember we’d hear the banging of frying pans before we ever saw the walkers,” he laughs. “They were hanging off the backpacks of the factory workers from Manchester who would clock off on Saturday and start walking and see how far they could get before they had to head back to work on Monday.”Similar to those early walkers, we were squashing our walk in between work. In contrast, we would be staying in warm “hobbit huts” atDufton Caravan Park, having walked fromBrunswick House B&B, run by Andrew Milnes, who told us that trail walkers account for a third of his annual business.We plough through the 17 miles, listening to the song of curlews, spying wild deer and admiring snowdropsDespite good accommodation, the distance is no shorter, and when we arrive into Dufton at dusk we head immediately for a hearty meal atThe Stag Inn– thankful we don’t need to cook our own dinner. We chat to Amanda behind the bar who raves about the section of the trail we were walking. “Do you think it will last another 60 years?” I ask her. “60?” she says. “It will last another 6,000 – it’s not going anywhere.”We were, however, and after a cosy night, we begin our walk on the hardest and highest section of the trail – over Cross Fell, home to the notoriously bitter Helm Wind (the only named wind in the UK). There is frost on the ground, the temperature is -4C (25F).By the time we reach the slopes of the 893-metre (2,930ft) peak, we hit the snowline. It is cold, but the ground is made solid by the frost, and we hike easily to the summit plateau, marked by a great stone cross (reportedly – we later find out from the woman who runs the Post Office at Garrigill – constructed on the trail’s opening by a reverend from Scotland who had received a message “from above” to build it to protect walkers). And as we reach it and see the Lakeland peaks spread out in front of us without even a breath of wind, I muse how perhaps it is working.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The trail’s creator, Tom Stephenson, never actually walked the entirety of his creation, the idea for which came in 1935, three years after the mass trespass ofKinder Scout, a protest in the Peak District for walkers’ rights. “He wasn’t interested in walking it, but he made damn sure other people did,” says Paddy. “His idea was if he could get people en masse into the countryside to areas previously forbidden to walk on, like Kinder Scout and Bleaklow [also in the Peak District], he could use that as a lever to get more rights in general for people to access previously private land.”After a night at theCumberland Innin Alston, we set our compass for Greenhead and Hadrian’s Wall, where we will grab a taxi, then the train at Haltwhistle to head home. We plough through the 17 miles easily, listening to the song of curlews, spying wild deer at the former Lambley station (now a private house), and admiring the snowdrops that have burst through the ground.The Pennine Way was the UK’s first national trail. There are now 17 in England and Wales, and four equivalent long-distance ‘great trails’ in ScotlandSince Stephenson’s pioneered the concept of a walk that allowed everyone to traverse the backbone of England, more routes have been established, such as theSouth Tyne Trail. For 23 miles, it follows the route of the defunct Haltwhistle railway line (closed in 1976; opened as a footpath in 2004) parallel to the Pennine Way and is so much easier and more commonly walked that Paddy has included it in his updated guidebook.The Pennine Way was the UK’s first national trail – there are now 17 in England and Wales, and four equivalent long-distance “great trails” in Scotland. The newest and longest yet, the 2,700-mile King Charles III England Coast Path is due to be fully walkable by the end of 2025; many parts of it are open now. Yet there is still much to fight for. According to the campaigning group Right to Roam, only 8% of England is accessible to hikers – nearly 49,000 miles of historic paths have been removed from official maps and 32,000 rights of way are blocked. Access is even more limited to those wishing to swim, cycle or camp (with one exception – wild camping is legal on Dartmoor, but this is beingcontested in the supreme courtby a wealthy landowner).Sixty years feels like a long time, but walking can still be a political act. And, perhaps, much like Joyce Neville in 1952, we should all hit the trails to exercise our right to roam.

The US department of justice emailed more than 350 organizations on Tuesday to tell them that the promised funding wasbeing terminated. According to a termination notice shared with the Guardian, the Department of Justice said the money was rescinded because it “no longer effectuates Department priorities”.Instead, the department intends to focus on “more directly supporting certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault, and better coordinating law enforcement efforts at all levels of government”, the notice read.“It was a bit like a slap in the face,” said Renée Williams, CEO of the National Center for Victims of Crime, which lost three grants, including one for a victim’s hotline, that the justice department had been funding for 10 years. The hotline shut down this Friday.Trump gutted key research programs studying violence. Experts say it will come at a heavy costRead more“We serve 16,000 people a year and there are other hotlines being shut down. When you see how many victims will be shut out from services, it’s terrifying.”The funding had come through the Office of justice programs (OJP), the justice department’s grant-making apparatus. Many of the grants were cut off in the middle of their funding cycles, throwing staffing and the survival of vital programs into jeopardy. The legality of these funding cuts is unclear and organizations across the country said they will be filing appeals and lawsuits to get the promised funds back.A spokesperson for the justice department said that the office would be focused on “prosecuting criminals, getting illegal drugs off of the streets, and protecting American institutions from toxic DEI and sanctuary city policies. Discretionary funds that are no longer aligned with the administration’s priorities are subject to review and reallocation”.The full tally of the rescinded funds is unclear, but the cuts come at a critical moment for community-based violence prevention, a field whose funding was super-charged during the Biden administration through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and whose work has been credited with the recent drop in homicides throughout the US.“We got that letter and couldn’t believe it at first. It’s frustrating, it’s disorienting and we know that this is a strategy that’s meant to keep us off balance,” said Joseph Griffin, executive director of Youth Alive, a more than 30-year-old Oakland-based violence prevention and intervention program.Youth Alive was more than one year into a three-year $2m grant from the justice department’s community based violence intervention and prevention initiative (CVIPI), which was formed in 2022 to support groups working in rural and urban communities struggling to address violence.Youth Alive, which also gets financial support from philanthropic donors, was planning to use the $2m to find ways that the healthcare agencies can support victims of violence, and evaluate its hospital-based violence intervention program, which dispatches staff to the bedsides of people who’ve been shot, as well as its broader violence interruption strategy. The loss of federal support follows adecrease in homicidesin Oakland in 2024.“What does violence prevention work look like without the federal government? These cuts are forcing us to come to terms with that,” Griffin said, noting that the cuts come just before summer, a season when gun violence tends to tick up. “How do we not get knocked off of our footing and figure out how to keep showing up in our community?”Since the creation of the CVIPI, more than $300m has been dispersed to groups such as Youth Alive that are led by people who live in areas with high concentrations of shootings, according to a former Biden administration official. Although it represents a small portion of the more than $4bn in grants the justice departmentawards annually, lawmakers and police partly attribute these programs this funding supports with thereduction in homicidesin cities across the US.White House removes advisory defining gun violence as a public health issueRead more“There’s a seismic shift happening that’s going to result in [violence prevention workers] being unemployed and more people being shot and hurt,” said Adam Rosenberg, executive director of Center for hope, a Baltimore-based group that provides prevention and healing services for children who’ve been the witnesses or victims of gun violence.The group lost $1.2m of a $2m grant that will impact at least seven staff members who worked directly with people impacted by violence. The grant money was intended to train staff and prevent shootings that begin on social media and spill onto the streets.Center for Hope also runs six of the city’s 10 Safe Street sites, which operate in the pockets of Baltimore that see the most shootings. Between 2023 and 2024, four of the sites run by center for hope saw zero homicides, according to Rosenberg. In that same timeframe, the number of homicides in the city decreased by 34% between 2023 and 2024, mayor Brandon Scottsaid in a post on Xon 3 February.“The biggest result of this: Victims not having resources,” Rosenberg said. “At its most catastrophic, we increase the risk of people dying, which is hard, especially when we turned the tide. We were winning.”The Department of Justice did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationGuns and liesGun crimeOpioids crisisUS politicsUS crimeOaklandBaltimorefeaturesShareReuse this content"

And the intersection, the briefest of meeting points for the two districts, captures the stakes of a “highly presidentialized” race.For nearly two years, Poilievre, a brazen and belligerent seven-term lawmaker, was theheir apparent to Canada’s top job. In poll after poll after poll, his party trounced the governing Liberals in a hypothetical matchup.Trump effect leaves Canada’s Conservatives facing catastrophic lossRead morePoilievre’s attacks on Justin Trudeau wereeffective and relentless. With a finely tuned sense for what angered voters, he took the unpopular prime minister to task over a spiralling cost-of-living crisis, housing unaffordability, mass immigration and a controversial tax on carbon emissions.The gambit appeared to be paying off. In early January, Trudeau announced he was resigning after nearly a decade in power. The Liberal leader’s reputation was tarnished by party infighting and an increasingly fatigued electorate. In the days after, the Conservatives hit their highest polling to date and with an election looming, looked poised for a generation-defining win.And then Donald Trump barrelled into Canadian politics. The unpredictable US president began threatening to impose tariffs onCanadaand even to annex the country to make it the 51st state. He addressed Trudeau as “governor” and threatened to use economic coercion.Canada opinion poll averagesThe impact for the Conservatives was devastating: within weeks,the party’s 25-point lead evaporated, and it now enters the final stretch of the campaign trailing well behind the Liberals.“Weeks before, people were thinking about inflation and cost of living. All of the sudden, they’re forced to think about the very existence of Canada. That shift is just unprecedented and I can’t think of this kind of complete reset in any jurisdiction around the world,” said David Coletto, head of the polling firm Abacus. “Trump has done the near-impossible: shifting a very anti-incumbent environment in 2024 into one where incumbency is more of an advantage. People are now looking for stability, as opposed to revolution.”View image in fullscreenCampaign signs for the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, are posted across the street from signs for the Liberal leader, Mark Carney, in Ottawa.Photograph: Dave Chan/AFP/Getty ImagesFor Carney, a political novice, the bruising nature of a federal campaign trail ahead of the election on 28 April has exposed his inexperience. Speaking to the media, his answers come off as unpolished and overly complicated.But voters appear ready to give him a chance. Some have wholeheartedly embraced the technocrat: at a rally, an overzealous supporter called out for Carney to “be our big daddy”. And in the Montreal neighbourhood whereLiberals recently lost a stronghold seat to the Bloc Québécois in a byelection, Carney has elicited a cautious interest from voters that deserted the separatist party.“The last thing I wanted was Justin Trudeau in the next election. It was getting to the point where I was ready to vote Conservative just to make a point – and I’ve never voted for them,” said Marc H, a father of two. “But now we’ve gota former central banker running in the midst of an economic crisis? Yeah, I’ll take a second look at him for sure.”Experts say Carney’s wonkish tendencies, his wealth and his time working for large investment firms would probably have weighed against his candidacy in any other election.“The idea of a former central banker who admitted on TV he doesn’t do his own grocery shopping probably wouldn’t have connected with an electorate that is reeling from an affordability crisis. Now, it doesn’t seem to matter as much. Relatability maybe isn’t what people need,” said Coletto.“And that presents a challenge for his opponents when they try to attack him. You accuse him ofplagiarizing his economics PhD dissertation?It reminds people he has a PhD in economics. You question him on his business experience? Now you’ve created a contrast with Poilievre, who has only ever been a politician. Everything’s been turned on its head.”Sensing how unpopular his predecessor was, Carney has pitched himself as a political outsider, trying to shed the political baggage of an incumbent Liberal government seeking its fourth consecutive term. During the only English language debate of the campaign, Carney turned to the Conservative leader and said: “I know you want to be running against Justin Trudeau.Justin Trudeau isn’t here.”Pollsters agree the electorate has split into two camps: those looking for change and those eager for stability. And much to the frustration of Conservatives, Liberals have copied many of their signature policies, including removing the consumer levy on carbon emissions. The strategic moves, which close the policy gaps between the two leaders, in effect force voters to assess the candidates themselves.“People are just going with their gut and how the leaders make them feel, as opposed to rationally looking at the policy set of each party,” says Coletto. “And the party that can harness the larger and more motivated group will likely determine the winner.”View image in fullscreenPierre Poilievre, left, and Mark Carney participate in the federal leaders’ debate in April.Photograph: Canadian Press/REX/ShutterstockIn Canada’s 2011 federal election, then prime minister Stephen Harper won slightly less than 40% of the vote and secured a majority government. In this cycle, some polling has the Conservatives higher than 40% and still falling well short of the Liberals.“Poilievre has been very, very successful in creating immense anti-Trudeau sentiment and in a normal election, that would have carried him through,” said Laura Stephenson, a professor of political science at the University of Western Ontario. But the binary nature of the race, fomented by the ever-present threat of Trump, has weakened the role of small opposition parties, pushing some to the brink of collapse.“Over the last few months, the entire calculus of people’s choice has gone up in smoke. And so what we’re seeing is the progressive movement uniting behind a single frontrunner to defeat another frontrunner,” said Stephenson.That coalescing of the progressive vote around Carney threatens to wipe out the New Democrats, a leftwing party thatsupported the governing Liberals after the 2021 election, keeping them in power in exchange for policy concessions. Now, the NDP is on track for its worst-ever performance as supporters flee to the Liberals, putting a partyleft for dead just months earlieron the verge of a majority government.The stark reversal of political fortunes have also prompted concern within the Conservative party that Poilievre’s own seat, which he has held since 2004, could be lost to the rival Liberal candidate. In recent weeks, the team overseeing the federal campaign has been sending workers to the Carleton riding, reflecting a belief the riding is tightly contested. Multiple media outlets have reported the shift in resources, which includes experienced workers typically used for tight races. A Conservative source confirmed these reports to the Guardian. The source also said factions within the party expect political recriminations if Poilievre fails perform on election day, including potential attempts to oust both the leader and his campaign manager Jenni Byrne.Carney has also benefited from being prime minister for only nine days before calling a snap election. When crisis immediately emerged in the form of tariff uncertainty, Carney suspended his campaign and held meetings with provincial and business leaders, later giving solemn speeches to the nation.“You could have 100 campaigns in a row and 99 times voters will pick the best politician. That’s not what seems to be happening this time,” said Scott Reid, a political adviser and former director of communications to the Liberal former prime minister Paul Martin. “They are literally picking someone that they think can be – ought to be – prime minister, even if they have political flaws that are apparent”Without the foil of Trudeau, Poilievre has nonetheless worked to harness the malaise of voters, calling a disgruntled electorate the symptom of a “lost Liberal decade”. To his fans, a charismatic career politician, not a banker, is the saviour the country needs.How Trump’s Canada threats dampened Quebec separatist movement – for nowRead more“Poilievre has more political experience, which I feel is just important – if not more – than business experience. We should have a prime minister who’s more worried about the politics of the situation at the moment than economic,” said Anshul Shah at a recent Conservative rally in the city of Brampton. “What I want is someone who knows how to do politics and someone who gets people excited.”For all his popularity with Conservatives, however, Poilievre has been dealt a blow by the US president.Trump’s trade warand annexation threats have caused broad outrage across Canada and the Conservative leader faced criticism, from opponents and from within his own party for reserving his most scathing attacks for Carney instead of the White House.In recent weeks, Poilievre has increasingly tried to condemn Trump while accusing the Liberals of leavingCanadavulnerable to its largest trading partner.“The campaign [has been unable] to truly adjust their tone, even though it’s plainly obvious that it evokes Maga,” said Reid. “But the other problem is that so much of this movement is built entirely around Pierre Poilievre, his perspective and his persona. That was its strength, and now it’s become its limitation.”An unsurmountable lead, held for two years, fell casualty to one of thesharpest polling shiftsin Canada’s political history, with the Conservatives now trailing well behind the Liberals. In the final days of the campaign, the race is Mark Carney’s to lose.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her parents were doing their best to reassure her that everything would be OK, but she knew they were in danger of being deported.She and her parents were one of the first to be sent to Karnes – one of two detention centers theTrump administrationhas commissioned to hold immigrant families. At first, she was the only kid – as far as she could tell – in the sprawling beige structure.Immigrationofficials had confiscated her family’s belongings, including her phone and her Nintendo Switch.There were a few books and games at the detention center, and a playground – but little else to distract her from her worries. “I just didn’t know what would happen to us,” she said.The Texas-based legal non-profit Raices said it was aware of at least 100 families held at Karnes since early March, after the Trump administration restarted the practice known as “family detention” – locking up children along with their parents. Those detained include families who had recently crossed into the US, as well as those swept up in cities across the country. Among the youngest detainees was a one-year-old child.Jade and her parents, Jason and Gabriela, are among the first to speak out about the conditions inside Karnes since being released. Now, back home inMississippi, Jade said she’s still trying to make sense of what happened. “I don’t know how to explain it. It was weird,” she said. “I still feel confused and scared.”The Biden administration suspended family detention in 2021 amid growing reports of sexual harassment and violence, medical neglect and inadequate food. The Trump administration has not only reinstated the practice, but Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, has said the administration would seek to challenge a longstanding settlement that limits the amount of time children can be held in detention.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that “adults with children are housed in facilities that adequately provide for their safety, security, and medical needs”.But human rights groups and pediatricians have said that these facilities – which are operated by private prison companies – are inherently harmful. In aletterto the Trump administration, several leading healthcare and pediatric groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, emphasized that “detention itself poses a threat to child health” and “even short periods of detention can cause psychological trauma and long-term mental health risks”.View image in fullscreenThe Karnes county facility in Texas.Photograph: Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images“Children experience time differently than adults do, and even brief periods of detention can have long term devastating consequences on a child’s development,” said Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School. “It’s cruel.”‘I wanted to cry the whole time’Jade and her family had fled a surge of violence inColombiain 2022, and had managed to make a good life for themselves in Mississippi.But things changed this year as the Trump administration ramped up its immigration crackdown. Jade was afraid to go to school, worried that immigration agents could come find her there, or take her parents while she was away. Jason and Gabriela had trouble finding work – employers had become squeamish about hiring workers without a legal status.“It was a very, very tough situation – it had become impossible to continue living here,” Jason told the Guardian in Spanish.So they decided to leave. Jade packed up her most prized possessions, including her Nintendo and all her favorite clothes. “I was like, I’m excited,” she said. “I’m going toCanada. I’m going to make new friends.”But they never made it to Canada.At first, they encountered Canadian border agents and tried to explain they were seeking asylum. But those agents told them they’d be ineligible, and turned them over to US border officials. “That’s when everything got out of hand,” Jason said.Agents handcuffed him and Gabriela, and drove them to Plattsburgh, New York and then Buffalo. “I wanted to cry the whole time,” Gabriela said.“Our daughter had never seen us like that – handcuffed like prisoners,” Jason added.In Buffalo, they were released from the cuffs, and sent via commercial flight to Texas. “The whole time we are trying to reassure our daughter, ‘Amor, nothing is wrong, it’s OK,’” Gabriela said. “But we didn’t have anything to distract her with, because she didn’t even have her Nintendo, her cellphone, she didn’t have her tablet, she couldn’t listen to music.”By the time they entered the detention center – a sprawling concrete facility set against the dusty landscape of Karnes county, Texas – they were exhausted. “We were in a state of shock,” Gabriela told the Guardian. “Maximum shock – because we didn’t know what would happen to us.”Jade was too young to remember the violence her family had left behind in Colombia, but Jason and Gabriela’s minds constantly flashed back to the threats and extortion they had faced. “It was anguish on a daily basis,” she said.During their first few days in detention, they didn’t know who to call for help. “How else do we fight for ourselves? We have nothing here,” Jason said. “Each day like this was torture.”Officials had confiscated all their things, and the family was given second-hand clothes and towels to use. They were able to buy minutes to make phone calls, but it was expensive.Gabriela and Jason struggled to find the words to help their daughter. “Imagine seeing your child sad because they can’t go to school. And you can’t even say, ‘Let’s go to the corner. Let’s go get ice cream. Or some chips,’” Gabriela said. “How do you explain any of this to a child? Your mom can’t do anything for you, your dad can’t do anything.”“She’s entering adolescence and everything that happens to her now will mark her. Everything that has happened could have broken her in some form, traumatized her,” she added. “That’s what distresses me as a mother.”Eventually a few other families arrived at the facility, including siblings aged three, six and eight. The youngest ones didn’t understand what was happening, so they weren’t as scared as she was – but they were just as tired, Jade said.She liked when the radio played at the detention center, especially when the Weeknd came on. “That’s my favorite singer,” she said. “I just tried to sit on the grass and listen, and look at the sky.”Relief finally came when they were able to connect with lawyers from Raices, who have been working with several families held at the detention center. Jade, Jason and Gabriela were finally released on 25 March – after about three weeks in detention – and their lawyers are now helping them seek legal status to remain in the US.All the families that were at Karnes have since been transferred to a bigger detention facility inDilley, Texas– which is more remote.“The bottom line is that these individuals have final deportation orders from federal judges,” said McLaughlin of the DHS. “This administration is not going to ignore the rule of law.”View image in fullscreenAsylum seekers hold hands as they leave a cafeteria at the jail in Dilley.Photograph: Eric Gay/APRaices said that assertion is “objectively untrue”.Immigration judgesare not the same as federal judges. And as a result of Donald Trump’s asylum ban at the southern border, “many families have not even appeared in front of immigration judges”, said Faisal Al-Juburi of Raices.At the same time, the administration ended several legal service and education initiatives for immigrants – narrowing opportunities for families inside the center to connect with lawyers, Al-Juburi said.The immigrant rights organization also contests the DHS’s assertion that Dilley has been adequately retrofitted for children.The facility, which is run by the private prison company CoreCivic, is not a licensed childcare facility and thus a violation of the protections afforded children under the Flores Settlement Agreement, a decades-old consent decree that requires the government to hold children in the least restrictive setting and release them as quickly as possible.How family detentions began, ended, and began againThe Trump administration isn’t the first to detain families.For decades, Democratic and Republican administrations have held immigrant families in specialized facilities – and the practice has elicited widespread criticism from pediatricians and mental health experts, and lawsuits from human rights groups.The family detention system took its lasting shape in 2001, and particularly post-9/11. The Bush administration had wanted to ramp up immigrant detention, and promoted family detention as an alternative to separating families and sending children to shelters while their parents were detained.Reports of human rights abuses in these facilities quickly followed. Families with children were held in prison-like conditions, with limited privacy and access to the outdoors. There was inadequate food and medical care, and reports of sexual abuse by guards.But family detention didn’t stop. Even as advocates sued the government and campaigned to close some family facilities, the government built others.In 2014, as families and unaccompanied children began increasingly arriving at the US southern border, the Obama administration contracted with private prison companies to open the Karnes and Dilley facilities, and the US family detention program grew to its largest since the internment of Japanese Americans in the 1940s.Legal challenges to the practice continued. In 2015 a judge ordered the release of children with their mothers, but then the first Trump administration pushed, unsuccessfully, toindefinitely detainfamilies.In 2018, a 21-month old toddler who became sick while being held at the Dilley detention centerdiedof her symptoms shortly after being released.Though the Biden administration stopped detaining families in 2021 – opting instead to track immigrant families via electronic monitoring and regular check-in appointments – it left in place most of the infrastructure to restart the practice.And earlier this year, the Trump administration did just that.Karnes, which the Biden administration used to hold adults, was recommissioned to hold families. Dilley, which had closed in 2024, reopened last month.Karnes, operated by the private contractor Geo Group, is more like a traditional adult prison, retrofitted with play sets, said Javier Hidalgo, the legal director at Raices. Cinderblock walls are painted withmurals of zoo animals. Families are allowed to be together during the day, but at night, mothers and children sleep together while fathers sleep in separate dorms.The South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, meanwhile, is more akin to an “internment camp”, said Hidalgo. Before it was a detention center, it was a migrant labor camp. But in the end, both centers are, “essentially, jails”, he said.View image in fullscreenA child rides a bike at the Dilley facility.Photograph: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty ImagesIn past years, the centers were commonly used to hold families newly arriving at the southern border. Officials kept families detained while evaluating their eligibility for asylum, and released them into the US if they passed an initial screening.But the Trump administration has suspended asylum requests at the border, and unauthorized crossings have dropped precipitously. Many of the families in detention now have been apprehended by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials in cities and towns across the US. Some were picked up at traffic stops, and others were arrested despite complying with orders to check in regularly with Ice.“Some of the families in detention have been here for a long time,” said Hidalgo. And it’s unclear how long the administration will be willing to detain these parents and children, including those with pending legal proceedings that could take months to resolve, he said. “Keeping them detained seems like it’s for the purpose of punishing families, and deterring them.”At least one other family held at Karnes – asylum seekers from Venezuela including a six-year-old and an eight-year-old – had also been arrested at the Canadian border, while trying to leave, according to Raices. Others included the nationals of various countries, including Brazil, Romania, Iran, Angola, Russia, Armenia and Turkey.“I’ve been working on issues of family detention for years,” said Mukherjee, who has litigated on behalf of children and families who have faced medical neglect and abuse at various facilities. “And I can’t believe we’re doing the same thing again, almost 20 years later. Reopening of family detention centers exemplifies the cruelty that is animating the Trump administration’s immigration policies.”Back in MississippiNow that she is back in Mississippi, Jade said she feels calmer, she said.“But I haven’t told most of my friends that I’m back, and I can’t take it any more,” she said. “I just told one friend, a good friend, and he said he wouldn’t tell anyone else.”She doesn’t know how to explain to them what happened to her family, or how uncertain their lives still are. It’s not like she knows how much longer they’ll get to stay in Mississippi.It could take months or longer for lawyers to work out their immigration case. In the meantime, they remain afraid of being swept up in the administration’s immigration crackdown once again.So they’ve been lying low, at home. It’s a bit barren, because the family had either sold or packed up most of their things before heading to Canada. But they are glad to be able to wear their own, freshly laundered clothes, Gabriela said.Jason was wearing a shirt printed with stars and stripes. When Jade pointed out to her dad that it also had the words “Land of the free” (“Tierra de los libres” she translated) printed across the left side, the whole family began laughing.He’d actually bought it to wear for the Fourth of July. “Actually we have lots of shirts like this – we’re quite patriotic,” Gabriela said. They have baseball caps with flags, and red, white and blue outfits for the whole family. “We just fell in love with this country. We love the security, the people. It’s a beautiful place where we live, in Mississippi. We are actually very much in love with this place.”They never wanted to leave. “It is tough, but I have told my wife and daughter that we have to live now, because life may end tomorrow,” said Jason. “Here we have known freedom. Here we get to prolong life a little bit longer.”The Guardian is not using Jason, Gabriela and Jade’s full names in this piece to protect their privacy and safety."

It’s morally repugnant,” said IRA’s executive director, Terrence Collingsworth.‘He’d only calm down if he killed one of us’: victims of slavery on farms in BrazilRead moreBoth the lawsuit and the complaint allege that, despite rescue operations, after which farm owners are fined and may be added to a government-maintained “dirty list” of employers linked to forced labour, Starbucks and other companies continue to import coffee from these farms.A Starbucks spokesperson said: “The cornerstone of our approach to buying coffee isCoffee and Farmer Equity (Cafe) Practices, one of the coffee industry’s first set of ethical sourcing standards when it launched in 2004 and is continuously improved.“Developed in collaboration with Conservation International, Cafe Practices is a verification program that measures farms against economic, social, and environmental criteria, all designed to promote transparent, profitable, and sustainable coffee growing practices while also protecting the well-being of coffee farmers and workers, their families, and their communities.”In Brazil, subjecting workers to forced labour is a crime punishable by up to eight years in prison, but farm owners are rarely jailed.“To put an end to this, we need consumers to be aware that every cup of coffee they drink, without questioning its true origin, is financing slave labour in coffee production,” said Santos Filho. “It’s no use feeling sympathy for the workers or claiming zero tolerance for such practices if you continue drinking coffee without questioning its source.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilStarbucksAmericasFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Hundreds of thousands of people are packing up boxes, loading U-Hauls, and shipping out of statein an urgent flight towards safety.They’re being propelled by hostile political forces bearing down on them because of who they are, what they believe, or for their medical needs.All are displaced within their own country for reasons they did not choose. They are the new generation of America’s internal refugees – and their ranks are growing by the day.Here, we profile families who have joined America’s swelling class of internal refugees. They represent just five stories among many others which might have been included: librarians fleeing book bans, professors forced out by ideologically-motivated collegeeducation boards, and most recently, the thousands offederal employeesfired by the Trump administration.Such is the tide of coerced dislocation, in the land of the free.The history teacherJohn DubeMoved from New Hampshire to Vermont to escape school censorshipView image in fullscreenJohn Dube, who has been a high school history teacher for 35 years.Photograph: John Tully/The GuardianJohn Dube, 63, takes great pride in his decades-long public service. He has been a high school history teacher for the past 35 years.“I encourage an inquiry- and evidence-based approach,” he said. “It’s a mantra of mine: if you have an understanding of the past, you can understand a lot about the present.”That’s the sensibility he infused into his classroom at Timberlane regional high school in Plaistow,New Hampshire, where he taught for more than 30 years. The town is also where he brought up his two children, living what he described as a “normal, some would say boring, suburban life”.It stopped being normal around four years ago, when headwinds started to build over what rightwing groups claimed was the victimization of white kids through the teaching of “critical race theory” (CRT). You won’t find CRT mentioned in any of Dube’s courses, and yet it became a battlefield in the culture wars and in his life.New Hampshire’s anti-CRT measure, HB 2, became law in 2021. It banned the teaching of “divisive concepts” in schools, meaning that teachers would no longer be allowed to discuss race, gender identity or sexual orientation in the classroom. They were explicitly forbidden from promoting ideas suggesting that a person is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive solely based on their race or sex, whether they are aware of it or not.To aid enforcement, the state set up anonline portalwhere parents and students could snitch on teachers, who could then facepossible dismissal or being stripped of their teaching licenses. The culture wars groupMoms for Libertybacked that up with a $500 bounty for information.Dube initially treated the CRT furor lightly, assuming it would quickly flame out. He was astounded when the bill became law (the legislation wasblocked by a federal judgelast May as unconstitutionally vague, and is now under appeal).For a start, how could you avoid “divisive concepts” when teaching history, a subject that is divisive by its nature? “History isn’t a science. It’s not like the law of gravity. Why did the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor? You can answer that in many different ways. It’s all in the debate.”He was also profoundly disturbed by the political intentions behind the law; being a history teacher, he saw the implications immediately. “It’s the old adage: control the past, control the future. It’s how totalitarian regimes take away people’s rights – by literally rewriting history.”He was angered by the edicts of Orwellian thought police in a state whose motto is “Live free or die”. In that spirit, he added his signature to anationwide petitioncalled a “pledge to teach the truth”, which vowed to oppose state-sponsored censorship.Dube added a note explaining why he had signed. It said: “I believe in encouraging my students to think critically.”The backlash was instant. Granite Grok, a local rightwing website, posted the names of all New Hampshire signatories, and within hours of that Dube received a Facebook message that read: “Whats up homo? I heard your teaching Marxist commie CRT in your classrooms. You can fuck right off you garbage human.”Dube calmly replied that he would not be intimidated.Within days, police officers turned up at his house, having been dispatched by the FBI. Dube’s name was circulating on obscure chatrooms frequented by violent militia members. He was urged to install security cameras at home, but when he asked why the police didn’t arrest the perpetrators of the threats, he was told that was impossible on free speech grounds.“I was like: are you kidding me? My life has been turned upside down in a moment because I pledged to teach the truth, and the police are preaching freedom of speech?”Over the next few months, the attrition became unbearable for Dube and his wife. They were afraid every time a car drove down their cul-de-sac. It was as if the New Hampshire they had fallen in love with years ago was vanishing.“It just destroyed it. It wasn’t about partisanship – we’ve been used to Republicans and Democrats arguing forever. It was about a climate being created where you don’t feel safe.”In the end, they cut their losses. They vacated their home of decades, abandoned family and friends, and headed for the Montpelier area ofVermont.The transition has been tough. Dube traded in his job as a respected long-time history teacher for a role as substitute. He still feels unsettled, like the internal refugee he has become.He thinks of the past – of the Von Trapp family of Sound of Music fame, who established their lodge in Stowe, Vermont, just 20 miles from his current home, having fled Austria shortly after the Nazi annexation. And he worries about the future. The New Hampshire model of educational intolerance is rapidly spreading nationwide: Donald Trump recently signed anexecutive orderthat seeks to impose the same ban on “divisive” history on the Smithsonian Institution, the world’s largest museum and education complex.“America is a flawed country. We’ve made tremendous mistakes,” Dube said. “But we’ve always tried to learn from those mistakes to become better. That’s the America that I’ve spent my life teaching about – and this is not that America.”The patient and her physicianKayla Smith and Kylie CooperLeft Idaho for Washington and Minnesota to flee a strict abortion banView image in fullscreenKayla Smith, pictured in Olympia, Washington.Photograph: Jovelle Tamayo/The GuardianKayla Smith can pinpoint the exact moment she knew she had to leave. It was early in her third pregnancy, and she was scared.Her first pregnancy had been difficult. She’d had severe pre-eclampsia – high blood pressure that can be life-threatening – and her daughter Addison had been born at 33 weeks. Her second pregnancy had ended tragically when she lost her son at 21 weeks due to a fatal heart defect.Now it was third time lucky, and Smith was seeking reassurance from her doctor. Would she and her baby be OK?The physician looked at her and said: “Idaho is not a safe place to be pregnant right now.” Then, as the devastating truth sank in, he added: “If you were my daughter, I’d have told you not to get pregnant in this state.”There was little to discuss after that. “That pretty much sealed the deal for us,” Smith said.The number of people internally displaced by anti-abortion laws is startling. A recent study published by theNational Bureau of Economic Researchof 13 states with strict abortion bans found that, between them, they are losing 36,000 residents everythree months. Separate research released this month by theInstitute for Women’s Policy Researchrevealed that one in five people planning to have children within the next decade have moved state, or know someone who has done so, to escape abortion restrictions.Idaho has one of the most coldly unbending abortion bans; the state’sDefense of Life Actis an almost total prohibition.The ban deeply affected how Smith’s second pregnancy unfolded. Two days after the state’s so-called “trigger law” became active, her baby – a boy she and her husband James had already named Brooks – was diagnosed with such a serious cardiac condition that they were told he was unlikely to survive beyond birth.Were Smith to develop complications, her doctors told her they could not protect her: they would only be able to intervene if she were in mortal danger, by which point it might be too late. (The law only makes exception for rape, incest and where a doctor can affirmatively prove they acted to prevent the pregnant woman’s death – a concept that is so vaguely worded that it encourages doctors to wait until patients become sicker to avoid being prosecuted.)So the Smiths took out a $16,000 personal loan to cover the costs of the procedure, travelled across state lines into neighboring Washington and, grieving their son, had a medically induced termination.Afterwards, they returned home, and eventually tried for another baby. They weren’t yet ready to give up on Idaho. Kayla, 33, had moved there for college, and James, one year her junior, had been to school and trained as a pharmacist in the state. By the time of their third pregnancy, James had been promoted to pharmacy manager, Kayla was caring for Addison at home, and they had built their own home. They were living the Idaho dream.But soon, the couple found themselves locked into a repetitive conversation. “We had it nightly for months,” Kayla said, “and we always came to the same decision – we probably need to leave.”Part of the motivation was discovering that they were expecting another girl, Nora. They started wondering what it would be like raising Addison and Nora in a state that would offer them no bodily autonomy. They knew too that in this third pregnancy, Smith’s life was potentially at risk given her history of pre-eclampsia.And so, in September 2023, the Smith family joined the ranks of America’s internal refugees. They relocated permanently to Washington state, where Kayla gave birth to Nora 16 months ago.They were not alone. Kylie Cooper was the physician specializing in high-risk pregnancies who gave the Smiths the devastating news about their son Brooks’ fetal abnormalities. Smith was the first patient Cooper saw after the Idaho trigger law kicked in.Under the law, doctors face up to five years in prison if they perform abortions not covered by exceptions. The onus of proof is on them – they must be able to convince a jury that termination was necessary to save the mother’s life, an exceptionally hard standard to meet given often nuanced medical decisions and the vague terminology of Idaho’s abortion ban.“I felt tremendous fear and sadness for my patients, as my ability to help them had been taken away. And I felt fear for myself, like I had a target on my back,” Cooper told the Guardian.Cooper, her husband and two young children left Idaho in April 2023 and now live in Minnesota. Six of Idaho’s initial nine maternal fetal medicine specialists have abandoned the state or retired since the abortion ban, with almostone in fourof all OB-GYNs leaving.“To have to move state to be able to practice medicine … I did not expect that in modern-day America,” Cooper said.The Smiths’ own displacement has cost them dear. In the move to Washington, where they now live in Olympia, James lost his manager’s position. “I had a reputation in Idaho, and now I’ve got to prove myself all over again.” They gave up the house they owned and are renting again, at a premium. To make up the difference, Kayla has gone back to work, which she regrets, as she spends less time with their daughters.Addison, now four, keeps asking where all the snow has gone. She used to love stepping out of their old Idaho home into the winter whiteness.Along with three other women who were also forced to leave Idaho to get abortions necessary to safeguard their lives, Smithjoined a lawsuitagainst the state brought by the Center for Reproductive Rights. The suit sought to widen the ban’s exceptions to cover fatal fetal diagnoses such as her son’s.A state courtruled last weekthat medical exceptions to the ban should be broadened to allow women like Smith who have a health condition or pregnancy complication that puts their own life at risk to obtain abortion care. However, the judge did not go so far as to include pregnant women with lethal fetal conditions who are not in danger themselves, leaving them still in a bind in which they must either carry a doomed pregnancy against their will or flee the state.Despite this partial victory, Smith can feel the mood darkening across the US. Some18 stateshave imposed total abortion bans or restrictions on terminations beyond 12 weeks of pregnancy. At the federal level, Trump has issued anexecutive orderundoing his predecessor Joe Biden’s efforts to preserve access to reproductive care.In 32 years, James Smith has never been outside the US. Nor has he ever possessed a passport. Now he is applying for one for himself, and for his two girls. “If things keep going south, I’d rather be prepared.”The mom of a trans teenAnonymousMoving her trans daughter from Texas to a west coast state for her protectionView image in fullscreen‘We are refugees, and many of us are in hiding.’Photograph: Allie Leepson and Jesse McClary/The GuardianSandra, the mother of a 15-year-old trans girl, has also started to probe the logistics of leaving the US. She spends evenings researching how to migrate to other countries, and the various health systems they would encounter.Several of the families who belong to an online community frequented by Sandra have already gone. One family went to Canada, another to Uruguay, a third to New Zealand.For Sandra, 41, though, dreams of leaving the country are not for now. She has a more pressing task: to get her daughter to safety by ushering her out ofTexasand resettling her on the west coast (it is an indication of the extent of her fears that she asked the Guardian not to specify their new state, and Sandra is a pseudonym, also at her request).Sandra has, with the help of a friend, set up a GoFundMe page to cover some of the costs of relocation. It has reached $6,000 – a fraction of the at least $20,000 she estimates will be needed to move the family and the small business they run to a safe haven.It will be worth it, she thinks, if it buys them and their teenager security and peace of mind. She expressed the urgency of this moment forfamilies like herswhen we first exchanged emails.“We are refugees and many of us are in hiding,” she wrote to me. “It’s immense and lonely.”Sandra’s “kiddo”, as she calls her child, identified as a girl from as young as four. They had been at a family gathering with cousins, and in the car on the way home the child began sobbing, imploring her parents to stop calling her a boy.In the more than 10 years since then, Marie (also not her real name) has never wavered in her gender identification. Through on-going therapy, medical visits, and parentally- and medically approved hormonal treatment, she has been categoric that she is a girl. She’s done so while insisting on her privacy, eschewing becoming a poster child of the transgender cause. She wants minimum fuss.Sandra and Marie’s father have followed Marie’s lead. In the decade since the meltdown in the car, Sandra has told nobody that her child is trans: to her friends and acquaintances, Sandra presents as a regular mom to a regular teenaged girl.But then the political climate turned against them. The more the Texas legislature has fallen under the grip of Trump’s Maga Republicans, the more trans families have become the subject of their ire.By 2021, Texas had introduced40 anti-trans bills, vastly more than any other state. Since then, the bombardment has only intensified. In 2022 the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, ordered officials to investigate trans families for child abuse. The move – a direct threat to Sandra and her family – is currently on hold pending appeal.The following year, lawmakers banned puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans kids, forcing Sandra to go out of state at great expense to find care for her daughter.In this year’s legislative session, no fewer than 125 anti-trans bills have been introduced, according to theTrans Legislation Tracker, covering almost every aspect of a trans person’s life. In March, arguably the most insidious bill so far was tabled,HB 3817. It would effectively criminalize being transgender, by creating a new state felony of “gender identity fraud”.“If that were to pass, someone could arrest my teenager and she would have a felony on her record for the rest of her life,” Sandra said.That the state is bearing down on her family is hard enough. But what has amplified the terror is how the hostility has spread out from the Texas capitol in Austin into the community. Parents in schools near their home have demanded to be notified of any trans students who might be sharing bathrooms with their children – effectively baying for the outing of kids like Marie.Sandra had hoped they might have another three or four years in Texas, long enough for Marie to complete high school. But as Trump’sattackson trans people have comethickandfast, the family is nowscrambling to get the teenager out by the end of summer.The blitz of federal actions has left Sandra angry, sad and confused. She keeps asking herself: why should the US president, who has the world to worry about, be focused on her family?“We’re just a regular American family doing the laundry, buying groceries, making sure the kid does homework. To have the president obsess on us is bizarre, and very intrusive.”It’s as though the world has steadily closed in on them, Sandra said. Asked how that felt, she replied: “I imagine it’s what it’s like being surrounded by a wildfire.”The climate evacueeAmanda McPhillipsQuit California for New York to escape the firesView image in fullscreenAmanda McPhillips plays with her children in Amagansett, New York.Photograph: Lindsay Morris/The GuardianIt was 4.30am and Amanda McPhillips had already taken her four egg-laying chickens out of the yard and into the bathtub for their protection. She had a bag with all her essentials – passports, birth certificates – packed by the door.Despite the assiduous preparations, she still wasn’t ready for the apocalyptic scene outside.“The air was deep orange. All of a sudden the evacuation zone on my phone was all around us. I was like, ‘Oh, this isn’t good. We should go.’”That was the start of McPhillips’s journey into displacement. In 2022, more than half a million people fled their homes in the US as a result of environmental disasters, according to theInternal Displacement Monitoring Center. The statistics do not reveal how many permanently relocated, but they do indicate the scale of human upheaval.Look at it one way, and McPhillips, 45, was one of the lucky ones.Her rented home in Pasadena remained standing in January’s devastating Los Angeles fires, while more than 6,000 homes in neighboring Altadena were wiped out. But the smoke damage to their house was intense, and it was within a few hundred yards of the burn area which threatened the family’s long-term health.What really did it, though, was that her six-year-old son’s elementary school burned to the ground. McPhillips was shocked by how profoundly that affected them.“I hadn’t realised how much of an anchor a school is with small kids. Our whole life revolved around it – pick-up and drop-off, play dates, extracurricular activities. Everything.”Today, McPhillips and her kids find themselves almost 3,000 miles away, sheltered in the East Hamptons hamlet of Amagansett on Long Island, New York. The contrast could not be more stark.Charred embers have been replaced by immaculate white fences, sparkling shingle houses, and topiary. A short drive away from McPhillips’s current home, Main Street offers day spas, organic restaurants and gourmet delis; the Atlantic Ocean is about 200 yards from their door.McPhillips’s friend from her years working in the New York TV industry offered her use of a vacant beach house as a temporary refuge. There is a public elementary school close by, with only 16 students per class.McPhillips is well aware of her good fortune. “I’m extremely privileged; I know that. People have been so kind. I’ve had a soft landing, and I have choices.” And yet, being an internally displaced person is not easy. Anything stable in her life is gone, shattered along with the school that held it together.“I feel so disheveled, so discombobulated. It’s like there’s no North Star for recovery – I don’t know where we’ll be in five months, let alone five years.”Unlike the other internal refugees profiled here, McPhillips has not been forced to relocate because of who she is or what she does. But the way she sees it, she shares with the others the fact that her life has been torn apart as a result of human failings, and worse.“We haven’t fled violence or political oppression, but we have been displaced by decades of failure to deal with climate change. And the climate stuff is the scariest, because you cannot reverse it. You cannot go back and fix it.”Trump’s actions since returning to the White House have supercharged her anxieties. Heblamed the LA fireson local Democratic politicians, and is presiding over a massiverollback of regulationsthat will hamper the fight against rising temperatures and put hundreds of thousands oflives at risk.When she’s at her lowest, McPhillips starts to think that it’s all futile. “It feels overwhelming, as though there’s nothing you can do. So many people are hurting, and yet there’s nothing that will change Trump’s mind.”Now she is on borrowed time. She and her boys will have to leave their Amagansett refuge in June ahead of the summer Hamptons rush.Where will she go? She could go back to LA, but the city is still reeling. She’s so sensitized to environmental disasters now that wherever they moved would have to be safe from the effects of the climate crisis. But where is such a place?“I met an extreme climate expert soon after the fires and I asked him where it would be safe to live,” she said. “He said he had identified two counties in Vermont as the safest in the US. Two months later, both counties were devastated by flooding.”The scientistKristy LewisAbandoned Florida for Rhode Island for academic freedomView image in fullscreenKristy Lewis: ‘There was a clear and imminent risk.’Photograph: Alana Perino/The GuardianMcPhillips’s craving for reliable information on where to shelter from the climate crisis faces another challenge: even the scientists who produce such intelligence are now being displaced by hostile forces.Five years ago Kristy Lewis, 47, was a climate scientist at the top of her game, running an oceanography lab under her own name at a prestigious public university inFlorida. She was researching how to mitigate the effects of sea-level rise on the most vulnerable coastal populations – a subject particularly pertinent to Florida, the state with the longest coastline in the contiguous US.Ever since she was little, Lewis had dreamed about becoming a marine biologist. She’d spent her summers snorkeling off the coast of Florida, fishing from her dad’s boat. “They just couldn’t get me out of the water,” she said.Fast forward to 2019 and she was heading the “Lewis Lab of Applied Coastal Ecology” at the University of Central Florida. She raised $8m in research funds, leading a team of six graduate research students.Then Ron DeSantis was elected Republican governor of Florida. Almost immediately, he began to shift how the state approached climate disasters: he would invest in adapting to the consequences of sea-level rise, but would not address the root causes.“The idea of ‘climate change’ has become politicised,” DeSantis said in April 2019. “My environmental policy is just to try to do things that benefit Floridians.”The rhetorical chill soon began to affect Lewis. She was disturbed when the state allowed students torecord their professors’ lectureswithout consent, and inform on them if they showed signs of political “bias”.“There was a clear and imminent risk. I was talking to students about complex topics like climate change, and it was unnerving to think that someone might record me because they thought I was doing them harm. For me, climate change isn’t a political issue – I know it is real because I have the data.”What most upset her was the effect on her scientific research. About 40% of her lab’s income came from state funding, which put it in danger as climate crisis denialism spread.As a queer person, she was also dismayed by the introduction of the“don’t say gay” bill, which banned classroom discussion on sexual orientation or gender identity. And as the chair of the College of Sciences’ diversity, equity and inclusion committee, she was disheartened by the clampdown on DEI initiatives – especially as a female scientist in a predominantly male scientific world.She would hear colleagues talk about the need to change the vocabulary they used. They should drop “climate crisis” and use “environmental change” instead.“It became exhausting to think about the politics all the time. It was a big distraction from my science, not knowing what was going to happen next. I just wanted to do my job.”She left Florida in 2023, along with five other professors in UCF’s College of Sciences who also departed that year. It was just in the nick of time. A few months after she left, DeSantis signed into lawHB 1645erasing the phrase “climate change” from state statutes.Like McPhillips, Lewis is profoundly conscious of how she was one of the fortunate ones. “I left because I felt an attack on my personal and professional self, and that was not OK with me. Not everyone has that privilege – many have no option but to stay.”She has landed well. She is rebuilding her Lewis Lab within the University of Rhode Island’s school of oceanography, a hallowed place from which in 1985 Bob Ballard discovered the wreck of the Titanic.But she, too, has paid a price. The relocation itself cost her $14,000. Her team of researchers has been splintered, and she is having to reassemble it slowly over time.The move set her back three years in her bid for a tenured academic position. That matters, as without tenure she is more exposed to the icy winds that blow.Those winds are certainly blowing now. This month, she received a letter from theTrump administrationinforming her that two federal grants she had already been awarded for research into offshore wind energy, amounting to $1.5m, had been cancelled.They no longer met “funding priorities”, she was told.Lewis fled Florida to escape the attack on her science. Now there is nowhere left to hide."

Latecomers gather near the entrance, clutching fans to ease the stifling heat.A prayer is read out in memory ofPope Francis,known affectionately as Lolo Kiko, or Grandpa Francis, whose image stands framed on the alter.It’s one of many tributes and services held across the Philippines over recent days, as one of the world’s biggest Catholic populations marksthe pope’s death.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declared a period of national mourning, lasting until the pope’s burial on Saturday. Buildings – from universities to a shopping mall – have held light displays in the papal colours of yellow and white, and in violet, which is often symbolic of penance. At a major thoroughfare in Manila, a billboard declares: “Pope Francis, thank you very much! We love you.”Quiapo, like many other churches across the country, rang out its bellsto mark his death on Easter Monday.“Pope Francis is the pope we grew up knowing,” says Mario Amor, 35, a member of Quiapo’s congregation. “For me, he is a very kind pope.”Pope Francis – a life in picturesRead moreOn the bustling boulevard outside the church, stalls are stacked with rosary beads, T-shirts emblazoned with Jesus’ image, and figurines of Catholic saints.Veronica Reponte, who has had a stall outside the church for two decades, vividly remembers when the pope visited thePhilippinesin 2015. She took her son, then aged eight, along with her to watch the procession at Manila’s Rizal park. “I didn’t have a raincoat and my umbrella couldn’t withstand the rain,” she recalls. Miserable weather didn’t stop the public from turning out. A record crowd of up to 7 million watched his procession.View image in fullscreenVeronica Reponte at her stall outside the Quiapo church in Manila.Photograph: Rebecca Ratcliffe/The GuardianThere had been a frenzy of excitement in the run-up to his arrival. Sales of anything pope-related on Reponte’s stall soared – calendars, posters and even handkerchiefs decorated with Francis’s face. “I’d wished I’d be able to see him again,” she says.In the Philippines, where 80% of the population is Catholic, popes are always revered. Francis, however, was especially well loved. Many fondly remember his 2015 visit, which came just over a year after the country had experienced the devastating Typhoon Haiyan that killed more than 6,000 people.Francis was reportedly advised to postpone his trip to Tacloban, the area worst affected, because of the risk of a tropical storm, but he was determined to go ahead. In a yellow poncho, battered by wind and rain, he stood before thousands of typhoon survivors, telling them: “I am here to be with you.” Men and women wept as he spoke.Francis was a pastor who “understood what suffering meant for Filipinos”, and who visited “at such an important period in our history”, says Jayeel Cornelio, a sociologist who specialises in the role ofCatholicismin contemporary Philippines.He also opened up the church to groups who had been otherwise excluded, including the LGBTQ+ community. “A lot of Filipinos [have described] … on social media how this was a man, in spite of representing a conservative institution, who gave hope, about how faith might be evolving,” Cornelio says.View image in fullscreenPope Francis visiting Tacloban, Philippines, on 17 January 2015Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty ImagesCatholicism, brought to the Philippines by Spanish colonisers in the 16th century, is deeply interwoven with the country’s culture and has shaped its laws. Abortion is banned, and adultery and “concubinage” carry jail sentences of at least six months. It is also the only place in the world, other than the Vatican, that does not have a divorce law – though there are efforts to change this – and public opinion has become far more sympathetic to divorce over recent years, reflecting the changing role or understanding of Catholicism in the country.The church was once so politically influential that it was at the forefront of movements to oust two presidents, including the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. Its power has waned, however. The presidency of former leader Rodrigo Duterte, who presided over a deadly “war on drugs” that activists believe killed as many as 30,000 people, was a particularly difficult time. Priests were conflicted: some risked retaliation by criticising the killings, others did not.‘I’m a Muslim and he was my inspiration’ – world pays tribute to Pope FrancisRead moreDuterte remained highly popular throughout his presidency, despite international condemnation. Francis worked “under the radar” to offer support to those who spoke out, says Cornelio.Leila de Lima, a former senator and human rights activist who was a fierce critic of Duterte, wrote in a statement this week: “During one of the darkest times in my life, I received a rosary from Pope Francis. It came quietly, without fanfare, but its meaning was profound. In that moment, I felt seen. I felt remembered.”Other rights groups also paid tribute. The Filipino LGBTQ+ group Bahaghari noted his “progressive yet controversial stance”. The group was, it says, hopeful that Francis’s papacy “becomes the spark” for a more inclusive church.View image in fullscreenCardinal Pablo Virgilio David touches a portrait of Pope Francis at the Manila Cathedral to mark his death.Photograph: Ted Aljibe/AFP/Getty ImagesNow Filipinos are bracing for the next pope, wondering whether he will continue Francis’s inclusive legacy or revert back to a more conservative approach.The next pope will be selected by the College of Cardinals, many of whom were appointed by Francis and reflect a more diverse church.Luis Antonio Tagle, 67, from the Philippines, is among those in the running. He has a similarly progressive outlook, having suggested that the Catholic church’s stance on gay and divorced couples is too harsh. He has, however, opposed abortion rights in the Philippines.If chosen, Tagle would be the first pontiff from Asia, the region with the fastest-growing Catholic population.Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, left, showing Pope Francis how to give the popular hand sign for ‘I love you’ in Manila in 2015.Photograph: Wally Santana/AP“The Italians might still want to be in power, but the signs of the times have changed,” Cornelio says.If he were appointed, the country would be overjoyed, he says. “The Philippines is all about national pride, from Miss Universe to boxing.”But back at Quiapo church, Mario Amor thinks there are forces greater than the conclave at play in the selection of the new pope.“I’m OK whoever will replace him,” he says. “The lord will appoint whoever is deserving.”Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesPope FrancisCatholicismAsia PacificChristianityReligionThe papacyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are other categories of content that need to be kept off children’s feeds altogether such as pornography and material related to self-harm, suicide and eating disorders.What happens if companies don’t follow the measures?From 25 July, sites and apps covered by the codes need to implement those changes – or use other “effective measures” – or risk being found guilty of breaching the act.If companies fail to comply with the requirement to protect children from harmful content, Ofcom can impose fines of up to £18m or 10% of global revenue. In the case of a company such as the Facebook parent, Meta, that would equate to a fine of $16.5bn (£12.4bn). For extreme breaches, Ofcom can ask a court to prevent the site or app from being available in the UK.Senior managers at tech firms will also be criminally liable for repeated breaches of their duty of care to children and could face up to two years in jail if they ignore enforcement notices fromOfcom.Do the codes tackle online misogyny and toxic male influencers?The Netflix series Adolescence hasenhanced the scrutiny of online misogynyand the reach of misogynist influencers such as Andrew Tate. Ofcom says the codes tackle online misogyny by requiring platforms to ensure their algorithms downplay content that, for instance, demeans women or promotes the idea that men are superior to women.“We expect companies to not be pushing this type of content,” says Almudena Lara, an online safety policy director at Ofcom.Ofcom’s guidance on content harmful to children, which they must be protected from encountering, includes a “hateful or aggressive misogynistic comment targeting a woman or girl” and a “post or comment attacking someone based on their gender using offensive, demeaning language to describe them”.Will the proposals work?Before the Online Safety Act, there was no all-encompassing legislation addressed toward social media platforms and search engines. So the threat of fines and a clear instruction to protect children from harmful content should have an impact. Regulation of the online space is no longer a loose amalgam of existing laws (such as legislation coveringmalicious communications) and self-regulation.What do critics of the measures say?The Children’s Commissioner for England, Rachel de Souza, has criticised the measures and accused Ofcom of prioritising tech companies’ business interests over children’s safety. De Souza, whooutlined a number of concerns about Ofcom’s approach last year, said the measures did not do enough to allay children’s fears about the online world.The Molly Rose Foundation, established by the family of Molly Russell, aBritish teenager who took her own lifeafter viewing harmful online content, believes the measures do not go far enough in various areas, including tackling damaging algorithms, stopping dangerous online challenges or making fundamental changes to how content is moderated.The NSPCC, a child protection charity, wants tougher measures on strongly encrypted messaging services such as WhatsApp – an ongoing issue for safety campaigners – although it describes the measures overall as a “major step forward”.Will the measures come under pressure from the US?The Online Safety Act has been highlighted as a potential bargaining chip in US-UK trade talks, with a report this month claiming that adraft transatlantic trade agreementcontains commitments to review enforcement of the legislation. However, the report from online newsletter Playbook said the review would not be a “do-over” of the act. The Guardianhas also reportedthat the US state department has challenged Ofcom over the act’s impact on freedom of expression.The science, innovation and technology secretary, Peter Kyle, has taken a firm stance on amending the act. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live on Thursday, he said US tech firms “must adhere to British laws” if they are to operate in the UK. He said Silicon Valley bosses such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg must “adapt to the different territories they have access to”.Kyle has also made clear that protection of children was a red line, saying last month that “none of our protections for children and vulnerable people are up for negotiation”.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyChild protectionRegulatorsOfcomInternetSocial mediaDigital mediaexplainersShareReuse this content"

Isn’t this supposed to be fun?Sam WollastonThu 24 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 08.17 EDTShareAchilly Saturday morning on the Astroturf pitches at Coram’s Fields in central London and several youth football matches are under way. I’m watching an under-11s game. The sound is the thud of boot on ball, the shrill interruption of the referee’s whistle, and a whole lot of shouting. From the players (“Mine!”, “Here!”, “Pass!”, “Ref!”, etc). From the two coaches (“Press!”, “Stay wide!”, “Push up!”, “Ref!”, etc). And from the touchline dads. There is one mum here today, but she’s less vocal.To varying degrees, the dads are part fan, part coach, part personal trainer to their progeny. There is one dad (there’s always one) who’s taking it a bit further, who’s a bit shoutier than the others. “Get rid of it!” he screams at the defence, meaning hoof it upfield, which is the opposite of the coach’s instructions to play it out from the back. “Ref! Seriously?” he shouts at the referee (who’s only about 17 himself).Most of Shouty Dad’s shouting is aimed at his own son, who, because of his position on the wing, has his father’s wisdom bellowed in his lughole throughout. “Stay wide!”; “Go on, son, skin him!”; and, intriguingly, “You’ve got a mouth – use it!” (I think he means call for the ball, rather thando a Luis Suárezand sink his teeth into an opponent.) The poor boy looks utterly miserable, as if he wants the ground to open up and swallow him. Or – better – swallow his dad.At half-time, when the coach gathers the players around for a chat, Shouty Dad joins them, to offer his own thoughts on the first half and what they could do better in the second.To be honest, it’s not the worst parental behaviour you’ll see at a youth football match. It can get a lot more serious than this. For example, it was reported that at arecent under-10s game in Kentan altercation between a couple of players led to a parental pitch invasion, punches being thrown, and one kid getting steamrolled by an out-of-control dad (presumably not his own).View image in fullscreen‘A kid will make a pass and then look at the parents for approval or disapproval.’Photograph: Posed by models; nazar_ab/Getty ImagesThis is not a new issue. Over a decade ago,Gary Lineker wrote about parents screaming abusefrom the sidelines, and how it is killing their kids’ love of the beautiful game. Speaking to me from 300 or so miles north of Coram’s Fields, Ian Coates, general manager of the Northumberland Football League, agrees that it’s problem: “A kid will make a pass and then look at the parents for approval or disapproval. When I’m coaching, I say to the kids: ‘The only person you take notice of when you’re on the pitch is me. If your mum or dad shouts anything to you, you’ve got my permission to turn round and tell them to shut up.

Who the fuck are you to talk to me?’ And I’m quite an imposing figure, 6ft 4in and built like a brick shithouse.”Figures published by the Football Association(FA), the governing body for football in England, show there were 2,561 charges issued for allegations of serious misconduct in grassroots football in 2023/24, up 13% on the previous season. But this refers to behaviour on the pitch, rather than parents’ conduct. A spokesperson for the FA told me that it can take action against clubs for the behaviour of their spectators, including parents, under FA Rule E21. The FA said that, in the 2023-24 season, 349 E21 charges were issued against clubs for the behaviour of their spectators, 60% of which related to the youth game.Parental behaviour has got worse since Covid – a lot of behaviour in public has got worseCounty football associations break down disciplinary issues further. I spoke to Jon Pike, CEO of Somerset FA, about how his association records the number of reported misconduct offences – which include parents and coaches shouting and screaming from the touchlines. The rate of misconduct incidents at Somerset FA has been rising steadily since about 2018, when the number recorded each season was in the low 200s. In 2023/2024,according to its 2024 annual report, 273 cases of misconduct were recorded.The association also noticed a spike in incidents when football restarted after the pandemic. Pike says: “No one had played for six months – it was like someone had shaken up a bottle of Coke and taken the lid off and everything just spurted out. We put it down to the fact that people had been repressed in lockdown.”But things haven’t improved since the end of the pandemic. After the opening of last season, the worst for discipline in Somerset FA’s history, Pike posted a “CEO discipline statement” on the association’s website. It said the following about youth football: “The main offenders in youth football are adults, be they coaches, managers, club assistant referees, spectators or parents. This may not come as a surprise to some of you who regularly watch youth football, but now is the time for everyone to take responsibility and protect the game that we all love. Young people in football, regardless of their role, deserve to enjoy the game free from abuse and negativity, and should expect adults to behave in a manner that sets a positive example.”Pike tells me about an exercise carried out at a young leaders’ day, where members of Somerset’s youth council (aged 16 to 24) had to write down, anonymously, on Post-it notes, what they liked and didn’t like about football. “We had this collage, all these Post-its, and the number who said that being shouted at from the side, ‘my parents going off on one’, that kind of thing, to me that’s one of the most powerful things I’ve seen. This was young people saying that what they didn’t like about the game was mouthy adults on the touchline.”View image in fullscreenIll-discipline trickles down from the higher echelons of the game.Photograph: Posed by model; FG Trade/Getty ImagesPike thinks touchline behaviour has deteriorated since the pandemic because so many other areas of life have, too. Coates agrees: “It’s got worse because society’s got worse. It’s the whole breakdown in discipline.” But he also thinks it trickles down from the higher echelons of the game. He cites the example of a match at St James’ Park in Newcastle, where the referee gave a free kick against a player, who responded with: “You’re having a fucking laugh.” The Gallowgate End immediately and inevitably broke into a tuneful rendition of: “The referee’s a wanker.”Well, that’s just part and parcel of the game, isn’t it (as inevitable as using cliches such as part and parcel)? It’s just a bit of fun, a display of passion? “OK, but there’s a 13-year-old boy in the stand with his dad,” Coates says. “They see that nothing happens to anybody. The player gets away with it, isn’t carded. And in the stands the stewards and police officers stand by letting everybody do these abusive chants without challenging them.”The trouble is, Coates says, what happens the next time the boy is playing football himself. “He goes in for a tackle, the ref gives a free kick, he shouts: ‘Ref, you’re having a fucking laugh’, and he gets sent off, as he should be under the laws of the game.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s got worse because society’s got worse. It’s the whole breakdown in discipline.’Illustration: Gus Scott/The GuardianAnd suddenly the referee is getting it from the sidelines, mainly from the child’s dad. “You get dads who go and watch football on a Saturday and can virtually say and do what they want, then on a Sunday morning they go and watch their sons and daughters play, and they think they’re in the same environment and say and do what they like.”Ant Canavan is a steward at Anfield and a referee in the lower leagues; he also runs theReferee Forum Groupon Facebook. “Parental behaviour has been an issue the whole 20 years I’ve been refereeing, but it’s certainly got worse since Covid,” he tells me. “A lot of people you talk to say people’s behaviour in the public domain has got worse, but it’s particularly noticeable in youth football.”Canavan says dads are the main culprits, but you do get the odd mum misbehaving. “You expect that kind of emotional outburst from a man – that’s what they do at football games, the man’s arena. When you get it from a woman, it’s not as expected.”Where does it come from? “There’s the old trope we go to: it’s the dad who had trials at Arsenal or whatever but never made it as a footballer, so they’re doing everything they can to make their kid stand out, be better, so they can have that professional career. They’re kind of vicariously living their failed and broken dreams through their children. But a lot of the time they just don’t know how to conduct themselves … No, they do know; they’re not bothered. You’ll see them in the terraces in the same afternoon as they’ve watched their kids in the morning and they’re doing the same thing, shouting at these millionaires and professional referees.”View image in fullscreen‘Some parents are vicariously living their failed dreams through their children.’Photograph: Posed by models; Lorado/Getty ImagesYou don’t get this kind of behaviour at cricket, rugby or, say, volleyball matches, Canavan says. “You wouldn’t have parents coming on to fight each other. It’s only football. And I think it’s because of this hooliganism culture that may stem from the 80s that got suppressed. It’s still knocking about, still there. I think football has this culture of toxic abuse, like it’s all part of the game.”Canavan has had to abandon matches due to bad behaviour. “I’ve had parents interrupt games because they weren’t happy with my decisions, and they’ve felt entitled to shout abuse from the sidelines or walk on the pitch and have a go at me. And I’m 6ft 4in, broad as you like, not easily intimidated.”Canavan continues to referee in the lower leagues, but he has stopped doing youth football and walked away from the angry dads. “Other referees will still go out for their 30, 40, 50 quid, take the abuse and at the end of it say: ‘Well, I’m getting paid for it. I’ll take it; the money is more important than my dignity or my pride.’”Not every referee is 6ft 4in and broad as you like. Back in Northumberland, Coates tells me about a 16-year-old referee who was chased out of the ground by parents and players. “He had to lock himself in the changing room, fearing for his life. We’ve had a referee threatened to be stabbed by a parent; he said if he gave another foul against his son he would stab him in the car park.”You don’t get parents fighting each other at cricket or rugby matchesThose incidents were reported to the police. But, usually, parents don’t get punished for their bad behaviour on the sidelines. Coates tells me about a recent under-16s game where, like the Kent match, “the parents all decided to start kicking the shit out of each other. The referee abandons the game, reports it to the county; the club gets charged with an [FA Rule] E3, which means failure to control players, managers or spectators. The club says yeah, we’re guilty, but how can we control the parents when they’re 70 yards away on the other side of the pitch? So the county FA or the FA fine them £150 and warn them about their behaviour – because the FA can’t take action against an individual parent.”And that’s the problem: while the kids who are playing can get lengthy bans for misdemeanors, their parents aren’t classed as participants by the FA, so they’re not covered by its rules and regulations. So whose responsibility is it to intervene? “The police could, but if you’ve stood at the side of the pitch, which I have, waiting for the police to come, you’ll be there till next Tuesday,” Coates says.To remove problematic parents from matches, a banning order would have to be issued. Coates says Northumberland has successfully managed to do this for pitches on private land, but it’s difficult to when the match is played on public land.View image in fullscreen‘Some referees think the money is more important than dignity or pride.’Photograph: Posed by models; matimix/Getty ImagesA couple of leagues have been trialling body cams, similar to the ones worn by police, for referees. The Northumberland Football League doesn’t have permission from the FA for its referees to wear them, but for the last couple of years it has been issuing them to stewards and volunteers at matches. Coates has used them and finds them very effective. “When I go to the side of the pitch and speak to a parent about their behaviour, I switch my body camera on with the remote control in my pocket. And when the parents can see that red light on, suddenly their tone is totally different.”Sometimes, if a young referee is getting abuse from a parent on the sidelines, he’ll go in undercover. “I’ll take my league coat off, and go and mingle with the crowd, stand with him. It’s easy to find out which is his son and I’ll say: ‘See that number seven there? He’s shit, isn’t he? He’s never trapped the ball, he cannot pass the ball, he needs to get his head up …’ And he’ll turn round and say: ‘Oi, man, that’s my son!’ And I say: ‘It’s not nice, is it? That’s what you’ve been doing to my referee for the past 10 minutes.’ That makes the penny drop.”Ah, the beautiful game, eh? Where children are screamed at by adults and officials are abused and scared. “You look at it,” says Canavan, “and you think: at what point did football become this?”Back to the second half at Coram’s Fields, and it hasn’t quite descended into call-the-police chaos, but Shouty Dad is still at it. He’s having a go at the centre mid now, for being out of position: “Who’s in the middle?”Oi, man, that’smyson! So I punch Shouty Dad in the face, and then kick him when he’s down … No, of course I don’t. Nor could I. But I do tell him that it’s my son, and he says sorry and tones it down. To be fair, he was right about him being out of position – I might have shouted something myself, but I am only allowed on the touchline on the condition that I keep my mouth shut. It’s a lifetime condition, issued not by the league, or the FA, or the coach … but by my son, of course.Explore more on these topicsFootballParents and parentingChildrenYoung peopleFamilySocial trendsRefereesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what awaited guards when they descended in early April on a guesthouse in the west of the country was both larger and smaller in scale than the smuggling operations they typically encounter. There were more than 5,000 smuggled animals, caged in their own enclosures. Each one, however, was about the size of a little fingernail: 18-25mm.View image in fullscreenThe samples of garden ants presented to the court.Photograph: Monicah Mwangi/ReutersThe cargo, which two Belgian teenagers had apparently intended to ship to exotic pet markets in Europe and Asia, was ants. Their enclosures were a mixture of test tubes and syringes containing cotton wool – environments that authorities say would keep the insects alive for weeks.“We did not come here to break any laws. By accident and stupidity we did,” says Lornoy David, one of the Belgian smugglers.David and Seppe Lodewijckx, both 19 years old, pleaded guilty after being charged last week with wildlife piracy, alongside two other men in a separate case who were caught smuggling 400 ants. The cases have shed new light on booming global ant trade – and what authorities say is a growing trend of trafficking “less conspicuous” creatures.These crimes represent “a shift in trafficking trends – from iconic large mammals to lesser-known yet ecologically critical species”, says a KWS statement.The unusual case has also trained a spotlight on the niche world of ant-keeping and collecting – a hobby that hasboomed over the past decade. The seized species includeMessor cephalotes, a large red harvester ant native to east Africa. Queens of the species grow to about 20-24mm long, and the ant sales websiteAnts R Usdescribes them as “many people’s dream species”, selling them for £99 per colony. The ants are prized by collectors for their unique behaviours and complex colony-building skills, “traits that make them popular in exotic pet circles, where they are kept in specialised habitats known as formicariums”, KWS says.View image in fullscreenLornoy David and Seppe Lodewijckx during the hearing.Photograph: Monicah Mwangi/ReutersOne online ant vendor, who asked not to be named, says the market is thriving, and there has been a growth in ant-keeping shows, where enthusiasts meet to compare housing and species details. “Sales volumes have grown almost every year. There are more ant vendors than before, and prices have become more competitive,” he says. “In today’s world, where most people live fast-paced, tech-driven lives, many are disconnected from themselves and their environment. Watching ants in a formicarium can be surprisingly therapeutic,” he says.David and Lodewijckx will remain in custody until the court considers a pre-sentencing report on 23 April. The ant seller says theirs is a “landmark case in the field”. “People travelling to other countries specifically to collect ants and then returning with them is virtually unheard of,” he says.View image in fullscreenA formicarium at a pet shop in Singapore.Photograph: Roslan Rahman/AFP/Getty ImagesScientists have raised concerns that the burgeoning trade in exotic ants could pose a significant biodiversity risk. “Ants are traded as pets across the globe, but if introduced outside of their native ranges they could become invasive with dire environmental and economic consequences,” researchers concludein a 2023 papertracking the ant trade across China. “The most sought-after ants have higher invasive potential,” they write.Removing ants from their ecosystems could also be damaging. Illegal exportation “not only undermines Kenya’s sovereign rights over its biodiversity but also deprives local communities and research institutions of potential ecological and economic benefits”, says KWS. Dino Martins, an entomologist and evolutionary biologist in Kenya, says harvester ants are among the most important insects on the African savannah, and any trade in them is bound to have negative consequences for the ecology of the grasslands.View image in fullscreenA Kenyan official arranges the containers of ants at the court.Photograph: Kenya Wildlife Service/AP“Harvester ants are seed collectors, and they gather [the seeds] as food for themselves, storing these in their nests. A single large harvester ant colony can collect several kilos of seeds of various grasses a year. In the process of collecting grass seeds, the ants ‘drop’ a number … dispersing them through the grasslands,” says Martins.The insects also serve as food for various other species including aardvarks, pangolins and aardwolves.Martins says he is surprised to see that smugglers feeding the global “pet” trade are training their sights onKenya, since “ants are among the most common and widespread of insects”.Who’s the smallest of them all? Meet the world’s amazing tiniest creaturesRead more“Insect trade can actually be done more sustainably, through controlled rearing of the insects. This can support livelihoods in rural communities such as the Kipepeo Project which rears butterflies in Kenya,” he says. Locally, the main threats to ants come not from the illegal trade but poisoning from pesticides, habitat destruction and invasive species, says Martins.Philip Muruthi, a vice-president for conservation at the African Wildlife Foundation in Nairobi, says ants enrich soils, enabling germination and providing food for other species.“When you see a healthy forest … you don’t think about what is making it healthy. It is the relationships all the way from the bacteria to the ants to the bigger things,” he says.Explore more on these topicsInsectsThe age of extinctionAnimalsWildlifeKenyaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is the most significant act of resistance taken by a US college in response to Trump’s crackdown on higher education.Ed Pilkington, chief reporter for Guardian US, explains toMichael Safithat capitulating to Trump’s demands would have severely undermined Harvard’s reputation, and that the administration was targeting it for being a bastion of liberal thought.As Pilkington describes, at the same time Trump is tapping into a deep seam of resentment towards higher education that has been building in the US as the cost of college attendance rockets and more people see the liberal ideas emerging from universities as irrelevant to their lives.The pair discuss the way Harvard is trying to appeal to the public by highlighting its contributions to society and whether the ultimate survival of higher education’s autonomy will be determined by the law courts or the court of public opinion.Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspodPhotograph: Nicholas Pfosi/ReutersExplore more on these topicsHarvard UniversityToday in FocusDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsHigher education"

Lissu himself could face the death penalty over the treason charge – his most serious threat yet despite multiple arrests over the years.Chadema hasaccused Tanzania’s president, Samia Suluhu Hassan, of returning to the repressive tactics of her predecessor, John Magufuli.“Some of our party officials have been arrested,” said the Chadema spokesperson Brenda Rupia, confirming to AFP that the party’s vice-chairperson, John Heche, and secretary general, John Mnyika, were among those detained by police.Lissu, 57, did not appear at a virtual hearing at Kisutu magistrates court in the country’s business capital, Dar es Salaam. Chadema said he had refused as conducting the hearing virtually “goes against the principle of transparency and the defendant’s right to a fair hearing”.Lissu has not been seen since a brief court appearance on 10 April, when he was charged with treason, which has no option of bail, and “publication of false information”. “The treason case is a path to liberation,” he said at the time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They forget that this is a country for us all,” said one supporter, Baraka Kunenga, 60.Lissu has led a forceful charge against the government, vowing that his party would not participate in polls without significant changes to the electoral system. Chadema’s refusal to sign an electoral “code of conduct” prompted its disqualification but the party has said its ban was unconstitutional.The president’s party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), won an overwhelming victory in local elections last year but Chadema says the vote was not free or fair since many of its candidates were disqualified.Chadema has demanded changes to voting, including a more independent electoral commission and clearer rules to ensure candidates are not removed from ballots. Lissu said last year that Chadema would “block the elections through confrontation” unless the system was improved. Its demands have long been ignored by the ruling party.A lawyer by training, Lissu entered parliament in 2010 and ran for president in 2020. He was shot 16 times in a 2017 attack that he says was ordered by his political opponents. Afterlosing the 2020 election to Magufuli, he fled the country. He returned in 2023 on a wave of optimism as Hassan moved to relax some of her predecessor’s restrictions on the opposition and the media. Those hopes proved short-lived.Rights groups and western governments are increasingly critical of renewed repression, including the arrests of Chadema politicians as well as abductions and murders of opposition figures.In Dar es Salaam, police erected a barricade around the court in the face of criticism from many who had gathered in protest. “I cannot believe this happening in our own country,” said one Chadema supporter, Aswile Mwaisanzu, 48.Explore more on these topicsTanzaniaAfricaAmnesty InternationalGovernancenewsShareReuse this content"

The latest mediation effort by Qatar, which has signed several economic cooperation agreements withRwandaand the DRC, came after the Arab country brokered a meeting between the Congolese president, Felix Tshisekedi, and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, in the capital last month.Both leaders called for a ceasefire after the meeting but it was not held. More than six truces and ceasefires have been agreed but failed since 2021.Delphin Ntanyoma, visiting researcher in peace and conflict studies at the University of Leeds, said while international pressure could sustain the Qatari-led process, questions remained over how it would be coordinated. He suggested it would be difficult to monitor the cessation of hostilities in “such a volatile and inaccessible large region of the Kivus” – referring to two provinces where fighting has taken place.In January, M23 started a rapid advance against the Congolese military and its allied forces in eastern DRC, capturing the region’s largest cities,GomaandBukavu.The fighting has left a trail of destruction and exacerbated the humanitarian situation in the region.Thousands of peoplehave been killed andhundreds of thousandsdisplaced.DRC, the US and other countries say Rwanda is backing M23 in order to exploit the area’s vast natural resources. Rwanda denies this.Some participants in the Qatar talks complained the meetings were quickly weighed down by technical details.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since taking power, Trump hasreduced the independenceof the SEC and other agencies, demanding their work be “controlled” by the president.The Brazil-based company’s shares elsewhere hit a record high on Tuesday whennews broke of the SEC rulingon the contentious application, which has been tussled over for several years, and is a joint listing with Amsterdam.Last week, JBS filed a report to the SEC saying it would hold a general shareholders meeting about the listing on approximately 23 May, and that the first day of trading of its shares in New York could be as early as 12 June.The life and death of a ‘laundered’ cow in the Amazon rainforestRead moreThe joint listing is expected to raise the value of the multinational, which started as a family business and grew globally with the support of Brazil’s national development bank. Almost half of its revenue now comes from the United States, where it sells household brands including Pilgrim’s, Moy Park, Seara and Primo. It also has a significant presence in Australia and strong sales in Europe and China. The companywebsiteboasts: “We feed the world with the best.”But it has alarmed conservation groups, who fear JBS will use the extra financial resources to expand its market and environmental footprint.JBS has been linked to deforestation on multipleoccasions, and the New York attorney general, Letitia James,filed a lawsuitlast year accusing the company of misleading consumers with its climate goals in an effort to increase sales. That lawsuit was dismissed in February.A bipartisan group of 15 US senators had urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject JBS’s application for a share listing. “Dozens of journalistic and NGO reports have shown that JBS is linked to more destruction of forests and other ecosystems than any other company in Brazil,” they wrotein an open letter.JBS – which is dominated by two brothers from the founding family, Joesley and Wesley Batista – had promised to clean up its supply chain in the Amazon rainforest, but ayear-long investigation published last weekby the Guardian, Unearthed and Reporter Brasil found widespread scepticism by frontline workers that the company’s new cattle tracing system will be ready by the deadline commitment of the end of this year. JBS has told the Guardian that it contested the conclusions of that investigation which it said were drawn from “a limited sample of 30 farmers”, saying it was irresponsible to disregard that JBS has “over 40,000 registered suppliers”.The company has also had to pay fines or make plea bargains in severalhigh-profilecorruption cases in Brazil and theUnited States.A recent Federal Election Commission filingrevealedJBS subsidiary Pilgrim’s made the largest single donation of $5m to Trump’s inaugural committee for his second term.Environment groups linked the listing decision to Trump’s executive order for the SEC and other formerly independent regulatory agencies established by Congress to be accountable to the White House. Thatdecreestates: “In order to improve the administration of the executive branch and to increase regulatory officials’ accountability to the American people, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch … Officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people’s elected President.”Glenn Hurowitz, the CEO of the Mighty Earth environmental watchdog group, said: “Given the company’s long rap sheet of illegal and corrupt conduct, it’s hard to see how the SEC could have confidence that JBS won’t deceive US investors. The approval of JBS’s IPO shows this is no longer the independent SEC that has upheld honest practices on American markets for nearly a century.”Others echoed the risks a listing posed to both investors and communities around the world. “By almost every metric, a company like JBS has a detrimental impact on society. Allowing it to list on the world’s largest stock exchange – unlocking vast opportunities for expansion and profit – shows the deep failures of the US financial regulatory system. This decision is a disaster for both people and the planet,” said Alexandria Reid of Global Witness, an environmental justice organization.Bibles, bullets and beef: Amazon cowboy culture at odds with Brazil’s climate goalsRead moreGreenpeace UK said JBS’s plans for global expansion threaten to tip the planet further towards climate chaos. “JBS built its meat empire on a history of corruption, broken promises and environmental destruction, including emissions that would make even fossil fuel companies raise an eyebrow,” campaigner Daniela Montalto, said. “This listing will benefit only the billionaire Batista brothers who sit at the helm of JBS, while ordinary people pick up the tab for climate chaos and environmental destruction that industrial agriculture is driving.”Asked about the criticism from the green groups, JBS said in a statement: “JBS believes the dual listing presents a compelling opportunity for stakeholders interested in the performance and sustainable growth of the company. The proposal creates value for our team members, the communities where we operate, and investors. We’ve maintained ongoing disclosures with domestic and foreign investors and partners, who have repeatedly demonstrated their confidence in the credibility and robustness of our policies.“JBS will continue to partner with farmers, NGOs, universities, customers, and other stakeholders to identify ways to reduce agricultural emissions, combat global food insecurity, and enhance the sustainability of food systems. Agriculture has an essential role to play in the climate change solution, and companies like JBS can and should help lead collective action.”The company repeated its comment on the investigation published by the Guardian last week about deforestation, saying that “while the sector-wide challenges are significant and larger than any one company can solve on its own, we believe JBS has an in-depth and robust series of integrated policies, systems, and investments that are making a material and positive impact on reducing deforestation risks”.Asked about the listing on the New York stock exchange, the SEC declined to comment, a spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsOur unequal earthMeat industryStock marketsBrazilCattleAmazon rainforestDeforestationnewsShareReuse this content"

A mother, father and teen tell of ‘anguish on a daily basis’Family incarceration has been revived after Biden – and Jade, Jason and Gabriela are speaking out about their distressing treatment in TexasMaanvi SinghThu 24 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 20.05 EDTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignWhen Jade and her family first arrived at the detention facility in Karnes county,Texas, she wasn’t really sure what to think.“I guess I was confused and scared,” said the 13-year-old. Her parents were doing their best to reassure her that everything would be OK, but she knew they were in danger of being deported.She and her parents were one of the first to be sent to Karnes – one of two detention centers theTrump administrationhas commissioned to hold immigrant families. At first, she was the only kid – as far as she could tell – in the sprawling beige structure.Immigrationofficials had confiscated her family’s belongings, including her phone and her Nintendo Switch.There were a few books and games at the detention center, and a playground – but little else to distract her from her worries. “I just didn’t know what would happen to us,” she said.The Texas-based legal non-profit Raices said it was aware of at least 100 families held at Karnes since early March, after the Trump administration restarted the practice known as “family detention” – locking up children along with their parents. Those detained include families who had recently crossed into the US, as well as those swept up in cities across the country. Among the youngest detainees was a one-year-old child.Jade and her parents, Jason and Gabriela, are among the first to speak out about the conditions inside Karnes since being released. Now, back home inMississippi, Jade said she’s still trying to make sense of what happened. “I don’t know how to explain it. It was weird,” she said. “I still feel confused and scared.”The Biden administration suspended family detention in 2021 amid growing reports of sexual harassment and violence, medical neglect and inadequate food. The Trump administration has not only reinstated the practice, but Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, has said the administration would seek to challenge a longstanding settlement that limits the amount of time children can be held in detention.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that “adults with children are housed in facilities that adequately provide for their safety, security, and medical needs”.But human rights groups and pediatricians have said that these facilities – which are operated by private prison companies – are inherently harmful. In aletterto the Trump administration, several leading healthcare and pediatric groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, emphasized that “detention itself poses a threat to child health” and “even short periods of detention can cause psychological trauma and long-term mental health risks”.View image in fullscreenThe Karnes county facility in Texas.Photograph: Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images“Children experience time differently than adults do, and even brief periods of detention can have long term devastating consequences on a child’s development,” said Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School. “It’s cruel.”‘I wanted to cry the whole time’Jade and her family had fled a surge of violence inColombiain 2022, and had managed to make a good life for themselves in Mississippi.But things changed this year as the Trump administration ramped up its immigration crackdown. Jade was afraid to go to school, worried that immigration agents could come find her there, or take her parents while she was away. Jason and Gabriela had trouble finding work – employers had become squeamish about hiring workers without a legal status.“It was a very, very tough situation – it had become impossible to continue living here,” Jason told the Guardian in Spanish.So they decided to leave. Jade packed up her most prized possessions, including her Nintendo and all her favorite clothes. “I was like, I’m excited,” she said. “I’m going toCanada. I’m going to make new friends.”But they never made it to Canada.At first, they encountered Canadian border agents and tried to explain they were seeking asylum. But those agents told them they’d be ineligible, and turned them over to US border officials. “That’s when everything got out of hand,” Jason said.Agents handcuffed him and Gabriela, and drove them to Plattsburgh, New York and then Buffalo. “I wanted to cry the whole time,” Gabriela said.“Our daughter had never seen us like that – handcuffed like prisoners,” Jason added.In Buffalo, they were released from the cuffs, and sent via commercial flight to Texas. “The whole time we are trying to reassure our daughter, ‘Amor, nothing is wrong, it’s OK,’” Gabriela said. “But we didn’t have anything to distract her with, because she didn’t even have her Nintendo, her cellphone, she didn’t have her tablet, she couldn’t listen to music.”By the time they entered the detention center – a sprawling concrete facility set against the dusty landscape of Karnes county, Texas – they were exhausted. “We were in a state of shock,” Gabriela told the Guardian. “Maximum shock – because we didn’t know what would happen to us.”Jade was too young to remember the violence her family had left behind in Colombia, but Jason and Gabriela’s minds constantly flashed back to the threats and extortion they had faced. “It was anguish on a daily basis,” she said.During their first few days in detention, they didn’t know who to call for help. “How else do we fight for ourselves? We have nothing here,” Jason said. “Each day like this was torture.”Officials had confiscated all their things, and the family was given second-hand clothes and towels to use. They were able to buy minutes to make phone calls, but it was expensive.Gabriela and Jason struggled to find the words to help their daughter. “Imagine seeing your child sad because they can’t go to school. And you can’t even say, ‘Let’s go to the corner. Let’s go get ice cream. Or some chips,’” Gabriela said. “How do you explain any of this to a child? Your mom can’t do anything for you, your dad can’t do anything.”“She’s entering adolescence and everything that happens to her now will mark her. Everything that has happened could have broken her in some form, traumatized her,” she added. “That’s what distresses me as a mother.”Eventually a few other families arrived at the facility, including siblings aged three, six and eight. The youngest ones didn’t understand what was happening, so they weren’t as scared as she was – but they were just as tired, Jade said.She liked when the radio played at the detention center, especially when the Weeknd came on. “That’s my favorite singer,” she said. “I just tried to sit on the grass and listen, and look at the sky.”Relief finally came when they were able to connect with lawyers from Raices, who have been working with several families held at the detention center. Jade, Jason and Gabriela were finally released on 25 March – after about three weeks in detention – and their lawyers are now helping them seek legal status to remain in the US.All the families that were at Karnes have since been transferred to a bigger detention facility inDilley, Texas– which is more remote.“The bottom line is that these individuals have final deportation orders from federal judges,” said McLaughlin of the DHS. “This administration is not going to ignore the rule of law.”View image in fullscreenAsylum seekers hold hands as they leave a cafeteria at the jail in Dilley.Photograph: Eric Gay/APRaices said that assertion is “objectively untrue”.Immigration judgesare not the same as federal judges. And as a result of Donald Trump’s asylum ban at the southern border, “many families have not even appeared in front of immigration judges”, said Faisal Al-Juburi of Raices.At the same time, the administration ended several legal service and education initiatives for immigrants – narrowing opportunities for families inside the center to connect with lawyers, Al-Juburi said.The immigrant rights organization also contests the DHS’s assertion that Dilley has been adequately retrofitted for children.The facility, which is run by the private prison company CoreCivic, is not a licensed childcare facility and thus a violation of the protections afforded children under the Flores Settlement Agreement, a decades-old consent decree that requires the government to hold children in the least restrictive setting and release them as quickly as possible.How family detentions began, ended, and began againThe Trump administration isn’t the first to detain families.For decades, Democratic and Republican administrations have held immigrant families in specialized facilities – and the practice has elicited widespread criticism from pediatricians and mental health experts, and lawsuits from human rights groups.The family detention system took its lasting shape in 2001, and particularly post-9/11. The Bush administration had wanted to ramp up immigrant detention, and promoted family detention as an alternative to separating families and sending children to shelters while their parents were detained.Reports of human rights abuses in these facilities quickly followed. Families with children were held in prison-like conditions, with limited privacy and access to the outdoors. There was inadequate food and medical care, and reports of sexual abuse by guards.But family detention didn’t stop. Even as advocates sued the government and campaigned to close some family facilities, the government built others.In 2014, as families and unaccompanied children began increasingly arriving at the US southern border, the Obama administration contracted with private prison companies to open the Karnes and Dilley facilities, and the US family detention program grew to its largest since the internment of Japanese Americans in the 1940s.Legal challenges to the practice continued. In 2015 a judge ordered the release of children with their mothers, but then the first Trump administration pushed, unsuccessfully, toindefinitely detainfamilies.In 2018, a 21-month old toddler who became sick while being held at the Dilley detention centerdiedof her symptoms shortly after being released.Though the Biden administration stopped detaining families in 2021 – opting instead to track immigrant families via electronic monitoring and regular check-in appointments – it left in place most of the infrastructure to restart the practice.And earlier this year, the Trump administration did just that.Karnes, which the Biden administration used to hold adults, was recommissioned to hold families. Dilley, which had closed in 2024, reopened last month.Karnes, operated by the private contractor Geo Group, is more like a traditional adult prison, retrofitted with play sets, said Javier Hidalgo, the legal director at Raices. Cinderblock walls are painted withmurals of zoo animals. Families are allowed to be together during the day, but at night, mothers and children sleep together while fathers sleep in separate dorms.The South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, meanwhile, is more akin to an “internment camp”, said Hidalgo. Before it was a detention center, it was a migrant labor camp. But in the end, both centers are, “essentially, jails”, he said.View image in fullscreenA child rides a bike at the Dilley facility.Photograph: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty ImagesIn past years, the centers were commonly used to hold families newly arriving at the southern border. Officials kept families detained while evaluating their eligibility for asylum, and released them into the US if they passed an initial screening.But the Trump administration has suspended asylum requests at the border, and unauthorized crossings have dropped precipitously. Many of the families in detention now have been apprehended by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials in cities and towns across the US. Some were picked up at traffic stops, and others were arrested despite complying with orders to check in regularly with Ice.“Some of the families in detention have been here for a long time,” said Hidalgo. And it’s unclear how long the administration will be willing to detain these parents and children, including those with pending legal proceedings that could take months to resolve, he said. “Keeping them detained seems like it’s for the purpose of punishing families, and deterring them.”At least one other family held at Karnes – asylum seekers from Venezuela including a six-year-old and an eight-year-old – had also been arrested at the Canadian border, while trying to leave, according to Raices. Others included the nationals of various countries, including Brazil, Romania, Iran, Angola, Russia, Armenia and Turkey.“I’ve been working on issues of family detention for years,” said Mukherjee, who has litigated on behalf of children and families who have faced medical neglect and abuse at various facilities. “And I can’t believe we’re doing the same thing again, almost 20 years later. Reopening of family detention centers exemplifies the cruelty that is animating the Trump administration’s immigration policies.”Back in MississippiNow that she is back in Mississippi, Jade said she feels calmer, she said.“But I haven’t told most of my friends that I’m back, and I can’t take it any more,” she said. “I just told one friend, a good friend, and he said he wouldn’t tell anyone else.”She doesn’t know how to explain to them what happened to her family, or how uncertain their lives still are. It’s not like she knows how much longer they’ll get to stay in Mississippi.It could take months or longer for lawyers to work out their immigration case. In the meantime, they remain afraid of being swept up in the administration’s immigration crackdown once again.So they’ve been lying low, at home. It’s a bit barren, because the family had either sold or packed up most of their things before heading to Canada. But they are glad to be able to wear their own, freshly laundered clothes, Gabriela said.Jason was wearing a shirt printed with stars and stripes. When Jade pointed out to her dad that it also had the words “Land of the free” (“Tierra de los libres” she translated) printed across the left side, the whole family began laughing.He’d actually bought it to wear for the Fourth of July. “Actually we have lots of shirts like this – we’re quite patriotic,” Gabriela said. They have baseball caps with flags, and red, white and blue outfits for the whole family. “We just fell in love with this country. We love the security, the people. It’s a beautiful place where we live, in Mississippi. We are actually very much in love with this place.”They never wanted to leave. “It is tough, but I have told my wife and daughter that we have to live now, because life may end tomorrow,” said Jason. “Here we have known freedom. Here we get to prolong life a little bit longer.”The Guardian is not using Jason, Gabriela and Jade’s full names in this piece to protect their privacy and safety."

It’s morally repugnant,” said IRA’s executive director, Terrence Collingsworth.‘He’d only calm down if he killed one of us’: victims of slavery on farms in BrazilRead moreBoth the lawsuit and the complaint allege that, despite rescue operations, after which farm owners are fined and may be added to a government-maintained “dirty list” of employers linked to forced labour, Starbucks and other companies continue to import coffee from these farms.A Starbucks spokesperson said: “The cornerstone of our approach to buying coffee isCoffee and Farmer Equity (Cafe) Practices, one of the coffee industry’s first set of ethical sourcing standards when it launched in 2004 and is continuously improved.“Developed in collaboration with Conservation International, Cafe Practices is a verification program that measures farms against economic, social, and environmental criteria, all designed to promote transparent, profitable, and sustainable coffee growing practices while also protecting the well-being of coffee farmers and workers, their families, and their communities.”In Brazil, subjecting workers to forced labour is a crime punishable by up to eight years in prison, but farm owners are rarely jailed.“To put an end to this, we need consumers to be aware that every cup of coffee they drink, without questioning its true origin, is financing slave labour in coffee production,” said Santos Filho. “It’s no use feeling sympathy for the workers or claiming zero tolerance for such practices if you continue drinking coffee without questioning its source.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilStarbucksAmericasFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, last year the state reported its tourism spending had hit an all-time high – though California has seen a drop in some areas.Canadian tourism in California was down 12% in February compared with the same month last year amid Trump’s tariff war. In response, the state has announced anew campaignto draw Canadians back, whileone cityhas put up pro-Canada signs across its downtown.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaGavin NewsomJapanAsia PacificWest CoastTrump administrationTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

But no deal has yet been signed.The IMFdowngraded its forecaststhis week for global economic growth and warned of further downside risks if the trade war escalated. “Simply put, the world economy is facing a new and major test,” Georgieva said.She added that the situation was particularly challenging because many countries had little room for policy manoeuvre after already enduring a series of economic shocks in recent years.Asked what the mood of the delegations from the fund’s member countries in Washington had been this week, Georgieva said: “The membership is anxious.”“We were just about to step on the road to more stability after multiple shocks. We were projecting 3.3% growth, and actually we were worried that this was not strong enough – and here we are,” she said. The IMF is now forecasting global growth of 2.8% for this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She suggested Beijing should boost demand at home, to rebalance its economy away from its dependence on exports, and “pull back from too much intervention in the economy”.IMF chief urges US to strike trade deals swiftly to limit damage to global economyRead moreWith many multilateral institutions under attack from theTrump administration, Georgieva welcomed a speech by Bessent on Wednesday in which he said the Bretton Woods institutions – the IMF and the World Bank – had “enduring value”.“I very much appreciate Secretary Bessent’s reiteration of the US commitment to the Fund and to its role,” she said.However, Bessent also fiercely criticised the institutions for what he called “mission creep” and their “sprawling and unfocused agendas”, including issues such as gender and the climate crisis.Georgieva, responding to a question about these claims, declined to say whether the IMF would continue to work on climate or gender.But she replied: “I want to say that I actually agree with the secretary on one thing. It’s a very complicated world, a world of massive challenges of all kinds.” Stressing that the Fund was a “very fiscally disciplined institution”, she added: “Yes, we have to focus.”Discussions on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank meetings have been dominated by the knock-on effects of Trump’s trade policy, with ministers closely monitoring the stream of pronouncements from the White House.Most countries are facing 10% tariffs on all exports to the US, and 25% for some key products such as cars. It remains unclear whether the much higher “reciprocal” rates announced by Trump in the White House Rose Garden will be reimposed when his 90-day “pause” is over.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeGlobal economyTrump tariffsTrump administrationInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)Kristalina GeorgievaEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Iran is the second highest incarcerator, with 43, down from 49 a year earlier, although those released had been freed with conditions that forced them into silence.Israel is in fifth place, with 21 writers behind bars, including eight in administrative detention – statistics at odds with the country’s self-proclaimed status as a democracy that tolerates dissent. Other prominent incarcerators are Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey, a Nato ally and ostensibly still a democracy under the leadership of its strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.Majority of attempts to ban books in US come from organised groups, not parentsRead moreThe index has been published for the past six years and has hitherto generally highlighted the dangers faced by writers living under repressive regimes, although Israel also appeared in the previous year’s report.While making no explicit mention of threats to free speech under the US president following a spate of arrests of foreign students who have campaigned for Palestinian rights and accusations of trying to curtail academic freedom, its text clearly hints at the potential for a future clampdown.“As geopolitics continue to shift and authoritarian tendencies spread to countries that were once considered safely anchored in openness, we are seeing that free expression, and therefore writers, are increasingly in the crosshairs of repression in a much wider range of countries,” says the index.“[Governments] recognize the power of words to affirm historical truths, give voice to those whose narratives have been excised from the historical ledger, develop or maintain culture, and hold institutions to account … Democracies have been slow to understand that attacks on writers are both the precursor to and a consequence of broader attacks on human rights, democracy, and free expression.”In an interview, Karin Deutsch Karlekar,PENAmerica’s director of writers, said the comments reflected a fear for writers on the domestic front, saying that the US had not witnessed such a “broad and deep attack on ideas” since the McCarthyite anticommunist witch-hunts of the 1950s.She cited the case ofRümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University in the US on a Fulbright scholarship, who was detained and earmarked for deportation after co-authoring an opinion article criticizing Israel’s military offensive in Gaza.“People are being detained for their ideas and their writing in the US. This is definitely worrying,” she said.“I would say it’s only probably a matter of time when writers that we would include in our database and index in the US being detained as well. I fully expect that next year, we may well have cases in the United States in our index.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If the US is really stepping back in terms of its role of defending free expression and being a standard bearer for this issue, that’s big blow in terms of global trends and getting writers out of jail in other countries.”Explore more on these topicsPENCensorshipChinaIranIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Three servicemen have been indicted over alleged sexual crimes on the island since last June.US air force member charged with kidnapping and rape of teen in OkinawaRead moreOther high-profile crimes, notably the 1995 abduction and rape of a 12-year-old girl by three US servicemen, inflamed anti-base sentiment on the island and prompted Washington and Tokyo to attempt to reduce the US military footprint.In 2012, the two countries agreed to move 9,000 marines from Okinawa to the US Pacific territory of Guam and other locations, and torelocate a sprawling basein the middle of a heavily populated area to a remote coastal site. However, only about 100 marines have left Okinawa, and the base relocation has been delayed bylegal and political challenges.The US and Japanese governments say US troops in Okinawa act as a deterrent amid growing concern over Chinese military activity in the South and East China Seas, and North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.Last week, US military officials and Japanese police conducted a joint patrol of a popular entertainment district near a US airbase in Okinawa. It was the first time the two countries had conducted patrols together since 1974, two years after the islands that make up Okinawa prefecture reverted to Japanese control.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryJapanAsia PacificUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Chen has deep ties with the Vatican and metPope Francissix times, but the decision means Taiwan’s delegation will be without a serving government official, despite the Vatican being one of Taiwan’s few diplomatic allies.Just 12 governments, including the Vatican, recogniseTaiwanas a country, and China lobbies to keep it excluded from most multilateral bodies. As a result there are few opportunities for Taiwan’s president to mix with other foreign leaders.Taiwan’s deputy foreign minister, Wu Chih-chung, had earlier said the government was in talks with the Vatican over Lai’s attendance.“This is the foreign ministry’s most important aim,” Wu said on Wednesday. Wu said the Vatican had “considerations” about whom Taiwan would send, as well as its own “international relations”, but did not go into specifics.“The church has its own diplomacy, I am not allowed to give answers on their behalf,” he said. Wu was speaking outside Taipei’s Catholic Archdiocese, where he was accompanying Lai on a visit to pay respects to Francis. Lai did not speak to the press.Later on Wednesday, Wu told reporters that Chen was “the best choice under the current circumstances”.Past leaders of Taiwan have attended formal events at the Vatican. The former president Ma Ying-jeou attended Francis’s first mass as pope in 2013. His predecessor, Chen Shui-bian, represented Taiwan at the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, and was seated according to Taiwan’s formal sovereign name, Republic of China.Taiwan’s ambassador to the Vatican at the time said Chen’s attendance marked the first visit to Europe by a sitting Taiwanese president.China’s government claims Taiwan as a province and does not allow other countries to have formal diplomatic relations with both governments. The vast majority of countries have chosen relations with China, with some having switched back and forth amid lobbying and incentives offered by both Taipei and Beijing. The remaining 12 allies of Taiwan are mostly small island nations in the Pacific and Caribbean. The Vatican is significant as Taiwan’s only ally in Europe, and “the value of being officially recognised by the Vatican is amplified by the significant influence it has globally as the head of the Catholic church”, said Zsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, assistant professor at Taiwan’s National Dong Hwa University, who is an expert on China-Europe relations.“Taiwan’s fear is that a Vatican-China rapprochement could lead to/pave the way to the end of Vatican-Taiwan diplomatic ties, which has put Taiwan’s leadership in a tight spot,” she said.“Taipei has had good reason to worry about the Vatican’s interactions with China in recent years, which, ironically, have unfolded amid increasing restrictions by the Chinese authorities on religious freedom in the country.”China’s relations with the Vatican appeared to improve under Francis, whooversaw controversial agreements with Beijingabout the appointments of Catholic bishops in China. The Chinese government insists that such appointments are a matter of sovereignty andmust be government-approved.Beijing did not issue public condolences to the Vatican until a foreign ministry press briefing on Tuesday.“In recent years China and the Vatican have maintained constructive engagement, conducted useful exchanges, and had extensive communication on international issues,” the ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters.Guo was asked about Pope Francis’s repeated wishes that he could visit China and meet leaders, and whether breaking ties with Taiwan was a prerequisite for this to ever happen with a future pontiff. He responded that Taiwan was “an inalienable part of China’s territory”.He would not confirm whether China planned to send anyone to the funeral.Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsTaiwanPope FrancisCatholicismAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The video includes images of Dunstan in fatigues undergoing physical training.Hastie, a former troop commander in the SAS, wassacked from the army reserve in 2016after he continued to include images of himself in uniform on campaign material. The military takes a stricter approach to candidates who are active members of the reserve.At the time, Hastie said the ADF had “used a bit of policy to try and push me around, basically”.“I had to decide whose authority I answered to. It was the people of Canning. As a federal parliamentarian, I don’t take orders from the military.”Almost a decade later, Hastie has launched paid ads on social media with images of himself on tour in uniform, holding rifles in helicopters and smiling in front of transport vehicles.“In the army, in the SAS, I learned about courage, about mateship, about leadership,” Hastie said over the images. “I joined up to fight for my country. Now I’m fighting for my family, for my community, and for you.”View image in fullscreenA screenshot of an ad for Andrew Hastie on social media.Photograph: MetaThe Liberal candidate for Leichhardt, Jeremy Neal, was pictured in military fatigues with a rifle on campaign pamphlets introducing him to the community.

No response was received before deadline.A Liberal party spokesperson said it was proud to have Dunstan, who is no longer a member of the SAS, as its candidate in Corangamite. Dunstan’s campaign corflutes in Corangamite describe him as a “Tradie. Soldier. Dad”.“As an SAS soldier for over a decade, Darcy defended our country with dignity and honour, and will be rightfully acknowledged alongside all of Australia’s current and former servicemen and women on Anzac Day,” the Liberal spokesperson said.If a candidate is no longer a member of theAustralian militaryor reserves – and is not using official defence material that is covered by copyright – there is little more the department can do than politely ask them to stop. There is no suggestion the three candidates have breached any rules.“Defence acknowledges the contribution of former ADF personnel,” the spokesperson said.While Guardian Australia did not find any examples of Labor candidates using military uniforms in their 2025 campaign material, there have been high-profile historical examples of this.In 2016, then Labor candidate for Eden-Monaro, Mike Kelly, resigned from the army reserves after he received an instruction to stop using photos of himself in uniform in campaign material.Kellytold Guardian Australiait was “a really sad day, it ended nearly 30 years of attachment to the Australian army, an institution that I love dearly”.The Labor member for Solomon, Luke Gosling, was told to stop using images of himself in uniform on campaign corflutes in 2022. Gosling also used images of himself in uniform during the 2016 and 2019 election campaigns.In 2022, Gosling defended his use of the military images and told the NT News that “being a veteran is a huge part of my identity and I fight on those issues for our defence community here in the territory every day”.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian militaryAustralian politicsCoalitionLiberal partyLabor partynewsShareReuse this content"

Garnett says it is the scabbard of a sword or dagger. Monk insists it is a male member.“I am in no doubt that the appendage is a depiction of male genitalia – the missed penis, shall we say. The detail is surprisingly anatomically fulsome,” Monk said.The Bayeux Museum in Normandy, home to the 70 metre-long embroidery, says: “The story it tells is an epic poem and a moralistic work.”View image in fullscreenThe two historians disagree on what the black shape emerging from this figure’s tunic represents.Photograph: Bayeux MuseumThe historians, whose academic skirmish takes place in theHistoryExtra Podcast, both insist that – beyond the smutty jokes and sexual innuendo – their work is far from silly. Garnett said it was about “understanding medieval minds”.“The whole point of studying history is to understand how people thought in the past,” he said. “And medieval people were not crude, unsophisticated, dim-witted individuals. Quite the opposite,.”He believes the unknown designer of the epic embroidery was highly educated and used “literary allusions to subvert the standard story of the Norman conquest”.He said: “What I’ve shown is that this is a serious, learned attempt to comment on the conquest – albeit in code.”In theBayeux tapestry, size did matter, Garnett said. He pointed out that the battle’s two leaders – Harold Godwinson, who died at Hastings with an arrow in his eye, and the victorious Duke William of Normandy, AKA William the Conqueror – are shown on steeds with noticeably larger endowments. “William’s horse is by far the biggest,” Garnett said. “And that’s not a coincidence.”Monk insisted the running man’s dangly bits are the tapestry’s “missing penis”.Dr David Musgrove, the host of the podcast and a Bayeux tapestry expert, said the new theory was fascinating.“It’s a reminder that this embroidery is a multi-layered artefact that rewards careful study and remains a wondrous enigma almost a millennium after it was stitched,” he said.Explore more on these topicsBayeux tapestryFranceEnglandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He repeatedly claimed during his election campaign that he would end the war within 24 hours of taking office.The US president insisted that he was applying pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the war, claiming that an agreement by Moscow not to take over the entire country would be a “pretty big concession”.“We’re putting a lot of pressure onRussia, and Russia knows that,” he said.Trump accuses Zelenskyy of jeopardising imminent peace dealRead moreRussian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov told CBS news the Kremlin was ready to “reach a deal” with the US onUkraine, but there are some “elements of this deal which need to be fine tuned”.The attack onKyivwas the biggest and most deadly this year. Two children were among the dead and at least 90 people were injured. Russia also carried out strikes against Kharkiv and other cities.Waves of drones as well as ballistic and guided missiles struck the Ukrainian capital early on Thursday. There were explosions for much of the night, beginning at about 1am local time, and the rattle of anti-aircraft fire as Ukrainian defences tried to shoot the missiles down.Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said rescuers searching for survivors had found one man alive and recovered three bodies. Zelenskyy said two of the victims were a brother and a sister, 21-year-old Nikita and 19-year-old Sofia. “To our great regret, there is destruction and loss in our capital,” he said.The injured included six children and a pregnant woman, with more than 40 peopletaken to hospital.A house, other buildings and cars were set on fire and extensive damage was caused by falling debris in several districts.Dozens of people killed in Russian air and missile attacks“Russia has launched a massive combined strike on Kyiv,” Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Telegram.Zelenskyy said early on Friday that Russian forces had tried to use mass air strikes as cover for intensified land-based attacks.“When our forces were concentrating to the maximum on defending against missiles and drones, the Russians went ahead with intensified ground attacks. But they were repelled in worthy fashion,” he said on the Telegram messaging appZelenskyy said Russia fired a North Korean ballistic missile at an apartment block in Kyiv’s Sviatoshynskyi district. Video showed the missile, which Reuters said was a North Korean KN-23, plunging into the building, followed by a huge orange explosion and a boom.Ukraine’s interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, said a big rescue operation was under way at the scene of the strike, involving dogs and engineering teams. “Mobile phones can be heard ringing under the ruins. The search will continue until everybody is got out. We have information about two children who cannot be found at the scene of the incident,” he said.Earlier on Wednesday evening, drones could be seen buzzing in the sky above the north-east Kharkiv region and flying over a forest. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, was hit by seven missiles and 12 kamikaze drones in strikes throughout the night as black smoke plumed overhead.According to Kharkiv’s mayor, several private houses, a factory and a high-rise apartment block were hit. “One of the most recent strikes hit a densely populated residential area. Two people were injured there,” Ihor Terekhov said, urging people to be careful.View image in fullscreenRescuers and civilians worked to pull victims from the rubble of a residential building in Kyiv on Thursday.Photograph: Libkos/Getty ImagesOn Thursday Trumppostedon Truth Social: “I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5,000 soldiers a week are dying. Let’s get the Peace Deal DONE!”The day before, he hadlashed out at Zelenskyyfor failing to support a US “peace plan” in which Crimea and other Ukrainian territories would be handed to Russia.Trump accused Ukraine’s president of prolonging the “killing field” and making “very harmful” statements. Zelenskyy has ruled out recognising Crimea as Russian and says a complete ceasefire is needed before any settlement can be discussed.Zelenskyy said he was cutting short a trip to South Africa because of the attack. “It has been 44 days since Ukraine agreed to a full ceasefire and a halt to strikes … And it has been 44 days of Russia continuing to kill our people,” Zelensky said in a post on X. “The strikes must be stopped immediately and unconditionally.”According to Bloomberg, Washington will push back on Russia’s demand that Ukraine is “demilitarised” as a part of a peace deal. The news agency said the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, would insist during his next meeting with Putin that Kyiv has its own army and defence industry.View image in fullscreenRescuers at the site of a building hit by a Russian ballistic missile strike in Kyiv on Thursday.Photograph: Valentyn Ogirenko/ReutersThe Ukrainian foreign minister, Andriy Sybiga, said Russia’s “maximalist demands for Ukraine to withdraw from its regions, combined with these brutal strikes, show that Russia, not Ukraine, is the obstacle to peace”.He added: “Moscow, not Kyiv, is where pressure should be applied. Putin demonstrates through his actions, not words, that he does not respect any peace efforts and only wants to continue the war. Weakness and concessions will not stop his terror and aggression. Only strength and pressure will.”Posting on social media as Russian bombs fell around them, Ukrainians criticised Trump’s one-sided approach and his apparent indifference to Ukrainian civilian casualties. The massive attack suggested the Kremlin was not remotely interested in peace, they suggested.Olga Rudenko, the editor of the Kyiv Independent newspaper, wrote on social media: “Can’t begin to explain how surreal it is to be sitting on the floor in the safest place of my apartment hearing an extremely loud Russian missile+drone attack – after having spent entire day discussing and editing coverage of the US effectively demanding Ukraine’s surrender.”Euan MacDonald, a freelance journalist, said: “Great big bang in Kyiv, and another – incoming missiles. Shaheds also in city, just heard anti-aircraft guns. And two more big bangs just as I write … Not been this noisy for a while.”1:22Zelenskyy calls for more pressure on Russia after massive Kyiv attack – videoThere were further attacks in the cities of Pavlohrad and Zhytomyr, as well as in the Zaporizhzhia region.In Kyiv, some residents spent a sleepless night in the subway, which doubles as a missile shelter. According to the photographerKostyantyn Liberov, Shahed drones struck the same district twice as rescuers and civilians were trying to free a young woman who was trapped in a collapsed building.“Honey, we’ll get you out no matter what. We’re right here,” one of the rescuers reassured her as a Shahed drone buzzed overhead, Liberov reported.Anton Shtuka, a videographer whofilmed the difficult rescue operation, said: “Sometimes it looks like these strikes hit our homes because Putin feels US support and begins to pressure Ukraine even more.” He added, ironically: “Thank you, partners.”Kyiv was last hit by missiles in early April, when at least three people were hurt. It has been the target of sporadic attacks since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelenskyy’s office, said: “Putin shows only a desire to kill. The attacks on civilians must stop.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineKyivRussiaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Recent videos online show the Base burning military vehicles with Ukrainian license plates, electrical boxes, and other activities inside the country.The writers said the new Base cell in Ukraine was “bigger than any other fedop” carried out by Nazzaro.“[Thus] not only are they trying to disrupt the system but also dislocate the Ukrainian forces which AGAIN furthers the interests of Russia,” they said.Other evidence provided to the Guardian shows that whoever is running the account for the Base’s Ukraine cell on Telegram, has paid for a bot army to up its follower numbers into the tens of thousands.“How does The Base have money for so [many] bots and rewards for actions?” wrote a user affiliated with the website on Telegram. “I wonder who funds them.”Nazzaro has increasingly leaned onRussian digital infrastructureto operate his global organization. Posts calling for attacks on Ukraine first appeared on the Base’s VK account, which is hosted in Russia and run by Nazzaro. The recruitment email for the Base is also a Mail.ru address – the email provider of a well-knownally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.Nazzaro, however, has repeatedly maintained that he is not affiliated with any spy agencies, even making an uncanny appearance on Kremlin state television in 2020, telling a reporter that he “never had any contact with any Russian security services”, something the ex-members also reference.“That these accusations are also coming from alleged former members of the group is particularly interesting, given inside knowledge of the group they may have and Nazzaro’s role within the global accelerationist white power movement,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a far-right analyst who saw the website and allegations circulating.Explore more on these topicsFar right (US)RussiaUkraineUS politicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The right to keep sovereign Ukrainian territory he has taken by violence and in breach of international law. 2. The right to control Ukraine’s destiny by forbidding Nato membership. 3. The lifting of sanctions againstRussia. 4. An economic partnership with America. 5. The chance to rebuild his armed forces for the next attack in a few short years’ time.”He added: “As for Ukraine – what do they get after three years of heroic resistance against a brutal and unprovoked invasion? What is their reward for the appalling sacrifices they have made – for the sake, as they have endlessly been told, of freedom and democracy around the world?“Apart from the right to share their natural resources with the United States they get nothing. What is there in this deal that can realistically stop a third Russian invasion? Nothing. If we are to prevent more atrocities by Putin then we must have a long-term, credible and above all properly funded security guarantee for Ukraine – a guarantee issued by the UK, the US and all western allies.”Keir Starmer condemned Moscow’s overnight strikes on Kyiv, saying it was “a real reminder that Russia is the aggressor here and that is being felt by the Ukrainians, as it has been felt for three long years now. That’s why it’s important to get Russia to an unconditional ceasefire.”He added: “We’re making progress towards the ceasefire. It’s got to be a lasting ceasefire. But these attacks – these awful attacks – are a real, human reminder of who is the aggressor here and the cost to the Ukrainian people.”Trumpalso criticised the strikesin a post on his Truth Social network. He said: “I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!”Johnson has previously criticised some of Trump’s language about Zelenskyy, including during theirWhite House fallout, saying it was “ghastly to hear some of the language that’s been coming from Washington about who started the war and Zelenskyy being a dictator”.But in the aftermath of the row, Johnson defended Trump again in acolumn for the Mail, saying the war of words “was not meant to happen” and that the US president did have a viable plan for peace.Explore more on these topicsUkraineBoris JohnsonDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinRussiaForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The attack took place at around 12.30pm (11.30am BST), before teachers overpowered the boy. One female student was killed. At least one other student is in a critical condition in hospital.“This tragedy shows once again the endemic violence that exists in a part of our youth,” Bayrou said in a statement. “Fundamental questions must be asked in terms of education, values and respect for human life.”He ordered checks inside and around schools to be intensified immediately. He also said a commission would look into how to deal with teenage knife crime in terms of weapons sales, and the owning and carrying of knives. It would study best practice in other countries across the world.Praising the “bravery” of the teachers who intervened, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the whole nation shared in the school’s shock and grief.A police source told France Info that the boy had first targeted a pupil on the second floor of the school and had then attacked three others coming down the stairs. He had gone into two classrooms, the source said. France Info also reported that the boy was carrying two knives.The boy was in police custody and a psychiatric assessment was being carried out, France Télévisions reported.The education minister, Élisabeth Borne, and the interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, travelled to the school to show “solidarity with victims and the school community”.Images from the scene showed police and troops surrounding the school as the investigation began.An official at the school, which is part of a complex housing a primary and middle school, would not comment on what happened. They said the school was concentrating on caring for the students who were on campus at the time.The school administration sent a message to the families of the 2,000 or so students who attend the school, informing them of the incident. Students had been immediately confined inside the school.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Israeli authorities confirmed last week thatNsasrah was in custody, but under emergency war legislation the whereabouts of detainees from Gaza can be kept secret and they can be barred from meeting a lawyer for 45 days. Nsasrah is not allowed legal counsel until 7 May.In Israeli political news on Thursday, the supreme court grantedBenjamin Netanyahuan extension until Sunday to file an official rebuttal to an affidavit from his fired Shin Bet chief, Ronen Bar.The Israeli prime minister was expected to accuse the head of the general security service of lying, in an affidavit that was supposed to be submitted by the end of Thursday in response to claims made by the security chief in his own 31-page affidavit earlier this week.Israel’s supreme court halted Bar’s controversial firing after a cabinet vote last month, widespread protests and a petition from the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, on the grounds it may be unlawful. The battle between the two men is pushing the country to the brink of a constitutional crisis.The Shin Bet has been investigating Netanyahu’s close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including leaking classified documents to foreign media, and allegedly taking money from Qatar, which is known to have given significant financial aid to Hamas.In his affidavit, Bar accused Netanyahu of moving to sack him after his refusal to fulfil requests including spying on anti-government protesters and helping the premier postpone his testimony in his criminal trial. Bar also claimed it had been made clear to him that he was expected to be “personally loyal” to the prime minister.Netanyahu has said he lost trust in Bar’s capacity to lead the Shin Bet. He escalated his attack on Bar on Wednesday night, before his expected filing, by sharing a recording of a phone conversation between a Shin Bet agent and a police officer allegedly proving that the agency “persecutes rightwing activists”.The relationship between the two men, already strained, deteriorated further after the release of a Shin Bet investigation pointing to policy issues in the run-up to the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack.Netanyahu has never accepted any responsibility for Israel’s worst national security disaster, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, led to 251 being abducted and held hostage in theGazaStrip, and ignited the devastating war in the Palestinian territory.The head of Israel’s powerful Histadrut union, Arnon Bar-David, threatened on Thursday to call a nationwide strike if the government disobeyed a potential high court order to reinstate Bar, describing such a move as a “red line”.Two previous Histadrut strikes have put Netanyahu’s far-right coalition under significant pressure. One in March 2023 was triggered by the prime minster’s decision to fire the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, over his opposition to a proposed judicial overhaul. Strike action in September 2024 took place in favour of a hostage deal and ceasefire in the war in Gaza after Hamas murdered six captives.In Gaza on Wednesday, Israeli airstrikes across the strip killed at least 28 people, according to the territory’s health ministry, whose data the UN assesses to be accurate.Explore more on these topicsIsraelIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The area was expanded last May to cover a larger area in south-west Gaza, including Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and al-Mawasi.Up to January, the humanitarian zone had been marked on maps that were posted online and dropped from the air by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). More than 1 million people had flocked to the areas as a result.The humanitarian zones were not entirely safe. Official figures showed they were hit by at least 28 Israeli strikes before January andan investigation by the BBCput the number as high as 97, with 550 people killed. The IDF accused Hamas militants of using the zones as protection and as a launchpad for attacks on Israeli troops.Despair in Gaza as Israeli aid blockade creates crisis ‘unmatched in severity’Read moreMention of the humanitarian zones has disappeared from maps since Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas collapsed in March. The IDF has resumed its airstrikes and seized swathes of land as a “security buffer zone” and the UN estimates that 70% of Gaza is now under either an evacuation order or is a “no-go zone”.In meetings with aid agencies, the IDF and Cogat – the Israeli government unit coordinating policy in Gaza – have sidestepped questions about humanitarian zones, according to a senior international official who asked not to be named in order to speak freely.The source added: “[The Israeli authorities] have not indicated if they will reinstate some of the humanitarian zone designations. There’s a logic there: if they don’t reinstate the humanitarian zones, they therefore can’t guarantee security of movement within that zone for aid workers or civilians.”In a comment to the Guardian, the IDF said: “Al-Mawasi is currently not defined as a safe zone, and evacuation zones change in accordance with IDF operations aimed at thwarting terrorist activity that threatens the security of Israel.“The IDF calls for and facilitates the evacuation of civilians from areas that endanger their safety, by issuing clear and detailed advance warnings through multiple channels.”Tens of thousands of Palestinians have continued to flock to al-Mawasi, a sandy area with few buildings, many in the belief it is still a protected zone. But the area has been hit by 23 airstrikes since the ceasefire ended, according to the UN.1:03Gaza footage captures the moment an Israeli airstrike hits Beit Lahia – videoLast week, two Israeli missiles struck refugee camps in al-Mawasi, setting fire to dozens of tents, many with women and children inside. The attacks killed at least 16 people and wounded many more. “Images of children burning while sheltering in makeshift tents should shake us all to our core,” said Catherine Russell, the executive director of Unicef.Nasser, a father of four, sought sanctuary with his family at al-Mawasi after their home in Deir al-Balah was wrecked last year.“Mawasi was not really better,” said the 35-year-old accountant. “The conditions were crowded, hot and dirty, there was nowhere to wash or have any privacy. Sometimes there were airstrikes on al-Mawasi when we were displaced there and they set the tents on fire. The Israelis told us to move again even inside the camp.”The family went back home when the ceasefire was declared but Nasser said it was now clear to everyone in Gaza that nowhere was safe.“We don’t know what to do,” he added. “I spent all day looking for clean water and firewood to make a fire to boil wastewater. But Mawasi is dangerous too, it has been targeted 20 times in the last month and there were many martyrs.”The UN warned on Tuesday that Gaza was facing famine after more than 50 days of a total Israeli blockade on aid entering the territory. Also on Tuesday, Israel airstrikes killed 17 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, described Gaza as a “land of desperation”.“Hunger is spreading and deepening, deliberate and manmade,” said Lazzarini on Tuesday. He said the 2 million people of Gaza were “undergoing collective punishment” and he charged Israel with using humanitarian aid as “a bargaining chip and a weapon of war”.His comments were echoed by Jens Lærke, a spokesperson for the UN humanitarian agency Ocha, who told reporters on Tuesday: “It is true that right now is probably the worst humanitarian situation we have seen throughout the war in Gaza.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaHumanitarian responsenewsShareReuse this content"

It promptedIndiato renew its blaming of Pakistan for sustaining “cross-border terrorism”, a claim Pakistan denies.“Pakistan declares the Indian defence, naval and air advisers in Islamabad persona non grata. They are directed to leave Pakistan immediately,” a statement from the office of the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, said after he had convened a rare national security committee meeting. It also said visas issued to Indian nationals would be cancelled.“Any threat to Pakistan’s sovereignty and to the security of its people will be met with firm reciprocal measures in all domains,” the statement added, ordering the closure of borders, the cancellation of trade and the closure of airspace to Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines.“India has taken irresponsible steps and levelled allegations,” Pakistan’s foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, told the Dunya News TV channel.MapDar said “any kinetic step [military action] by India would see a tit-to-tat kinetic response” from Pakistan, rekindling memories of February 2019 when a car suicide bombing in Kashmir brought the two countries to the verge of war.The toughest language, however, was aimed at India’s decision to suspend the decades-old Indus waters treaty – the world’s most durable water-sharing agreement – which is vital for Pakistani agriculture.“Any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan as per the Indus waters treaty … will be considered as an act of war and responded [to] with full force across the complete spectrum of national power,” Islamabad said on Thursday.1:17Manhunt launched after 26 tourists killed by suspected militants in Kashmir – videoIndia suspended the treaty on Wednesday, when it also accused Pakistan of supporting “cross-border terrorism” and downgraded ties with its neighbour with a series of diplomatic measures. Pakistan has denied any role in the attack.In response, Pakistan suspended the Shimla accord, the 1972 treaty that for decades formed the foundation of peace with India that was signed by the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, and Pakistan’s Zulfikar Ali Bhutto after the 1971 war that resulted in Bangladesh’s creation.India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, vowed to pursue those responsible for Tuesday’s attack “to the ends of the Earth”.Twenty-six men were killed in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam, in the deadliest attack on civilians in the contested Muslim-majority territory since 2000.“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” Modi said in his first speech since the attack.Pakistan’s top diplomat in Delhi, Saad Ahmad Warraich, the charge d’affaires at the Pakistan embassy, was summoned by India’s ministry of external affairs on Wednesday evening, according to a diplomatic source and local media reports.India had already closed a key land border with Pakistanand barred Pakistani citizens from entering under a visa exemption scheme.Police in Kashmir published notices on Thursday naming three suspected militants alleged to have been involved in the attack, and announced rewards for information leading to their arrest. Two of the three are Pakistani nationals, according to the notices.Kashmir attack sparks fear of fresh conflict between India and PakistanRead moreModi has called for a meeting with opposition parties on Thursday to brief them on the government’s response to the attack.Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence in 1947, with both claiming the Himalayan territory in full but governing separate portions of it.The Indus waters treaty, mediated by the World Bank, splits the Indus River and its tributaries between the neighbours and regulates the sharing of water. It had until now withstood wars between the neighbours.India would hold the treaty in abeyance, the country’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, said.Diplomatic ties between the two countries had been loose even before the latest measures were announced, after Pakistan had expelled India’s envoy and said it would not post its own high commissioner to Delhi when India revoked the semi-autonomous status of Kashmir in 2019.Reuters, AP and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsKashmirIndiaPakistanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Although a federal judge this week ordered the Trump administration to restore more than 1,000 jobs and funding for VOA, its status remains unclear and a government appeal is expected.Broken and in the grip of civil war, can Myanmar rebuild after earthquake?Read moreVOA’s satellite channel ceased broadcasts into Myanmar just weeks beforea huge 7.7-magnitude earthquakehit the centre of the country. Its epicentre was about 11 miles from Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city.More than 3,000 people are thought to have been killed. The digital reach of the BBC’s existing Burmese coverage spiked significantly as people searched for information.Amid concerns about the lack of independent news being delivered to the country, the BBC has opted to intervene. In the coming months, the Thaicom 6 satellite, which covers Myanmar and the wider region, will deliver BBC News Burmese TV and audio programming. The channel will also provide a QR code linking to the BBC website’s Burmese content.Jonathan Munro, the global director and deputy chief executive of BBC News, said the corporation believed it had to act swiftly to ensure a vulnerable audience were well served with independent information.“In Myanmar, where press freedom is severely restricted and where a vicious conflict continues, we now have an audience also beset by a natural disaster,” he said.“During the week of the disastrous earthquake, BBC News Burmese total digital reach quadrupled as people came to the BBC for trusted information.“With the launch of this new satellite-based video service, featuring our TV, radio and online output in Burmese, we’ll be offering a critical information stream for an audience struggling to recover from the calamity which took so many lives.“Aimed for an audience in need, this is yet another timely and much-needed initiative born from the commitment and expertise of the BBC teams.”However, the move will be a further squeeze on the BBC’s World Service, which has come under huge financial pressure over recent years as the value of the licence fee has significantly diminished.The BBC was forced to take on its costs from the Foreign Office in 2014 as part of the coalition government’s public spending cuts.BBC bosses want to see the current government take back those costsas part of negotiations over the renewal of the BBC charter.Independent journalism is extremely challenging in Myanmar.

Rather than taking it on faith that the woody biomass burnt for energy is a sustainably sourced low-carbon alternative fuel, it is long past time a true assay was made of what taxpayers are getting for their money.”The industry was plunged into controversy last year when the FTSE 250 owners of the Drax power plant agreed to pay a£25mfine after an investigation by the energy regulator found “an absence of adequate data governance and controls” to monitor the sourcing of biomass pellets.The company was also accused by a former employee of “misleading the public, government and its regulator” over its sourcing of wood for biomass pellets, in a claim for unfair dismissal filed against Drax at an employment tribunal earlier this year.Drax denied the claims, and the litigation ended after the company and the whistleblower “reached a mutually agreeable position, without admission of liability”, it said.Clifton-Brown said the government must do more to establish full confidence in the biomass industry’s supply chains “to truly satisfy itself that biomass is not a white elephant”.He added the report had raised further questionsabout the future role of biomass plants fitted with carbon capture technology – known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or Beccs.Earlier this year, Drax said it wouldslow its investment in Beccsunless the government provided clarity over the returns it could expect from the upgrade. The comapny signalled the slowdown despite securing an extra three years of government subsidies and earning record profits of more than £1bn last year.Clifton-Brown said although Beccs has been “long-viewed as crucial for net zero” there is “no movement visible on the horizon to start to build it into the UK’s infrastructure”.A Drax spokesperson said its biomass was “certified as sustainable” through the Sustainable Biomass Programme (SBP), a certification scheme that has been criticised by some for not being “robust”, according to the PAC report.The spokesperson added: “Our regulator, Ofgem, has tested and benchmarked the SBP against the government’s sustainability requirements for woody biomass, alongside other programmes.”Explore more on these topicsDraxEnergy industryBiomass and bioenergyRenewable energyEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

US consumer confidence levels havefallen sharplyin recent weeks.The inflationary impact outside the US is not as clear because exports from US trading partners could be rerouted elsewhere, and a glut of goods arriving in those places could cause prices to fall.However, growing numbers of companies are warning that the disruption to supply chains could force them to put up prices, while consumer inflation expectations are also rising.According to the latest snapshot from GfK, the measure of UK consumer expectations for the general economic situation over the next 12 months fell by eight points to -37, a significantly worse reading than in April 2024.The forecast for personal finances over the next 12 months also slipped by four points to -3, which is five points worse than this time last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While itnow stands at 2.6%, the Bank of England expects a rise to 3.7% this summer before slowly falling back to its 2% target over the next two years.Bellamy questioned whether Britain was “on the verge of another round of rapidly increasing prices” on the back of Trump’s tariffs.“If so, consumer confidence is likely to collapse, and the broad gains seen since the disastrous September 2022 mini-budget – when confidence hit a record low of -49 – could quickly be eroded.”Explore more on these topicsConsumer spendingTrump tariffsHousehold billsUK cost of living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

The amendments renew a planned change of the law under the Conservatives that was derailed by the general election.Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, plans to close a loophole whereby reckless cycling was caught under legislation dating back to the 1860s.View image in fullscreenMatt Briggs, widower of Kim, who was killed when a cyclist hit her in 2016.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianCampaigners have welcomed the new legislation. Matt Briggs,whose wife, Kim, 44, was killed by a cyclist nine years ago, told the Telegraph: “After losing Kim in 2016, I began campaigning the following year to have these laws enacted.“The use of the ‘wanton and furious’ charge for so many cases has been inadequate and archaic.“I’m absolutely delighted that this Labour government has followed through with our calls for new legislation.“This isn’t just a victory for me and my family, it’s also a victory for all the families who have worked tirelessly through their unbearable tragedies to have these laws changed.”The amendments have been criticised by some cyclists. Chris Boardman, the former Olympic cyclist and national active travel commissioner for England, said the new laws could prevent people from cycling.Labour has promised“unprecedented levels of funding”to encourage more people to cycle as it aims to meet its net zero targets.A DfT spokesperson said: “Dangerous cycling is completely unacceptable, and the safety of our roads is a key priority for this government.“The government is proposing new offences and penalties for dangerous cycling, updating legislation that is over 160 years old, to ensure that the tiny minority who recklessly disregard others face the full force of the law.“These are being brought forward as part of the crime and policing bill and will be debated in due course.”Explore more on these topicsCyclingTransport policyTransportHeidi AlexandernewsShareReuse this content"

The Environment Agency, which investigates water companies in England, has identified hundreds of such cases since 2020.Steve Reed, the environment secretary, said: “Bosses must face consequences if they commit crimes – there must be accountability. From today, there will be no more hiding places.“Water companies must now focus on cleaning up our rivers, lakes and seas for good.”Water companies dumped a record amount of sewage into rivers and coastal waters last year, mostly because wet weather threatened to wash sewage back into people’s homes.Datareleased last monthby the Environment Agency revealed companies had discharged untreated effluent for nearly 4m hours during 2024, a slight increase on the previous year.But companies have also illegally dumped sewage during dry weather. Data released to the Telegraphlast yearunder freedom of information rules shows regulators had identified 465 illegal sewage spills since 2020, with a further 154 under investigation as potentially illegal spills.Britain’s polluted waterways became a major issue at last year’s election, with Labour promising to end what it called the “Tory sewage scandal”.Government sources say one reason illegal spills have been allowed to continue is that regulators have faced obstruction when investigating them.In 2019, three employees at Southern Waterwere convictedof hampering the Environment Agency when it was trying to collect data as part of an investigation into raw sewage spilled into rivers and on beaches in south-east England.The maximum punishment available in that case was a fine, but none of the individuals were fined. Several of the employees said at the time they were told by the company solicitor not to give data to the regulator.Two years later, Southernwas givena £90m fine after pleading guilty to thousands of illegal discharges of sewage over a five-year period.New rules coming into force on Friday will give legal agencies the power to bring prosecutions in the crown court against employees for obstructing regulatory investigations, with a maximum sanction of imprisonment.Directors and executives can be prosecuted if they have consented to or connived with that obstruction, or allowed it to happen through neglect.The rules were included in the Water (Special Measures) Act, which came into law in February. The act also gives the regulator new powers to ban bonuses if environmental standards are not met and requires companies to install real-time monitors at every emergency sewage outlet.Philip Duffy, the chief executive of the Environment Agency, said: “The act was a crucial step in making sure water companies take full responsibility for their impact on the environment.“The tougher powers we have gained through this legislation will allow us, as the regulator, to close the justice gap, deliver swifter enforcement action and ultimately deter illegal activity.“Alongside this, we’re modernising and expanding our approach to water company inspections – and it’s working. More people, powers, better data and inspections are yielding vital evidence so that we can reduce sewage pollution, hold water companies to account and protect the environment.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironment AgencyRiversSteve ReedWater industrynewsShareReuse this content"

They don’t want to compromise on the quality of food provided, but that may mean having to cut spending on other things which may affect children’s learning.“We urge the government to look carefully at the actual costs of providing meals and make sure these are fully covered in the funding schools receive.”The lunches are provided to all children in reception, year 1 and year 2 classes in state primary schools, meaning a typical school with 90 pupils in the three year groups will receive an extra £2.70 a day.The 1.2% increase is well below the 3% annual rise in food pricesrecorded in March by the Office for National Statistics, while pay rises of 3% or more are expected for catering staff, alongside increases in the minimum wage and national insurance contributions.Dinner lady congratulated by Jamie Oliver after 40 years at Oldham schoolRead moreUniversal infant free school meals were introduced under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2014, with schools receiving £2.30 per child.Since then funding increases have been below inflation: by 2023, when the rate was £2.41, theInstitute for Fiscal Studies estimatedit had lost 16% of its value.Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats’ spokesperson for education, children and families, said: “Labour are serving our children crumbs. An increase of just a few pennies is pitiful given the current financial pressures and shows that the government has its priorities totally scrambled.”Astudy by the Child Poverty Action Groupconcluded: “Despite some shortcomings we find that the policy has yielded significant benefits for children, including children from disadvantaged backgrounds, and [the policy] deserves the support of those who campaign against child poverty.”A DfE spokesperson said: “This government is mission-driven to break the unfair link between background and opportunity, and we have already taken action to tackle the challenges felt by families who are struggling.“We have tripled our investment in free breakfast clubs to over £30m, with 750 early adopter schools offering free meals and childcare from this month, ensuring children are ready to learn.“We are also continuing to fund free lunches for over 3 million pupils, while taking tough decisions to fix the foundations of the economy, deliver growth and rebuild Britain.”Explore more on these topicsSchool mealsSchool fundingChildrenPrimary schoolsDepartment for EducationSchoolsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

National output has come close to stagnation in the second half of last year amid weakness in consumer confidence.The IMF downgrade followed similar deep negative revisions by the Bank and the government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. However, recent figures showed the economy recovered at afaster rate than expected in February.While Labour has made rebooting economic growth its number one mission for government, experts say Trump’s increasingly erratic trade wars could torpedo the world economy, including sapping growth in Britain.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is expected to discuss theprospects for a US-UK trade agreementwhen she meets the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, this week but she said on Wednesday that the UK was“not going to rush”into a deal.Britain is hoping to persuade Trump to relent on a 25% tariff on UK car imports to the US, which British manufacturers have warned could lead to imminent job losses if it is not lifted.It is unclear whether Washington is prepared to discuss exemptions from the 10% base tariff it has imposed on all countries, including the UK.Reeves signalled she would be prepared to cut tariffs on imports of some US products if it helped to seal an agreement, but she has insisted food standards and other regulations are not up for negotiation.The UK has already offered other concessions, includingreducing the £1bn digital services tax, which hits US tech firms.Bailey, speaking to CNBC television, said he would be “very encouraged if the UK does make a deal” but stressed that as an open economy, the UK would still be hit as global growth slows down.He said the Bank’s policymakers would have to weigh the risks to growth against an expectation of rapidly rising inflation. “We’ve got to balance those two. But I think the trade issue is the new part of that story,” he said.Speaking at an IMF panel event, Reeves said she shared some of the White House’s concerns about persistent trade deficits in the global economy, and accepted that Trump had a mandate to change things.“There’s been a feeling in my country, and in America and in many other developed countries, that the system we have today delivers for some but not for all, and jobs have been hollowed out in some sectors of the economy,” she said. “It does matter where things are made and who makes them, and we can’t be agnostic or naive about that.”But she said tariffs were “blunt instruments” for dealing with imbalances, calling instead for dialogue.She also confirmed that the UK has no intention of retaliating against US tariffs. “We think that ratcheting up benefits no one, and instead we’re approaching the dialogue with cool heads and a pragmatic realism about what we want to achieve,” she said.Appearing on the panel alongside Reeves, the IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, praised the UK’s growth policies. “What Rachel is doing to lift up growth in the UK, she’s tackling very tough issues: getting reprioritisation of spending, getting the regulatory environment to be more rational, and then taking on the battle to get it done – and it’s really impressive.”Explore more on these topicsAndrew BaileyBank of EnglandInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)EconomicsGlobal economyTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Its CEO and president, Regina Wallace-Jones, sent an email this week saying the organization expected an executive order targeting it, and that the threat of these investigations had “caused many in the ecosystem anxiety and distress”.Federal judge blocks Trump order that could disenfranchise millions of votersRead more“If we look past rumors and innuendo, here is what we know to be true: Nothing will deter or interrupt ActBlue’s mission and work to enable millions of Americans to participate in our democracy,” she wrote. “There is an ongoing and persistent effort to weaken the confidence of the American people in what’s possible. This is the next version of ‘the big lie.’”ActBlue is the main platform used to collect donations for Democratic candidates and causes. The move is among several actions the Trump administration has taken to “cripple the left”, the New York Timeshas reported, part of a “series of highly partisan official actions that, if successful, will threaten to hobble Democrats’ ability to compete in elections for years to come”.The memo comes amid ongoing unsubstantiated claims on the right about the fundraising platform. Elon Musk has tweeted about ActBlue multiple times since Trump took office. “Something stinks about ActBlue,” he said in one post.Republican lawmakers havecalledon the treasury department to investigate ActBlue. Representative Darrell Issa wrote to the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in March,sayingthe department should investigate whether ActBlue facilitated donations from “terror-linked organizations and non-profits”, based on reporting in rightwing media that the platform had cut ties with a Palestinian organization that advocates for divestment in Israel.Congressman Bryan Steil, the chair of the committee on House administration, requested documents from ActBlue in October “related to the platform’s donor verification policies and potential vulnerabilities that foreign actors may exploit to illegally participate in the US political process”. Those documents showed that the platform had updated its policies to automatically reject certain donations from gift cards and other avenues, Steil said.The organization has seen internal strife, the New York Timesreported, leading to departures of senior officials. Republicans demanded more documents from ActBlue based on the departures, the paperreported.The attack on the fundraising platform comes asDemocratsprepare efforts to win back majorities in Washington in the midterms. On Thursday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced a plan to revitalize state Democratic parties by sending monthly donations from the national party to the states, with more funding going to red states.“Donald Trump’s memorandum targeting ActBlue is designed to undermine democratic participation – and it’s no wonder why,” the heads of the DNC, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Governors Association wrote in a joint statement.“He knows Americans are already fed up with his chaotic agenda that is driving the economy off a cliff, so he’s trying to block lawful grassroots donations from supporters giving just $5 or $10 to candidates who oppose him while further empowering the corrupt billionaires who already control his administration.“As Democrats, we’re unified in standing with the millions of Americans who are fighting back against Trump’s dangerous abuses of power.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsDemocratsUS political financingnewsShareReuse this content"

Changing the US Constitution to allow a third presidential term would require a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. An amendment would also need ratification by at least 38 of the 50 US states, another slim possibility.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

But no deal has yet been signed.The IMFdowngraded its forecaststhis week for global economic growth and warned of further downside risks if the trade war escalated. “Simply put, the world economy is facing a new and major test,” Georgieva said.She added that the situation was particularly challenging because many countries had little room for policy manoeuvre after already enduring a series of economic shocks in recent years.Asked what the mood of the delegations from the fund’s member countries in Washington had been this week, Georgieva said: “The membership is anxious.”“We were just about to step on the road to more stability after multiple shocks. We were projecting 3.3% growth, and actually we were worried that this was not strong enough – and here we are,” she said. The IMF is now forecasting global growth of 2.8% for this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She suggested Beijing should boost demand at home, to rebalance its economy away from its dependence on exports, and “pull back from too much intervention in the economy”.IMF chief urges US to strike trade deals swiftly to limit damage to global economyRead moreWith many multilateral institutions under attack from theTrump administration, Georgieva welcomed a speech by Bessent on Wednesday in which he said the Bretton Woods institutions – the IMF and the World Bank – had “enduring value”.“I very much appreciate Secretary Bessent’s reiteration of the US commitment to the Fund and to its role,” she said.However, Bessent also fiercely criticised the institutions for what he called “mission creep” and their “sprawling and unfocused agendas”, including issues such as gender and the climate crisis.Georgieva, responding to a question about these claims, declined to say whether the IMF would continue to work on climate or gender.But she replied: “I want to say that I actually agree with the secretary on one thing. It’s a very complicated world, a world of massive challenges of all kinds.” Stressing that the Fund was a “very fiscally disciplined institution”, she added: “Yes, we have to focus.”Discussions on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank meetings have been dominated by the knock-on effects of Trump’s trade policy, with ministers closely monitoring the stream of pronouncements from the White House.Most countries are facing 10% tariffs on all exports to the US, and 25% for some key products such as cars. It remains unclear whether the much higher “reciprocal” rates announced by Trump in the White House Rose Garden will be reimposed when his 90-day “pause” is over.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeGlobal economyTrump tariffsTrump administrationInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)Kristalina GeorgievaEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, postal workers and others fear the worst is to come.Many feared DeJoy, a prolificTrumpdonor and trucking logistics executive whopusheda 10-year consolidation plan at the agency, would be the man who would finally dismantle theUnited States Postal Service(USPS). Now the service is facing off with an empowered Trump andElon Musk, his billionaire backer and chainsaw-wielding leader of his government job-cutting “department of government efficiency” (Doge).At stake, supporters argue, is the very existence of a service woven into US society, which can be traced back to 1775. “These are real threats. The hounds are at the door,” said Don Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, the unionrepresentingmore than 130,000 mail carriers in rural America.Workers and labor unions at the USPS are sounding the alarm and calling for public awareness of the threats of dismantling and privatizing the agency by theTrump administration.In March, the USPS reached anagreementwith Doge to cut billions of dollars from its budget and finalize a voluntary retirement buyout program announced under the Biden administration to cut 10,000 employees. The Washington Post hasreportedindustry executives are preparing for government efforts to outsource mail and package handling and long-haul trucking routes, and offload leases for unprofitable post offices.“There are other organizations on the chopping block right now, and it is just an amount of time before they get to us. So we just need to get the message out and get ahead of them to say ‘hands off the post office’,” said Tameka Brown, a rural letter carrier inLouisianaand president of the Louisiana Rural Letter Carriers’ Association. “We are the lifeline for a lot of American people, so to feel that your job is being threatened, it’s heart-wrenching.”View image in fullscreenSigns are seen outside a USPS office in New York on 23 March.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPADeJoy’s cuts are already affecting service, especially in rural areas and states. Wyoming, for example, looks set to lose allafternoon mail pickup.Brown warned that if the postal service is privatized, the services it provides would be eliminated or offered at much higher prices by private companies.“We touch American lives every day,” added Brown. “You’re linked to us throughout your whole life in one way or the other. They need to keep their hands off the post office. Through the rain, sleet, snow and through Covid, we were there. We didn’t miss a day.”Doge was even too much for DeJoy, whoreportedlyleft after clashing with its staff over access to the agency.Last month, Muskvoiced supportfor privatizing the USPS. The idea has been praised on the right, including bystaffat the Heritage Foundation, whichorganizedProject 2025, and by Trump: “It’s an idea that a lot of people have liked for a long time. We’re looking at it,” he saidlast year.Maston of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association said Trump had been “floating balloons, seeing what he can get away with and what the reaction is going to be” over his interest in privatizing the USPS. But Trump also seems cautious. The postal service is popular with Americans, and especially rural Americans.“It’s not the US PostalBusiness, it’s the US PostalService,”said Maston. “It’s owned by we, the people, you and I and every other American.“The postal service is the No 2 most trusted and loved government agency. The threats and the attacks by the current administration and Elon Musk, it’s all just for a bottom line and to make something that they can make a profit off of, another piece of the pie.”Marc Mancini, a letter carrier in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and shop steward with the National Association of Letter Carriers, said the USPS was already under intense strain. “The way I feel they’re going about it is they’re trying to save money by squeezing more and more out of workers. So you’re getting a lot more pressure from management, upper management, to have the carriers run faster and move quicker,” he said.He noted any changes to the independence of the USPSmust be madeby Congress, but he said he was worried that the Trump administration might try to skirt around the proper channels.“I think a lot of people cling to the hope that because of that, Trump and Doge cannot fully implement a full privatization of the post office, but I don’t think Trump really cares much for what the constitution says or what the laws are,” Mancini added. “He’s already making threats that if judges rule against them, he’s going to remove them. So I think the threat of privatization should be taken a lot more seriously.”No permanent replacement has yet been named for DeJoy. The Washington Postreportedin February 2025 that Trump was considering dissolving the leadership of the USPS by executive order and absorbing the agency into the US Department of Commerce.The White House rejected the report of a planned executive order, though the presidentsaidit was being looked into it. Trump claimed during the swearing-in ceremony of US Department of Commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, that the USPS was a“tremendous loser for this country”.View image in fullscreenHundreds of USPS workers rally against Doge actions against the institution in Washington DC on 24 February.Photograph: Allison Bailey/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockThe merger proposal wascharacterizedby unions representing USPS workers as an attack on the workers, postal services and the people who rely on them.Brian Renfroe, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said the USPS was far from being a “loser”. “It is a public service that does not operate on taxpayer dollars. It’s self-sustaining. It is paid for. It’s funded solely by revenue from people that mail things,” he said.The USPSlost$9.5bn in fiscal year 2024. Indisputably, it faces huge challenges, although80%of its continued net losses are due to factors outside management’s control. Revenue losses by the agency are not entirely due to operation costs, but from liabilities for pensions and retirements that require policy changes to alleviate, such as enablingbetter pension investments.“It’s challenging during a period of modernization where they’re trying to change and improve their network, but you have to still provide service every day. It’s almost like rebuilding a ship while you’re crossing the ocean,” said Renfroe. “Maintaining that network and public service where everyone, no matter where they live, receives the same postal services for the same price is ultra important, and that is really where the problem comes in with privatization. That would be virtually impossible to maintain in a privatized model.”Postal workers have held rallies around the US in recent weeks, including those organized by theNational Association of Letter Carriers, theAmerican Postal Workers Union, theNational Postal Mailhandlers Unionand theNational Rural Letter Carriers’ Association. Of the 640,000 workers at the USPS, about91%are union members.Legislation has also recently been introduced in theHouseandSenatewith Democratic and Republican support to oppose privatization of the USPS.Tim Thomason, vice-president of the West Virginia chapter of the National Rural Letter Carriers Association and a retired mail carrier of 33 years who served out of the Princeton, West Virginia, post office, argued that rural communities rely on the postal service even more as many private mail services do not serve them because doing so is not profitable.“Those folks rely on us. I took medicine to disabled people. I pulled cars out of ditches. I changed flat tires. It wasn’t just about being the mailman. I felt like I was part of our community,” he said. “If it is torn apart, then we lose the universal service and and I think that the people that I delivered mail to are the ones that are hurt.”The USPS did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A senior White House official claimed “the Trump administration is not considering privatization of the USPS”.The official added in an email: “Doge is actively assessing ways to cut waste, fraud and abuse while eliminating the presence of DEI in the USPS. The president is committed to ensuring no disruptions to the critical mission of the USPS.”Explore more on these topicsUS Postal ServiceTrump administrationUS unionsLouisianaWyomingUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We were projecting 3.3% growth, and actually we were worried that this was not strong enough – and here we are,” she said. The IMF is now forecasting global growth of 2.8% for this year.With many multilateral institutions under attack from the Trump administration, Georgieva welcomed a speech by Bessent on Wednesday, in which he said the Bretton Woods institutions – the IMF and the World Bank – had “enduring value”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a very complicated world, a world of massive challenges of all kinds.” Stressing that the Fund was a “very fiscally disciplined institution”, she added: “Yes, we have to focus.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)Trump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpInternational tradeEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It fell back slightly to $12.30 in early trading on Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap.Critics slam deregulation of crypto as Trump family expands its footprint in industryRead moreDespite the sharp rise, the price of the president’s coin is far below the peak it hit shortly before his inauguration in January,when it soaredfrom about $6 to $75. The launch of coins for Trump and his wife, Melania, have prompted experts to accuse the pair of“shameful” conflicts of interest.The sudden jump in Trump’s meme coin on Wednesday came as investors had been expecting the start of a process that allows more original investors and insiders to cash out their holdings. This “unlock” usually leads to a price fall but the coin’s X account said this would be delayed by 90 days.Meme coins are digital tokens inspired by trends such as viral moments and have no inherent utility. They typically fall in value after an initial strong rally.Last year, the “hawk tuah girl” Haliey Welch, made famous online by a viral video,launched a meme cointhat was worth $490m in December but it quickly plummeted in value and is now worth just $2.9m.While Trump was sceptical of cryptocurrency in his first administration, he has since called himself the “crypto president” and promised to support growth in the sector.In March, he hired the venture capitalist David Sacks to act as an artificial intelligence and crypto tsar, as well as establishing a national stockpile of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.The Trumps have become actively involved in the cryptocurrency sector. The first lady also launched a meme coin in January, and last year the president and his three sons started a crypto platform called World Liberty Financial.Meanwhile, Trump Media and Technology Group, where the president is a majority shareholder, announced plans last month to work with the trading operation Crypto.com to provide investment products linked to crypto.This month the US justice department said it would disband a unit dedicated toinvestigating cryptocurrency-related fraud, as oversight in the digital assets sector began to loosen.The deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said the department would no longer pursue litigation or enforcement actions that had “the effect of superimposing regulatory frameworks on digital assets while President Trump’s actual regulators do this work outside the punitive criminal justice framework”.The deregulation has prompted influential congressional Democrats and watchdogsto warn about the growing risks to investors and the economyposed by multiple deregulatory crypto actions at federal agencies.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsE-commerceInternetMelania TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s time to break up the companyCourtney C RadschTwo recent US cases have found the search giant is functioning as an illegal monopoly. This should be a turning pointThu 24 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 08.25 EDTShareIn less than a year, US courts have ruled that the world’s most powerful tech company broke the law – twice.In August,a federal judge in Washington ruledthat Google illegally maintained its search monopoly by locking up defaults on browsers and devices. InApril, a federal judgein Virginia found that Google illegally monopolized the digital advertising market, manipulating auctions, restricting and stifling competitors. These two rulings, the most significant antitrust wins against a tech giant in decades, should be a turning point in the digital economy.The rulings against Google’s illegal monopoly in digital advertising offer a once-in-a-generation chance to redesign the infrastructure of surveillance that underpins Google’s ill-gotten dominance. But if regulators settle for symbolic fines or behavioral tweaks, it will do nothing to structurally reform the business model and incentives that underpin Google’s illegal dominance. In a three-week hearing that began this week,the US justice department is urging a judgeto break up the company. Whether we seize this moment to break up these concentrations of power will shape the future of markets, media and democratic governance.Google is emblematic of the platform economy in which we now live. The Silicon Valley corporation and its platform brethren provide core infrastructure – for advertising, for information access, for the economy at large. Google’s control of the search ecosystem, from its Chrome browser and Android operating system to its dominance in digital advertising and search, gives it unrivaled power over who gets heard and who gets paid. That power has stifled competition,undermined journalismand distorted the digital economy.The courts have now recognized what myfellow criticshave arguedfor years and whatregulatorsaround the worldhave similarly determined: Google illegally leverages its dominance in one market to reinforce its control in another.As addressed in the ad tech case, Google manipulated auctions and structured its business to advantage its own services at the expense of publishers and rivals, turning its ad exchange into what one employee called an “authoritarian intermediary”. As a result of its illegal monopoly, and by its own estimates, Google pockets on average more than 30% of the advertising dollars that flow through its digital advertising technology products; in some transactions and with certain publishers and advertisers, it takes far more.As discussed inthe search case, Google paid billions annually to be the default search engine on devices and browsers, effectively shutting out competitors and securing its control of 90% of the search market. And Google is now usingthe data generatedthroughout these products and its monopoly profits to secure its dominance in AI.Regulators around the world have converged on similar verdicts and would like to see structural changes, though they seem to have been waiting to see what happened in the US cases. In 2023, the European Commissionconcludedthat only divestiture could remedy Google’s ad tech conflicts of interest. Googleoffered to sell its AdX exchange, but European publishers and regulators rejected the move as insufficient. In the UK, Google is nowfacinga £5bn class-action lawsuit for abusing its search dominance along with acompetition strategic market statusinvestigation, which could result in structural or behavioral remedies.These global actions reflect a growing consensus: Google’s power is infrastructural and self-reinforcing. It controls the tools that decide what we know, what we see and who profits. The implications are especially acute for journalism, which has been hollowed out by Google’s ad market manipulation and search favoritism. In an era ofgenerative AI, where foundation models are trained on the open web and commodify news content without compensation, this market power becomes even more perfidious.Meaningful remedies require structural separation supported by behavioral changes to prevent future anticompetitive behaviors, including in the market for artificial intelligence. First, Google should be required to divest parts of its ad tech stack, spin off Chrome and ensure interoperability. Vertical integration has allowed it to dominateevery layer of digital advertising, from the tools publishers use to the auctions that determine ad placement. Breaking up that stack would create space for competition and innovation.Second, regulators should enforce interoperability and transparency. Let competitors have access to or build on Google’s core infrastructure. Let users choose and switch search engines and browsers easily, enabling them to take their data and easily shift providers. RequireGoogleto disclose how it trains its AI models and how it uses publisher content.Third,global coordinationshould be built into enforcement. Antitrust remedies must be aligned across jurisdictions to prevent regulatory arbitrage and make retaliatory American actions more difficult. The US cases should embolden regulators elsewhere to act swiftly.Finally, we must recognize that these antitrust cases are not just about prices or innovation. They are about power. Who sets the rules for how knowledge circulates? Who profits from public discourse? Who benefits from the infrastructure of the modern economy? If we allow Google to keep its hydra-headed corporation intact, the same dynamics will replicate themselves under the guise of AI innovation.The courts have shown that Google broke the law. Now, governments must show that the law still has teeth. That means structural remedies, not settlements. Transformation, not tinkering.If we fail to act now, we may not get another chance.Dr Courtney C Radsch is director of the Center for Journalism and Liberty at Open Markets InstituteExplore more on these topicsGoogleOpinionLaw (US)Search enginesAlphabetcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s morally repugnant,” said IRA’s executive director, Terrence Collingsworth.‘He’d only calm down if he killed one of us’: victims of slavery on farms in BrazilRead moreBoth the lawsuit and the complaint allege that, despite rescue operations, after which farm owners are fined and may be added to a government-maintained “dirty list” of employers linked to forced labour, Starbucks and other companies continue to import coffee from these farms.A Starbucks spokesperson said: “The cornerstone of our approach to buying coffee isCoffee and Farmer Equity (Cafe) Practices, one of the coffee industry’s first set of ethical sourcing standards when it launched in 2004 and is continuously improved.“Developed in collaboration with Conservation International, Cafe Practices is a verification program that measures farms against economic, social, and environmental criteria, all designed to promote transparent, profitable, and sustainable coffee growing practices while also protecting the well-being of coffee farmers and workers, their families, and their communities.”In Brazil, subjecting workers to forced labour is a crime punishable by up to eight years in prison, but farm owners are rarely jailed.“To put an end to this, we need consumers to be aware that every cup of coffee they drink, without questioning its true origin, is financing slave labour in coffee production,” said Santos Filho. “It’s no use feeling sympathy for the workers or claiming zero tolerance for such practices if you continue drinking coffee without questioning its source.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilStarbucksAmericasFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

A homegrown talent, the 19-year-old winger has done well in his Conference League outings and is in contention for his first start in the league when Enzo Maresca’s side host Everton in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off. Fast, direct and sharp on the ball, George has quickly become a favourite with supporters and he lifted some of the pressure off Maresca after coming off the bench to score an excellent equaliser inChelsea’s comeback win at Fulhamlast weekend. Thrown on as a striker, George made it 1-1 with a fine shot from the edge of the area. It was the latest in a series of positive contributions from the teenager. His enthusiasm could make a difference against Everton.Jacob SteinbergChelsea v Everton,Premier League, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)2Hürzeler needs to snooze, not lose“I have been trying to improve my sleep but it doesn’t happen overnight,” said Fabian Hürzeler this week. The Brighton manager – “dressed head to toe in Stone Island” for his interview with GQ Magazine – revealed he had employed a sleep expert who recommended changing his daily routine. “Because of that I bought an electric bike for the half-hour commute to work. It helps me relax more than going by car.” With West Ham visiting the Amex Stadium on Saturday, Brighton supporters will be hoping that Hürzeler’s peace of mind can inspire a turnaround in their fortunes after a miserable few weeks that have derailed their push for Europe. Graham Potter’s side have a terrible record against his former club, having beaten them once since Brighton were promoted in 2017, although that came the last time this fixture took place, at the start of last season.Ed AaronsBrighton v West Ham, Premier League, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenFabian Hürzeler (second from left) is seeking a first victory in six league games for his Brighton side.Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters3Can McKenna prolong inevitable drop?Should Jack Clarke start for Ipswich or, more likely , step off the bench, he can be expected to be greeted by resounding boos. That is the fate of any former Sunderland player appearing at St James’ Park. But Clarke might welcome a bit of recognition after a season in which his newfound status as a bit-part player has served as a microcosm of the gulf between the top and second tiers. The winger starred at Sunderland last season, prompting the initial £15m transfer fee that transported him to East Anglia. The only problem was that Premier League full-backs have proved far less susceptible to his advances than their Championship counterparts. While his old friends at Sunderland prepare for the playoffs, Ipswich will have their relegation rubber-stamped unless they beat Champions League-chasing Newcastle. All eyes will be on Liam Delap, Kieran McKenna’s much-coveted centre-forward. Chelsea andManchester Unitedmay be favourites to sign Delap this summer but Newcastle retain an interest and this could prove a timely audition.Louise TaylorNewcastle v Ipswich, Premier League, Saturday 3pm4Saints look to dodge unwanted recordCould this be Southampton’s day of glory? After reaching the monumental heights of 11 points last week with aninjury-time equaliser at West Ham, Simon Rusk’s side could surpass Derby in 2007-08, the worst team in Premier League history, if they avoid losing against Fulham. The first positive for Saints is they did just that atCraven Cottage in December with a goalless draw, one of four league games they have not lost away from home this season. Unfortunately, their home form is somehow even worse. They have won once, againstSean Dyche’s appalling version of Everton, and battled todraws with IpswichandCrystal Palace. With Manchester City and Arsenal to come in their final Premier League games at St Mary’s for a while, this is a fantastic opportunity to put the points tally concerns to bed. Better news for Saints fans is that Fulham have endured a late-season wobble, losing their past two matches to leave them potentially eyeing up their summer holidays.Will UnwinSouthampton v Fulham, Premier League, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenLesley Ugochukwu’s late leveller at West Ham means Southampton have picked up more points away than at home this season.Photograph: Tony O Brien/Reuters5End of an era for Vardy and LeicesterJamie Vardy’sexit at the end of the seasonmarks the end of an era for Leicester City, with the 38-year-old the last remaining member of the 2015-16 title-winning squad. Relegation this campaign will invariably trigger change and there are big decisions for the chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, to consider. Ruud van Nistelrooy is unlikely to start next season in charge, while the work of Jon Rudkin, the director of football who began at Leicester as a part-time academy coach, is the subject of much disillusionment. If Vardy plays every remaining game this season, starting at Wolves on Saturday, he will break the 500-game mark in a Leicester shirt. His achievements will go down in club folklore. Vardy is worthy of the statue mooted after he announced his departure on Thursday – but now Leicester need new heroes.Ben FisherWolves v Leicester, Premier League, Saturday 3pm6Emery finds himself in another dogfightConsidering the teams Aston Villa have beaten this season, including Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain andManchester City, it will irk Unai Emery that in three matches against Crystal Palace they have failed to win, losing away and drawing at home in the league, and losing at Villa Park in the League Cup. It has been almost 30 years since Villa last won a major trophy and playing a team five places and 12 points below them in the league should be an ideal situation. Oliver Glasner seems to be one step ahead of Emery at the moment, though. Even in the 2-2 draw at Villa Park, Palace were the better team and repeatedly hit the hosts on the break. It will be up to the Villa manager to find a way to counter the speed of Eberechi Eze and Ismaïla Sarr, or Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final could be the biggest disappointment of the four meetings with Palace this term.WUCrystal Palace v Aston Villa, FA Cup semi-final, Saturday 5.15pm7Amorim should know the kids are all rightRuben Amorim will use more of his youngsters in the coming weeks as heprioritises the Europa League semi-final against Athletic Bilbao. Manchester United desperately need to qualify for the Champions League and this is the only route back to European football next season. Amorim showed his intent by starting the highly regarded Tyler Fredricson and Harry Amassagainst Wolves. On the bench, however, the only academy player present was Chido Obi. That seems strange considering Jaydan Kamason, Godwill Kukonki and Jack Moorhouse were named as substitutesagainst Lyon. There were even three centre-backs for the Wolves fixture, including Jonny Evans, whose time at the club is rapidly running out. If Amorim is to take his policy seriously, he needs to back the kids.WUBournemouth v Manchester United, Premier League, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenTyler Fredricson (right) started for Manchester United at home to Wolves, but will more youngsters join him?Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA8Don’t expect Spurs to spoil Anfield partyOne point, just one point, and Tottenham will leapfrog Wolves into 15th providing Vítor Pereira’s in-form side suffer a surprise home defeat against Leicester the day before. Apologies for the flippancy, but that sums up the meagre opposition standing in the way ofLiverpooland a monumental party on Sunday. Anfield awaits a second Premier League title in five years, although it will be the first time since 28 April 1990 that fans will be able to join the celebrations when Arne Slot’s side get the job done. They could not have picked a more inviting opponent than a Spurs team who have endured 10 away defeats in the league – only relegated Leicester and Southampton have more. Liverpool have already beaten Spurs 6-3 and 4-0 (the latter in the League Cup) this season, and Tottenham have a Europa League semi-final first leg to come next Thursday. Having won the league by beating Spurs at Anfield twice before, in 1981-82 and 1987-88, it would register as a seismic shock should the hosts fail to make it a hat-trick on Sunday. Anfield has waited long enough.Andy HunterLiverpool v Tottenham, Premier League, Sunday 4.30pm9Gibbs-White gears up for City auditionMorgan Gibbs-White has been linked with a move to Manchester City this summer as Pep Guardiola seeks a creative replacement for Kevin De Bruyne. The England international’s majestic skills as an attacking midfielder are a key reason behind Forest’s challenge for a Champions League spot and progress to an FA Cup semi-final. The 25-year-old has scored five and assisted nine in 29 Premier League appearances. It is this level of output that has attracted City; it shows he has the dynamism and physical attributes to make a difference for an elite team. Forest have a previous Wembley hero, their former manager Steve Cooper, to thank for his arrival at the City Ground. Despite Wolvesnot budging on their £35m price, Cooper did not want second-best. Gibbs-White will have another chance to show Guardiola what he has in his locker and how he can perform on the biggest stage.WUNottingham Forest v Manchester City, FA Cup semi-final, Sunday 4.30pm10Fans left for dust by overuse of WembleyThere are tickets still available to buy in the Manchester City end at Wembley on Sunday. It is even possible for supporters to buy four seats at a time, although that might not be advisable with many priced at £90, £120 and £150 each. There should be plenty of room to spread out without snapping up extra seats for the sake of it. Partly, the issue is that City have been to Wembley more times recently than anyone cares to remember. The prospect of another expensive day out, including a lengthy trip to London on unreliable trains, is not the enticing prospect it once was for their fans. Besides, hosting a semi-final between teams from Manchester and Nottingham in northwest Londonis pointless and inconsiderate. The FA needs to reconsider their strategy and utilise the country’s many top-class and more convenient stadiums because, once again, it looks like no one cares about supporters.WUPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3344792Arsenal3434673Man City3423614Nottm Forest3314605Newcastle3318596Chelsea3318577Aston Villa345578AFC Bournemouth3312499Fulham3334810Brighton3304811Brentford3364612Crystal Palace34-44513Everton33-63814Man Utd33-83815Wolverhampton33-133816Tottenham Hotspur33103717West Ham33-183618Ipswich33-382119Leicester33-461820Southampton33-5411Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendFA CupLiverpoolArsenalManchester CityNottingham ForestNewcastle UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The gallery is less than 100 in number. Still, there is extra pep in the starter’s voice. Those last four words carry such weight, they conjure such images. Masters champion, Rory McIlroy. An introduction he had waited a lifetime to receive. It somehow felt inadequate that it was over in a split second. “Very nice,” said McIlroy later. “I could get used to it.” He will be afforded that very privilege.Rory McIlroy shaken by scale of ‘absolutely amazing’ reaction to Masters triumphRead moreA 329-yard drive flew down the fairway. The latest chapter of McIlroy’s thrilling, fabled career was under way. Dressed all in black, 11 days after he may as well have worn Superman’s cape. Records will show McIlroy, in partnership with Shane Lowry in better ball format, started life as a grand slam winner with an eight-under-par 64 at the Zurich Classic. Back in the old routine.McIlroy has never needed to chase popularity. The way he plays, the way he talks and, to an extent, the heartache attached to parts of his career means he is the people’s champion. McIlroy is relatable. Unlike Tiger Woods in his prime, he does not pretend to be infallible. It is just that the adulation has been cranked up a notch. Crowds quickly multiplied as McIlroy and Lowry went about their business.Theirs was a subdued round until McIlroy rolled in a lengthy birdie putt at the 1st, the pair’s 10th, and hit an outrageous second at the next to set up an eagle. They will fancy their chances of a successful Zurich defence albeit this was a day on which the Højgaard twins, Rasmus and Nicolai, posted a 59, only to be headed by the 58-shooting Kevin Velo and Isaiah Salinda. Crazy golf.“Shane got off to a really good start,” McIlroy said. “I didn’t do anything. Shane joked I could have had a couple of extra hours in bed if I wanted to. But yeah, I played a bit better coming in. It was OK. We felt like we left a few shots out there.”View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler holds the Green Jacket for Rory McIlroy after Augusta glory.Photograph: John Angelillo/UPI/ShutterstockThere will come a time when Rory’s story will have to project forward. More majors, Ryder Cups, the pursuit of Olympic medals. The US PGA Championship is only three weeks away. It is just that what played out at Augusta National on 13 April was so extraordinary that it requires ongoing analysis.In becoming just the sixth man in history to complete the grand slam, McIlroy was central to one of the most noteworthy major finishes of all time. Events in Georgia mean the 35-year-old is again the hottest ticket in sport. The g-word is overused but McIlroy is indeed a great. He feels “responsibility” in holding the Green Jacket for a year. It is one of McIlroy’s attributes that he has never outwardly changed, despite the inevitable impact of fame and fortune. Masters glory will not alter McIlroy’s values or approach.“It’s another really big tournament, one I had wanted to win for a long time and hadn’t been able to do it so there is a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction,” he said. “That is really nice but I don’tfeeldifferent. I didn’t expect to feel different. I am glad of the experience and glad to have got through it but it wasn’t like I was ever going to wake up the next morning and … ” Hence here he was, on a cloudy morning in Louisiana, back at work.Predictions that McIlroy would end his Masters wait arrived from illustrious observers on the morning the tournament began. Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tom Watson all tipped McIlroy. The man himself acted as if he was unaware what had been said by the honorary starters, when in reality he knew straight away. “I don’t think there was anything that could have happened that I hadn’t heard before,” McIlroy said. “It’s all just noise. I got really used to dealing with noise that week.” McIlroy pauses. “It was nice to prove them right.”McIlroy’s euphoric celebrations on the 18th green at Augusta were instinctive. Something that happened next was not. McIlroy turned to his four-year-old daughter, Poppy, during the prize-giving ceremony and delivered a simple message: “Never, ever, give up on your dreams.” The theme had been scripted.“I hope Poppy had a little clue about what was going on,” McIlroy says with a smile. “That was directed at her but I had also always thought about, if I did win the Masters and completed the slam, what did I want my message to be. It was great that she was there and I could direct that at her but it was also for every little boy or girl in the world who has a dream.“I wanted it to mean something more than me just winning a golf tournament. I wanted it to represent something more and be inspirational; if you have a dream, never give up on it and work hard. Overcome obstacles. Keep coming back. That is what I wanted the lesson to be.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

McIlroy could never properly articulate what he went through in round four, where he looked to have the Masters in his grip, wobbled, hauled himself back to the summit but faced a playoff against Justin Rose. What if he had not actually won it?“I don’t even want to think about that,” says McIlroy. “It is hard for me to even watch it back. Just the feelings … aargh.” Still? “Still. I think back to the playoff and don’t know how I hit those three shots. I don’t have a clue. It will be the hardest round of golf I’ll ever have to play. I’m glad I have it behind me.”Private celebrations included a trip home to Belfast, from where McIlroy’s parents had watched the Masters unfold. McIlroy almost tears up when asked about the moment he set eyes on Rosie and Gerry, whose role in the development of a history-maker should never be underplayed. From humble roots, they have seen their only child etch indelible marks in record books. “Emotional,” he says. “It is still emotional. Hopefully they are very proud of their boy.”Had McIlroy won theMasters in 2011, when he collapsed so painfully over the last nine holes, the reaction would have been nothing like what transpired 14 years later. The tension, the drama, the reaching of this promised land turned heads way beyond golf. When Donald Trump contacted McIlroy on the Monday, the US president wanted to analyse the champion’s final round. The broader response to this win was humongous.“While it was happening, I had no idea,” McIlroy says. “I was just trying to win the tournament. Afterwards, yes. People could see the emotion and how much it meant to me.”Elton John was amongst those to get in touch with McIlroy to offer heartfelt congratulations. Rory’s still standing … better than he ever did.Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyGolffeaturesShareReuse this content"

A two-year consensual relationship ensued during which, she alleges, he raped her.Sharpe, who has previously denied the allegations, said on Thursday that the relationship was “100% consensual” and that he was “electing to step aside temporarily from myESPNduties.”NFL hall of famer Shannon Sharpe accused of rape in Nevada lawsuitRead moreIn the statement, he added: “I will be devoting this time to my family, and responding and dealing with these false and disruptive allegations set against me. I plan to return to ESPN at the start of theNFLpreseason.”Sharpe has fashioned a successful media career on television and podcasts since he retired from the NFL, and had recently signed a contract extension with ESPN. In a statement on Thursday, ESPN commented on Sharpe’s decision.“This is a serious situation, and we agree with Shannon’s decision to step away,” the network said.In the lawsuit, the woman also claims Sharpe once threatened to kill her after she arrived at his house. Additionally she alleges he filmed some of their sexual encounters and shared the footage with others. She is seeking $50m in damages.Her lawyer, Tony Buzbee, released audio earlier this week in which someone, allegedly Sharpe, can be heard threatening to choke the woman. Buzbee has also represented women who say they have been assaulted by Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs and NFL quarterback Deshaun Watson. On Thursday, Sharpesaid in a video posted to Instagramthat the lawsuit is a “shakedown,” and Buzbee “targets Black men”. Sharpe’s lawyer also said the audio recording was “heavily edited and taken entirely out of context.”Sharpe temporarily stepped away from his role at CBS Sports in 2010 after a woman accused him of sexual assault. Sharpe never faced criminal charges over those allegations,and he later returned to his job.Sharpe played 14 seasons in the NFL, won three Super Bowls and was an eight-time Pro Bowler.

The stats siteRSSSFcredits the Brazilian with a total of 778.Ronaldo has 933. This month, after scoring twice forAl-Nassrin a 3-1 win over Al-Hilal in the Riyadh derby, he played it down. “Guys, let’s enjoy the moment, the present,” he said. “I’m not following 1,000 [goals]. If it’s yes, perfect. If it’s not, it’s not.”In a chat with Rio Ferdinand last August, however, he was more bullish. “For me it’s the best mark that I can have in football, to reach, first 900 goals. After, my challenge is 1,000 goals,” he said, adding that there were also no doubts about his number even if he wasn’t quite as cheeky as Maradona. “All the goals that I score, they have video. So I can prove that it’s [real] … But if I don’t have injuries, I want that [goal tally].”Quick GuideAsian Champions League quarter-finalsShowAl-Hilal v Gwangju, Fri 5.30pm (all times BST)Al-Ahli Saudi v Buriram United, Sat 5.30pmYokohama v Al-Nassr, Sat 8.30pmKawasaki v Al Sadd, Sun 5.30pmSemi-finals:Tues 29 and Weds 30 April, both 5.30pmFinal:Sat 3 May, 5.30pmWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.At the age of 40, games and scoring opportunities are running out even for a player in such fine physical condition, but the goals are still flowing. Last season Ronaldo broke theSaudi Pro Leaguerecord with 35. This season he also tops the standings with 23. There are rumours that Gianni Infantino wants him to receive an invitation from one of the 32 teams at the Club World Cup (well, 31, as he is never going to appear for Nassr’s bitter rivals Al-Hilal) and potentially play a few more games this summer. As well as further international appearances with Portugal from June – he scored international goal number 136, a men’s record of course, against Denmark in March – there should be more than one Asian Champions League game in the coming days.The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has seven goals in the tournament and will fancy his chances of more against Yokohama, especially as he was rested in Al-Nassr’s 3-2 league win at Damac on Tuesday (it was only their second win in seven Ronaldo-less games this season; he doesn’t miss many). The Japanese team are bottom of the J1 League. After three successive Australian coaches with Ange Postecoglou, Kevin Muscat (who both delivered league titles) and then Harry Kewell (who led them to the last season’s Champions League final but was fired after poor domestic results), Steve Holland, Gareth Southgate’s former England assistant, was appointed just before Christmas. He was dismissed on Good Friday after four months and not many more points.Format as well as form is against Yokohama. From the quarter-final stage onwards (the final is on 3 May), all games will be over one leg and held in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah. Home advantage will help Ronaldo, who wants as many games as possible for club and country.There have been some concerns in Portugal, heightened during the 2024 European Championship, about whether his continued place in the national team is warranted and whether this personal milestone could become a collective millstone. “Ronaldo is at a point in his career where he needs to start prioritising the team instead of himself,” Dietmar Hamann said last July, adding that he would be surprised if the forward reached 1,000 goals. “I don’t think he can go on for that long.” This week, however, Luís Figo predicted that his compatriot could be a starter at the next World Cup and would still be scoring at the age of 42.View image in fullscreenCristiano Ronaldo scores against Poland last November having struggled during Euro 2024 in the summer.Photograph: Estela Silva/EPAThere is much less of a debate in Saudi Arabia about his effectiveness. There, Ronaldo is very much the face of his club, which he joined in December 2022, and the league. Public doubts are rare but can be heard. Al-Nassr’s coach, Stefano Pioli, has been criticised for failing to create a more expansive brand of attacking football but the former Al-Hilal administrator Ibrahim al-Anqari said last week it was not all the Italian’s fault. “Any coach will find it difficult to do so withCristiano Ronaldo,” he said. “If you do not create an easy opportunity for him, he will not be in the match.”The latter part seems a bit harsh given some of the goals he has scored – the former Al-Nassr star Hashem Sorour said that only Al-Hilal fans or those who know nothing of football criticise Ronaldo – but the old marauding forward is long gone.The hunger for goals is still there, of course. Being 67 short on the wrong side of 40 makes it tough to get on the right side of 1,000 but Ronaldo is still playing and still scoring. His contract in Riyadh ends this summer but most expect that it will be extended for another season until the 2026 World Cup. What happens after that may depend on just how close he is.Explore more on these topicsCristiano RonaldoAl-NassrSaudi Pro LeagueSaudi Arabia and sportAsian Champions LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was 67.An All-Pro in 1985 and 1987, McMichael was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2024. He played in a franchise-record 191 consecutive games from 1981 to 1993 and ranks second to Richard Dent on the Bears’ career sacks list with 92.5. His finalNFLseason was with Green Bay in 1994.McMichael’s brash personality and willingness to say whatever was on his mind made him a perfect fit for pro wrestling. He began working for World ChampionshipWrestlingin the 1990s at the height of the “Monday Night Wars” with the World Wrestling Federation, starting as a color commentator and later joining Ric Flair in the “Four Horsemen” group.McMichael revealed in April 2021 that he had been diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease or motor neurone disease, which affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing loss of muscle control.“I promise you, this epitaph that I’m going to have on me now? This ain’t ever how I envisioned this was going to end,” McMichael told theChicagoTribune.McMichael had been experiencing tingling in his arms for some time that he thought was a neck or spine issue stemming from his playing days or his work as a wrestler.“He’s scared to die and he shouldn’t be because he’s the most badass man I’ve ever known inside and out,” his wife, Misty McMichael, said his Hall of Fame induction in 2024. “He’s a good man. He’s gonna be in heaven before any of us, so I don’t know what he’s afraid of. But I’ve told him to please hang on ’til the [induction] and then, you know, I don’t want to see him suffer anymore. He’s been suffering.”McMichael was born in Houston and went on to a successful college career at Texas. The New England Patriots drafted McMichael in the third round in 1980. He didn’t last long, appearing in six games as a rookie before getting released prior to his second season. McMichael would play hard on and off the field, getting in fights in practice and taking in Boston’s nightlife afterward.“They looked at me and said, ‘Steve, we think you’re the criminal element in the league. Get out,’” McMichael said in 2019.The same traits that apparently led to a ticket out of New England were welcomed in Chicago. McMichael recalled walking into founder George Halas’ office – “It was like I was walking into a 1920 gangster movie and he was James Cagney” – when he signed with Chicago.“Papa Bear” made it clear. “You know what he said to me, guys?” McMichael said. “I’ve heard what kind of dirty rat you are in practice. Don’t change, Steve.”His nasty demeanor and oversized personality made McMichael one of the most feared players on arguably the greatest defense ever assembled. But longtime friend Dave Siden remembered him as master storyteller and a generous man who would sign over his preseason paychecks to the team trainers as a token of appreciation and buy baskets of toys for children. Through McMichael, Siden met golfer Ben Crenshaw and went backstage at wrestling events.“I knew him as one of the nicest, most giving friends you could have,” Siden said.McMichael played alongside Hall of Famers Dent, Mike Singletary and Dan Hampton, and the 1985 Bears, led by their dominant defense, made their way to the franchise’s lone Super Bowl championship. McMichael was an All-Pro that season with eight sacks.He played 15 years in the NFL – 13 with Chicago before his final season with the rival Packers.“Steve ‘Mongo’ McMichael was a Bears legend, and his courageous battle against ALS inspired us all,” the Bears posted on X. “Our hearts go out to his family, friends and teammates.”Pro Football Hall of Fame president and CEO Jim Porter said in a statement: “Steve McMichael told everyone he would fight ALS with the same tenacity he showed for 15 seasons in the National Football League. And he did just that. Everyone who played with or against Steve shares the same opinion: No one battled longer or harder from the snap until the whistle than Steve the player.”He and his first wife, Debra, divorced in 1998. He married the former Misty Davenport in 2001, and their daughter, Macy, was born in 2008.Explore more on these topicsNFLChicago BearsWrestlingUS sportsChicagoShareReuse this content"

Or not like he used to anyway.That seems to be the verdict of his Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, who obliquely cited an absence of“physicality”in his explanation for leaving De Bruyne out of the lineup against Real Madrid in February.One data point suggests that De Bruyne still covers ground as he did in his gut-busting prime, when he always seemed to be triggering City’s high press. The11.6 kilometers per 90 minuteshe ran in the Champions League this season stack up favorably against the11.5 km/90he posted in the 2019/20 Premier League season when he won the first of two PFA Player of the Year awards in a row. His top speed, though, tells another story. In 2022, he recordedthe highest sprint speedin the Champions League since it had begun tracking it in 2016 at 39.1 km/h. This season, De Bruyne’s top speed in European competition was 32.25 km/h.What’s more, he has been on the field forless than halfof Manchester City’s total Premier League playing time this season – last season, it was just 35.7%. He’s missed42 matchesto hamstring injuries over those campaigns.Kevin De Bruyne ‘a bit surprised’ not to be offered new Manchester City dealRead moreDe Bruyne has not lost a step. He’s misplaced several of them. Yet he’s still capable of brilliance, as against Crystal Palace on 12 April, when hetallieda goal, an assist and three key passes.De Bruyne himself maydisagreewith the reasons behind his exit, but his contract will nonetheless expire this summer when he turns 34, bookending a decade at City and one of the finest midfield careers in Premier League history. He is likely to come to Major League Soccer, where teams are alreadyjostling for positionto recruit him, evidently satisfied that he can still do MLS-level running.If someone works out how to pay De Bruyne a figure palatable to him after earning a reported $25.5m (about£19.2m) a year at City, the Belgian will not only bring his generational passing and reading of the game. He will also come equipped with a charming refusal, or possible inability, to ever be diplomatic about anything.Asked by the Guardianwhether Belgium could win the 2022 World Cup ahead of the start of that tournament, De Bruyne was his unfiltered self: “No chance, we’re too old.”Even more memorable was the initially innocuous social media footage of De Bruyne tasting some food with then-teammate Fabian Delph, who froze when prompted to chime in? “Say something, it’s a video!” De Bruyne hollered at Delph in theviral post.“You idiot!” he added in the bit clipped from the video that was posted, a well-placed source insideManchester Cityconfirmed to the Guardian US – surely the most important scoop this august outlet will get all year.This allergy to tact should deliver yet more funny moments when it collides with the many quirks ofMLS. But a stateside signing for De Bruyne would also reignite a tiresome “retirement league” discourse – the perpetuation of the idea that the league is merely a place for over-the-hill stars looking for one last payday, and little more. This debate is not only very boring, but also a marker of an almost incurable immaturity as a soccer scene.View image in fullscreenZlatan Ibrahimovic was excellent for the Galaxy before moving back to Europe.Photograph: Usa Today Uspw/USA Today SportsIt also is not based in reality. Fixating on the older arrivals to MLS ignores the league’s consistent acquisitions of up-and-coming players from South- and Central America, who far outnumber the rare big name headed to one of the league’s coastal hotspots. These are also conversations that other established and respected leagues – which is what MLS must be viewed as by now, in its 30th season – simply aren’t having.The English Premier League spent the 1990s as a haven for the Italian Serie A’s veterans. The fondly remembered Gianfranco Zola didn’t arrive at Chelsea until he was 30. Gianluca Vialli had arrived a few months earlier at 32. Paolo Di Canio, Fabrizio Ravenelli, Pierluigi Casiraghi – all in their late 20s. Nobody fretted about what it all meant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet when Milan gladly took Zlatan back after his spell with the Galaxy – as they did with Beckham, twice! – Serie A didn’t tumble into an existential crisis. If the league fell in the eyes of some in those years, those acquisitions were not the reason why. Zlatan got 34 more league goals in Italy, then retired.Today, some Serie A teams like Milan, which presently has six players signed directly from English clubs in its first-team squad, basically run a jobs program for not-quite-good-enough-for-the-Big-6 Premier Leaguers. Is this considered to be a problem? It is not.Signing older players with big names doesn’t mean you’re desperately chasing clout for your otherwise irrelevant league. Sometimes they are just opportunities to improve teams with shrewd signings at (often) below-market prices. In the best cases, they can raise the level of entire teams. In Miami, Lionel Messi and his merry band of longtime friends are all clearly much nearer the end of their careers than their peaks, yet last season they combined to amass the largest regular season points haul in MLS history – and while Messi and Sergio Busquets are well paid ata combined guaranteed rateof almost $30m, Jordi Alba and Luis Suárez are sensibly priced at a mere $1.5m apiece.Now that they no longer rely on the reputation of imported veterans to cast their credibility on MLS, its clubs have also grown savvier in avoiding the sorts of players intent on enjoying a leisurely lifestyle in favor of those whose competitiveness still rages. Of late, there have been a lot fewer club-hopping Lothar Matthäuses or lackadaisical Rafa Márquez type-veterans in MLS than those with the relentlessness of Robbie Keane or the ever-irritable Thierry Henry, pushed by a pressing urge to keep winning no matter who they played for.Whoever lands De Bruyne, if anyone in MLS indeed does, will surely be improved by his presence, even if he isn’t as fast as he once was. And it will doubtless be delightful to behold, as the Belgian has been his whole career.Let’s propose, then, that there is no larger referendum in these kinds of signings any more, and that they can just stand alone as injections of joy.Leander Schaerlaeckens is at work on a book about the United States men’s national soccer team, out in 2026.

So I think she’s proud, a little bit stressed but it’s all right.”Growing up in Ajat, a village in the Dordogne, Lacroix knew he was never going to follow in his mother Corrine’s footsteps by becoming a doctor. Having moved to Germany from the French side Sochaux as a 20-year-old after coming through the prestigious Clairefontaine academy, he reunited with Oliver Glasner – his former manager at Wolfsburg – in south London last summer. The elegant defender is the heartbeat of the Palace side that will face Aston Villa for a place in the final and has been tipped to win his first senior cap sooner rather than later after representingFranceat every youth level.“One day I will be in a national team – I know,” he says confidently. “But right now it’s to look at what’s happening in Crystal Palace, the semi-final and win this Cup.”Lacroix reveals that a chat with the club captain, Joel Ward, has ensured he is fully briefed on Palace’s history in this competition. Heartbreaking defeats in finals by Manchester United in 1990and 2016mean Palace have never won a major trophy, and they may not get a better chance than this year.Lacroix believes team spirit has been the secret to their superb form since failing to win any of their opening eight Premier League fixtures, with Glasner’s side racking up seven successive away clean sheets in all competitions before recent defeats against Manchester City and Newcastle. “This is really important – to build something off the pitch also,” he says as the striker Jean-Philippe Mateta lurks in the background trying to distract him. “We can see it on the pitch. Everyone wants to fight for each other. This is why we are difficult to play.”View image in fullscreenMaxence Lacroix heads the ball clear during Crystal Palace’s FA Cup quarter-final victory over Fulham.Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/ShutterstockFaith is another key factor that underpins Palace’s unity. Ward, Eberechi Eze and Lacroix’s central defensive partners Marc Guéhi and Chris Richards are among those who have spoken about how Christian values have influenced their careers. But it wasn’t until Lacroix signed that a group of them started praying together before matches.“We have a lot of Christians in this team and I said when we have a lot of Christians, normally Christianity is a big family,” says Lacroix. “I said before games we come and we put this game into the hands of God and we pray together. We have done this since the first games I’m here. I think a lot of guys wanted it but didn’t know how to do it. I said let’s do it and now it’s normal.”He adds: “I’m more like the pastor of this team. I speak a lot about Jesus, about God. I love God. I know a lot about the Bible, about Jesus and I try to give what I know, the knowledge about the words, because sometimes it’s difficult to understand. I try my best to spread the word.”Lacroix learned English while in Germany on the advice of his Wolfsburg teammate Josuha Guilavogui, who now plays for Leeds and helped him settle when he moved to Palace. Lacroix has a nine-month-old son and his mother, a former specialist in nutrition and psychology, is regularly on the phone offering advice.“She helps me every day,” he says. “If I don’t speak with her I’m in trouble. She accomplished everything in her own way. To be a doctor is difficult, it’s really long, you have to give a lot, you have to go to school for a while. But it was my plan to play football.”View image in fullscreenLacroix (second left, kneeling) celebrates with Marc Guéhi, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Daniel Muñoz and Trevoh Chalobah after scoring Crystal Palace’s second goal in their 2-2 draw with Manchester City in December.Photograph: Sebastian Frej/MB Media/Getty ImagesLacroix was 21 when he was made captain at Wolfsburg by Glasner, who was adamant he was the ideal replacement in the middle of Palace’s back three after the sale of Joachim Andersen to Fulham last summer. It has proved to be a shrewd move because Lacroix’s ability on the ball and recovery speed have complemented the attributes of Guéhi and Richards.“He takes the best of you,” Lacroix says of the Austrian manager. “He can make a normal player into a good player because he helps you to give everything you have. I think this is the biggest point.”The 25-year-old’s eyes light up when he looks forward to the prospect of running out in front of 35,000 Palace supporters at Wembley. Lacroix has become a firm favourite at Selhurst Park and wants to repeat the celebration he performed against Manchester City in December when he scored his only goal for the club anddropped to one knee in prayer.“I hope on Saturday we’re going to do it again, because I think Wembley will shake,” he says. “Our fans are like the 12th man on the pitch. When you play against us, especially in our stadium, the fans are incredible. I heard there’s going to be like 35,000 fans. So it’s more than our stadium.“It’s going to be hard for us against Villa. It’s difficult when you play against these guys because they will push us. But [the fans] give us a new energy when it’s difficult on the pitch. When you hear them, they push you, you want to give everything for them.”Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceFA CupFranceinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Surprisingly, almost all the reaction to the conversation has ignored this bombshell – Engelbert apparently not such a big player in the culture war world; best focus on your Middle Easts, your Bravermans, your impartialities, Brian.Of course the job of news outlets is to pick out headlines but it does appear almost no one has watched the whole programme. It’s essentially a nice wide-ranging interview covering the career of one of the best English footballers and football broadcasters of all time.Pundits’ showy partisanship reflects football’s embrace of fan-centric populism | Jonathan LiewRead moreWe learn that his parents weren’t that pushy, that his life changed after that hat-trick against Poland in ‘86. He discusses Diego Maradona and the state of that pitch at the Estadio Azteca, the terrible foul on Glenn Hoddle just before Barry Davies talks us through one of the greatest goals of all time: “You have to say that’s magnificent.”We learn about his views on gambling, the secret to scoring goals, his incredibly moving testimony about almost losing his son to leukemia.He talks about being thrust into the Grandstand presenter’s chair when Des Lynam was at Aintree the day the Grand National was abandoned because of a bomb scare, and explains that those lines whenever England are knocked out of a major tournament are off the cuff. There’s hilarious footage of him running away from paps half his age to catch a train during the Match Of the Day debacle.But then comes the headline-grabbing stuff: on being stood down from Match of the Day that Friday in 2023, onsigning a letterto have a Gaza documentary put back on iPlayer, and ultimately on whether the BBC wanted him to leave.Depending on your political allegiance this is just one bigBBCcircle jerk, or Lineker has taken Auntie to the cleaners.The usual suspects line up to have a go at one of their favourite targets. “Arrogant BBC interview proves he still just doesn’t get it,” saysthe Telegraph. TheDaily Expressquotes a body language expert who says he showed signs of “anger and unhappiness”. Narrator with no body language qualifications: he didn’t.Take an unfortunate alt-right YouTube adventure and youfind Dan Woottoncalling it “extraordinarily delusional and out of touch” – while repeatedly calling the BBC the British Bashing Corporation before advertising a body cleansing Hot Chocolate for what seems like an eternity.Over on GB News Patrick Christys wonders why Rajan didn’t ask Lineker whether he supports Hamas. Presumably because it would be a monumentally stupid waste of a question.View image in fullscreenGary Lineker attempts to walk his dog near his London home amid the scrutiny that followed his suspension from Match of the Day in March 2023.Photograph: Niklas Halle’n/AFP/Getty ImagesOn Gaza, theJewish Chronicleopens its opinion piece: “One of the BBC’s biggest problems can be summed up in two words: Gary and Lineker.” While at the other end of the spectrum, onhis YouTube channelthe Guardian’s Owen Jones entitles an episode: “Gary Lineker shames BBC over Gaza.”I’m not sure Lineker does that. He appears very sympathetic to the BBC bosses who have to make difficult editorial decisions. But he remains adamant that he was right to sign the letter to have Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone reinstated on the iPlayer despite the 13-year-old narrator’sdad being a Hamas official. Can the wrong messenger still tell you the right message? “I think you let people make their own minds up,” Lineker said. “We’re adults. We’re allowed to see things like that. It’s incredibly moving … I think [the BBC] just capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot.”The word lobbying is problematic, inadvertently invoking the trope of some secretive cabal of Jewish people pulling the strings behind the scenes. But Lineker appears to take the rational view that the7 October massacrewas abhorrent, but that history didn’t begin on that date. And it is incorrect to see all criticism of the Israeli state as antisemitic, especially given how many innocent people, including so many children, have been killed. As I have mentioned before, my family changed our name because of antisemitic threats in the 80s. I’d be an odd antisemite – like Lineker, I’d just like the killing to stop.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The comparisons are obvious aside from his vastly superior football ability, vastly more successful broadcasting career, especially at the BBC (although who doesn’t remember Lunch with Max on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, Saturdays 12pm-2pm, 2004-05?). But as someone with an (albeit much smaller) platform, the question of which subjects to speak about on social media and on air are interesting.My impression from broadcasting across the BBC, Sky and TalkSport among others over the past 23 years is that most bosses would prefer you just talked about sport – although I’ve never been told what to say, or perhaps more importantly what not to say. Just keeping numerous TV channels or radio stations on air is hard enough before worrying about what your presenters have tweeted or said on air. Even managers want an easy life.But you have to push back sometimes. I had a producer once say: “Can we not talk about domestic violence today? It’s Friday.”I was once co-hosting a radio show with a former professional footballer. During the show I got another ex-pro, the former Australia international Craig Foster, a human rights activist, on air to raise awareness of a campaign to free a footballer from a Thai jail, from where he was due to be extradited to Bahrain on false charges. My co-host’s response: “I’m not really into those things.” Human rights, it’s not just not my thing.BBC impartiality views to one side, do we expect people in sport to have no view on the outside world? They are still humans, being humans in the world like everyone else. Surely the key is balance and timing.Lineker has never talked about Brexit or the plight of the Palestinian people before introducing Jonathan Pearce at Selhurst Park for Crystal Palace v Bournemouth. Perhaps it’s no surprise that one woke snowflake lefty agrees with another one but in this interview, and in our very occasional meetings, he comes across as a guy who is good at what he does and cares about other people. It actually feels so dramatically uncontroversial.Match of the Day will be fine without him – it is in the hands ofthree brilliant broadcasters. Perhaps now people will leave Lineker to do his podcasts rather than obsessing about every tiny little thing he did yesterday.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The 38-year-old, regarded as the club’s greatest player, was central towinning the Premier Leagueagainst all odds in 2016 andthe FA Cupin 2021.Vardy signed a 12-month extension last summer after promotion as champions from the Championship but this campaign has been a struggle. This week he apologised to the club’s supporters after relegation was confirmed with five games to play and described his own season as a “total embarrassment”.Vardy’s story is one of the most famous in the modern era, the player having joined Leicester from non-league Fleetwood for £1m in 2012 and gone on to cement himself as an England international and one of the best strikers in the Premier League. He has scored 198 goals in 496 appearances for Leicester.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In 2019-20, aged 33, Vardy became the oldest player to win the Premier League Golden Boot. He scored 18 league goals as the club won promotion last season and has scored seven in this campaign.He said in a farewell message on social media that Leicester “did the impossible” by winning the league and that he had memories to last a lifetime, picking out alongside the trophies a run to the Champions League quarter-finals and an escape from relegation.“I have been here so long that I truly thought it would never end,” he said. “This has not only been really difficult for me to write but also a really difficult decision to make.Leicester Cityhas been my second home, my extended family, my life for 13 years.

Hopefully there is one or two more for Leicester between now and the end of the season, and many more in the future. I might be 38 but I’ve still got the desire and ambition to achieve so much more.”He reserved praise for the “band of brothers” from their title-winning season and for his first manager, Nigel Pearson, for enabling him to turn professional, and acknowledged his own character. “Thanks also to all the other managers, coaches and staff who have helped me and, in some cases, put up with me.”Leicester, who visit Wolves on Saturday, are 19th in the Premier League after taking 18 points from 33 matches. They have lost 16 of their past 18 matches under Ruud van Nistelrooy, who is unlikely to lead the club next season.Leicester’s chair, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, said: “Jamie is unique. He is a special player and an even more special person. He holds a place in the hearts of everyone connected to Leicester City, and he certainly has my deepest respect and affection.

At the end of Celta de Vigo’s victory over Villarreal on Wednesday, players and staff crouched low before fans and for the first time a hush fell over Balaídos. All together now, the chant started slowly, quietly, whispered, but the pace quickened and the volume grew bit by bit until they burst to their feet, belted out their name and bounced off each other, footballers fell into the net laughing and one thought emerged above any other:how much fun they were having.This is the way football’s supposed to be – about enjoying, about belonging – and this is the way it has been since Claudio Giráldez came along: good even when it has been bad and getting better all the time. The last time Celta played Villarreal they were beaten 4-3 with a 100th-minute winner, a game of seven goals that could have been 17 after which Iglesias said: “If we’re going to lose, let it be like this.” Eight months on Celta beat them back, a 3-0 victory lifting them into a European place where they have not finished for a decade and embodying all they want to be. Iglesias was a ballboy back then and it was “cool”, he said, but not quite like this, grateful for the days he has been given.The days everyone has. Giráldez had been thinking the unthinkable, ready to walk, when Celta offered him the manager’s job last March. Born and raised 10 miles away and a success as the B team coach, he had even won the derby against Deportivo de La Coruña, but taking the first team was not the plan. It was expensive too – Celta had signed Rafa Benítez for three years on €3m each – but this was an emergency. As it turned out, it was also an opportunity. They had thought it a coup to get the Champions League winner in for their centenary season yet he did not complete it, sacked in March 2024, one place and two points off the relegation zonehaving won just five times in 28, the worst win percentage in 80 years. So they called Giráldez and he matched that in a third of the games.Celta climbed to safety swiftly. A year on, having spent zero euros on new signings, Iglesias one of only three players joining them last summer, they are seventh. The final Champions League place, held by the Villarreal team they beat, is within reach. At Balaídos, they believe it is possible, there is hope – and that is a success in itself, the point of it all. It is not just that Celta could return to continental competition for the first time since thatOld Trafford semi-final in 2017. It is not even thatrelegation,more realthan Europe in a time when they finished 13th, 13th, 17th, 17th, eighth, 11th, 13th and 13th, and a fate from whichIago Aspas too often had to rescue them, has been left behind. It is the way they have done it, who they have done it with and what it all means, how it feels. And it feels good,theirs.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowTuesdayBarcelona 1-0 Mallorca, Valencia 1-1 Espanyol.WednesdayAlavés 1-0 Real Sociedad, Athletic Bilbao 1-0 Las Palmas, Celta 3-0 Villarreal, Getafe 0-1 Real Madrid.Thursday fixturesAtlético 3-0 Rayo, Betis 5-1 Valladolid, Leganés 1-1 Girona, Osasuna 1-0 Sevilla.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Born in O Porriño in Pontevedra province, a town of 20,562 people, Giráldez was a Celta fan who said the world stopped when the ball was at the feet of Aleksandr Mostovoi. Nephew of the former Celta and Real Valladolid centre-back Pepe Lemos, he could play a bit too. Spotted representing Porriño at the Vigo Cup, he left for Real Madrid at 13, arriving the same year Zinedine Zidane did, but home pulled, more than a playing career. He regretted that and regretted the time away too, which he felt even more keenly when his father died. He did not hit the gym, did not look after his diet, did not do the things others did, all the essential extras. Instead, he trusted everything to his left foot and his brain; both were good but not enough.View image in fullscreenClaudio Giráldez is a boyhood Celta fan and now the manager.Photograph: Octávio Passos/Getty ImagesWhile he trained with Sergio Ramos and Arjen Robben, joining first-team sessions, Giráldez played only one game for Castilla, the B team – and that was against Celta in Segunda B, Group I. Aspas played against him that day in September 2007;Michu scored. He had a year at Atlético Madrid’s academy, but went back to Galicia: Pontevedra, Ourense, Coruxo. And then Porriño Industrial, where he did everything from coaching to ticketing to chasing sponsors. He also sold insurance.“I tell my players now not to be the donkey I was,” he says. But there was something about him that was always more coach more than player anyway. The way he tells it, he learned to read and write with Don Balón magazine, Marca guidebooks and football stickers. He was, he said, a bit of afriki: an anorak, a geek. He played PC Futbol, Spain’s Championship Manager with Michael Robinson on the box. He played at coach in his teams too, noting lineups, formations and drills, a collective view that partly got in the way of his individual development. He argued with coaches and admits he could be “unbearable” and a “pain in the arse”. He got two degrees – sports science and journalism – and never quite made playing his everything. He got his coaching badge at 19.He coached inTercerain Vigo, took Celta’s under-19s in 2021 and the second team the year after. When he reached the first team last season after eight years coaching in the academy, he was the second youngest manager inPrimera,behind Iñigo Pérez. He was younger than Aspas, his centre-forward and theclub’s best ever player. “It seems like I’m young but I’ve been around 20 years,” he says. The time at Madrid and Atlético shaped him, especially working under Abraham García, Fernando Torres’s mentor. But hisideas also came from Johan Cruyff. Above all they came from Celta, where he watchedEduardo Berizzo and Luis Enrique, had longconversations with Eduardo Coudet, and saw what the kids could do.On his first night in charge, Celta won 2-1 at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán. “This is the way we have to play,” Aspas said after. “Even if we lose, we have to play the way we know.” Aspas and his teammates got bored and increasingly irritable under Benítez, something irremediably broken. Fans had too, the identification lost. For the first time in 15 years, under Benítez, Celta fielded an XI without a single academy player. Giráldez was a liberation. He changed everything.The new coach trusted them, believed in them and had inculcated a footballing ideal already. He was closer to them but demanding. Hugo Sotelo says they have a love-hate relationship and Iglesias’s claim that Giráldez changed his life, calling him “the best coach I’ve ever had”, was about support too and the warmth was shared: “Borja is a man whodignifies this sport,” the coach said. As for the kids, he knew they could play, so they played. The only problem, he said, was the music in the dressing room.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Always watch Celta, even when they lose.They were beaten 4-3 by Barcelonaon Saturday and drew 2-2 with them earlier this season, as they did with Real Betis and Girona. They lost 3-2 at Osasuna. They scored 17 in four Copa del Rey games before getting knocked out 5-2 after extra time at the Bernabéu. Only two La Liga teams have conceded more; only four have scored more. They were beaten at home by Madrid and Atlético but out-shot both.“Celta play, Madrid win,” as one headline put it. Although it took a while, although they lost two in a row before this midweek – that 4-3 at Barcelona and 2-0 against Espanyol – those were their only defeats in 10, the control and assuredness increasing. Giráldez rightly said: “Survival was the objective. No one expected us to be fighting for Europe; this is something to be enjoyed.”View image in fullscreenBorja Iglesias is enjoying a purple patch in front of goal for Celta.Photograph: Octávio Passos/Getty ImagesSomething very real too after 3-0 victory over Villarreal. It was helped by a red card but beyond the points or the place in the table, the whole thing was a portrait of what Celta are, a picture of happiness. Of the 16 players Giráldez used, 10 are under 25, 11 played in the academy, and eight are Galicians, seven from the province. There was a goal each for three generations of youth-team products and Galicians: the 20-year-old Fer López got the first, the 32-year-old Iglesias – the heart of theCelta B Panda Team from where his nickname camebefore embarking on a career that has brought him back eight years later – got the second and departed to a standing ovation, embracing the 37-year-old Aspas and holding Giráldez in a long hug. And Aspas almost added an outrageous third immediately before scoring a penalty in the final minutes, the evening complete.At the end, as the gulls flew across from the Atlantic, someone handed Iglesias a Polaroid picture of his goal and 19,324 people put their arms around one another and sang. “I was at the academy when they were in Europe and the atmosphere was cool but I don’t think I’ve ever seen a communion like this,” Iglesias said. “We have to look after it, enjoy it and live it intensely.”PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona3357762Real Madrid3335723Atletico Madrid3329664Athletic Bilbao3324605Real Betis339546Villarreal3210527Celta Vigo331468Osasuna33-6449Mallorca33-74410Real Sociedad33-54211Rayo Vallecano33-74112Getafe3313913Espanyol32-63914Valencia33-123915Sevilla33-93716Girona33-123517Alaves33-113418Las Palmas33-153219Leganes33-193020Valladolid33-5716Explore more on these topicsCelta VigoLa LigaEuropean club footballRafael BenítezfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While the remaining four participants for May’s event are not yet finalised, the Guardian understands that the English trio of Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City have all held discussions about potentially taking part, as have other teams from different leagues around the world. The only European teams who will not be eligible to take part are the Champions League finalists.“Innovation is a priority within our club,” said Ajax’s technical director, Alex Kroes, on their inclusion. “World Sevens Football provides an exciting opportunity for our players to demonstrate their creativity and skill in a fast-paced format. We have a young and talented team with a lot of players from our own academy and we’re ready to compete fiercely.”Marc Skinner, Manchester United’s head coach, added: “This is a really exciting opportunity to be part of something new for the women’s game. Our only focus right now is on finishing the domestic season as strongly as possible in the WSL and the FA Cup; then we can travel to Portugal to enjoy what promises to be an entertaining three days of fast, fun, seven-a-side football.”The competition will be broadcast live by the streaming platform Dazn and, for each individual match, teams can name a squad of 14 players with rolling subs, and can take a squad of up to 25 players overall to the tournament, to enable significant squad rotation. Each is 30 minutes long with 15-minute halves. The new event is being funded by $100m of investment over a five-year period, backed by the US-based philanthropist Jennifer Mackesy, co-owner of the NWSL club Gotham FC.Many critics on social media have pointed to an already-congested women’s football calendar and the England head coach, Sarina Wiegman, has questioned whether there is room for this event in the schedule in the long-run. However, discussing the issue of player welfare on Thursday, the former England defender Anita Asante, who is an ambassador for World Sevens Football, said: “We wanted to centre the player welfare aspect in every decision that we made, regarding the format.“Having a bigger squad allows them to be able to manage those minutes, manage the load and allow multiple players to have playing opportunities. These clubs are professional clubs who have professional staff who manage their strength and conditioning. We also trust that they make good decisions for their players because fundamentally these are players for their clubs as well. The short format, it’s three days, it’s going to be less taxing than an actual Euros in the context of a tournament format for players who have already played obviously a whole season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While it’s a state of affairs some trophy-obsessed fans of more elite clubs would argue renders Palace’s 164-year existence a complete exercise in futility, the team from Selhurst Park have contested two FA Cup finals, only to come up short against Manchester United on both occasions. The most recentwas nine years agoin a Wembley showpiece largely remembered for the losing manager’stouchline body-poppingand the winning one being handed his P45 before his captain was presented with the trophy. And to think some people say the famous old competition has lost its magic, eh?After their team’s2-2 draw with Arsenalat the Emirates in Wednesday night’s snappily titled Don’t Get Knacked Because We All Have Bigger Fish To Fry derby, Palace fans are now free to start bricking themselves about the FA Cup semi against Aston Villa, a team whose most recent taste of major trophy success came 29 years ago in the Coca-Cola Cup. Before a match that both teams will consider eminently winnable, the atmosphere at Wembley come kick-off time on Saturday afternoon ought to be buoyant but will in truth be fraught by nerves, crippling anxiety and downright terror throughout the stands. “We’re very excited,” purred Palace manager Oliver Glasner after seeing his side use up two of their best goals of the season in an inconsequential draw. “I think everyone who is connected with Palace is very excited, but I think on the other side, it’s also important to stay calm.” To which the only obvious rejoinder is: “Good luck with that, Oliver.”Following Saturday’s semi-final, Wembley Way will be rebranded in the colours of Nottingham Forest and Manchester City, two clubs whose major trophy droughts date back 35 years and 11 months, respectively. Following an unexpectedly disastrous Premier League campaign in which they currently sit one point ahead of a Forest side who are having an unexpectedly brilliant one, City will go into their seventh semi-final under Pep Guardiola as the bookies’ favourites, with most football romantics aside from their own fans (and those of Derby County, Leicester City and Notts County) fervently hoping they lose.QUOTE OF THE DAY“He had to lock himself in the changing room, fearing for his life.

You’re not actually a human. You’re not a person. You don’t have a mum, a dad, a partner who’s going to read that sort of stuff. It’s very bizarre.“It affects my mumway more than it affects me. Whereas for me, I’ve become pretty numb to it. The only reason I call it out is that I have a lot of young kids who follow me, and I don’t want them to think that the reason I’m breaking the British record, or I’m fast, is because I starve myself to do it or that skinny means fast.”However, McColgan admitted that she was stunned that people who hadn’t hidden their identities were also prepared to abuse her.“I always find it bizarre when people have their name and face on there and they’re fully brazen,” she said. “One woman actually said something about my body shape, who was a teacher, and she had a young girl in her profile picture. So I wrote to her to say that the fact that you are openly writing this on my page as a school teacher with a daughter is a disgrace. And then obviously they vanish. They delete it because they panic.“There was one guy who had three young daughters, and one of the comments he made was quite sexualized. I wrote back to him saying: ‘Could you imagine someone saying this to your daughters?’ They don’t think.”But despite all the abuse, McColgan insisted that she would stay on platforms such as Instagram.View image in fullscreenEilish McColgan after winning the 10,000m final at the Commonwealth Games in 2022.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian“Someone said to me, you should just come off social media,” she said. “But would you tell kids that if they get bullied at school to stop going? Or to stop doing what they enjoy because one person is ruining it for you? Why should I change what I do just because of somebody that’s irrelevant for me? That is my mindset.“I’ve had a couple of people message me saying they get bullied at school because of the way they look, so it’s helped them,” added McColgan, whose non-profitGiving Back to Trackhelps young athletes. “It gives them a little bit more confidence to fight their corner. So that’s really the only reason I do call it out.“I would have loved to have been able to pop Kelly Holmes a message. But it’s also trying to get it across to the next generation that in order to get longevity in your career, your utmost priority is looking after your body. And it doesn’t matter what these people online think. They’re not your family, they’re not your friends, they’re people who are irrelevant.”McColgan has set her sights on beating her mum’s personal best of 2hr 26min 52sec in what will be her debut marathon. In reality she may run several minutes quicker, although she admits she is nervous about running the distance for the first time. “I’m absolutely bricking it,” she said. “I’ve never been this scared. It’s just a complete unknown. I’ve run 21 miles in training. We’ve never got anywhere near 26, so what happens after 20 miles? I don’t know, but there’s 55,000 other people on the start line all thinking the exact same thing.“I’m super nervous, but there’s really an overriding feeling of excitement.

Despite being in Madrid this week to promote the release of his new Netflix docuseries, Alcaraz was absent from the practice courts in the first four days of the tournament.On Thursday, he confirmed his withdrawal, explaining that medical tests after the Barcelona final had further revealed a hamstring injury in his left leg.“I also noticed an issue in my left leg when I had tests on Tuesday,” said Alcaraz. “I’ve been waiting, talking with my team, with the doctors, to see if I’d be able to play in good condition and without a job here in Madrid. I’ve done everything possible, everything in my power to make that happen, but things haven’t improved As you all suspected, because I can’t train these days for the final in Barcelona, I have to work on my adductor and right leg, but much over the last few days.”Despite his frustration, Alcaraz believes his hamstring injury is not as severe as the right arm injury that forced him to withdraw during the Madrid Open last season and affected him up until the French Open last year.“I’m not really worried about it,” he said. “I believe it’s going to take one week, one week and a half, two weeks maximum, but I won’t have doubts about coming back and moving 100% again.”Explore more on these topicsCarlos AlcarazTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

She has been the best in the PWR [Premiership Women’s Rugby]. It gives us a chance to adapt and another chance to deal with a situation that might occur down the track so we’re more than confident to make that decision. Ellie will be back into it in June, there should be no restrictions when it comes to June.”Gloucester-Hartpury’s Sing will make her third start for her country as one of eight changes to the Red Roses’ starting XV from the sidethat defeated Scotland.A shuffle in the back row means the former captain Marlie Packer drops out of the matchday 23 with Maddie Feaunati moved to openside flanker. Alex Matthews comes in at No 8 and the captain, Zoe Aldcroft, the only England player to keep her starting shirt throughout the tournament,, plays at blindside.Quick GuideEngland v France teamsShowEngland:Sing; Dow, Jones, Heard, MacDonald; Harrison, Hunt; Botterman, Atkin-Davies, Muir, Talling, Ward, Aldcroft (c), Feunati, Matthews.Replacements:Cokayne, Clifford, Bern, Galligan, Burton, L Packer, Aitchison, Rowland.France:Bourgeois; Grisez, M Ménager, Vernier, Arbey; Arbez, Bourdon Sansus; Brosseau, Bigot, Khalfaoui, M Feleu (c), Fall-Raclot, Escudero, Champon, T Feleu.Replacements:Riffonneau, Mwayembe, Bernadou, Zago, Berthoumieu, Maka, Chambon, QueyroiWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The wing Claudia MacDonald also starts following a two-try performance against Scotland, with Abby Dow – who tops the tournament try-scoring chart on four alongside Kildunne and Ireland’s Aoife Wafer – completing the back three. That means no place for Jess Breach in the matchday squad but Zoe Harrison gets the nod at fly-half.Mitchell has been keen to experiment with different combinations this tournament. Asked if this is his strongest 23 he said: “We’ve obviously been planning with the end [Rugby World Cup] in mind and we’ve tried to create situations in the tournament that are going to be like the experience at the end of the year, so it requires a lot of patience from the girls.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, concerns have been raised over whether the competition can sustain 19 teams and exactly how much the state will pay for the entity dubbed the Perth Bears.The Australian Rugby League Commission, led by chair Peter V’landys, struck an in-principle agreement with WA premier Roger Cook on Wednesday for the inclusion of the Bears in the NRL in 2027. Thestate government is to provide tens of millions of dollarscovering infrastructure, pathways and a licence fee.Case for the defence proves Bulldogs have foundations in place for long-term NRL success | Nick TedeschiRead moreThe deal must be approved by existing NRL clubs and the Rugby League Players’ Association, before anexpanded men’s competition– which would grow to 18 teams in 2027 before PNG joins one year later – is pitched to broadcasters for a new media rights agreement beginning in 2028 that will be worth billions of dollars to the code.Rugby league sources on Thursday confirmed the existence of the deal, however Cook – speaking alongside prime minister Anthony Albanese in Perth – said conversations were “positive” but he had yet to receive a formal response from the NRL.“I assume they have a range of processes they need to go through to consider anything in relation to these conversations,” Cook said.

Former player and board member Billy Moore told AAP, “this is the greatest day since the 1922 grand final.” Hornsby councillor Nathan Tilbury posted on Facebook saying “Forget the federal election, this is the biggest and best news of the day!”Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy ruled himself out of the running for the Bears’ job on Thursday, but warned the game needed to work hard to ensure there is enough talent to ensure a high-quality product.“There are more kids playing soccer and AFL, they see probably the rugby codes with [the risk of] head knocks,” Bellamy said. “It’s really important that we do work hard to increase our junior numbers in rugby league everywhere but, like I say, that’s probably out of my jurisdiction, so I’ll leave that to the hierarchy.”The ARLC has already taken steps to help improve the standard of players ahead of the inclusion of a Port Moresby franchise in 2028. Two PNG pathway players can be signed by other NRL clubs outside the ordinary 30-person roster.Negotiations around the Perth franchise have been tense, and discussions between a Bears consortium and the ARLC ended last year with disputes over a licence fee. That entity pitched a Perth-based franchise leveraging the Bears’ history, and included two regular season games in Sydney.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Answering your NFL questionsRead our NFL Draft predictionsTom LutzThu 24 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 16.02 EDTShareWhat time does theNFLdraft begin?The first round of this year’s draft starts at 8pm ET on Thursday. But that’s just the start because this is a long, drawn out process that some cynics – not us! – would say is designed to maximise TV and online advertising. The second and third rounds start on Friday at 7pm ET, while the session for the fourth to seventh rounds starts on Saturday at 12pm ET. But if you only have time for one session, watch the first round – that’s when the really big names are picked.Where is the 2025 NFL draft held?The draft is held in different cities each year, often ones that are too cold too host theSuper Bowlin February and are given the draft as a consolation prize.Which brings us to this year’s host: the very cold (in winter) and very small Green Bay, home to one of the NFL’s most hallowed teams, thePackers. Green Bay has a population of a little more than 100,000 and they could nearly all fit into the Packers’ Lambeau Field, which has a capacity of about 80,000. The draft will take place outside the historic stadium. Bad news for fans: the weather doesn’t look great, unless you like drizzle and a chilly wind.What’s the order for this year’s draft?Teams are ordered based on their record the previous season, with the team with the worst record picking first in the first round and theSuper Bowl championspicking last, at No 32. This is supposed to help maintain parity, with the worst teams getting the best players out of college. But bad teams are bad for a reason and it can be hard to judge a player solely on their college career, so teams often get their picks wrong, although it can be years before a player’s true value can be fairly assessed. The Tennessee Titans have the No 1 pick this year. Teams can also trade picks, moving up the order if they see a player they really like. There will be 257 picks in this year’s draft so we won’t list the entire order here, butyou can find it here if you like.Which teams made the best picks over the past 10 years?It depends what you mean by best. For example, quarterbackJoe Burrowis an excellent player but it wasn’t a brilliant piece of strategy or scouting by theCincinnati Bengalswhen they picked him No 1 overall in 2020: anyone with a passing knowledge of football would have done the same in their position, if they needed a quarterback. However, most people would agree that theKansas City Chiefs’ decision to trade up to No 10 in the 2017 draft and getPatrick Mahomeswas the best move of the last decade. Mahomes wasn’t considered a sure-fire success, and plenty of other teams passed up the chance to get him, but he has gone on to win three Super Bowls, and is already one of thegreatest quarterbacks of all time.Who went No 1 in the draft last year?Caleb Williams was pickedNo 1 overall in 2024by theChicago Bears. The quarterback had an adequate first season but was outshone by the Washington Commanders’ Jayden Daniels, who was picked at No 2 and had one of thebest rookie quarterback seasons of all time.Who is expected to be the No 1 overall pick in 2025?Florida quarterback Cam Ward is generally considered likely to be the No 1 overall pick. He is the best available player at football’s most important position and the Titans, who are due to pick at No 1, are in need of a quarterback.Who are the best players in the NFL draft?While Ward will probably go No 1, he isn’t necessarily the best player: it’s just that the Titans need a quarterback and Ward is the best one available. Colorado’s Travis Hunter is considered the most talented player by most scouts. His wild athleticism means he is good enough to play on defense at cornerback or on offense at wide receiver, an ability that is incredibly rare in professional football. Some would counter that Hunter is a jack of all trades but a master of none. They would go for Abdul Carter, an elite pass rusher who should thrive in theNFL.What is the best website for mock drafts?Pretty much every website out there has a mock draft, and the Guardian is no exception. Although we have done things slightly differently and made various predictions this year. Anyway, they’re great.You can read them here.If not, Google is available.How to watch the draft?Obviously, you should follow it with the Guardian’s excellent liveblog which will belive here from 7pm on Thursday.

And Cam Wardisthe top quarterback prospect in the class. But the No 1 pick should be Hunter, the electrifying hybrid corner/receiver. Whether he can play both ways in the league is an open question, but wherever he lines up, Hunter will be a gamechanger at a premium position.OCTravis Hunter.I am not entirely sold on any of the quarterbacks in this class, so that’s that out the window. Instead, I would easily and happily turn the card in on football’s version of Babe Ruth or Shohei Ohtani: a guy who can play two crucial positions – cornerback and wide receiver – at an insanely high level. My comp for Hunter as a receiver is DeAndre Hopkins; my comp for him as a cornerback is Darius Slay. Think about how unprecedented that is in football history, and make the move.DFCam Ward, QB.This is the NFL draft, people. You get the top pick, you draft the best quarterback on the board – and this year they don’t come better than 6ft 2in, 219lb University of Miami senior, a Davey O’Brien award winner (for the nation’s top college QB) and Heisman Trophy finalist. It’s not just about stats with him; it’s theutter nonchalancewith which he piles them up.ALAbdul Carter, Edge.The chance to add an edge defender who draws comparisons to Micah Parsons is a phenomenal opportunity to transform Tennessee’s defense. The Titans should rethink their strategy at quarterback, and possibly wait to pick a new offensive cornerstone from next year’s richer talent pool while they have the chance to give their limp pass rush a huge boost.GSTravis Hunter wants to be the NFL’s Shohei Ohtani. Will anyone let him?Read moreThe best QB in the draft not called Cam Ward is ...Shedeur Sanders, Colorado. There is draft fatigue with Sanders. Jaxson Dart is bigger and stronger. Tyler Shough played in a more pro-ready system. Jalen Milroe is an athletic phenom, albeit one with serious accuracy issues. Sanders, by contrast, is a slight, point-guard-like QB who played in a wonky offense at Colorado. There is more Brock Purdy to his game than those who typically top the league’s MVP charts; Sanders will have to rely on smarts and timing to distribute the ball to playmakers rather than taking over games on his own. Still, Sanders has the makeup to be a solid starter in the right system.OCJaxson Dart, Ole Miss.Much like Oregon’s Bo Nix last year, Dart is being unfairly maligned for not succeeding in a pro-conversant system (untrue), but the route concepts are there. Dart led the FBS in touchdown passes of 20 or more air yards with 17, he’s efficient under pressure, he’s a very good runner, and he sees the field estimably at his best. With a few mechanical fixes, Dart hasNFLstarting potential.DFShedeur Sanders.AsI wrote, the scouts have the wrong idea about him. Set his luxury accessories aside, and what you’re left with is a QB who was privy to some of the game’s best tutors – not least the hall of fame cornerback he calls Dad – and made the grade while turning around two stagnant programs. With Sanders falling down draft boards as the big day approaches, someone’s in for a bargain.ALJaxson Dart.Reliability, accuracy at all levels and unflappability are key traits in the Ole Miss quarterback’s back pocket. Handily for certain head coaches, Dart’s processing of the field stood out among his rivals in the past two seasons. He gets the ball where it needs to be regardless of the defensive look.GSShould Travis Hunter be a two-way player?He should try! Hunter is a once-in-a-franchise type player who can be the cornerstone of an offense or defense. Playing both ways in the league, physically and mentally, may be too big an ask. But he’s done it his entire career, and should be given a shot to see if he can break the mold. If he’s forced to play one side, receiver is probably where he will land.OCIt depends on your definition of “two-way.” Richard Sherman and Dick LeBeau, both of whom know a great deal more about football than I do,have told me independentlythat they see Hunter’s ideal NFL path as a primary cornerback with secondary receiver reps. That’s similar to what Deion Sanders, his college coach,did with the Dallas Cowboys in 1996. But Hunter will be more valuable to his team as a defender.DFWhy not? The NFL grind is a whole lot tougher than college. Even aside from the physical aspect, the prospect of having to attend twice the number of daily meetings would do anyone’s head in, regardless of the industry. But if Hunter has the patience to sit through all that and stamina left for double the practice snaps, why deny him his Sunday rewards?ALNFL scouting is broken. Colorado’s Shedeur Sanders is all the proof you need | Andrew LawrenceRead moreDefinitely. The NFL needs a shot in the arm to shut down the asinine narrative that the sport is scripted by the higher ups. Hunter showing up on both sides of the ball would be a very welcome distraction from the whining.GSThis will be a good draft for ...Pass rushers. Whether you’re looking for edge defenders or interior, upfield rushers, the draft is flooded. There are roughly 50 pass rushers, inside and on the edge, whoshouldbe drafted this year, an uncommon amount of depth at a pair of essential positions. If the Eagles’ Super Bowl victory reminded teams of anything, it was that the smoothest path to contention is an overwhelming four-man pass rush. This year, those players will fly off the board early and often.OCAnyone needing an interior defensive lineman.It’s not just the quantity and the quality of this interior defensive line class – which is the best I’ve seen in a very long time. It’s also the variety of talent, which perfectly matches what NFL defensive coaches want to do with their defensive fronts. Multi-gap disruption is the way to go, and you can get everything from twitchy athletic movers to 340-pound brick buildings capable of not only soaking up double teams, but also jumping a gap or two with shocking agility.DFThe O-line.Teams looking to fix or bolster their protection have plenty of solid options to choose from. At offensive tackle alone, you’ve got LSU’s Will Campbell (a fierce run blocker), Texas’ Kelvin Banks Jr (an agile pass protector who can play guard as well) and Ohio State’s Josh Simmons (an extraordinarily effective obstacle who anchored the Buckeyes’ national title-winning team).ALThe draft as spectacle.The decision to take the show to Lambeau Field will bring a welcome grounding in history for the megachurch of hype. Green Bay’s charm will be front and centre with the town revelling in its moment in the spotlight. It’s a huge long shot, but maybe it’s a warmup for eventually hosting a Super Bowl?GSView image in fullscreenThe 49ers are in need of a good draft after entering a rebuild.Photograph: John Angelillo/UPI/REX/ShutterstockTeam most in need of a good draft …The New York Giants.General manager Joe Schoen and head coach Brian Daboll are walking into draft night on the hot seat, and desperation forces teams to do strange things. The duo must come up with a viable long-term answer at quarterback, and they have plenty of holes to plug elsewhere too. Fortunately, they are in an ideal spot to move around the board to shore up concerns along their offensive and defensive lines and take a swing at a project quarterback. But if they can’t unearth a handful of starters, they will be looking for new jobs by the new year.OCThe San Francisco 49ers.For the second time in the John Lynch/Kyle Shanahan era (which began in 2017),the 49ers have cleaned out the cupboards in a personnel sensewith a refit in mind. The last time they did so was 2021, and they managed to rebuild pretty impressively. Now, it’s time to replace all the guys they’ve cast aside, and the good news is that they have11 picks in the 2025 draft(including four in the top 100) with which to do so. The bad news is that if a high rate of those picks don’t hit, it could be a tough season for a franchise that has Super Bowl expectations as the default.DFThe New England Patriots.They know they’ve got a franchise quarterback in Drake Maye and now they’ve got Mike Vrabel back to reinstitute the Patriot Way. The young Patriots showed flashes of potential last year and are poised for a big leap in 2025 if they can just add on a few more playmakers. (They’ll get nine cracks to try in this year’s draft.)ALThe New Orleans Saints.They have to draft well to give their new head coach, Kellen Moore, a shot at success. A fresh running back to eventually replace Alvin Kamara, now in his ninth season, a receiver and an offensive lineman are all spots needing attention. Failure to provide Moore with the right tools would be very disappointing for an already frustrated fanbase.GSBuilt different: Is the 6XL, 464lb Desmond Watson too large for the NFL?Read moreA lower-round gem to watch is ...Justin Walley, CB, Minnesota.In a weak cornerback class, Walley could be the steal of the draft. He is currently No 224 on the consensus board, but will make a team happy if he lasts until day three. Whalley is a tough, physical, experienced cornerback who is as smart and aggressive as any of the top corners this season. He is a high-IQ player who has thrived in every form of technique and coverage, a level of versatility lacking elsewhere in this class. Walley lacks prototypical size, but he does the little things that teams covet in starting corners.OCWillie Lampkin, center, North Carolina.I have no idea what NFL teams think of Lampkin, and it may be that those same teams aren’t so sure, either. What I do know is that at 5ft 11in and 279lb, Lampkin was a stellar right guard for North Carolina last season – he’ll be a center in the NFL, because his lack of size is less of an issue. Lampkin is light on his feet when pass-protecting, and of all the offensive line prospects I’ve studied this year, nobody else physically displaced more opponents than Lampkin did. Someone will really have to bet on the tape over the measurables here. In Lampkin’s case,the tape revealsa player who is worth the risk.DFTyler Shough, QB, Louisville.Pronouncedshuck(like corn), Shough is 25, recently married and started his college career at Oregon backing up Justin Herbert – the Los Angeles Chargers’ sixth-year starter. The major red flag with him is his injury history: he’s broken his left leg and his collarbone twice. (A minor red flag isthis air-mailed pass attempthe made at the combine that has unfortunately gone viral.) Throughout, he’s shown an uncanny knack for bouncing back with strong performances. In the right system and fitness regimen, Shough could be a star. Coming out of high school, he was a sought-after recruit behind Trevor Lawrence and Justin Fields.ALCam Skattebo, RB, Arizona State.He thrilled for the Sun Devils to such an extent he entered the Heisman conversation last season when he racked up 1,711 rushing yards and 605 receiving from 13 games, yet he’s projected to land somewhere in the fourth round. He is only 5ft 9in and his 40-yard dash time of 4.65 seconds from a private workout is dead last when compared to other rushers at the combine. However, the tape shows a faster “game speed” for Skattebo. His low center of gravity allows him to stay balanced when hit to help churn for heaps of extra yardage after contact.GSThe team who drafted best last year were ...The Los Angeles Ramscompletely remade their defense with last season’s haul. They doubled down on their defensive front by grabbing Jared Verse and Braden Fiske. They also added plenty of supplementary pieces, too. Safety Kam Kinchens and linebacker Omar Speights helped solidify the spine of a young group. The Rams squeezed out 7,649 snaps from their rookies, by far the fattest mark in the league. They landed an impact piece (Verse), three solid starters (Fiske, Kinchens and Speights) and complementary depth pieces. For a team that has consistently bailed on the draft, it’s hard to do better than that.OCThe Washington Commanders.Yes, it helps when you lead with the second overall pick in a draft with Jayden Daniels, who may have hadthe greatest rookie quarterback season ever. But Daniels wasn’t the only rookie who helped the Commanders move from 4-13 in 2023 to 12-5 and an NFC Championship game berth in 2024. Michigan’s Mike Sainristil was a slot-only cornerback at Michigan, but the second-rounder became by far the team’s best outside cornerback when the need arose. There’s a lot of depth as well, especially second-round interior defensive lineman Jer’Zhan “Johnny” Newton, who started to come on late in the season when healthy.DFThe Arizona Cardinalscertainly made the most of their draft-leading 12 picks last year. Marvin Harrison Jr immediately boosted the Cardinals’ receiving corps and became Kyler Murray’s go-to guy. Darius Robinson was a solid addition to the defensive line. Max Melton, the fourth player ever to be drafted from Rutgers, had a quietly good first year in the Cardinals defensive secondary. And Dadrion Taylor-Demerson turned out to be an impressive playmaker at safety after Arizona scooped him up in the fourth round from Texas Tech. It all came together in a year that saw the Cardinals go from four wins in 2023 to doubling that and playing teams close all season – especially those in their division.ALThe Los Angeles Rams.Teams can spend years in the wilderness trying to fill the hole left by a retired legend. The Rams just needed a month by the pool to find the right answers in Verse and Fiske. The former claimed defensive rookie of the year honours and the latter led the team in sacks with 8.5. Succession planning par excellence.GSView image in fullscreenCam Ward is expected to go No 1 overall.Photograph: George Walker IV/APThe top 10 will be* ...1)Tennessee Titans, Cam Ward, QB, Miami2) Cleveland Browns, Travis Hunter, CB/WR, Colorado3) New York Giants, Abdul Carter, Edge, Penn State4) New England Patriots, Armand Membou, OT, Missouri5) Jacksonville Jaguars, Tetairoa McMillan, WR, Arizona6) Las Vegas Raiders, Ashton Jeanty, RB, Boise State7) New York Jets, Mason Graham, DL, Michigan8) Carolina Panthers, Jalon Walker, Edge, Georgia9) New Orleans Saints, Will Campbell, OT, LSU10) Chicago Bears, Colston Loveland, TE, MichiganOC----1) Tennessee Titans, Cam Ward, QB, Miami2) Cleveland Browns, Abdul Carter, Edge, Penn State3) New York Giants, Travis Hunter, CB/WR, Colorado4) New England Patriots, Will Campbell, OT, LSU5) Jacksonville Jaguars, Tyler Warren, TE, Penn State6) Las Vegas Raiders, Ashton Jeanty, RB, Boise State7) New York Jets, Jahdae Barron, CB, Texas8) Carolina Panthers, Tetairoa McMillan, WR, Arizona9) New Orleans Saints, Mason Graham, DT, Michigan10) Chicago Bears, Mike Green, Edge, MarshallDF----1) Tennessee Titans, Cam Ward, QB, Miami2) Cleveland Browns, Travis Hunter, CB/WR, Colorado3) New York Giants, Abdul Carter, Edge, Penn State4) New England Patriots, Will Campbell, OT, LSU5) Las Vegas Raiders, Shedeur Sanders, QB, Colorado6) Carolina Panthers, Tetairoa McMillan, WR, Arizona7) Jacksonville Jaguars, Mason Graham, DT, Michigan8) New York Jets, Kelvin Banks Jr, OT, Texas9) Chicago Bears, Ashton Jeanty, RB, Boise State10) New Orleans Saints, Mike Green, Edge, MarshallAL----1) Tennessee Titans, Cam Ward, QB, Miami2) Cleveland Browns, Shedeur Sanders, QB, Colorado3) New York Giants, Travis Hunter, WR/CB, Colorado4) New England Patriots, Abdul Carter, edge, Penn State5) Jacksonville Jaguars, Mason Graham, DT, Michigan6) Las Vegas Raiders, Ashton Jeanty, RB, Boise State7) New York Jets, Tyler Warren, TE, Penn State8) Carolina Panthers, Jalon Walker, Edge, Georgia9) New Orleans Saints, Will Campbell, offensive tackle, LSU10) Chicago Bears, Omarion Hampton, RB, North CarolinaGS----* This is what our writers think the order will be, rather than what they think itshouldbe.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsCollege footballCollege sportsTennessee TitansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m not going to act on something that will have a profound impact on every single child in the country without making sure that the evidence supports it – but I am investing in [researching] the evidence,” he said.Kyle added on Thursday that the newOfcomcodes should be a “watershed moment” that turned the tide on “toxic experiences on these platforms”.“Growing up in the digital age should mean children can reap the immense benefits of the online world safely, but in recent years too many young people have been exposed to lawless, poisonous environments online which we know can lead to real and sometimes fatal consequences. This cannot continue,” he added.Online platforms will be required to suppress the spread of harmful content, such as violent, hateful or abusive material and online bullying. More seriously harmful content, including that relating to suicide, self-harm and eating disorders, will need to be kept off children’s feeds entirely, as will pornography.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It fell back slightly to $12.30 in early trading on Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap.Critics slam deregulation of crypto as Trump family expands its footprint in industryRead moreDespite the sharp rise, the price of the president’s coin is far below the peak it hit shortly before his inauguration in January,when it soaredfrom about $6 to $75. The launch of coins for Trump and his wife, Melania, have prompted experts to accuse the pair of“shameful” conflicts of interest.The sudden jump in Trump’s meme coin on Wednesday came as investors had been expecting the start of a process that allows more original investors and insiders to cash out their holdings. This “unlock” usually leads to a price fall but the coin’s X account said this would be delayed by 90 days.Meme coins are digital tokens inspired by trends such as viral moments and have no inherent utility. They typically fall in value after an initial strong rally.Last year, the “hawk tuah girl” Haliey Welch, made famous online by a viral video,launched a meme cointhat was worth $490m in December but it quickly plummeted in value and is now worth just $2.9m.While Trump was sceptical of cryptocurrency in his first administration, he has since called himself the “crypto president” and promised to support growth in the sector.In March, he hired the venture capitalist David Sacks to act as an artificial intelligence and crypto tsar, as well as establishing a national stockpile of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.The Trumps have become actively involved in the cryptocurrency sector. The first lady also launched a meme coin in January, and last year the president and his three sons started a crypto platform called World Liberty Financial.Meanwhile, Trump Media and Technology Group, where the president is a majority shareholder, announced plans last month to work with the trading operation Crypto.com to provide investment products linked to crypto.This month the US justice department said it would disband a unit dedicated toinvestigating cryptocurrency-related fraud, as oversight in the digital assets sector began to loosen.The deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said the department would no longer pursue litigation or enforcement actions that had “the effect of superimposing regulatory frameworks on digital assets while President Trump’s actual regulators do this work outside the punitive criminal justice framework”.The deregulation has prompted influential congressional Democrats and watchdogsto warn about the growing risks to investors and the economyposed by multiple deregulatory crypto actions at federal agencies.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsE-commerceInternetMelania TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

This isthe company’s first earnings report sinceDonald Trumpleviedtariffson trade partners around the world.Despite the upheaval for Alphabet, it exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, reporting revenue of $90.23bn, up 12% since the same time last year, and $2.81 in earnings per share. Analysts had projected first quarter revenue of $89.2bn and earnings of $2.01 per share,according to consensus estimates. The global tariffs were not expected to create much of an impact for Alphabet, since they were mostly instituted after the end of the quarter.Alphabet’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, said the first quarter results “reflect healthy growth and momentum across the business” and that underpinning this growth is the company’s emphasis on artificial intelligence.Alphabet’s stock jumped more than 7% in after hours trading.Alphabet is one of the world’s most valuable companies, worth nearly $2trn. But economic headwinds that include high tariffs and possible trade wars, along with various legal battles brought by governments worldwide, could eventually hit the tech behemoth.Google is “not immune to the macro environment”, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. He added that Google’s ads business could be effected by Trump’s decision to end the de minimis trade loophole on 2 May, which allows for duty-free shipments to the US for items less than $800. But, Schindler said, “we have a lot of experience in managing through uncertain times.”Earlier this week,Google returned to court in Washington DC for theconclusion of a lawsuitbrought by the US Department of Justice. The government sued Google in 2020 alleging it acted illegally to maintain a monopoly of the search engine market. The justice departmentwon that caseafter a trial last year and now the two parties are in court again to decide whether Google will be forced to break off parts of its company, including its Chrome browser.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Google has said it will also appeal the “adverse” portion of this ruling.Advertising is Google’s core business, making up about 75% of its total revenue, according toStatista. That number has fallen 13% since 2017 though, and the company says it’s working on shifting its ads business to emphasize more artificial intelligence tools and capabilities for marketers.Artificial intelligenceis a huge growth area for Alphabet, as it faces competition from companies such as Microsoft, OpenAI and China’s DeepSeek. In itslast earnings reportin February, Alphabet said it planned to spend $75bn on capital expenditures in 2025, which will mostly be used to expand its AI capabilities and infrastructure.Investors have been looking at how the company is integrating the technology into its suite of services, including Google Search, YouTube and Google Cloud.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Blue Prince, Botany Manor and Layers of Fear spring to mind. The manor as a site of danger, supernatural peril, untrustworthy architecture – perfect, surely, for an unsettling experience. Or even a silly experience in unsettling surroundings.Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3 promises much in its title. It presents initially as a high-concept dinosaur-hunting adventure in spooky house run by a sinister old mogul, then quickly reveals to the player that it knows it is a video game. A broken video game, that is, and it is up to us to patch it as we go.The player explores the mansion through text and puzzle vignettes, pushing the limits on every scenario in the hopes of finding bugs and glitches, ultimately in the hope of defying the wishes of the unseen developers and “finishing” the game themself. This is a big concept, but the game seems to be interested in telling us its ideas rather than showing them to us – or demonstrating them within the play itself.The combat system through which our butch, confused protagonist operates is a clever little game of match three, the rules of which bend and flex depending on what he is fighting. Sometimes it is a dinosaur with a gun. Sometimes it is a tripwire, sometimes it is a legion of clones – sometimes his own clone. Sometimes it is talking vegetables. Sometimes a dinosaur in a wig. The silliness is one note and becomes flat quickly, saved only by the pleasing nature of the puzzles.Still, in order to have an effective game of match three – or, frankly, Candy Crush – you have to use high-contrast colours to make it kinder on the player. There were rounds when I played in which the symbols were really difficult to differentiate, which interrupted the otherwise pleasing flow. This visual issue is not limited to the puzzles: the entire colour palette of this game is muddy. It neither commits to the gothic nor leans full chaos.The same issues applies to the text. The game is text based, but the dialogue and descriptive writing are as muddy as the visuals. The jokes are fine, though they aim to be subversive and shocking (dinosaur romance being a recurring gag). However, the game being about gameplay and game development means that much of the descriptions are couched in jargon. Discussions of files and version history are beyond inside baseball. So if you are a seasoned enough gamer to be up to speed with the meta language, surely you don’t need swearwords to be starred out. Surely we were all laughing atdinosaur romancefive years ago. The writing is so close to great. It just needed to be sharper.View image in fullscreenText-based gameplay in Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3.Photograph: Strange ScaffoldThe art style is sketchy, but not in a way that evokes a deliberate aesthetic. There are times in which reality is said, by the text, to be bending and glitching. There are moments in which we disappear into voids and exit the world. There is even a somewhat climactic moment in which we enter the internet. Still, the visuals pull their punches. These strange occurrences can be evoked with drawings and don’t require flashy graphics. I recognise the illustrative style is deliberate but the game would have been better served by even a little more playfulness, or even intentionality, in the art style. Two moments did make me laugh – one involving some unexpected clowns, the other, pets – when the visual style actually did move into the meta and demonstrate some of what the game tells us it is about.I wanted to love this game. On paper it is outrageous. Strange Scaffold, the developer, is known for the weird – notablyClickholding, which is sinister, experimental and truly queries what a game is in its execution (there is a lot of clicking, and being watched in the action of clicking). Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3 certainly is creepy, and set in a mansion, and does have dinosaurs and some really satisfying puzzles. It also has some great ideas and isn’t quite a failed experiment. While it doesn’t bend reality in the way that it seems to want to, it aims high, and if the player can manage the places where the aesthetic falls short, they’ll have a great time. They might even meet a nice, blond dinosaur they can take home with them.Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3 is out now, £15.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPCPuzzle gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s time to break up the companyCourtney C RadschTwo recent US cases have found the search giant is functioning as an illegal monopoly. This should be a turning pointThu 24 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 08.25 EDTShareIn less than a year, US courts have ruled that the world’s most powerful tech company broke the law – twice.In August,a federal judge in Washington ruledthat Google illegally maintained its search monopoly by locking up defaults on browsers and devices. InApril, a federal judgein Virginia found that Google illegally monopolized the digital advertising market, manipulating auctions, restricting and stifling competitors. These two rulings, the most significant antitrust wins against a tech giant in decades, should be a turning point in the digital economy.The rulings against Google’s illegal monopoly in digital advertising offer a once-in-a-generation chance to redesign the infrastructure of surveillance that underpins Google’s ill-gotten dominance. But if regulators settle for symbolic fines or behavioral tweaks, it will do nothing to structurally reform the business model and incentives that underpin Google’s illegal dominance. In a three-week hearing that began this week,the US justice department is urging a judgeto break up the company. Whether we seize this moment to break up these concentrations of power will shape the future of markets, media and democratic governance.Google is emblematic of the platform economy in which we now live. The Silicon Valley corporation and its platform brethren provide core infrastructure – for advertising, for information access, for the economy at large. Google’s control of the search ecosystem, from its Chrome browser and Android operating system to its dominance in digital advertising and search, gives it unrivaled power over who gets heard and who gets paid. That power has stifled competition,undermined journalismand distorted the digital economy.The courts have now recognized what myfellow criticshave arguedfor years and whatregulatorsaround the worldhave similarly determined: Google illegally leverages its dominance in one market to reinforce its control in another.As addressed in the ad tech case, Google manipulated auctions and structured its business to advantage its own services at the expense of publishers and rivals, turning its ad exchange into what one employee called an “authoritarian intermediary”. As a result of its illegal monopoly, and by its own estimates, Google pockets on average more than 30% of the advertising dollars that flow through its digital advertising technology products; in some transactions and with certain publishers and advertisers, it takes far more.As discussed inthe search case, Google paid billions annually to be the default search engine on devices and browsers, effectively shutting out competitors and securing its control of 90% of the search market. And Google is now usingthe data generatedthroughout these products and its monopoly profits to secure its dominance in AI.Regulators around the world have converged on similar verdicts and would like to see structural changes, though they seem to have been waiting to see what happened in the US cases. In 2023, the European Commissionconcludedthat only divestiture could remedy Google’s ad tech conflicts of interest. Googleoffered to sell its AdX exchange, but European publishers and regulators rejected the move as insufficient. In the UK, Google is nowfacinga £5bn class-action lawsuit for abusing its search dominance along with acompetition strategic market statusinvestigation, which could result in structural or behavioral remedies.These global actions reflect a growing consensus: Google’s power is infrastructural and self-reinforcing. It controls the tools that decide what we know, what we see and who profits. The implications are especially acute for journalism, which has been hollowed out by Google’s ad market manipulation and search favoritism. In an era ofgenerative AI, where foundation models are trained on the open web and commodify news content without compensation, this market power becomes even more perfidious.Meaningful remedies require structural separation supported by behavioral changes to prevent future anticompetitive behaviors, including in the market for artificial intelligence. First, Google should be required to divest parts of its ad tech stack, spin off Chrome and ensure interoperability. Vertical integration has allowed it to dominateevery layer of digital advertising, from the tools publishers use to the auctions that determine ad placement. Breaking up that stack would create space for competition and innovation.Second, regulators should enforce interoperability and transparency. Let competitors have access to or build on Google’s core infrastructure. Let users choose and switch search engines and browsers easily, enabling them to take their data and easily shift providers. RequireGoogleto disclose how it trains its AI models and how it uses publisher content.Third,global coordinationshould be built into enforcement. Antitrust remedies must be aligned across jurisdictions to prevent regulatory arbitrage and make retaliatory American actions more difficult. The US cases should embolden regulators elsewhere to act swiftly.Finally, we must recognize that these antitrust cases are not just about prices or innovation. They are about power. Who sets the rules for how knowledge circulates? Who profits from public discourse? Who benefits from the infrastructure of the modern economy? If we allow Google to keep its hydra-headed corporation intact, the same dynamics will replicate themselves under the guise of AI innovation.The courts have shown that Google broke the law. Now, governments must show that the law still has teeth. That means structural remedies, not settlements. Transformation, not tinkering.If we fail to act now, we may not get another chance.Dr Courtney C Radsch is director of the Center for Journalism and Liberty at Open Markets InstituteExplore more on these topicsGoogleOpinionLaw (US)Search enginesAlphabetcommentShareReuse this content"

But as Americans turn against the idea, the party is dividedThu 24 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 13.12 EDTShare“Iam a gay woman who is moderately pro-choice – I know that there are some people in this room who don’t believe that my marriage should have been legal,” the rightwing impresario Bari Weisstolda Federalist Society gathering in 2023. “And that’s OK. Because we’re all Americans who want lower taxes.”The assembled conservatives guffawed at hearing the quiet part out loud: in this case, the admission that tax cuts for the rich have been the glue holding the US conservative movement together.And yet, less than two years after Weiss’s speech, the epoxy seems to be less sticky.In recent weeks, polls have shown Republican voters becoming far more skeptical of across-the-board tax reduction proposals. Reflecting that shift, GOP lawmakers are now trial-ballooning a proposal to increase some taxes on the wealthy. Some Maga voices are attempting to articulate a Republican-leaning, tax-cut version of Democrats’ traditional redistributionist rhetoric, arguing that higher taxes on millionaires should finance bigger tax cuts for the working class.Republican leaders are responding with the previously unthinkable: proposals to raise some taxes on the richAll of this has the Washington swamp’s old-guard Republicans in a panic; one longtime anti-tax leaderinsistedthat “there are traitors inside the Trump White House,” and anotherdeclared: “This is a potential crisis in the party – it sounds like Bernie Sanders economics.”So what happened? Why is the anti-tax argument losing its unifying power amongRepublicans?As the Lever’s new investigative audio seriesTax Revoltdetails, the answer may lie in that movement’s key revelation a half-century ago.The Santa Claus theory of tax cutsIn the mid-1970s, the Republican party was adrift, demoralized and divided amid both the post-Watergate backlash and the Republican president Gerald Ford’sattempt to raise taxesin pursuit of halting inflation and plugging federal budget holes. A young journalist named Jude Wanniski had an epiphany when at a lunch meeting, he watched the economist Arthur Laffer draw a curve on anapkinto argue to the Ford staffers Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld that cutting taxes could raise companies’ revenues.Two years later, Wanniski penned agrand unifying“Santa Claus Theory”, arguing that Republicans had “continued to play Scrooge, carping against increased spending without ever offering the obvious alternative”: tax reduction.He concluded: “Republicans, traditionally the party of income growth, should be the Santa Claus of tax reduction,” offering it as a supposed gift to Americans – and understand that “the first rule of successful politics is Never Shoot Santa Claus.”It was a revelation for a new generation of conservatives seeking to create a sunnier, more optimistic image for the GOP in the wake of Barry Goldwater’s cranky campaign and Richard Nixon’s downfall. Younger, more telegenic Republican leaders such as Representative Jack Kemp passed the essay around to colleagues, urging them to reimagine tax cuts not solely as a means to demonize government, but also as a way to court the working class with promises of life-bettering benefits.The dual message of so-called “supply-side economics” soon found its Santa Claus in the anti-tax governor turned anti-tax presidentRonald Reagan.“As government’s hunger for ever more revenues expanded, families saw taxes cut deeper and deeper into their paychecks,” Reagansaidbefore signing federal legislation to cut the top marginal tax rate. “This tax bill is less a reform than a revolution. Millions of working poor will be dropped from the tax rolls altogether, and families will get a long-overdue break with lower rates.”High-income tax cuts became the Republican party’s economic policy priority – and depicting such gifts to the wealthy as a boon to the working class became the GOP’s political strategy. Indeed,Reagan,George W BushandDonald Trumpeach championed tax cut legislation that delivered disproportionate benefits to the rich, and fueled an explosion of economic inequality – all while presenting their agenda as fight-for-the-little-guy populism.American women and children are in crisis. Republicans are about to make it worse | Karen DolanRead more“I promised we would pass a massive tax cut for the everyday, working American families who are the backbone and the heartbeat of our country,” Trump said on the eve of signing his$1.9tn tax cut billin 2017. “We’re just days away [from] keeping that promise and delivering a truly amazing victory for American families. We want to give you, the American people, a giant tax cut for Christmas.”This sales pitch became ubiquitous, and most political prognosticators assumed it would always be effective. Butsurvey datasuggests that most Americans have come to realize that while Tax Cut Santa Claus has been stashing big gifts under billionaires’ Christmas trees, he’s been leaving everyone else’s stockings empty.Whereas more than half of Americans approved of Reagan’s first major high-income tax cut proposal, only about a third of Americans approved of Bush’s similar tax proposal at the same time in his presidency. By the time Trump assumed office for his first term, less than a third of Americans supported his high-income tax cut initiative, knowing that such policies have failed to benefit them personallyandfailedto boostthe macroeconomy.‘The times are totally different’Fast forward to Trump’s second term. In previous eras, a new Republican president delivering more tax cuts for the wealthy would be a foregone conclusion under Wanniski’s Santa Claus theory. But that political hypothesis is now buckling under the weight of Trump’s new $4.5tn proposal to extend his 2017 tax cuts.In its current form, the White House’s initiative would delivermore than halfits benefits to the richest 10% of the country. Coupled with spending cuts and tariffs, Trump’s agenda would deliver a big income boost to the top 1%, while reducing the income of the bottom 80%, according to theCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities.As Trump’s legislative agenda hits Congress, opposition to more high-income tax cuts is strong not just among Democrats and independents, but also among Republicans. Morning Consultreportsthat 70% of GOP voters believe “the wealthiest Americans should pay higher taxes” – a whopping eight-point jump from six years ago. Moreover, “roughly 7 in 10 voters, including 2 in 3 Republicans, support proposals to raise taxes on earners making more than $400,000.”Republican leaders are responding with the previously unthinkable: proposals to raise some taxes on the rich. Indeed, Trump reportedlyfloatedthe idea and some GOP lawmakers areconsideringcreating anew top tax bracket.Republicans want corporate oligarchy. We need economic democracy | Rashida Tlaib and Michael A McCarthyRead moreThis has touched off an intraparty civil war. On one side are those who came of age in the Reagan and George W Bush epochs –Newt Gingrich,Sean Hannity, the formervice-president Mike Pence, Americans for Tax Reform’s Grover Norquist, the hedge-funder-turned-GOP senatorDave McCormick, and the Club for Growth’sStephen Moore. This old guard believes Republicans can still get away with depicting billionaire giveaways as populism, and vilifying tax hikes on the rich.“It’s vicious and full of envy. It’s a dumb idea. It’s bad for the economy,”saidNorquist, who spent the last quarter-century pressing Republicans to sign pledges to oppose all tax increases. “What happened when George Herbert Walker Bush raised the top rate? Let’s see, he lost the next election. We lost House and Senate seats and taxes went up and we had a recession.”On the other side are newfangled Maga voices – the former Mitt Romney stafferOren Cass,Vice-President JD Vance, the former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, andreportedlyTrump’s budget director,Russell Vought. They sense political peril in Republicans presenting themselves as populists while their party enriches billionaires and corporations.“We have to increase taxes on the wealthy,” Bannonsaidin December. This month he added that conservatives must prove “Republicans are not the country club Republicans”, which is “why it’s so important to not extend the tax cuts for the wealthy”.Of the old anti-tax crowd, Bannon added: “They’re arrogant and they refuse to look at the reality of the situation we’re in … The times are totally different.”‘Didn’t we already give them a break at the top?’Of course, we’ve been at these junctures before – moments when Republicans seemed to sense political vulnerability on taxes.In 1985, Reagan tried to deflect Democrats’ criticism of his tax policy byinsisting: “There is one group of losers in our tax plan – those individuals and corporations who are not paying their fair share or, for that matter, any share. These abuses cannot be tolerated.”Similarly, George W Bush momentarily pushed back against conservative aides pressing him to champion yet another tax cut for the rich. “Didn’t we already give them a break at the top?” he reportedlyasked.Ramming more tax cuts for the rich through Congress is the surest way for Trump to enrich himself, his family and the entire front row of his inaugurationBut the powerful anti-tax movement of those eras convinced both Republican presidents to plow forward. Reagan followed up his first tax cut by furtherreducingthe top tax rate, and Bush’s sequel to his first tax cut was slashing taxes oncorporate dividends.Trump could end up doing much the same. After all, ramming more tax cuts for the rich through Congress is the surest way for Trump to enrich himself, his family and the entirefront row of his inauguration.But this time around, the long-term politics of taxes are in flux. Running the same tax play would show a Republican president siding with oligarchs against the preferences of his own party’s rank and file that no longer buys the Santa Claus theory.That’s a new and unpredictable dynamic – one that may finally begin weakening the anti-tax movement’s grip on power in the years ahead.David Sirota is the founder and editor-in-chief ofthe Lever, an investigative news outlet.

Bill Maher did: who’ll be next?Emma BrockesAfter the apparent defanging of the once critical talkshow host, can the president get more stars onside? Some nuts will be tougher to crack than othersThu 24 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 21.48 EDTShareIf President Trump invited you to the White House, would you go? This is the question US hacks and other media personalities have been asking themselves since the inauguration, an American version of that self-flattering British perennial: when Buckingham Palace calls, will you be buying a fascinator to accept the OBE? In both cases, no matter how pluckily anti-establishment an individual may have been to that point, the answer is often a resounding: you bet!First, the rationalisations. In the US context, respect for the “office of the president”, for which there is no British equivalent that doesn’t prompt sniggering, is taken seriously enough that if the president calls, you don’t turn him down. There’s the standard argument in favour of engagement over boycott as a more constructive path to account-holding. And there is, for hacks, the perfectly reasonable rationale of pursuing the story. Ofcourse,you’re going to say yes if Trump calls. How could you not?The question is what happens next – and it’s a tricky one, isn’t it? One minute you’re hurtling towards Washington DC on the Acela Express train fully intending to speak truth to power, the next you’ve tripped on the rug and somehow become Albert Speer. It isn’t known what Bill Maher, the comedian, talkshow host and, until recently, fierce critic of Trump, thought he was up to last month when he accepted an invitation to dine with the president. But after the event, he treated us to alove letterto a man he found to be full of “good humour”, “generous”, “without animus”, as well as “gracious and measured” – almost as if successful politicians have the ability to turn on the charm. “Just for starters,” said Maher, “he laughs!” Like Garbo!Trump chose his target well, promoting the encounter as a robust piece of engagement with a foe – “a man who has been unjustifiably critical of anything, or anyone, TRUMP”,posted the presidentbefore the meeting – when in fact Maher’s been a creepy little men’s rights guy dispensing fat jokes and gags for some time that turn on the punchline “retarded”. He’s not Stephen Colbert or even Bill Burr, and it’s significant that Trump hasn’t, for example, taken up Jon Stewart’s offer to publicly debate him. Instead, this meeting, apparently“brokered” by Kid Rock, was another example of Trump’s ability to spot an easy mark. “That’s how it went down, make of it what you will,” said Maher whimsically, and what people havemade of itis that Bill Maher’s an idiot.‘I must say, mein Führer, I’m so thankful I came’: Larry David spoofs Bill Maher’s fawning White House visit with TrumpRead moreMaher is only the starkest example of a general softening since January of the cultural resistance to Trump. Remember when George Clooney wrote hisstirring little op-edfor the New York Times urging his fellow Americans to ditch Joe Biden? No follow-up piece since then, from George, or much in the way of public protest from any of the other celebrities who stumped for Kamala Harris. Clooney didshow upthis week on Gayle King’s CBS show, but that was to promote something, namely the “huge responsibility” of his new Broadway play about Edward R Murrow. Clooney, a man whose charm you imagine even Maher might find himself able to see through, responded toTrump’s mockery– “a second-rate movie ‘star’ and failed political pundit” – with the words, “My job is not to please the president of the United States. My job is to try and tell the truth”, before King moved the subject on to the colour of his hair.Anyway, back to Maher, who got his comeuppance. Whatever you do in life you really don’t want Larry David writing asatirical pieceabout you in the New York Times that includes the line: “Göring, with his mouth full, asked what was so funny, and Hitler said, ‘I was just telling him about the time my dog had diarrhea in the Reichstag’.” And it remains the case that pushback against Trump can be hard to get right.I say, let’s hear it for Rosie O’Donnell for making good on her threat to move countries if Trump got elected: she is now living in Ireland. Likewise for Ellen DeGeneres, whomoved to the Cotswolds, while we must assume that Cher, Sharon Stone, Miley Cyrus and Whoopi Goldberg are still waiting on a third quote from movers – but the three Yale professors who moved to Canada for the same reason havecopped some flakfor leaving the fight. You can’t win, perhaps. But watching Maher this week, there are better ways of losing.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionCelebrityGeorge ClooneyUS televisionTelevisionBill MahercommentShareReuse this content"

Your lookout spots species of birds typically found offshore. It now seems likely that you are approaching land, but it is impossible to know for sure until you see the coastline. If a US recession is land, the “birds” are already swooping into view. But these sightings offer no guarantees of what lies ahead, only probabilities.An inverted yield curve, when the long-term interest rate falls to or below the short-term rate, is commonly considered to be a predictor of recession. The 10-year bond ratedidfall belowthe three-month Treasury rate in March, although the two are now at about the same level. In any case, the yield curve does not actually tell us much. It simply reflects financial market expectations that the US Federal Reserve might cut short-term interest rates in the future, which in turn reflects expectations that economic activity might falter.Consumer confidence is a more direct indicator – particularly for predicting household demand. Two long-established measures of consumer confidence, conducted by theUniversity of Michiganandthe Conference Board, showed sharp declines in March, when Donald Trump’s tariff threats began to materialise. TheMichigan survey’s index of consumer sentiment, which has been falling since the start of the year,plummetedanother 11% on 11 April – well below theaveragein past recessions and thesecond-lowestlevel since records began in 1952.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’ssurvey of consumer expectationslikewise reports that households’ year-ahead expectations about their financial situations deteriorated in March. Similarly,business confidence– which guides firms’ hiring and investment decisions – “collapsed” on 4 April, not onlyin the USbutglobally, owing to uncertainty over Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs.In seeking to determine whether a recession is imminent, one might also look toprofessional forecasts, about 50 of which are aggregated by theBlue Chip Financial Forecasts. Two other sources that aggregate forecasts are theSurvey of Professional Forecastersand theWall Street Journal. On 17 April, the latter showed a mean forecast of 0.44% annualised for the first quarter, and much higher recession probabilities than at the start of the year. But the WSJ and SPF surveys are published only once a quarter and can become stale rapidly.In any case, what people say may be less meaningful than where they put their money. Prediction markets tripled the odds they placed on recession after 3 March, when Trump applied 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico, and 2 April, when he announced his “reciprocal tariffs.” As of 19 April, Polymarketshowsa 57% chance of recession in the coming year, and Kalshicomesin at 59% – about four times the level in a normal year (15%). If I had to look at only one type of estimate, it would probably be the prediction markets.Forecasting a possible recession is one thing; identifying when one has already begun is anotherForecasting a possible recession is one thing; identifying when one has already begun is another. Rather than telegraphing a downturn before it happens, theSahm rule recession indicatorsays that the economy is in recession if a three-month moving average of theunemployment raterises by at least 0.5 percentage points, relative to its lowest point from the previous 12 months. For now, the indicator does not signal a recession:unemploymentremains low by historical standards. But firms sometimes hold off on the decision to lay off workers in response to falling demand, especially in times of heightened uncertainty such as now, until after they have accumulated some unwanted inventory, and/or cut back on their output and workers’weekly hours.A number of other early measures of actual economic activity can help us identify a recession. Purchasing managers’ indices (PMI) survey private sector firms to learn, for example, whether they have seen new orders rise or fall over the preceding month. The Institute for Supply Management’s USmanufacturing PMIfell to 49 in March. Readings below 50 indicate contraction.The Census Bureau’sretail sales data– the earliest data on householdconsumptionto become available – are also revealing, since private consumption accounts for nearlytwo-thirdsof US GDP. The March report indicated continued growth, albeit driven largely by elevated motor vehicle sales to consumers who were trying to get ahead of impending tariffs.Of course, the criterion that comes closest to defining a recession is a period of negative GDP growth (in most countries, lasting two consecutive quarters). But GDP is reported only quarterly, with a substantial lag (andit isoftenrevisedlater). So, “nowcasts” have emerged to provide real-time estimates of GDP, based on the most up-to-date relevant indicators, such as the PMI, industrial production, and retail sales. The estimate of first-quarter GDP growth by the most prominent US nowcast, the Atlanta Fed’sGDPNow, fell off a cliff at the end of February, from above +2% to below -2%. Even after adjusting for anunusual increasein gold imports, GDPNow shows a fall in growth to slightly below zero in April.Whereas the birds that augur a recession offer no guarantees, the nowcast indicators can suggest that we may have arrived there. They can thus be thought of as clusters of rocks or shoals. But even then, they may or may not be attached to a larger landmass. In fact, even while the recession is under way, we do not know for sure that this is what we are experiencing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Who wouldn’t want to plan out their ideal urban community, like Sim City and its many video game imitators, or Babar the elephant building Celesteville with its palace of work, palace of pleasure, perfect jobs for each citizen and a lake for swimming and sailing? Our king had great fun devising his Poundbury model town. The lucky members of the government’snew towns taskforcehave been dreaming up a modern generation of new civic places, and are due to unveil their plans in July.They work in the shadow of the great 1946 New Towns Act, and plans drawn up under a similar committee, chaired by Lord Reith, which led to the building of Stevenage, Harlow, Crawley, Corby and others. In the next waves came the ambitious city of Milton Keynes, Peterborough and others.The new committee has been travelling the country, looking at the successes and errors of the past. It looks, too, at lessons to be learned from the great failure of the last Labour government,which pledged to create 10 eco towns. Only one very small development came to fruition in North West Bicester and “disappointing” was the verdict. Built on an isolated greenfield site, with no shops or buses, contrary to what was promised in its desirable original masterplan, residents are totally reliant on cars.This time, from talking to those close to the action, I sense real urgency, not just a nice-to-have addition to Labour’s housing plans, but flagships of growth and regeneration in a nation stymied by a lack of homes. Michael Lyons, ex-chair of the BBC and with enormous experience in building, planning and local government, heads the committee, whose members likewise have deep knowledge of what has and hasn’t worked in the past. Can they summon up the spirit of 1946, or of the earlier garden cities, or of Milton Keynes, which is now highly popular? Can they keep the government on track to follow through a massive programme, and trust that it will be farsighted enough to know it takes years to deliver, with many obstacles?The taskforce conducts its work in strict secrecy, for very good reasons. No one knows where it has been or what it has looked at. The moment it announces recommended sites, the land values will soar: it needs to move fast to secure land at agricultural prices and establish development corporations to own it. The entire financing depends on that, so it can borrow to build, and eventually sell to homebuyers and businesses at far higher new town prices than the old pre-planning permission agricultural value to recover the cost. The added value of the development and all its facilities needs to be captured for the benefit of the new town, not landowners, developers and speculators. Development corporations were how previous new towns were built, and how Michael Heseltine financed his Liverpool and London dockland regenerations. It requires developers’ buy-in too: another risk is that they get cold feet, only wanting to build a few houses to stop prices falling.One reason for Labour’s eco towns failing to get off the ground was that the Treasury tried to finance most of the scheme, with private developers who never want to build amenities bidding for plots. But building new towns will always require that public development corporations control land, building and finance. So the great question now is how much will the Treasury put up in this summer’s spending review? This shouldn’t be in competition with any other funds, as it’s essentially a loan, an investment, most of which will be paid back eventually. Nor is this analagous to the plea made by every department that a pound spent now will prevent a £10 cost later. This really is a mortgage on land, but the Treasury may refuse to put it on its books as an asset, not a debt.The other reason for top secrecy is to avoid giving early warning to inevitable local opponents. Scouting their favoured sites, the taskforce quietly seeks local political buy-in, but even so opposition is guaranteed, and will be noisy even if coming from a minority: forget any hope of cross-party agreement. The government has to stand ruthlessly firm on the side of the silent many who will live in the new towns, not the noisy few already living in the vicinity.The taskforce’s prescription for a good new town sounds like this: at least 20,000, preferably 60,000, homes, intensively built at high-enough density with a critical mass of population to support good transport, shops and services. The taskforce was delighted that 120 zoneswere put up in answer to its call for applications, with a fair spread around the country. Inevitably some were uselessly unsuitable sites for which developers or landowners had tried and failed to get planning permission many times over many years, which had been refused with good reason. Brownfield sites in or near large towns and cities will be chosen mainly, not the out-of-the-way green fields favoured by private developers. There must be jobs nearby. The design must have character; the community must have libraries, sports and arts facilities, parks; the towns must be easy on the eye. The pledge is 40% social and affordable homes, though as the Treasury will know, social housing doesn’t repay like the rest, even with decades of rent, as so many tenants draw housing benefit.These new towns will be rolled out gradually, so the upfront money can be spread across time and the scarcity of construction workers accounted for. The plan is for much of the housing to be system-built in factories. Really? Legal and General’s pioneering modular housing factory just closed with culmulative losses of more than £350m, as have others. Ah, that was because they relied on erratic orders from developers, who refuse to build many at a time. New towns will be system building’s salvation, offering a reliably steady flow of orders for years that should kickstart the industry, ending the reliance onexpensive building skills that have remained essentially unchanged since ancient times, creating factory jobs instead.How long-termist is Keir Starmer? He has always talked of a 10-year focus. Only a few early spades will have broken any ground by the time of the next election, but towns should be springing up halfway through the next parliament – if government has the patience. If Labour loses, these plans could suffer the fate of the few eco towns instantly cut by the incoming housing minister, Grant Shapps, like everything else in 2010. But if the government hits its ambitious target of 1.5m homes, which the Office for Budget Responsibility predicts will bring housebuilding to itshighest level in 40 years, and new towns sprout as symbols of new life, it might help ensure Labour does get re-elected.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionLabourCommunitiescommentShareReuse this content"

Surrounding it all will be Christian prayer.When previously writing about the politics of commemoration I’ve referenced an Australian Vietnam veteranJim Robertsonwho wrote a submission to the federal government ahead of thecentenary of Anzacin 2015. His words are just as salient today.On Anzac Day you’ll hear stories of courage and mateship. It’s a way to rationalise war | Paul DaleyRead moreHe took exception to the term “fallen” (which I agree is something of a sanitisation of battlefield death) as used by politicians when speaking of the war dead. For, Robertson pointed out, they “did not trip over a stick or a garden hose, they were drowned, burned, shot, gassed and eviscerated to lie face down in mud or sand at the bottom of the ocean”.To think of the war dead as fallen may once have been comforting to some in the same way that the famous thoughhistorically highly dubious Atatürk letter(whereby the “Johnnies and Mehmets” lay side by side in the earth at Gallipoli) gave solace to the families of those killed on an obscure finger of the Ottoman Empire which must have seemed a world away then.The Australian War Memorial’s Anzac dawn service is popularly revered as a solemn and respectful commemoration of Australia’s participation in the Gallipoli invasion in 1915 – an event many still (fallaciously, I’ve long argued) cling to as the birth of the Australian nation.But not everyone believes the ceremony ought continue to include elements of traditional Christian worship as it conventionally has, and as it didlast yearand doubtless will again this year. Last year, again, there were Christian hymns. The Lord’s Prayer. A presiding Christian chaplain.There is no doubt many soldiers of the First Australian Imperial Force took solace in their predominant Christian faiths amid the horrors of Gallipoli, the European western front and the Middle East.But times change as do religious affiliations, as reflected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which records that at thelast Australian census(2021) the most common religions were Christianity (43.9%), Islam (3.2%), Hinduism (2.7%) and Buddhism (2.4%). Some 38.9% of Australians said they had no religion.The census found, “The number of people affiliated withChristianityin Australia decreased from 12.2 million (52.1%) in 2016 to 11.1 million (43.9%) in 2021. This decrease occurred across most ages, with the largest decrease for young adults (18-25 years).”It can be reasonably assumed the affiliations and beliefs of contemporary Australian service personnel are reflected in these numbers too.While secularism is growing in Australia, particularly in younger demographics, official Anzac commemorations across the nation (especially the biggest, televised and most observed – that at the war memorial in Canberra) remain fervently Christian.The memorial, generally slow orresistant to cultural changeon a range of salient issues (not least on appropriate commemoration of theAustralian frontier warsbetween First Nations resisters and British troops, settler militias, vigilantes and police) is not, it seems, about to lead the way when it comes to de-Christianising the Anzac Day service. The memorial hosts the annual service on behalf of the Australian Capital Territory Returned and Services League, which apparently remains intransigent on lowering the Christian tempo of the performance.The Rationalist Society of Australia has beenat the forefrontof the push to expunge the Christian rites and practices and prayers from the service, complaining to the ACT Human Rights Commission that the service has discriminated against and excluded some Australians who might otherwise commemorate Anzac.More than 10,000 First Nations people killed in Australia’s frontier wars, final massacre map showsRead moreAs Australia’s first world war veterans (all dead now) fade from living memory, just as those of the second world war will too within a generation, commemoration of Anzac and its profound impact on Australian society and identity must surely evolve with the times. An abundance of Christianity in Anzac Day services stands to emotionally and culturally isolate more and more people.Many Christians, in their celebration of Jesus as a peacemaker, also feel uncomfortable about the pervasiveness of Christianity in military commemoration, not least Anzac and 11 November, Remembrance Day.They’ve got a point: it does seem increasingly anomalous, given the pervasive capacity of religion and its territorial affiliation with land to spark wars. Look at the TV any night. In that, perhaps, might be found a parallel with the war memorial’s acceptance ofsponsorship funds from weapons manufacturers.Religious faith, of course, gave considerable succour and comfort to the men in opposing muddy, bloody trenches during the Great War. To have God on one’s side was comforting – even when another avowed Christian was shooting at you from the enemy dugout.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsAnzac DayOpinionFirst world warAustralian War MemorialReligionChristianityAustralian militarycommentShareReuse this content"

Working with our allies will make British people safer, more secure and more prosperousThu 24 Apr 2025 06.47 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 08.41 EDTShareLabour has been determined to negotiate a new partnership with the EU. The benefits it could unlock are clear – reducing barriers to trade, driving economic growth and keeping us safe in an increasingly dangerous world. It is the sensible, pragmatic thing to do. We want to put more money in the pockets of working people and provide Britain with long-term stability and security; we won’t be defined by debates and arguments of the past.We are equally confident in what the UK can offer in return. It is a politically stable country, and the government has a huge mandate, with more than four years left to deliver our policies. This stability has already inspired the confidence of businessesacross the world, unlocking tens of billions of pounds of long-term investment. This month, Universal announced a multi-billion-pound investment for anew theme park, expected to create 28,000 jobs. We have shown that Britain is back on the world stage, and that it has a lot to offer.The events of recent weeks have seen the UK step up alongside its European partners and play a leading role in the global response to a series of historic events. Russia’s continued aggression in Ukraine has required a momentousresponse from Europe. It has seen European nations come together in defence of our continent, going further than ever on defence spending to keep Ukraine in the fight for as long as it takes. I am proud that the UK has contributed £15bn in support of Ukrainian sovereignty.Labour is rising to meet the challenges in this new era of global instability. It has pumped money into defence, and its first budget restored economic stability.The government needs to work with Britain’s allies on solutions that will minimise the impact of these global shocks. Today, Keir Starmer ishosting Ursula von der Leyenat Downing Street. They will be discussing how countries can work together to deliver energy security, as well as the progress made strengthening the UK-EU relationship since the election.Their meeting is a clear example of global leaders working together on issues that matter to people – such asUkraine, energy security and the global economy. It will also be an opportunity to take stock of the progress made in our negotiations for a better deal with the EU, and make sure teams are meeting our aspirations – to grow the economy, boost living standards and keep the UK safe –when we kicked off this work last October.Pursuing a new partnership with the EU is about meeting the needs of our times. This is not about ideology or returning to the divisions of the past, but about ruthless pragmatism and what works in the national interest. For me, that means working with our allies in the EU to make people across the continent safer, more secure and more prosperous. The EU is our largest trading partner and this government is determined to work to reduce barriers to trade across the economy to help drive growth. Just last week, for example, we saw major retailers such as Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Lidl and Ocadosupporting the government’s aimto negotiate an agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) with the EU, to reduce paperwork and checks, making it easier to do business.There is a way to turn Trump’s chaos into an opportunity. Here is what European leaders must do | Paul TaylorRead moreWhen it comes to security, Nato is the cornerstone of our defence. Now is the time for us to unite across our continent in order to guarantee the best outcome for Ukraine, protect European security and secure our collective future. In the UK we are stepping up, and I know European countries are doing the same. This year we expect the UK to provide £4.5bn in support to Ukraine, more than in any previous year. But there is more the UK and EU can do together to rise to this moment.We are also determined to keep our streets safe. As part of our plan to do this, we have already increased the UK’s presence at Europol to tackle cross-border crime, such as the scourges of human trafficking and drug smuggling.I want us to go further to work with our partners across the continent to smash criminal gangs operating across Europe and smuggling contraband into the UK.All of this will be framed by the very clear red lines we set out at the election. We won’t return to the arguments of the past: there will be no return to the single market, the customs union or freedom of movement. We will only agree an EU deal that meets the needs of the British people and respects the 2016 referendum result. By doing this we will seize the opportunities in front of us to deliver a better future.Nick Thomas-Symonds is paymaster general, minister for the Cabinet Office and minister for the constitution and EU relationsExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionEuropeUkraineLabourKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

All that ended on Friday nightThu 24 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 14.33 EDTShareMy cousin Ziyad was too young to die. He was sleeping at home in Khan Younis refugee camp when the bombs fell just before midnight on Friday. After they heard the explosion, my cousins Mohammed and Moatsem ran to save him, they told me, but he had already died in his bed. He was 44.Ziyad was a social worker for Unrwa, working with vulnerable families in Gaza’s refugee camps. Every summer when I visitedGazafrom my home in Canada, he would buy my little son candies from Asa’ad’s shop – now gone with Asa’ad (who was killed in October 2023) – insisting that Gaza’s candies were the best in the world. Everyone in Khan Younis knew him for his calm presence, gentle spirit and warm smile. He was always ready to help – the words “no” or “I can’t” were never part of his vocabulary. The night before he was killed, he visited the wounded and sick, including my uncle, Kamal.These attacks come mostly at night, when people steal what sleep they can from the endless explosions and cries for help. Since Israelcut off the electricity supplyto Gaza, their light and noise pierces the intense darkness that falls after sundown. And it was the middle of the night when a missile struck the home of Ziyad’s family. The multistorey building had five apartments, all filled with people – three of Ziyad’s siblings and their families, and several displaced family memberswho had sought shelter there after losing their homes. Khan Younis camp is wheremy grandparents sought refuge in 1948after the Nakba, and my family has lived there ever since.Ziyad seems to have been killed instantly. His wife, Samah, and four children – Abboud, Duha, Leen and Obada – were wounded.View image in fullscreenZiyad with his son Obada before the war.His brother Islam was severely injured, and remains unconscious in the partially functional Nasser hospital. Islam’s wife, Du’aa, was killed instantly. One of their children, Ahmed, was thrown from the second floor to the ground by the force of the explosion – doctors are talking about fractures in his pelvis and legs. Ziyad’s sister, Hala, was also wounded, along with her children – Malak, Nour and Muhammad. Three of Muhammad’s limbs were amputated. I’ll never forget the video I saw on Telegram of Hala, walking the corridors of Nasser hospital, her face carrying more grief than any heart should bear.Another of Ziyad’s brothers, Imad, and his entire family – his wife, Nihal, and their seven children, Muhammad, Muhand, Mu’ayyad, Mu’min and their triplet girls Dima, Rima and Rita – were also injured. In total, 15 children under the age of 15 were injured in my family, in this single strike. According to Unicef,15,600 Palestinian childrenhave been killed in Gaza since 7 October 2023;nearly 600 childrenhave been killed and more than 1,600 injured since Israel resumed its assaults on 18 March. Entire family lines have been erased, homes turned into graves.My cousins tell me that among the children killed on Friday was 20-month-old Kenan, the only son of the photojournalist Ahmad Adwan, whose family had sought shelter in Ziyad’s home. Kenan was born after 18 years of his parents’ struggle with infertility and countless costly medical treatments. His life was stolen before it had even begun.Months earlier, Ziyad was abducted by the Israeli army from the home he eventually died in, and held for several months. When he was finally released, he couldn’t recognise Khan Younis, where he grew up. The destruction was so complete it obliterated most familiar landmarks of the city and camp. The streets he had once known were unrecognisable ruins. But what he recognised was the tenacity of the people who face up to any danger to bring hope and healing.The circumstances of Ziyad’s own death demonstrate this. When the attack occurred, Mohammed, 26, was sitting with his father and his young brother Moatsem, 17. They heard the whistle of a missile – a brief few seconds – then a devastating explosion shattered windows, doors and lives. Stones and debris rained down on their roof, injuring Mohammed’s arm. Without hesitation, Mohammed and Moatsem bolted outside, into the darkness. Their father shouted for them to stay inside, fearing a “double-tap” strike –a tactic that targets first responders.This British-Australian doctor has seen the unspeakable in Gaza. He wants to shout from the rooftopsRead moreThe boys told me how they ran toward the thick smoke and dust. At least 20 other people were already gathered, searching desperately in the dark with nothing but the weak glow of their phone lights. There were small shovels to help with the rescue, but most survivors and neighbours were left to claw through the debris with their bare hands. Large slabs of ceiling had collapsed; anyone trapped beneath them stood no chance. Yet people charged into the wreckage without pause, pulling the wounded from the rubble, cradling lifeless children, and shouting out names into the chaos.This isn’t the first time my family has been hit. On 26 October 2023,bombs rained downon our residential quarter in Khan Younis without warning, killing more than 60 people – 45 of them members of my family. Back then, Ziyad was one of the first to rush to try to rescue his relatives. This time it was too late to rescue him. I’ve long since stopped counting those I’ve lost.My family’s story echoes those of countless families across Gaza whose lives have been shrouded in the darkness of this genocide. I believe that to tell their stories is to defy the darkness. To demand justice is not to ask forcharity – it is a moral obligation. My family was not collateral damage. They were teachers, doctors, students, engineers, social workers, mothers and children – each one snuffed out too early.What offers me solace is that, in the face of this unimaginable cruelty, Palestinians still run to save one another. In pitch darkness, even amid falling rubble and suffocating dust, the light of Palestinian dignity refuses to be extinguished. These lights call all of us to be witnesses to the brutality, and are lights of hope that the suffering of Palestinians can be brought to an end immediately.Ghada Ageel, a third-generation Palestinian refugee, worked as a translator for the Guardian in Gaza from 2000 to 2006.

We know because Keir Starmer told usThu 24 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 06.50 EDTShareThose of us who try to defend wildlife are horribly familiar with bad laws. But we’ve never seen anything like this. The government’splanning and infrastructure billis the worst assault on England’s ecosystems in living memory. It erasesdecades of environmental protections, including legislation we inherited from the EU, which even the Tories promised to uphold.The rules defending wildlife and habitats from unscrupulous developers areweak enough already, which is partly why, as Labourreminded us in its manifesto, Britain is “one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world”. But this bill will make it much, much worse.At present, builders aresupposed to followa “mitigation hierarchy”: avoid, minimise, mitigate, offset. Ideally, they should avoid building in places of high wildlife value, especially irreplaceable habitats. If that isn’t possible, they should minimise the harm inflicted. Then they should mitigate that harm, by restoring the habitats they’ve damaged. Only if all these options are exhausted should they seek to offset the damage by creating habitat elsewhere. This final gambit is generally themost expensive and least successful.The new bill scratches all that, jumping straight to option 4: offsetting. By paying a “nature restoration levy”, developers will be allowed to trash whatever habitats – woods, meadows, wetlands, streams – stand in their way. Once they’ve paid, the bill states, they can “disregard” the impact of destroying a protected feature. The details are remarkably, horrifyingly vague: the secretary of state merely needs to believe that the levy is “likely”, one day, to create new habitat to deem the damage “outweighed”.Some ecosystems, such as ancient woodlands, ancient meadows and chalk streams, simply cannot be replaced. But the bill pretends that everything is tradeable. You can destroy an ancient woodland,as long as you deliveran “overall improvement” in woodland cover, namely saplings in plastic tubes. Anyway, we won’t even know what we are losing, as the new legislation negates the requirement to conduct ecological site surveys. How can you measure an “overall improvement” if you don’t have a baseline? Without surveys, no one can be charged with wildlife crime for destroying habitats and species, as there will be no evidence. It’s the kind of anti-scientific, pro-corporate scrubbing of expertise we see in Donald Trump’s US.Even if a huge impact is somehow identified, the bill insists that the levy for offsetting habitat destruction cannot be high enough to make the development “economically unviable”. So developers have no incentive to avoid trashing rare and beautiful places, as their profits will be protected by law.Inevitably, this will reduce the provision of urban green spaces. Building land is expensive; farmland much cheaper. It will always be in a developer’s interest to build over urban habitats while paying for restoration in the countryside. Asevidence gatheredacrossthree decadesshows, this will haveserious impactson local people’s physical and mental health. Like austerity, deregulation tends not to save money, but to shift costs from the rich to the poor and the private sector to the state.Across my long and largely futile career, I’ve read innumerable reports by professional bodies. But neverone as scathingas the note last month by the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management. “It is evident that the broad consensus of concern raised by a wide range of environmental professionals, professional bodies, NGOs, learned societies and developers” has been “entirely disregarded in the bill drafting process … no meaningful inclusions have been made to address the significant issues identified”. The government hasintroduced the billwithout an evidence base, truncating its own consultations and expert assessments. Its “lack of transparency”, and “failure to follow an objective, evidence-led, democratic process” is “reckless”.So who has the government listened to? Astonishingly, Keir Starmerhas told us. His attack on environmental regulation, he states, has been inspired by “my conversations with leading CEOs”. He seems blissfully unaware that this is the bit you are not supposed to say. Politicians are meant to sustain the illusion that governments exist to enact the will of the people, not the will of the corporations.If you listen only to corporations, you’re a dupe. Of course, they will produce justifications for the harmful things they want. Of course, they will tell you that rules are too onerous, taxes too high and subsidies too low. It takes spectacular political naivety to take them at their word. But Starmer seems happy to be conned.The story they have told him, which he recites like an automaton, is that development is beingimpeded by “blockers”,“time-wasting nimbys”and “zealots”. The case that he and the billionaire presscite repeatedlyis HS2’s £100m tunnel to protect bats. How’s that for regulator overreach? But had ecologists been brought in at the beginning of the planning process, they would have advised avoiding the ancient woodland the railway bisects, saving HS2 a ton of money and trouble.Planning bill ‘throws environmental protection to the wind’, say UK nature chiefsRead moreA combination of a lack of foresight andthe dire undercapacityof local authorities and government regulators, caused by austerity, are the main impediments to development, not ecological surveys and consultation. As ecological consultants explain to me, many of the delays developers bemoan are actually caused by the companies themselves, commissioning surveys at the last minute, rather than designing them into the process. Nature is ever the afterthought. And afterthoughts are expensive.In its manifesto,Labourpromised “to restore and protect our natural world” and “to unlock the building of homes … without weakening environmental protections”.Well, I guess you could argue it isn’t weakening them. It’s deleting them.Like the government’snew anti-protest law, exacerbating the Conservatives’ draconian measures, this bill betrays an undemocratic impatience with the people, motivated by the blatant appeasement of corporate power. Just as the US iscaptured by a billionaire death cult, our government is opening the door to the same forces.All this is supposed to promote economic growth, which appears to be Labour’s sole remaining principle. Trashing the living world to stimulate growth is like sacrificing virgins to secure a good harvest: it’s cruel, ignorant and ineffective. If anything, it willhave the opposite effect.Environmental defenders were wary of Starmer’s Labour party, though I don’t think anyone believed it would be worse than the Tories. But here we are. Its legacy, if this terrible bill is approved, will be a grimmer, greyer, unhappier nation.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPlanning policyOpinionWildlifeEconomic growth (GDP)Keir StarmerLabourConstruction industryPropertycommentShareReuse this content"

Was that to appease Trump?Alexander HurstInstead of bazooka-level fines on global turnover, this €700m was no more than a slap on the wrist. It’s a missed opportunityThu 24 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 11.46 EDTShareThe European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, had sometough wordsfor big tech this week, but it seems that at the last minute, the EU lost its nerve. Under the Digital Markets Act, companies that the EU has designated as “gatekeepers” – that is, digital platforms that provide core services such as search engines, app stores and messenger services – havespecial obligations and constraintsthat are meant to ensure a fair playing field for other companies.Apple, which takes a significant cut of purchases (including subscriptions) made through its App Store, violated the act by preventing developers from directing customers to their own websites to get around the “Apple tax”. In Meta’s case, thecompany was finedfor forcing Facebook and Instagram users to either consent to letting Meta use their personal data, or pay a monthly fee to remove ads.In theory, the act contains bazooka-level enforcement: fines can reach up to 10% of a company’s global turnover, or 20% for repeat offences. In this first test, however, the EU decided to dole out a round of fines so wimpy that it might as well have done nothing at all.Instead of a maximum$39bn (£29bn) fine, Applewill pay $570m(£430m); instead of $16bn (£12bn), Meta will pay $228m (£172m). Let me break down the sheer insignificance of two fines that sound large but aren’t. Apple, with a $3tn market cap, brought in $391bn inrevenue in 2024. Meta’s revenue was $164.5bn and it made a $62.4bn profit. In effect, the EU knocked 46 hours off of Apple’s year of profit, and shortened Meta’s year by 28 hours.Fines this pathetic become simply part of the cost of doing business. They risk failing to deter tech companies from abusing their power in the future, just as they have done in the past. In the last two years alone, Meta was hit with an€800m fineand a€1.2bn fine, and Apple was handed a€1.8bnantitrust fine.There’s another, deeper, political consequence. Voters are fed up with the impunity that follows wealth. In 2008, Wall Street banks crashed the global economy with a mixture of irresponsible and criminal behaviour; taxpayers picked up the tab for bailing them out, and only a handful of executives went to jail. The result was a widespreadloss of faith in institutionsand representative government, and the growth of far-right, populist movements.The EU might think that by soft-pedalling, it is protecting Europeans from the potential economic impact of angering the Trump administration by handing down deterrent-level fines to his allies, but that’s wrong. In the long run, Europeans will benefit far more from a competitive economy that opens the door for the continent’s own tech companies to emerge and thrive, rather than one governed by monopolistic big tech from the US.It’s not so much that these “tsk-tsk”-level fines will crater Europeans’ confidence in their government as it is a missed opportunity to show voters what it looks like to actually rein in powerful corporations who assume – rightly, I guess – that at the end of the day, they can pay and go on their way.Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe columnistExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionAppleMetaEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionEuropeUrsula von der LeyencommentShareReuse this content"

But a music festival choir singalong changed everythingWed 23 Apr 2025 22.27 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 13.40 EDTShareWhen I was 16 I eagerly auditioned for our high school musical, singing a verse and the chorus from the Irene Cara song Flashdance … What a Feeling. Instead of taking the music teacher’s advice and picking something suitable for my voice, I chose this song because I secretly wanted to be just a dancer with a welding mask – just like the star of the film.Preparations were intense. I spent hours rehearsing at home, nailing down the lyrics and watching the same scene over and over on my treasured VHS copy of Flashdance. I would have attempted some of the dance moves too but it was clear to everyone that was never going to be to my advantage.My friendship group auditioned for the handful of lead roles and I had visions of myself up on stage, belting out a song alongside the cute boy in my year I had a crush on.Aidan felt safe at choir, changed by the communal act of sharing his voice – then he was diagnosed with cancerRead moreThe day finally came when the cast list was posted near the music room – I can still remember the churning in my stomach as we raced down at lunch to see.We were all given parts, because inclusion mattered, but, while most of my friends were given key singing roles, I was cast in the only speaking part that didn’t include a song. I wasn’t much of an actor either but it didn’t stop me loving every second on stage, even knowing that the only thing I’d mastered was remembering my lines.That audition has haunted me for years and I’ve perfected the art of dodging public singing ever since. Except for the odd Happy Birthday or someone hearing me singing too loud in the shower, my voice is rarely tested.Until, that is, I found myself at CresFest, a small music festival in Creswick, north-westVictoria. The festival is dedicated to celebrating the joy of music and there are performances from local and international bands, workshops and choral performances.I’d tagged along with three friends who sing inthe choir my partner belonged to. When he died in 2020 the choir sang at his memorial so I always felt like a sort of honorary, silent member.When we checked into our accommodation my friends told me about the community choir singalong that night. Anyone who had bought a ticket to the weekend’s events could turn up at the church and sing, learning four songs to perform at the festival’s last event.I was settling into a night on the couch with a book when my friends suggested I join them. I’m not sure why I agreed. Perhaps I saw it as my chance to witness the inner workings of a choir, something that had always seemed so far away from my experience.The wonder of 100 harmonising voices soon began to weave its magicDriving down the dimly lit country road to that rehearsal, I was nervous. Nervous in that way I hadn’t been since I was 16. As what-ifs swirled around my head, I imagined someone overhearing my out-of-tune voice and sending me packing.The church was heaving with people when we arrived. We were ushered into areas, depending on our voices. I looked lost until my friend told me to stay with her. It turned out I would be an alto for the night.I huddled at the back of the pack and, as I took the lyrics from a volunteer, I decided to mime, reasoning that if nobody could hear me singing out of tune then it didn’t matter if I was there.With a hundred or so singers from choirs across Victoria jammed into the church, it was slow going learning the different parts of the songs. The sopranos were in one corner, basses in the other, with the altos and tenors taking up the final two spots.The wonder of 100 harmonising voices soon began to weave its magic and I looked across at my friend, whose voice I could hear over the others around me. She smiled and it was all I needed. Instead of miming, actual notes began to flow out of my mouth.We sang together for an hour. Many of us strangers, we’d turned up just to be part of something. Something transitory and fleeting. I knew I wouldn’t even remember the lyrics when I got outside. But I didn’t care. I’d sung in public with a room of people and survived. Irene Cara would have been proud.Nova Weetman is an award-winning children’s author.

In St Peter’s Basilica, where he now lies in state, Francis’s bodyrestsin an unelaborate coffin and has not been placed on the traditional elevated bier. Thetombin which he will be buried is to be underground and unadorned, carrying only the plain inscription “Franciscus”, again on his instructions.The final grace notes of a remarkable papacy will add to the pathos of Saturday’sfuneral, which hundreds of thousands of mourners are expected to attend. The Argentinian pope’s plain, direct style endeared him to millions of non-Catholics as well as to the faithful. But the ecclesiastical politics of what happens next, in a divided church, will be anything but straightforward.The papalconclavedue to commence in May will play a crucial role in determining the durability of Francis’s reforming legacy. Traditionalists railed bitterly at the pope’s pastoral approach to questions of sexuality and diversity, his disdain for hierarchy and dogma, and his emphasis on social and environmental justice. They will see the chance of a conservative reset.For cardinals from the global south – appointedin large numbersby Francis as he sought to reflect the geographical realities of 21st-century Catholicism – the conclave is an opportunity to exert influence on behalf of the church in Africa and Asia. That may point towards the election of a pope sharing Francis’s passionate emphasis on addressing global inequality, the climate emergency and defending the rights of migrants. On the other hand, the morally conservative outlookdominantin many African churches could lead to alliances with western traditionalists, to the benefit of a theological hardliner able to garner support from both constituencies.At this stage, “runners and riders” lists of the supposedly “papabili” are stimulating sources of gossip, but not much more. Many of the newer cardinal electors are unknown quantities in Rome, and unknown to each other. As the Oscar-winning filmConclavevividly portrayed, the political dynamics that play out in the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel are generally shifting and impossible to predict. No one, for example, saw Karol Wojtyla of Krakow coming in the late 1970s.The impact of the subsequentpapacyof John Paul II serves to highlight the potential stakes for non-Catholics as well as believers. The 1980s saw the church under his leadership play an influential role in the tumultuous period leading to the collapse of communism and the end of the cold war. Although theologically conservative at a time when secularisation in the west was accelerating, the Polish pope was in tune with changing times when it came to the victorious struggle against authoritarian regimes in eastern Europe.In contrast, Francis sometimes cut an isolated figure as he opposed a new authoritarian turn in the politics of the west.Deploringthe rise of aggressive nationalisms and the erosion of democratic norms, he became a lonely but vital bulwark of resistance in the name of universal rights and values. Progressives inside and outside the church must hope that, in an unstable and dangerously volatile era, that witness can be built upon by the next pontiff. But ahead of an unusually large and an unusually unpredictable conclave, all bets are off.Explore more on these topicsThe papacyOpinionCatholicismPope FrancisReligionChristianityConclavePope John Paul IIeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Oceanic Feeling (2021)If you wanted to take Lorde’s third album, Solar Power, as a farewell to chasing mainstream stardom, closer Oceanic Feeling was strong evidence: her trademark “cherry black lipstick” was “gathering dust in a drawer / I don’t need her any more.” Instead, she offered a beautiful, sun-kissed paean to stepping off the treadmill: “I just had to breathe,” she explains.19. Yellow Flicker Beat (2014)Between her first and second albums, Lorde performed with the surviving members of Nirvana, and essayed an astonishing Brit awards tribute to David Bowie. She also absolutely crushed her contribution to the Hunger Games: Mockingjay soundtrack – Yellow Flicker Beat is ominous and powerful, and it works both as part of the movie’s plot and entirely separate from it.18. Mood Ring (2021)Amid Solar Power’s seemingly earnest paeans to taking it easy came Mood Ring, a song that suggested Lorde’s capacity for snark wasn’t diminished. Just as she did with pop culture on Royals, she fixes her satirical gaze on millennial wellness trends, with splendid results: “Let’s fly somewhere eastern! They’ll have what I need!”17. Buzzcut Season (2013)If you want evidence of the cool, this-is-me self-confidence that powered Lorde’s debut album, you could do worse than listen to Buzzcut Season. Its memories of past summers are set to music eerily sparse by the standards of 2013, an era of DayGlo pop maximalism, EDM, Miley Cyrus’s Wrecking Ball and Katy Perry’s Roar.View image in fullscreenLorde plays the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury festival, 2022.Photograph: Harry Durrant/Getty Images16. Stoned at the Nail Salon (2021)A grumbling electric guitar plays a folky figure (vaguely evocative of Nico’s celebrated These Days), backing a plethora of worries about the passage of time: youthful beauty fading, relationships withering, tastes in music changing. An existential crisis or just a mind wandering under the influence of THC? Lorde isn’t sure, but it sounds beautiful either way.15. Royals (2013)Lorde’s breakthrough hit wasn’t the best track on Pure Heroine, but it might be the most striking: the sound of pop’s target market answering back, with an incisive skewering of the glaring disparity between the unattainable lifestyles it projects and the realities of teenage life – and beating it at its own game.14. The Louvre (2017)Her second album, Melodrama, depicted the debauchery and emotional chaos of late teen lives so brilliantly, the fact the late teen in question was a huge pop star seemed beside the point. The Louvre reports from the dizzy height of an inadvisable romance: “We’re the greatest, they’ll hang us in the Louvre / Down the back but who cares – still the Louvre.”13. Perfect Places (2017)The sparkling big-chorused pop of Perfect Places sounds buoyant, but it jars against the lyrics. They paint a picture of Lorde partying – she drinks, drugs, cops off and throws up – and ending up not in hedonistic nirvana but in hollow, hungover regret, wondering “what the fuck” the point is.12. Team (2013)The key line on Pure Heroine might be Team’s snotty riposte to pop’s then-current obsession with partying in the VIP area: “I’m kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air,” it snaps, fabulously. The sound of a kid who has heard one Black Eyed Peas hit too many.11. Liability (2017)A limpid melody and a raw, close-miked vocal, as if someone who has had a few drinks is detailing their romantic woes inches away from your face, replete with I’ll-never-love-again misery and a resolution, of sorts: “You’re all gonna watch me disappear into the sun.” Intense, but beautiful with it.10. What Was That (2025)A strikingly effective update of Melodrama’s angst-ridden-yet-euphoric banger approach, Lorde’s brand new single comes complete with a lyric that compares sexual desire to smoking a cigarette on MDMA. Charli xcx recently announced the coming of a “Lorde summer”: if the rest of the next album is as good as this, she might have a point.9. Tennis Court (2013)Packing one of the most fabulously surly (and very teenage) opening lines in pop history – “Don’t you think it’s boring how people talk?” – Lorde stares down the prospect of fame with an equivocal eye. The irony is that the song itself is so perfectly constructed it makes huge success seem inevitable.8. Supercut (2017)It’s one of the few songs on Melodrama to reference Lorde’s fame, albeit obliquely (“continents and cars … the stages and the stars”). But Supercut’s real currency is more breakup-fuelled distress, this time set to music that slowly builds to a delicious, dizzyingly effective pop chorus, then collapses into racked silence before gradually rebuilding itself again.7. Hard Feelings/Loveless (2017)If Melodrama seemed more straightforwardly poppy than its predecessor, Lorde’s oddball side took charge here. This is two entirely different tracks jammed into one: the first stately, punctuated by screams and scraping noise, the second a kind of creeped-out nursery rhyme that borrows the drums from Phil Collins’s In the Air Tonight.6. A World Alone (2013)A beautiful, complex portrayal of the friendship between two adolescent weirdos. Brutal self-assessment coexists with take-us-or-leave-us swagger – “Maybe the internet raised us, or maybe people are jerks” is a particularly great line – perfectly mirrored in the song’s musical shifts from fragile solo electric guitar to dancefloor-engaging four-four thud.5. Homemade Dynamite (2017)View image in fullscreenLorde in 2025.A masterclass in how to make a fantastic 21st-century pop track, everything about Homemade Dynamite is inspired: the spiky staccato arrangement at odds with Lorde’s cooing vocal, the vaguely military beat, the earworm chorus, the stammering hook. Also fantastic:the all-star remix featuring SZA, Post Malone and Khalid.4. Writer in the Dark (2017)This is Melodrama’s killer breakup ballad, at turns despondent, stoic and savage, its sudden shifts in mood utterly believable. The orchestration is subtly done – all the drama comes from Lorde’s lyrics and voice, which starts as a bitter snarl, gradually gathers itself and transforms, stunningly, into swooping, Kate Bush-esque catharsis as it reaches the chorus.3. 400 Lux (2013)The perfect example of Pure Heroine’s ability to transform the mundane into something gripping. It’s a song about “killing time” by driving aimlessly around with a pal, but the vocals are surrounded by occasionally off-key synths: a strange, faintly uneasy counterpoint to the lyrics about friendship and suburban contentment.2. Green Light (2017)A thrillingly explosive introduction to Lorde’s second album. Fuelled by extraordinarily bitter sentiments – at one point, she wishes her ex could be mauled by a shark – and hands-in-the-air house piano, Green Light abandons Pure Heroine’s slow-burn sound in favour of careering along, dragging us with it.1. Ribs (2013)Ribs sharply evokes both a house party’s hungover aftermath and the weird, liminal nature of adolescence, the disquieting moment when you’re struck by the realisation that your childhood is over and you’re entirely unprepared for whatever is supposed to happen next, no matter how much you pretend you are: “We can talk it so good … it drives you crazy getting old.” Perfectly, the music is all about anticipation: one long build to a climax that never arrives. The startling brilliance of Lorde’s debut album – a teenage audience’s concerns addressed directly by another teenager, albeit a preternaturally smart one – is encapsulated in four minutes.Explore more on these topicsRankedLordePop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some people opted to pop in for hour-long sessions throughout the day and into the evening, with the last slot beginning at 11pm and lasting until the bitter end.‘He will not leave the stage. Ever’: Marina Abramović and Igor Levit on their marathon 16-hour concertyRead moreJacob Povey, a 29-year-old nurse, was in it for the long haul. “It’s such a unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” he said as he waited for doors to open. “I’ve managed five hours before at Christian Marclay’s film installation The Clock, so I know I’ve got something like that in me. I’ll be in and out, but hopefully I’m here at the end … whenever itdoes actually end.”Written in 1893 for keyboard, Vexations is between one and two minutes long when played once. But a note from Satie on the manuscript – “In order to play this motif 840 times in a row, it would be advisable to prepare oneself beforehand, in the deepest silence, through serious immobilities” – has inspired several artists over the years to attempt just that.A marathon performance of the piece in 1963, organised by John Cage and played in shifts by various pianists including Christian Wolff, lasted 19 hours and was called “musical history” by the New York Times.Levit, whose first performance of the piece was streamed from his Berlin apartment during the Covid-19 lockdown, has done it before in 15 and a half hours.For many visiting, it was less about the music and more about the performance, which featured pieces of the modular stage being taken apart and turned into sculptural chairs.“One of the things that struck me was how unmemorable that piece of music was,” said Dave Hallberry, 69, who had come along to the performance with his wife, Noreen, and 18-year-old daughter, Sorcha.“Even now I don’t think I could sing it to you, and I’ve just been listening to it for an hour. There’s something about the combination of notes that makes you want to keep listening to it.”View image in fullscreenIgor Levit performs, flanked by onstage helpers and reflected in the mirror-effect above designed by Marina Abramović and Urs Schönebaum.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianAbramović worked with the lighting designer Urs Schönebaum to create a mirror-like effect above the piano. Clare Maleeny, a 24-year-old film editor in the audience, said: “I kept switching my view between the mirror and the stage. It was trance-like.”Ruth Davis, 69, an Alexander teacher, was more familiar with the piece than most. “They said it was the first time that it’s been played live in the UK,” she said. “Which is not true: I played this piece in front of an audience in 1983 for my second-year performance at Leicester Polytechnic and it lasted 11 hours and 43 minutes. I starved myself for two days before. It’s really quite a difficult piece to play!”Luckily, Levit had two onstage helpers nearby to provide him with sustenance and mop his brow. And as for the key question on everyone’s mind – how he went to the toilet – a screen was on standby to go up around the piano.Many, though, worried about his comfort and wondered whether he would go the distance. “The chair wasn’t great,” Hallberry said. “I thought he’d have some sort of comfy office chair or something.”Speaking to the Guardian earlier this year, Abramović said the chair could turn into a bed, “so that he can lie next to the piano for 10 or 15 minutes if he needs to”.For the audience as much as for Levit, it will be a test of endurance.“I will have to leave for toilet breaks and eating and so on,” said Nick Manrique, a 26-year-old PhD student. “But I’m stubborn – I’m quite determined to see it through.”Tickets for Igor Levit’s performance of Vexations – including one-hour time slots – were still available on Thursday fromtheSouthbank Centre box office.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicIgor LevitMarina AbramovićSouthbank CentrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We step inside their hidden worldBarbara SpeedThu 24 Apr 2025 11.02 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 18.19 EDTShareAfew years ago, a Hollywood studio approached the tech giant IBM with an idea. Perhaps it would be fun if Watson – the company’s artificial intelligence system – analysed its new film about an artificial humanoid gone rogue, and created a trailer for it. The technology was duly “trained” on 100 horror trailers, fed the 90-minute film, and a human editor helped stitch its chosen clips together.The result, billed as “the first movie trailer made by AI”, is awful. The exchanges are slow and pause-filled, as though filmed underwater. Toby Jones raises his eyebrow sagely at nothing. The screen flashes to black for no reason. At the end, the title card apologetically fades in: “Morgan … September 2.”View image in fullscreenWatch the eyebrows … Toby Jones in Morgan.Photograph: Aidan Monaghan/20th Century Fox/AllstarThe director may have had a vested interest in the trailer going wrong – the film was, after all, about the dangers of this kind of technology. Yet as interest in AI-generated trailers grows, including Netflix recently being granted a patent forpersonalised algorithmic trailer technology, and cinema attendance still in the post-pandemic doldrums, the Morgan trailer was a masterclass in whatnotto do – and a testament to the anonymous army that has perfected the art of making good trailers.Trailers are an entirely different discipline from long-form cinema; made not by the film’s director, as is often assumed, but by highly skilled specialist editors. They are credited nowhere, yet responsible for selling the film to audiences in 150 seconds or less (the maximum allowed by the US Motion Picture Association, though somecinemas have asked that they stick to two minutesflat).“My dad is always asking me, when will I see your name in lights?” says Zoe Carey, an editor at Create Advertising, whose trailer and teaser credits includeNomadland,Paddingtonand the latest season ofThe White Lotus. “I’m like, never.”At school, Carey would spend her lunch breaks in the computer lab watching trailer after trailer, and as a student she acted as “the videographer” of her shared house. “I got hooked by the craft of editing and storytelling, and how something that can be shapeless can become so awesome. I realised that was my calling.”Create Advertising editor Zoe Carey’s trailer for The White LotusIf making a feature film is like writing a novel, Carey compares trailer-editing to writing poetry. Presented with a cut of the film that might be finished, or may be more like a bundle of rushes, editors – who may work alone or in a bigger team – distil the project’s essence and mood, adding music (which often, to viewers’ frustration, isn’t in the film itself because of licensing restrictions) and ordering dialogue into a narrative. Some may watch the whole thing on mute, then listen to the whole audio track, picking out the key moments from each. Once a first cut is presented, the back-and-forth with the client kicks into gear.Despite their invisible creators, trailers have been central to the history of film, with huge sums spent on their creation. Mike DiBenedetto, whose notable edits include the trailer forEnchantedand many Marvel movies, got a job in the early 2000s driving tapes of potential cuts all over town and then worked his way up. Agencies would be pitted against one another to land the job: “Warner Bros might have 16 trailers commissioned for a movie, and only one of them is going to win. It was very sports-like – every big assignment you got put on to was like a cup competition.” As a biography for DiBenedetto on an industry website notes: “Some of his trailers were beautiful. Some were bombastic. Some were hilarious. Most of them died.”Mike DiBenedetto’s trailer for EnchantedThat level of competition could result in a toxic atmosphere. Earlier in Carey’s career, her boss would ask to present her cuts as his own in meetings with clients. “I would say yeah, that’s fine – it wasn’t because he was trying to take credit for my work, it was because there was a predetermined idea of what an editor should look like.” (While the industry is still pretty male-dominated, she says: “There’s no way that would happen now.”)When DiBenedetto started out, the voiceover-led trailer was still king, and editors tended to be technical specialists, often hired from post-production editing houses. “But then my generation of trailer editors came along, and we were just nerds – the guys who recorded trailers on their VHS at home. I grew up on skateboard videos and Tarantino. We were coming at it from a completely different direction.” Over time, the voiceover declined in popularity, in order to let the film speak for itself, rather than “pulling people out of the experience. It was really exciting – you could no longer just write a script, put music underneath it and call it a day.”View image in fullscreenMonica Brady and Evelyn Watters, co-founders of the Golden Trailer awards, at the 2019 ceremony.Photograph: Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images for Golden Trailer AwardsA few years before, sisters Monica Brady and Evelyn Watters were trying to make their first feature film, and wanted to make a trailer to tempt investors (a common, but lesser-known function of the format). “My sister said: ‘There must be an awards show for trailer editors, we’ll find the best ones there.’ But there wasn’t,” says Brady. So they decided to create one, and managed to lure Quentin Tarantino and the British film-maker Stephen Woolley on to the Golden Trailer awards’ first judging panel in 1999.Now in its 25th year, the awards show is fittingly short – “Eighty minutes this year,” Brady says; “Seventy to 80,” Watters adds: “I have an extremely short attention span.”The pair are themselves true trailer heads. In college, Brady once let her car battery die in order to watch them: her cinema companion pointed out that she’d left the lights on, and “I was like: ‘Ah, someone will jump-start me later. We’re not missing the trailers.’”Categories include best feature, best animated, best action and scores more (though trashiest trailer, awarded for the best use of sex or gore, was relegated from the main show after the sisters’ aunt, a nun, came to the ceremony). But a perennial favourite is the Golden Fleece award, given to the best trailer for a bad film. It’s part-joke, part-tribute to the essence of what a great trailer editor can do: make a film appear as the best version of itself.Carey was proud to be nominated for a Golden Fleece in 2019 for her trailer for Welcome to Marwen, a Steve Carell-led biopic of a photographer who dealt with PTSD by building a second world war-era village out of dolls. The film bombed, and wassummarised in these pagesGuardian as “Steve Carell on icky form in straightwashed misfire”.The trailer, Carey says, “was … hard to crack”. As the trailer begins, the film does indeed seem baffling – poorly animated dolls fire machine guns, and Carell shows a neighbour his Nazi-doll torture scene. But as the Foo Fighters’ Learning to Walk Again” fades in, and a plasticky Carell booms “If I can be a hero, so can you,” I find myself … moved. Smiling. Wait, am I crying?You would think that being landed with a bad film – or even one you don’t like – might be offputting, but the editors I speak to don’t see it that way. John Piedot, whose agency’s drug-and-expletive-filled trailer for the Irish film Kneecap won a Clio advertising award, points out that it’s a “service industry” – finding something appealing in any project is the essence of the job. DiBenedetto sees his role as “working out who the person who wants to watch this is, and how do I tell them that it’s great? My ex-father-in-law loved Baby Geniuses, the terrible movie with the talking babies. Getting him in front of that film – that was a win for everybody.” Of course, this can be taken too far: the trailer for Kangaroo Jack lured children to the cinema expecting a talking kangaroo, only to find it was an action film in which the titular marsupial raps, but only in a dream sequence. Fan disappointment can have consequences – two Ana de Armas stansunsuccessfully took the creators of Yesterdayto court after the actor appeared in the trailer, but not in the film.View image in fullscreenAna de Armas appeared in the trailer for Yesterday, but didn’t make the film’s final cut.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamySince the glory days of the 2000s, budgets and bidding wars have contracted a little, and the time given by studios for a first cut of a trailer by an agency has generally shrunk from two weeks to one. When I ask about Cameron Diaz’s character, Amanda, in The Holiday, perhaps the biggest portrayal of a trailer editor in popular culture, her mansion with its onsite editing suite raises some smirks. “I once worked for an editor with a huge house in the Palisades – the money in the trailer industry was no joke,” DiBenedetto says. Carey rolls her eyes – “if I had a dollar for every time someone asks me about The Holiday …” – and is forced to point out that Amanda isn’t a trailer editor – she’s a trailerproducer,and “an annoying one at that”, hovering over the shoulder of John Krasinski’s character, the actual trailer editor. Later, though, Carey sends me a photo of a poster for The Holiday on her wall: “Since it was the first movie that shone a light on trailers, I felt like I had to have some artwork honouring it!”The growth of streaming, and the disruption to the more traditional path of films from cinema to home video or DVD, has injected some uncertainty, too.A recent N+1 pieceabout Netflix’s strategy laid out that marketing for individual titles is far less important than simply getting people on to your platform in the first place. As DiBenedetto puts it: “Netflix realised there wasn’t a lot of return on investment on cutting a full-blown trailer when you can just pull a single snippet of the show out instead.”But most of Carey’s work now is for streamer-released shows: “More platforms mean more content, which means more trailers, more work for everyone.” Cutting the White Lotus trailer was a career highlight: “It was such a big cultural moment, and I love the show so much.” As with a big cinema releases, big streaming releases may now see a number of agencies competing for the commission. The Golden Trailer awards, accordingly, now have awards for TV shows and for “digital” trailers.View image in fullscreenA shot from the specially filmed Terminator 2 teaser trailer, with Arnold Schwarzenegger.Photograph: TristarThanks in part to the sorry efforts achieved so far, none of the editors I spoke to are too worried about AI. Dan Noall, who works mostly with independent film studios, points out that large language models “by definition produce an average approximation of what you ask it to do”, having been fed, say, 100 comedy trailers; or told to find scenes that represent the overall message of a film. says: “Clients don’t want average, they want something that stands out. AI would produce something incredibly lazy.” Brady and Watters haven’t detected much anxiety, either. Brady says: “It’s like clothes – you can buy a suit at Macy’s or wherever. But then there will always be the people who need Savile Row. You’ll always still need the person that cuts the suit to perfection.”Attack of the spoilers: are trailers giving away too much?Read moreThe problem with the AI trailer for Morgan, ultimately, is that it doesn’t make you feel anything. The best trailers are ballets of condensed emotion; shots of what you might experience over two or three hours in the cinema. Piedot vividly remembers hiring the VHS for Total Recall from Blockbuster in 1991, not because of the film, but for the specially filmedTerminator 2 teaserthat preceded it; the camera crawling up a robotic body until it reaches Arnold Schwarzenegger’s face. “I must have watched and rewatched it 100 times.” Looking back on his favourite trailers, DiBenedetto reflects that they often age badly, as they land so squarely in their moment, playing on the references, experiences, memoriesand excitement of the people sitting in the cinema that day.Brady and Watters are still hoping to develop that original film project, the one they needed a trailer for. The book they want to adapt contains a scene about a character desperate to ditch his date at a drive-through cinema, until he sees the trailers come on. “And he says something like: ‘I always have to watch the trailers,’” Brady says, eyes lit up, “Because they give me hope there’s something coming in the future.”Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

However, some years later, when a similarly excitable Rolling Stone magazine declared that “modern rock’n’roll reached its peak in 1978” with Pere Ubu’s debut album The Modern Dance, the band’s singer David Thomas took it as a challenge. “I wasn’t going to stop making music in 1978 just because everybody said ‘they’ve ended rock’n’roll’,” he insisted later. “I had – I have – other things to say.”Thus, by the time of his death this week aged 71, he’d made a further 18 studio albums and dozens more live albums with Pere Ubu, plus many others as a solo artist with a myriad of backing bands. He performed in theatrical productions and delivered lectures. Another LP was apparently almost finished, along with an autobiography. He carried on performing even aftertechnically dying twiceand subsequently requiring kidney dialysis and a Zimmer frame. “I’m sort of glad that I can’t jump around any more because I don’t have to worry about falling into the drums,” he gleefully insisted. “All my concentration goes into singing.” Absurdly, given his gargantuan critical reputation, he once attributed his almost pathological desire to keep working to a feeling that “artistically, my entire life is failure. I want to get it right”.Thomas was once introduced to Brian Wilson with the words: ‘Meet the other genius’In fact, had this son of a literary professor stopped at The Modern Dance, he would have already sealed his legacy as one of rock’s great outsider innovator-pioneers. Thomas’s infamously self-destructive first band,Rocket from the Tombs, were only together for a few months in Cleveland, Ohio between 1974 and 1975 yet created a prototype for punk cited as a major influence by Ramones, Devo and the Fall. Then, Pere Ubu’s “avant garage” – a turbulent mix of punk, garage, art rock, jazz, experimental noise and influences ranging from MC5 to Sun Ra – ushered in a no wave/postpunk sound and inspired bands including Joy Division, Gang of Four, Sonic Youth, REM and Pixies. Other fans ranged from Rebus writer Ian Rankin to Beach Boys lyricistVan Dyke Parks, who once introduced Thomas to Brian Wilson with the words: “Meet the other genius”.On a mission to “challenge the narrative” and “rewrite the rules of musical production”, Pere Ubu’s groundbreaking early albums laid out Thomas’s mission to take rock music into new areas, whether those areas welcomed it or not. A colossus of a man with a yelping, howling voice, in his earlier years he would career around the stage, leaving audiences open-mouthed. He put on “Disastodromes” – festivals of noise acts promising “confused, liberating disorder” – and even a rock adaptation of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales. He was a fearless, vivid, literary lyricist, describing guitars as sounding “like a nuclear destruction”, and visions such as “the stars on fire, the world in flames”, as he insisted that rock could and should be “smart”.Musicians who worked with him knew they had to be on their mettle. There would be freaky pre-gig monologues, or lyrics they’d hear for the first time when he sang them. Original Ubu keyboardist Allen Ravenstine described “brutal” creative sessions, yet Thomas insisted that the 20 musicians he worked with in Ubu over the years would welcome further work together.His stature and fierce intellect could certainly make for an intimidating presence, but behind it all were a gleeful, childlike playfulness and thrilled fascination with the absurdities of human life. Once, in Manchester, he started a show with a hilarious monologue in which Bon Jovi and Madonna were reduced to playing Holiday Inns while Pere Ubu had a global No 1. When he mock-cantankerously forbade the audience to clap, they cheered him to the rafters. Although the band spent time on a major label, Thomas was one of the few great artists of his generation who never compromised his art to become popular, declaring: “The only reason I would have liked to have been rich and famous is because I would have spent the money on even more outrageous projects.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPere UbuPop and rockPunkExperimental musiccommentShareReuse this content"

In real life, however, it would be silly to assume that someone would be creatively barren enough to make a film based on Kool-Aid. And this is because in real life people are creatively barren enough to make a film about Toys R Us.Variety has reported that a live-actionToysR Us movie is in the works, made by Toys R Us Studios which is apparently a real thing that exists in the world. The movie is said to be a live-action film, along the lines of Night at the Museum and Big, which “aims to capture that childhood wonder in a modern, fast-paced adventure that taps into the Toys R Us brand’s relevance across its more than 70 years in the toy industry.” And quite frankly this couldn’t have come soon enough, because if my children have been crying out for anything, it’s a film about the brand relevance of a shop.View image in fullscreenPink pounds … Barbie dolls on sale in 2021.Photograph: Andrew Kelly/ReutersThis is where we are. First they made films about people. Then they made films about toys. And now they’re making films about the shops where people buy toys. The logical endpoint of this are films about the various industrial components that are manufactured to build the shops where people buy toys. Again, I am all for this. If anyone in Hollywood needs someone to write a fast-paced Jumanji-style adventure movie based on the Hitachi Primairy R32 light commercial inverter heat pump split system commercial air conditioning unit, please do get in touch because this exact thing has long been my dream.Obviously we have Barbie to blame for this. For years, films based on brands were just about as low-rent as you could get, appealing to the audience’s sense of baseline recognition over other factors such as talent or quality. Nobody went to see the Battleship movie because it looked good; they either went to see it because they were prompted by dull nostalgia or they happened to be bizarre Rihanna completists.But Barbie changed all that. Barbie was self-aware and auteur-driven, and demonstrated that there was a way to slightly elevate miserable brand properties. So now we live in a world where JJ Abrams is making a“grounded and gritty” Hot Wheels movieand Daniel Kaluuya is producinga Barney the Dinosaur filmthat is apparently heavily influenced by the work of Charlie Kaufman.To the credit of Toys R Us, their movie doesn’t sound anywhere near as sophisticated as this. It sounds like the retail version of Ready Player One, where hundreds of immediately identifiable toy characters will come to life and playfully terrorise (I’m guessing) Jack Black for one hour and 28 minutes.But still, Toys R Us? In the year 2025? The same Toys R Us that filed for bankruptcy and closed its UK stores in 2017 before announcing new ones last year? The same Toys R Us that has zero brand recognition among its target audience? The same Toys R Us that, even for those old enough to have visited in its pomp, is best remembered for its absolute and total lack of any magic whatsoever? Based on my experience, that means the Toys R Us movie is going to be one of two things: it’s either going to be a movie about a chilly warehouse that smells vaguely of urine, or it’s going to be very inventive indeed.I suppose, if nothing else, Toys R Us does at least have an identifiable corporate mascot in the form of Geoffrey the Giraffe. So at the very least it won’t just be a transparent attempt to try and mash a recognisable narrative out of 70 years of distantly familiar toy brands. It will be a transparent attempt to to mash a recognisable narrative out of 70 years of distantly familiar toy brandsthat has a massive lifelike giraffe in it.

Now a new show celebrates an artist dedicated to documenting the underdogSkye SherwinThu 24 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 10.21 EDTShareIn 1975, when Mao Ishikawa was in her early 20s, she took a job in a bar frequented by Black American GIs stationed at Camp Hansen, in Okinawa. She had grown up hating the Americans who controlled her home island and, to this day, maintain military bases there. Yet she found kindred spirits among the soldiers and her fellow barmaids, with whom she lived and loved and also photographed. These images became her first major documentary series, Red Flower: The Women of Okinawa, and capture a sense of their youthful freedom and outsider bonhomie, from the group of men and women hanging out in bed to the trio hitting the town for a night out, the women’s hair teased into afros, massive hoop earrings glinting.Like much of what you can discover in Ishikawa’s first UK survey, spanning her five-decade career – from dockworkers to travelling actors or downtown Philadelphia’s African American community – these are natural, intimate photographs of a hidden world that could only have been taken by an insider. They are an act of political resistance, too.Ishikawa explains how her antipathy towards the American occupiers was inevitable during a period when everything was “rotten and collapsing”. The US had been an oppressive presence in Okinawa since the aftermath of the second world war. Though governance of the island was returned to Japan in 1972, military bases remained, serving as a stop-off for returning troops during the Vietnam war and as a deterrent to a potential threat from China. When Ishikawa came of age, crimes committed by soldiers against Okinawans, including an alarming number ofsexual assaults, were tried in military courts, with suspects frequently acquitted and discharged. Okinawa had apparently been discarded by Japan, and both Americans and the Japanese, she says, saw Okinawans as “less than human”.Taking a photograph of someone in an intimate moment only happens after I’ve spent time with them, and always with permission“It made me passionate,” she says. “I have a lot of anger; sometimes it surprises people, but it’s my motivation as well.” When Ishikawa turned her lens on barmaids and American soldiers, she’d recently returned from a brief stint in Tokyo where she’d attended the new photography school set up byShomei Tomatsu, a driving force behind the medium’s golden age in postwar Japan who would later champion her work. Her studies weren’t curtailed by a lack of focus. She wanted to pursue the one subject that really mattered to her, documenting Okinawa’s overlooked.Like the chronicler of the New York underground, Nan Goldin, to whom she’s been compared, Ishikawa gets involved in what she catches on camera, describing it once as her own “emotional record”. Where this immersive method has taken her is a continual surprise. A Port Town Elegy, the project that emerged a decade after Red Flower, focused on some of Okinawa’s most intimidating figures: burly dockworkers who lived fleeting lives of long fishing tours, money blown in brothels, constant fights and time in and out of jail. “They were fierce-looking, like yakuza gangsters,” she recalls. “They had a very closed community and people feared them though I always have an urge to explore what seems offputting or unknown.”When it comes to Ishikawa’s talent for overcoming barriers and capturing authentic experience, one series particularly stands out. Life in Philly, focused on African Americans in Philadelphia in 1986, is testament to the trust she establishes with her subjects. It captures an everyday world, including people lying around naked, in the aftermath of sex. She explains: “Taking a photograph of someone in an intimate moment would happen only after I’d spent a lot of time with them, and always with permission. You might think I’m a bold person, but I’m also very sensitive. I love humans. That’s my main drive, and it gives me the courage to approach them.”Mao Ishikawa is at Warwick Arts Centre, Coventry,1 May to22 June.Five highlights of the exhibitionA Port Town Elegy, 1983–86 (main picture)Ishikawa ran a pub where she got to know Okinawa’s stevedores, one of whom became her partner. She began photographing this distinctly man’s world at a little house where they’d drink all day. If they started to fight, Ishikawa just kept shooting quietly. Her images give a rare insight into their existence, balancing the grit with companionship and release.View image in fullscreenUchinaa Shibai (Okinawan Play): A Story of Nakada Sachiko’s Theater Company (1977- 1992).Photograph: Mao IshikawaUchinaa Shibai (Okinawa Play): A Story of Nakada Sachiko’s Theater Company, 1977–92Ishikawa spent years photographing the traditional Okinawan theatre company Diego-Za on stage and behind the scenes. She was so moved by their struggle to keep the island’s traditional culture alive she offered to abandon photography and join the troupe. “They gently rejected me,” she laughs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She let circumstances lead her where they would: “I’ve always sided with those who are weaker. I saw how the Black soldiers were bullied by the whites. Not that these guys didn’t fight back.

He now lives and works in Portugal, and is currently the subject of a large retrospective at the Seattle Museum of Art including four decades of work.His new project at the Franklin D Roosevelt Four Freedoms state park, a place on the southernmost tip of Roosevelt Island that memorializes the 32nd president’s famous speech on human rights, embodies the artist’s “personal commentary on what is unfolding politically and culturally in our time”, Weiwei told theNew York Times. It is the first commission by Art X Freedom, which provides an annual budget of $250,000 for works altering the 3.5-acre park. Each artist will also receive a $25,000 prize.“Public art is a mirror to our times,” said the initiative’s co-chair, philanthropist Agnes Gund. “Art X Freedom speaks to the urgent need to protect freedom for all, including freedom of speech, expression and the right to dissent – values that are the bedrock of democracy and justice.”Added Allison Binns, a venture capitalist who serves as Gund’s co-chair: “Ai Weiwei is globally renowned for his provocative and thought-provoking body of work and his staunch and unwavering advocacy for human rights. We could not have found a more perfect partner or resonant project to help us introduce Art X Freedom to the world and inspire park visitors.”Camouflage will remain on view until 1 December 2025. The conservancy will announce finalists for the September 2026 installation in the fall of this year.Explore more on these topicsAi WeiweiNew YorkDesignnewsShareReuse this content"

We deliver the programme to you in a way you want to watch it.” Declining box office takings forced the question, he continued, of “What is the consumer trying to tell us?” Sarandos’s verdict: “That they’d like to watch movies at home.”Asked whether he felt making movies for people to watch in cinemas as a communal experience was increasingly obsolete, Sarandos said, “I believe it is an outmoded idea, for most people – not for everybody.”In 2019, Netflix took over the last single-screen movie theatre in Manhattan, but since the pandemic, the streamer’s primacy has accelerated – although a much-coveted best picture Oscar still eludes the company.Sarandos went on to credit Netflix for making consumers more broad-minded, saying subscribers frequently view numerous different genres. He then noted that a promotional event for wrestling event WWE Monday Night RAW included a live chamber music performance inspired by Netflix’s bodice-ripping hit Bridgerton.Earlier on Wednesday, Saranos had said that the entertainment industry often gets “thrown under the bus” when it comes to trade deals. He later expanded on this, saying that free trade agreements with other territories might include an exception for entertainment, requiring a minimum investment obligation that only the entertainment businesses have to follow.“What I was saying is, it’s often that the entertainment industry doesn’t get treated like a real business, and that’s one of the examples of it,” he said.There are fears in Hollywood that Donald Trump’s tariff battles may affect the reach of entertainment such as TV shows and films.Earlier this month China announced it will further curb the number of US films allowed to screen in the country, in response to Trump’s imposition of heavy tariffs on Chinese imports.“The wrong action of the US government to abuse tariffs onChinawill inevitably further reduce the domestic audience’s favourability towards American films,” the China Film Administration said. “We will follow the market rules, respect the audience’s choice, and moderately reduce the number of American films imported.”Explore more on these topicsFilm industryTed SarandosNetflixTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

The former BBC reporter “instigated the exposure of Bashir’s deceit in persuading Diana to be interviewed”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

And in 2021 he filed a freedom of information request to the BBC, for emails relating to Bashir sent between corporation bosses over a three month period in 2020. He was ultimately sent more than 3,000 messages, amounting to 10,000 pages.In an email sent on 19 October 2019, a lawyer told an editor of Panorama that the BBC was “not releasing all of the internal investigations documents at this present time”,the BBC later reported. Webb said the broadcaster “clearly admit that documents were being withheld”, amounting to a “cover-up”.Dianarama is the “true story of one of the biggest scandals in public life and broadcasting history, revealing a cover-up of staggering proportions, and around which questions persist to the present day,” said the publisher in its acquisition statement.“It’s rare to come across a book that presents a radical reappraisal of a major historical event, let alone one written by the individual who, through dogged perseverance, brought that history to light,” said Daniel Bunyard, publishing director at Penguin imprint Michael Joseph, which will publish the book on 20 November, exactly 30 years after the interview aired.“This is a ‘David versus Goliath’ tale, a lone journalist holding one of the most venerable of British institutions to account, along with very senior figures within it.”Explore more on these topicsBooksDiana, Princess of WalesMonarchyBBCPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

Iran is the second highest incarcerator, with 43, down from 49 a year earlier, although those released had been freed with conditions that forced them into silence.Israel is in fifth place, with 21 writers behind bars, including eight in administrative detention – statistics at odds with the country’s self-proclaimed status as a democracy that tolerates dissent. Other prominent incarcerators are Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey, a Nato ally and ostensibly still a democracy under the leadership of its strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.Majority of attempts to ban books in US come from organised groups, not parentsRead moreThe index has been published for the past six years and has hitherto generally highlighted the dangers faced by writers living under repressive regimes, although Israel also appeared in the previous year’s report.While making no explicit mention of threats to free speech under the US president following a spate of arrests of foreign students who have campaigned for Palestinian rights and accusations of trying to curtail academic freedom, its text clearly hints at the potential for a future clampdown.“As geopolitics continue to shift and authoritarian tendencies spread to countries that were once considered safely anchored in openness, we are seeing that free expression, and therefore writers, are increasingly in the crosshairs of repression in a much wider range of countries,” says the index.“[Governments] recognize the power of words to affirm historical truths, give voice to those whose narratives have been excised from the historical ledger, develop or maintain culture, and hold institutions to account … Democracies have been slow to understand that attacks on writers are both the precursor to and a consequence of broader attacks on human rights, democracy, and free expression.”In an interview, Karin Deutsch Karlekar,PENAmerica’s director of writers, said the comments reflected a fear for writers on the domestic front, saying that the US had not witnessed such a “broad and deep attack on ideas” since the McCarthyite anticommunist witch-hunts of the 1950s.She cited the case ofRümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University in the US on a Fulbright scholarship, who was detained and earmarked for deportation after co-authoring an opinion article criticizing Israel’s military offensive in Gaza.“People are being detained for their ideas and their writing in the US. This is definitely worrying,” she said.“I would say it’s only probably a matter of time when writers that we would include in our database and index in the US being detained as well. I fully expect that next year, we may well have cases in the United States in our index.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If the US is really stepping back in terms of its role of defending free expression and being a standard bearer for this issue, that’s big blow in terms of global trends and getting writers out of jail in other countries.”Explore more on these topicsPENCensorshipChinaIranIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But president Michael I Kotlikoff wrote in a public statement: “In the days since Kehlani was announced, I have heard grave concerns from our community that many are angry, hurt, and confused that Slope Day would feature a performer who has espoused antisemitic, anti-Israel sentiments in performances, videos, and on social media. While any artist has the right in our country to express hateful views, Slope Day is about uniting our community, not dividing it.”Kehlani, whose first two albums reached the US Top 3 in 2017 and 2020, has publicly supported Palestine a number of times. She appeared in front of Palestinian flags in the video to her 2024 song Next 2 U, wearing a suit stitched with keffiyeh scarf material. The video also features the words “long live the intifada” at the outset, a phrase which has been chanted at protests over the Israel-Gaza war.“Intifada” has been used to name particular armed conflicts between Palestinians and Israelis, and also to general Palestinian resistance to Israel. Some US politicians and academics have equated the term, which translates as “shaking off”, with calls for violence, even genocide, against Jewish people.In an Instagram post announcing the song, Kehlani quoted US artist-activist Toni Cade Bambara’s aphorism “the role of the artist is to make the revolution irresistible”, and added: “As an artist, i was nervous [to release Next 2 U]. terrified … paired with the crippling wonder of what music is appropriate to drop during the most historical tragedies of our generation.” A T-shirt made in Palestine was sold alongside the song to raise funds for aid organisation Operation Olive Branch.In a video in May 2024 castigating some of her music peers for their lack of comments on the war, Kehlani said “fuck Israel, fuck Zionism”.The Guardian has contacted representatives of Kehlani for comment.Kotlikoff acknowledged that “my decision will be celebrated by some and criticised by others. I believe it is the right thing to do and the decision I must make to ensure community and safety at this high-profile event”.Numerous US university campuses have seen pro-Palestine protests on their grounds since the October 2023 outbreak of war, and in March this year, 60 universities were sent warning letters by the Department for Education, telling them to “fulfill their obligations … to protect Jewish students on campus”. Secretary of education Linda McMahoncharacterisedthe campus protests as “relentless antisemitic eruptions”.In a subsequentNew York Times op-ed, without making direct reference to the warnings, Kotlikoff defended Cornell’s handling of a protest during an event with Israeli and Palestinian speakers. “Universities, despite rapidly escalating political, legal and financial risks, cannot afford to cede the space of public discourse and the free exchange of ideas,” he wrote. “Democracies are not silent places, and neither are universities. They are vibrant, active and sometimes unruly; differences are aired, disagreements argued, voices raised.”Earlier this month, the Trump administration froze $1bn in federal funding for Cornell university, with university officials acknowledging they had received “more than 75 stop work orders” relating to various research grants.The proposed Kehlani concert is the second live music event this week to face criticism over artists’ support for Palestine and condemnation of Israel, following the performance ofIrish rappers Kneecapat California’s Coachella festival.Their performance featured a backdrop with the words: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people” and “Fuck Israel. Free Palestine.”Pro-Israel groups, Fox News presentersand Sharon Osbourneall criticised Kneecap, with Osbourne calling for their US work visas to be revoked and accusing them of “aggressive political statements … this band openly support terrorist organisations.”Kneecap responded by saying: “Statements aren’t aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.”Explore more on these topicsKehlaniR&BPop and rockUS universitiesFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

Guided by his “vocal double”, participants will record their own voice reel, “until the experience takes an unexpected turn”, say organisers.The installation, called Vocalize, “is a brilliant fusion of art and entertainment, revealing both the wonders and pitfalls of AI”, said Fry. “As this technology shapes our future, it urges us to pause, reflect, and question: where are we heading and who gets to decide?”In 2023,Fry revealedthat his recordings of the seven volumes of the Harry Potter books had been used to create an AI version of his voice for the narration of a historical documentary. “I said not one word of that – it was a machine. Yes, it shocked me”, he said at the time.The AI tool could “have me read anything from a call to storm parliament to hard porn, all without my knowledge and without my permission.” On hearing about it he told his agents, who “went ballistic”.He has since spoken about AI multiple times. In January, he compared AI to contaminated water, warning that in the future it could have “raw sewage and chemicals and all kinds of nonsense in it”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It is partly supported by Arts Council England among other organisations.“We wanted audiences to feel what manipulation truly means”, said Vocalize’s creators. “When the viewer becomes the protagonist, the boundary between truth and fabrication starts to dissolve… As artists, we’re drawn to exploring AI not only to unlock its creative potential, but also to confront the risks and ethical dilemmas it presents.”Explore more on these topicsBooksStephen FryArtificial intelligence (AI)Hay festivalnewsShareReuse this content"

MC5 were playing on the radio.” The statement continues: “He will ultimately be returned to his [family] home, the farm in Pennsylvania, where he insisted he was to be ‘thrown in the barn’ … We’ll leave you with his own words, which sums up who he was better than we can: ‘My name is David Fucking Thomas… and I’m the lead singer of the best fucking rock and roll band in the world.’”That band were indeed a force to be reckoned with, channelling the raucous, raw energy of garage rock into adventurous songwriting decked out with saxophones, funky bass and Thomas’s spirited exclamations. With a post-punk spirit even before punk had properly got going, Pere Ubu were a big influence on the alt-rock that emerged in the 1980s including bands such as Pixies.Born in Miami and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, Thomas formed his first band Rocket From the Tombs in 1974, who, despite some notoriously energised live shows couldn’t find a record deal and never put out studio material. Thomas later said he was dismayed by the band’s desire to play cover versions, and “knew that Rocket From the Tombs was dead”.Thomas then formed Pere Ubu, taking their name from a character in a play by absurdist French writer Alfred Jarry. “It was a name that wouldn’t mean anything to 95% of an audience,” he later said. “I wanted to create a band that Herman Melville, William Faulkner or Raymond Chandler would have wanted to be in.”Debut single 30 Seconds Over Tokyo was released in 1975, and the band impressed an A&R at Mercury Records, which created a whole new imprint for their 1978 debut album The Modern Dance. Described as “harsh and wilfully ugly” in Rolling Stone, it contained superb vocal performances from Thomas, such as the exhilarating rant of Life Stinks, and while it wasn’t a commercial success it chimed with a growing post-punk movement.The band broke up briefly in 1979, then for a longer period after fifth album Song of the Bailing Man. Thomas put out a series of records away from the group, with backing bands such as the Pedestrians and the Wooden Birds, before Pere Ubu reformed in 1987. This was the beginning of the band’s most commercially successful phase, with a major label behind them, prompting minor MTV hits such as Waiting For Mary, and appearances on British TV.They released 14 albums in the following years, with Thomas the sole founder member leading a changing lineup of more than 20 musicians. “If I called up 20 of the 21 tomorrow they’d come back. They love to work with me,” Thomastold the Guardianin 2022.Pere Ubu’s David Thomas: ‘I expect rock music to be smart’Read moreThomas also had intriguing side projects, such as an appearance in Rogue’s Gallery, a star-studded concert series performing pirate songs (he also performed What Will We Do With a Drunken Sailor on a 2006 album that also featured Sting, Lou Reed and Nick Cave) and a 2002 West End production of “junk opera” Shockheaded Peter. A five-starGuardian reviewhailed his “gravitas” and said: “Thomas adds immeasurably to the freakshow appeal.”He later lived with kidney disease. The Facebook post announcing his death stated Thomas had been recording an album that “he knew was to be his last”. The album will be completed after his death, along with an autobiography and an archival project of live concerts.Explore more on these topicsPere UbuPunkPop and rockExperimental musicnewsShareReuse this content"

Under the direction of Marc Bruni, it starts big, in sound and look, as the world of spoiled old-money couple, Tom (Jon Robyns) and Daisy Buchanan (Frances Mayli McCann), collides with that of the self-made Jay Gatsby (Jamie Muscato).But it has nowhere to go from there: with every ostrich-filled scene and iceberg-sized setting, designed by Paul Tate DePoo III, it appears more like a Las Vegas casino with bursts of lurid light and ever more showboating sets.The music by Jason Howland, and lyrics by Nathan Tysen, comprise cruise-liner material too, by turns trite, tinkly and bombastic, from the opening number, Roaring On, onwards. It is unfortunate, given the strong vocal capabilities of the cast.The unfettered parties at Gatsby’s swanky mansion are antiseptic despite the eye-catching array of costumes designed by Linda Cho (a dazzle of beaded frocks, flapper headdresses and glittery Mary Janes). Dominque Kelley’s choreography gives period moves (Charlestons galore) Beyoncé-style inflections but it looks sterile for the lack of emotional drama around it, while the book, by Kait Kerrigan, merely tells you what is going on, and who is who.View image in fullscreenA bit too relatable … Corbin Bleu (Nick Carraway) in The Great Gatsby: A New Musical.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianFitzgerald’s central couple fizz with charisma on the page, lighting up every room with their smiles, but here they are smoothed to two dimensions, as slick and empty-eyed as those of Doctor TJ Eckleberg’s in the advert that looms behind them. They all seem breezy and rather amicable, including the supercilious Tom, while Gatsby is something of a cypher. That is no fault of the cast – the mood is simply too perky, the pace brisk and breezy, the story’s heart subsumed by the mission to put on a high-octane musical.Puttin’ on the Fitz! The Great Gatsby: A New Musical – in picturesRead moreThere is no depth of emotion to the love story between Jay and Daisy, no sultriness to Tom’s affair with the wife of petrol pump attendant, Myrtle (Rachel Tucker), and no icy heat to the romance between Jordan (Amber Davies) and Nick Carraway (Corbin Bleu). Here, she excitedly asks for his hand in marriage – but why? Gatsby’s dodgy business is flat-footedly conveyed in the song, Shady, while his associate, Meyer Wolfsheim (John Owen-Jones) is about as sinister as a Bugsy Malone extra.Then there is the problem of Nick. The show’s narrator is far removed fromthe voice of Fitzgerald’s lone observer. He resembles a relatable, hapless type from a modern relationship TV drama – quite literally the guy next door. He squirms when things turn bad and talks of journalling about his post-traumatic stress disorder from the Great War. The babbling tone of his narration turns Fitzgerald’s prose – full of poetic restraint – into rambles.And despite the glut of vocal and visual crescendos, the peaks of the story flatline, from the violence by Tom that breaks Myrtle’s nose to the shooting at the ending. Fresh from Broadway, this production encapsulates the worst of peacockingly splashy entertainment – the kind whose soul has been suctioned out in the making.At theColiseum, London, until 7 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreF Scott FitzgeraldreviewsShareReuse this content"

Welsh director Gareth Evans is the action maestro who rocked our world with his superb skull-rattling thrillersThe RaidandThe Raid 2; this new one for Netflix certainly has its fair share of OTT gonzo mayhem. Shootouts in cramped interiors and in the open air sometimes seem to go on so long that the gunfire feels like an extended drumroll. Dozens of people get riddled with bullets from automatic weaponry; they all go into that shoulder-rolling, arm-waving, blood-spurting choreography. At one stage, a comatose and heavily bandaged person in a hospital bed gets the same machine gun treatment, and even this poor guy has to jitterbug, infinitesimally and horizontally, in his hospital pyjamas as he gets filled full of lead.But frankly the action and the violence is too chaotic and almost meaningless and the CGI-Gotham-type cityscape where the drama takes place feels too artificial to me. (The film was actually shot in Cardiff.) Tom Hardy, doing his wheezy-nasal and faintly Cagney tough guy voice, plays Walker, a disillusioned but basically decent cop, who has found himself coerced into doing dirty work for corrupt politician Lawrence Beaumont, played byForest Whitaker.When Beaumont’s son Charlie (Justin Cornwell) is wanted for involvement in drug running and apparently slaying a pampered young prince of the Chinese gangs, it is Walker who has to somehow rescue Charlie both from the police and the vengeful triads. He has the help of a smart young rookie cop Ellie (Jessie Mei Li) but must face a horribly corrupt and cynical officer, Vincent, played by the reliably malign Timothy Olyphant.Evans certainly brings the craziness and the violence but, for me, without the stylish martial arts of his Raid films and without any plausible sense that anything is believably at stake.Havoc is on Netflix from 25 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsTom HardyForest WhitakerGareth EvansreviewsShareReuse this content"

A figure lying on its back, in this show of his early works, is made of solid sheets of lead, welded neatly into the form of a man, based like so much of his work on the dimensions of Gormley’s own body. Two small holes at the nose are the only perforations in an otherwise uniform metal structure. They’re not nostrils though, oh no: “Two holes at the nose reinforce the notion of the body as a conduit between physical and transcendent realms.” Gesundheit!It’s the kind of overblown over-justification that has always blighted the work of Gormley. His body forms dot the country, peering out to sea along Crosby Beach, standing with wings spread at Gateshead, looming out at you from the lobbies of countless bank HQs. For the past 30-odd years, Gormley has been everywhere, his simple, stark figures acting as cyphers for the very act of existence in the modern world. Where you see a Gorm, you see yourself, you see humankind, persevering, surviving in nature, in the sea, in banks.White Cube is focusing on his first steps towards becoming a household name, with early experiments in lead. These are the first footprints left by a giant of contemporary British art. The earliest, Land Sea and Air from 1977-79, is three boulder forms plopped on the ground, all grey and weathered and wrapped in lead. One is a granite rock from a beach in Ireland, the other two are water and air from the same place, though you’ll never know which is which unless you pick them up or give them a quick toe punt (don’t try it – the security guards are extremely vigilant at White Cube).View image in fullscreenUsing the material of bullets … Close I, 1992 Lead, fibreglass, plaster and air.Photograph: Photograph by Stephen White & Co © the artistDespite its obvious poisonous qualities, the lead wrapping acts as a form of preservation, saving these elemental materials from destruction. And destruction at the time the work was made must have felt imminent, with Europe haunted by the cold war, nuclear annihilation a constant threat.So Gormley turned to lead, the material of bullets, to save, record and preserve what we are. The middle of the gallery is filled with objects arranged in size, starting at a pea then a banana, a grenade, a lemon, a lightbulb, a club, a squash, a ball, each wrapped in lead. Next to it, lead bullets have been left a pile, a grey shape on the wall is a lead-wrapped machete. Violence, death, injury – Gormley saw it everywhere. The symbolism is incredibly heavy-handed, appropriately enough for lead, but it works.Downstairs things get more familiar, as the gallery gets filled with Gorminators, the body-shaped statues that have become his signature. One lies face down with legs spread on the cold concrete, another pulls its knees into its chest and buries its head in its arms. The largest, a walking figure in the middle of the space, has had its head swapped for a huge 5m-long building. Each work is made of lead, the welding lines acting like enormous scars across their bodies. They’re desolate, desperate things.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These can’t just be left as bodies preserved against imminent death. Instead, he says things like: “I have always thought of the darkness of the body as being equivalent to the darkness of the universe.” The insistence on the universal and transcendent, the idea of Gormley’s body as a metaphor, a stand-in for wider humanity, has always grated. It pulls it all out of the real and shoves it into the realm of existential nonsense. It makes the reasoning behind the work so vague and overblown, leaving it pretty meaninglessness in the process.Which is a pity, because if you can manage to wade through the fog of waffle that engulfs these early pieces, there’s something quite special here. These are works of profound fear and paranoia. The lead that has replaced the flesh on these bodies is the material of war. They are human munitions now, bullets waiting to be fired, shields ready to be sacrificed. They cower in fear or lie prone waiting for inevitable annihilation. Everywhere he looks, he seem to see death looming. The work might be a product of its time, but it still feels upsettingly relevant todayAnthony Gormley: Witness is atWhite Cube, London, until 8 JuneExplore more on these topicsArt and designAntony GormleyExhibitionsSculptureArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Stravinsky’s Dumbarton Oaks was the composer’s first US commission; played in the composer’s two-piano version rather than by chamber orchestra, it seems less an 18th-century homage and more a direct link between the baroque and 20th-century minimalism. A complete contrast comes with Balinese Ceremonial Music by Colin McPhee, who was mining the potential of gamelan music decades before other western composers followed.The playing is finely balanced and unobtrusively imaginative throughout, but it’s the two more recent pieces that are arguably the most interesting.Frederic Rzewski’s Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues is initially unsettlingly inhuman, weaving the protest song into the noise of factory machines: you can picture the pianists as automatons thumping at the keyboards. Finally, there’s the title work, the name of whichJohn Adamsborrowed from a truck stop near the California-Nevada border. Written in 1996, it’s an example of how Adams can make minimalism feel huge and eclectic; the pianists trace its jangling and surging lines brilliantly.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

Circa’s acrobats, five women, five men, look like classical statues slowly coming to life in the Introduction, as their lifts and dives become ever more vertiginous. The Danse Guerrière became a spectacular contest of prowess between two men on a climbing frame, and in Chloé’s Danse Suppliante, a woman hovered and swung with supreme grace in bolts of cloth high above the orchestra. The interlocking bodies of Lever du Jour, suggestive of ancient Greek friezes, were particularly beautiful, though the final Bacchanale, where the music turns orgiastic, eventually coalesces into an aggressive, unresolved standoff between two men.View image in fullscreenSupreme grace … Circa and the LPO perform Daphnis et Chloé.Photograph: Pete WoodheadThe sudden ambivalence, in fact, marked the transition to La Valse with its underlying sense of society careering towards its own destruction. The atmosphere was markedly different. Tracksuits and skirts replaced the clingy lacy outfits worn in Daphnis, and where the latter was danced in pools of light, all pastel shades and purple, the platform now glowed red.The choreography was again spectacular, if more closely woven: we’re now aware of tautness and tension throughout. Routines began and ended in the formality of ballroom hold, which felt increasingly like a constraint, and Gardner ratcheted up the pressure as the waltz itself moved almost imperceptibly from suave elegance to something infinitely more troubling. Lifschitz’s ending, meanwhile, with the 10 acrobats simultaneously performing a different spotlit dance was astonishing, but we were also suddenly and shockingly aware how isolated each had become. Powerful, beautiful stuff, and a most extraordinary evening.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBalletreviewsShareReuse this content"

She is due at a meeting in New York and has decided to get there via a leisurely road trip. But what starts off as a fleeting break from the mundanity of marriage and motherhood turns into a wild and wonderfully odd unravelling. Just half an hour into her journey, she impulsively leaves the freeway and checks into a scruffy motel. There she is electrified by a younger car hire worker who has “a Huckleberry Finn/Gilbert Blythe look that I used to flip out over as a teenager.” After the two lock eyes while he squeegees her windscreen (not a euphemism), she decides to pursue him in an unusually chaste love affair.All Fours – which has been shortlisted for this year’s Women’s Prize for fiction – is narrated by July whose pacy, hypnotic reading skilfully evokes the internal monologue of her protagonist, who pinballs between drily funny and existentially bereft. The book has been called a menopause novel on the basis that it centres on a 45-year-old dismayed at being halfway through her life and past her peak (both her grandmother and aunt killed themselves and she worries she is next in line). But there’s more than just dwindling oestrogen in this frank and subversive tale which reflects on desire, freedom and creativity, and shines a light on the complex inner life of a woman.Available via Canongate, 10hr 13minFurther listeningMaternity ServiceEmma Barnett, Penguin Audio, 1hr50minThe Today presenter narrates her manifesto for rethinking women’s maternity leave based on her own experiences on motherhood’s “frontline”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He did, after all, write this now-venerated concerto largely on the fly, for a soloist whose party piece was playing the violin upside down.View image in fullscreenNicola Benedetti/Aurora Orchestra: Beethoven Violin ConcertoSo it’s apt that Benedetti, Aurora and their conductorNicholas Collonhave recorded an interpretation that’s buoyant, warmly affectionate and at times just a little tongue-in-cheek. You’d expect playfulness in the last movement, but it’s there to some extent throughout, even in Benedetti’s weightless playing of the slow movement. There are striking moments nodding to historical authenticity – the drum, with sticks hard as nails, at the very start, and the vibrato-less strings in the introduction to the slow movement. The drum becomes unusually important, announcing the first-movement cadenza with a huge roll and then joining Benedetti in a rollicking cadenza adapted from Beethoven’s piano version.The recording was made in studio conditions but with all involved playing from memory, as is Aurora’s trademark. Does that make a difference in an audio-only context? Perhaps – there’s certainly a sense of freedom, of phrasing that isn’t bound by bar lines. In any case, the result is music of irresistible ebullience.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

To mark its anniversary, our writer takes on a particularly wild sectionPhoebe SmithThu 24 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Apr 2025 02.02 EDTShareHigh on the ridges of the Pennines, somewhere between the waters of Malham Tarn in the Yorkshire Dales and Kirk Yetholm in the Scottish Borders, a 31-year-old woman stands amid a group of mainly male walkers. She’s wearing bell-bottom jeans, a fitted long-sleeve top and an Alice band to keep her hair out of her face in the prevailing westerly wind. Her name is Joyce Neville and the year is 1952. She’s in the middle of a walk along a proposed national trail – the Pennine WayJoyce had seen an advert for this self-described “Pioneer Walk” in the Sunday newspapers a few months earlier. It was placed by the writer and campaignerTom Stephensonwho was requesting “accomplished walkers, fit and over 18” to take part in a 15-day hike on the “long green trail” he was suggesting be created in Britain (inspired by the US’s 2,200-mile Appalachian Trail). Few women wore jeans back then, according to Joyce’s notes (which were passed on to me by Paddy Dillon, author of Cicerone’sWalking the Pennine Wayguidebook), and the whole trip cost just £25.Pennine Way between Middleton and GreenheadMore than 70 years later, my friend Cerys and I are standing in the Pennines, at the lip of a feature known as High Cup Nick. This glacially scoured U-shaped valley, known as England’s Grand Canyon, sits above the village of Dufton in Cumbria. We are on the first day of a three-day walk on the Pennine Way (which officially opened in 1965) to celebrate its diamond anniversary. We’d begun on a cold but sunny day in February at the waterfall-rich town of Middleton-in-Teesdale, and already scrambled alongside the torrent of Cauldron Snout, listened to the call of corncrakes in the farmland of the Eden Valley, bog-hopped along the path beside MOD Warcop training ground (out of bounds to hikers without prior permission), and arrived at this – one of the geological highlights of the entire 268-mile trail.View image in fullscreenJoyce Neville’s notes from her 1952 Pennines walk.Photograph: Phoebe SmithThe landscape would have been the same when Joyce trod it in the 1950s, though some things have definitely changed.“Back then it was a damn tough walk because all the blanket bog would be trodden into a filthy morass that got to waist-deep at times,” said Paddy when I called him pre-trip to ask advice about the section we had decided to walk, between Middleton-in-Teesdale and Greenhead, inspired by the same three-day trip Stephenson made in 1948 to publicise his cause. He was accompanied by five MPs, among them Barbara Castle (one of the longest serving female MPs in British history) and Arthur Blenkinsop (a Labour MP for South Shields who went on to become vice-president of the Ramblers). “You could have worn waders and it might have kept you clean. Now, thanks to the flagstones, you can do it in carpet slippers.”Joyce noted that when women were expected to wear long tweed skirts for walking, her outfit was regarded as quite scandalousWe weren’t quite so bold as to ditch our hiking boots, but our gear was definitely changed from Joyce’s day. At the time, she notes, when women were expected to wear long tweed skirts for walking, her outfit was regarded as quite scandalous. In a way, we have Joyce and other women like her to thank for the fact that we can now wear warm, dry fleece-lined trousers without offending anyone. We also had our lightweight waterproof jackets, and didn’t have to carry heavy canvas bell tents like they did. When Joyce was walking this route, hikers had to negotiate with farmers to camp in their fields; later, after the path’s official opening, there were about 20 YHA hostels along the route. There are only a handful left, so guesthouses, pubs with rooms, the occasional campsite and Airbnbs are the way most people do things.View image in fullscreenHigh Cup Nick was one of the early highlights of the writer’s walk.Photograph: Phoebe SmithAs we stand gawping at the crumbling buttresses and pinnacles that line the edges of High Cup, we meet a hiker called Mike, 73, with his dog Ringo, who says he lived along the trail at Earby when the Pennine Way opened.“I remember we’d hear the banging of frying pans before we ever saw the walkers,” he laughs. “They were hanging off the backpacks of the factory workers from Manchester who would clock off on Saturday and start walking and see how far they could get before they had to head back to work on Monday.”Similar to those early walkers, we were squashing our walk in between work. In contrast, we would be staying in warm “hobbit huts” atDufton Caravan Park, having walked fromBrunswick House B&B, run by Andrew Milnes, who told us that trail walkers account for a third of his annual business.We plough through the 17 miles, listening to the song of curlews, spying wild deer and admiring snowdropsDespite good accommodation, the distance is no shorter, and when we arrive into Dufton at dusk we head immediately for a hearty meal atThe Stag Inn– thankful we don’t need to cook our own dinner. We chat to Amanda behind the bar who raves about the section of the trail we were walking. “Do you think it will last another 60 years?” I ask her. “60?” she says. “It will last another 6,000 – it’s not going anywhere.”We were, however, and after a cosy night, we begin our walk on the hardest and highest section of the trail – over Cross Fell, home to the notoriously bitter Helm Wind (the only named wind in the UK). There is frost on the ground, the temperature is -4C (25F).By the time we reach the slopes of the 893-metre (2,930ft) peak, we hit the snowline. It is cold, but the ground is made solid by the frost, and we hike easily to the summit plateau, marked by a great stone cross (reportedly – we later find out from the woman who runs the Post Office at Garrigill – constructed on the trail’s opening by a reverend from Scotland who had received a message “from above” to build it to protect walkers). And as we reach it and see the Lakeland peaks spread out in front of us without even a breath of wind, I muse how perhaps it is working.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The trail’s creator, Tom Stephenson, never actually walked the entirety of his creation, the idea for which came in 1935, three years after the mass trespass ofKinder Scout, a protest in the Peak District for walkers’ rights. “He wasn’t interested in walking it, but he made damn sure other people did,” says Paddy. “His idea was if he could get people en masse into the countryside to areas previously forbidden to walk on, like Kinder Scout and Bleaklow [also in the Peak District], he could use that as a lever to get more rights in general for people to access previously private land.”After a night at theCumberland Innin Alston, we set our compass for Greenhead and Hadrian’s Wall, where we will grab a taxi, then the train at Haltwhistle to head home. We plough through the 17 miles easily, listening to the song of curlews, spying wild deer at the former Lambley station (now a private house), and admiring the snowdrops that have burst through the ground.The Pennine Way was the UK’s first national trail. There are now 17 in England and Wales, and four equivalent long-distance ‘great trails’ in ScotlandSince Stephenson’s pioneered the concept of a walk that allowed everyone to traverse the backbone of England, more routes have been established, such as theSouth Tyne Trail. For 23 miles, it follows the route of the defunct Haltwhistle railway line (closed in 1976; opened as a footpath in 2004) parallel to the Pennine Way and is so much easier and more commonly walked that Paddy has included it in his updated guidebook.The Pennine Way was the UK’s first national trail – there are now 17 in England and Wales, and four equivalent long-distance “great trails” in Scotland. The newest and longest yet, the 2,700-mile King Charles III England Coast Path is due to be fully walkable by the end of 2025; many parts of it are open now. Yet there is still much to fight for. According to the campaigning group Right to Roam, only 8% of England is accessible to hikers – nearly 49,000 miles of historic paths have been removed from official maps and 32,000 rights of way are blocked. Access is even more limited to those wishing to swim, cycle or camp (with one exception – wild camping is legal on Dartmoor, but this is beingcontested in the supreme courtby a wealthy landowner).Sixty years feels like a long time, but walking can still be a political act. And, perhaps, much like Joyce Neville in 1952, we should all hit the trails to exercise our right to roam. Jeans are optional.Explore more on these topicsNorthumberland holidaysEngland holidaysWalking holidaysWalkingUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It makes sense, right?”This year brings the centenary of the chocolate digestive, with the biscuit having been made by McVitie’s since 1925.They were a follow-up to the plain digestive, first manufactured in 1892 but conceived much earlier by two Scottish doctors who believed the sodium bicarbonate ingredient would aid digestion.Consider the biscuitRead moreThey now regularly come top of Britain’s favourite biscuit lists and were followed in a 2020 poll by shortbread, chocolate fingers, jaffa cakes (not a biscuit) and chocolate hobnobs. Chocolate digestives were also named as the best dunker in 2009.In his travel book, Notes From a Small Island, the American-British writer Bill Bryson asked: “What other nation in the world could possibly have given us William Shakespeare, pork pies, Christopher Wren, Windsor Great Park, the Open University, Gardeners’ Question Time, and the chocolate digestive biscuit? None, of course.”The centenary has led to McVitie’s launching one of its biggest ever marketing campaigns, which includes a pop-up chocolate digestive store in Piccadilly Circus, London, from 2-5 May.It is not known whether the store will tell people how to eat their biscuits but, even for factory boss Coulson, old habits die hard.“I still do [eat it chocolate side up] if I’m totally honest,” he admitted.Explore more on these topicsBiscuitsFoodShareReuse this content"
