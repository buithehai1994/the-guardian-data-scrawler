Portraits would display a massive potentate striding ahead of his troops and crushing on his opponents’ skulls.View image in fullscreenA military parade in Paris on Bastille Day.Photograph: Peter Turnley/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesMilitary parades were also integral rituals of the Roman Empire, where generals and emperors who had won battles would march from the field of Mars into the temple of Jupiter, witnessed by thousands of adoring peasants.The looted possessions of conquered nations were said to be conveyed in chariots, while abducted barbarians were dragged along in chains. Slaves were encouraged to murmur “Memento mori” (remember that you will die) to their captors, it is said, as part of a drama supposed to link the Roman public to its leaders.In one depicted image, created in the 19th century by the artist Bartolomeo Pinelli, the Roman military leader, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, is seenleading his triumphant army to Rome after defeating the Gauls, having personally triumphed over their leader in one-to-one combat.These Roman rituals were later adopted by European countries as they evolved into nation states and sought to project images of power and military potency.The military parade is widely believed to have been refined in Prussia, a European state that later became part of a unified Germany under the leadership of Otto von Bismarck.Featuring choreography including salutes, precise spacing between soldiers, and goose steps, the Prussian model became a prototype for other armies in Europe and beyond.View image in fullscreenMilitary vehicles move across Palace Square during the Victory Day parade in Russia on 2025/05/09.Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesOther European countries had different versions, that have in some cases become annual rituals.In Britain, starting during the reign of Charles II, Trooping the Colour is held every year on Horse Guards Parade near Buckingham Palace to celebrate the sovereign’s birthday.This year’s parade, celebrating the birthday of the current King Charles, coincidentally takes place on Saturday, which is also Trump’s 79th birthday.Staring under the Soviet Union and continuing in present day Russia, Moscow plays host on 9 May every year to victory day, commemorating victory over Nazi Germany in the second world war. During the cold war, the parades, featuring Red Army soldiers marching through Red Square viewed by the Soviet leadership, became a symbol of Moscow’s implacable hostility to the west in the ideological struggle between capitalism and communism.View image in fullscreenAdolf Hitler attends Buckeberg Harvest Festival in Germany 1 October 1934.Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesRed Square was the venue for what is believed to be the largest military parade ever staged, on 24 June 1945, when 40,000 troops and 1,800 armored vehicles passed through to mark victory over Germany.This year’s occasion, marking the 80th anniversary of the war’s end, featured even greater pomp than usual, with troops from China, Egypt, Belarus and several central Asian countries marching alongside their Russian counterparts. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, was among several international statesman joining Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, in the reviewing stands.Comparable displays of military muscle are seen in China. The national day parade in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square – marking the anniversary of the Communist regime’s ascent to power – is now a once-a-decade affair but used to occur more regularly.View image in fullscreenRussian military vehicles and weapons are seen during a rehearsal for the Victory Day military parade, which marks the 80th anniversary of the Victory in the Soviet Union’s Great Patriotic War, on 07 May 2025 in Moscow, Russia.Photograph: China News Service/Getty ImagesThe most recent event, which took place on 1 October, 2019 to celebrate the regime’s 70th birthday, was billed as the biggest military parade and mass pageant ever held in China.Beijing’s ally, North Korea, holds annual parades to celebrate the date of the state’s founding, as well as separate events to mark the birthdays of its dynastic leaders.Strikingly, if less well-documented, Pyong Yang’s parades are mirrored by equivalent events in democratic South Korea, which stages armed forces day annually on 1 October to mark the anniversary of its troops crossing the 38th parallel during the Korean War.By contrast, choreographed exhibitions are much rarer in the US.View image in fullscreenKim Jong-un inspects his troops before the parade marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of North Korea in Pyongyang on 09 September 2018, North Korea.Photograph: API/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesThe most recent parade was instigated by Trump himself during his first presidency when – apparently triggered by having watched a Bastille Day parade alongside the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris – his administration organized a Salute to America event to coincide with the 4 July celebrations in 2019.That display on Washington’s national mall included aircraft flyovers, presentations of military vehicles and an address by Trump at the Lincoln memorial.It was the first military parade in the US Capitol since a June 1991 extravaganza, watched by an estimated 200,000 spectators, to celebrate expelling Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi forces from Kuwait in the first Gulf war. Tanks and Patriot missile batteries were rolled out while Stealth fighter jets flew above a parade led by general Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of coalition forces in the conflict.The 1953 presidential inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower, a former general of US and allied forces in the second world war, included a parade by 22,000 troops and even a nuclear-capable canon. In similar vein, John F Kennedy, a decorated military veteran, had military hardware on show at his 1961 inaugural.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump’s Salute to America parade in 2019 is the first military parade in the US Capitol since this June 1991 Desert Storm victory military parade.Photograph: Joe Sohm/Visions of America/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesOthers notable military parades took place to mark the end of the first and second world war, as well as the American Civil War.A ticker tape welcome was afforded victorious troops, including 13,000 members of the 82nd airborne division, in a spectacular victory parade in New York in 1946 that was seen by an estimated four million people.Similar parades were staged in New York and Washington in 1919, with General John Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force that had fought in France, leading 25,000 parading soldiers in full battle dress.In 1865, after Abraham Lincoln’s assassination in the immediate aftermath of the American Civil War, his successor Andrew Johnson ordered a two-day grand review of the armies. The result saw about 145,000 soldiers from the armies of the Potomac, Georgia and Tennessee marching down Pennsylvania Avenue, to be reviewed by victorious Union generals, Ulysses S Grant, William Sherman and George Meade.In general, however, US presidents have avoided explicitly militaristic displays – until now.A stark contrast to Trump’s bullish attitude was offered by his Republican predecessor, Gerald Ford, who declined to take part in the military parades organized for the 1976 bicentennial celebrations, citing the enduring negative sentiment over the Vietnam war.View image in fullscreenParatroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division, which four times parachuted into enemy territory, march through the Washington Square Arch in New York City’s long-awaited victory parade.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveFord’s posture may seem extreme but it may be more in keeping with the feelings of America’s founding fathers towards militarism, according to Jonathan Alter, a historian who has chronicled several US presidencies.“The United States was founded by men who were admirers of the Roman Republic, which had an important law that military commanders could not bring their troops into Rome,” he explained.The law, however was violated by Julius Caesar, who crossed the Rubicon river in 49BC with his forces at the start of a civil war that was to result in him acquiring dictatorial powers.“It was a hugely significant thing, and a violation of 400 years of very important Roman tradition which the founders of our country were quite aware of,” Alter said. “That’s the way military dictatorship lies, if you have the head of state bringing his army into the capital.“We have a more modest tradition when it comes to showing military power. It goes back to George Washington. There’s always been a sense that tanks in the capital are a bad sign, even if it’s just for a parade.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS militaryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then came the shattered glass as rocks exploded through windows. Then the flames, licking up curtains and spreading to sofas, carpets, books and framed pictures until smoke billowed into the summer night.They might have been scenes from another century, another country, but they played out inNorthern Irelandthis week in the glare of rolling news and social media, which recorded a soundtrack of glee and hate. “Where are the foreigners?” the mob shouted.The targets werefamilies that were different– different nationality, different ethnicity, different skin tone, different language. The goal was expulsion – or immolation. “There’s someone in that room inside,” said a voice caught on video. “Aye, but are they local?” responded a comrade. “If they’re local, they need out. If they’re not local, let them stay there.”View image in fullscreenA rioter is silhouetted at night with flames in the backgroundPhotograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/ReutersNo one died in Ballymena, the County Antrim town that erupted on Monday andflared for the rest of the week, or in other towns with smaller, copycat mayhem, but families fled, dozens of police were injured and Northern Ireland faced stark questions about racism, xenophobia and intolerance.Three decades ago, the Good Friday agreement drew a line under the Troubles. Republican paramilitaries that wanted a united Ireland, and loyalist paramilitaries that wanted the region to remain in the UK, wound down the killing.Peace brought the novelty of immigration and diversity. In the 2001 census just 14,300 people, or 0.8% of the overall population, belonged to a minority ethnic group. By 2021 it was 65,600 people, or 3.4%. Compared with England (18%), or Scotland (11%), Northern Ireland remains very white.Despite this, many residents in Ballymena, a mainly working-class, Protestant town 25 miles north of Belfast, believe foreigners have “invaded”, “infested” and “ruined” their community.It was not only the hundreds of young men in hoods and masks who hurled missiles: older residents, during lulls in violence, endorsed the disturbances. “We want our voices to be heard. If this is the only way, so be it,” said one woman in her 30s, who declined to be named.The Police Federation of Northern Ireland said its members, by drawing the wrath of mobs, had averted a pogrom.The spark was an alleged sexual assault on a teenage girl by two 14-year-old boys, who appeared in court with a Romanian interpreter and were charged with attempted rape. Loyalist groups in other areas took that as their cue to protest. “It’s time to take a stand and stop welcoming these illegal migrant gangs flocking into our town, paedophiles, drug pushers, human traffickers, prostitutes,” said a group in Portadown, exhorting people to march on a hostel.View image in fullscreenA man cycles past a burnt-out overturned car in Ballymena.Photograph: Niall Carson/PASuch hostility has a blunt, facile explanation: some communities do not like outsiders – a broad, evolving category known occasionally in Northern Ireland as “them ’uns”. Protestant loyalist mobs in Belfast burned Catholics from their homes at the outset of the Troubles in 1969. Ballymena earned notoriety in the 1990s and mid-2000s with sectarian attacks on Catholic schools and churches.Loyalists in nearby towns have been blamed for a sporadic campaign of paint bombs, smashed windows, graffiti and threatening posters targeting non-white residents. Last year at leasteight African families– half of them including nurses – were forced toflee an estate in Antrim town.“There is fundamental racism in some places that, to put it nicely, have a proud sense of social and cultural cohesion,” said Malachi O’Doherty, a commentator and author of How to Fix Northern Ireland. Communities that are accustomed to living on the same estate can bristle when outsiders take houses that might otherwise have gone to friends or relatives, he said. “Whether it’s Catholics or Roma, it’s seen as a dilution of that community.”Just 4.9% of Ballymena’s population is non-white, according to the 2021 census, and very few of the new arrivals are asylum seekers, yet there is widespread belief in proliferating “scrounging refugees”, and scepticism about official statistics. “What we’re reading is completely different from what the government is telling us,” said one resident in his 50s. The riots were welcome and overdue, although, he said, the noise was disturbing his sleep.The current strife has a seasonal aspect: summer is when loyalists – and to a lesser extent republicans – assert their identity by parading with drums and flutes and lighting bonfires, traditions that fuel tension and confrontation.Catholics have joined Protestants in anti-immigrant actions and staged their own protests in Catholic areas, but those eruptions tend to be smaller and less frequent. “Catholics almost take a sectarian pride in not being racist. ‘Oh, we’re not like them,’” said O’Doherty.View image in fullscreenA PSNI vehicle near to debris on fire in Ballymena.Photograph: Liam McBurney/PADespite a gritty reputation, Northern Irelandscores betterfor housing, unemployment and poverty than many parts of England, Wales and Scotland. However, it has some of the worst education attainment rates in the UK and the highest rate of economically inactive people, metrics that hint at the alienation and hopelessness felt in some Catholic and Protestant working-class areas.An education system that largely segregates the two main blocs also tends to silo minority ethnic pupils, said Rebecca Loader, a social science researcher at Queen’s University Belfast. “You have schools that have no diversity and schools with high levels, perhaps just separated by a few miles. Certain classes of people are never meeting. It’s not conducive to meeting and learning about the other.” Also, very little in Northern Ireland’s curriculum addresses racism, unlike curriculums in Britain, especially Wales, she said.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

One is politics. Leaders from across the political spectrum have condemned the violence and appealed for calm, as they did last August during asimilar flare-up. However, critics say some unionist parties – which represent loyalism – give mixed signals by defending “legitimate protest” and amplifying immigration myths.Political unityfractured on Thursdayafter Gordon Lyons, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) communities minister, complained on social media that he had not been consulted about a leisure centre in Larne hosting families evacuated from Ballymena. A short time later, a mob set the centre on fire. Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland secretary, called on Lyons to reflect on his comments. Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin first minister, suggested he should resign.View image in fullscreenA worker at Larne leisure centre, which was damaged during the third night of unrest.Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/ReutersPaul Sceeny, an interim manager at the North West Migrants Forum in Derry, said growing internationalantipathy to immigrantswas affecting Northern Ireland. “People are becoming emboldened to use racist tropes. It’s part of a wider pattern,” he said.The other factor is social media. Protest organisers use Facebook, TikTok and other platforms to rally support and broadcast the results. In Ballymena, rioters reportedly requested likes, follows and gifts from viewers while livestreaming the destruction of a house.During the daytime calm this week, while authorities cleared debris from streets and foreign families packed up and left, youths huddled over phones and analysed clips, like actors reviewing a performance, seeking ways to improve before the next show.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandImmigration and asylumRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

One which has seen Emmanuel Macron confronted over whether it was right to marry his former teacher and Danny Dyer probed about whether he has ajoint bank account with his wife. Celebrities have been caught off guard, or left sobbing and laughing in equal measure.The Assembly, in which an audience of autistic, neurodivergent and learning disabled people ask unpredictable, probing and often remarkably direct questions of a celebrity, has won plaudits and rave reviews since launching in 2022. It has now become an international phenomenon.The show, which originated in France, had more international commissions than the all-conquering reality hit The Traitors last year. The format has already been commissioned across 19 countries, according to an industry report by K7 Media. Ten new versions have already been confirmed.Unusually for a new European format, The Assembly is already making its mark in Asia: it will launch in Singapore in January. It is heading into its fourth series in France and has been a hit in Norway, Australia and Denmark – succeeding on public and private broadcasters.Michael Sheen on The Assembly.Its producers say the authenticity of the show has created its universal appeal – while the clippable content is perfect for a social media age in which broadcasters are desperate to reach younger audiences glued to their feeds.Stu Richards, creative director of the programme’s UK producers Rockerdale Studios, said it was crucial the show was billed as having broad appeal, rather than as a programme highlighting neurodiversity. “It’s not just representation for the sake of it – it’s not tokenistic,” he said. “We see this as mainstream entertainment.”The stripped-back look of the show – shot over three hours in natural light with the camera crew in full view – adds to the sense that viewers are getting an unfiltered experience. “There’s an honesty that you just don’t get in other TV shows,” said Richards.“It has non-culturally specific values like honesty and by extension, empathy. In shows with disabled people, you as a viewer are almost always asked to be sympathetic towards the people you’re seeing. You’re rarely asked to empathise. In this show, our cast have the authorship, they have the agency.”Richards said he was sold on the idea immediately after seeing Macron asked bluntly about the propriety of his marital relationship. “When I saw that question, I thought: this is something unlike any interview format I’ve seen,” he said. “We’ve had interview formats in the past, like Ali G, where people have tried to ask comedically funny questions. But the president of France asked about the age gap with his older wife? Boom, yes. I’m completely in.”For broadcasters desperate to reach new audiences to be found on social media, the format also lends itself to short clips, as an unsuspecting celebrity responds to a left-field question. Several of such clips, featuring Macron,Michael Sheenand the Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in the Danish edition, have gone viral.“That’s the mother load for so many commissioners and broadcasters at the moment,” said Michelle Singer, Rockerdale’s director of production.Coster-Waldau broke down when talking about the death of his alcoholic father. In the Australian edition, the Jurassic Park actor Sam Neill was similarly floored when asked about the best lesson he had learned from his parents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They said the dynamic between the cast and the interviewee meant it was unlike other chatshows or political programmes. “It’s the authenticity,” said Arnaud Renard, co-founder of Can’t Stop Media, the programme’s distributor. “Everybody gets it. Everybody understands it’s a show where we have people that are going to ask unexpected questions – but without bad feelings. We’re not trying to trick people.”Despite the show’s international success, it has had an unusual journey in the UK. A pilot featuring Sheen was made for the BBC, but the corporation is said to have concluded it did not have the funds to make a series. It has since found success on ITV, where the first series featured David Tennant, Jade Thirlwall, Gary Lineker and Dyer – who, among other things, was asked how much he was paid for presenting the Saturday night gameshow The Wall (about £100,000).Bigger names have been booked for follow-up series overseas, though producers are sworn to secrecy. To take it to the next level in the UK, fans are hoping a British politician might be brave enough to enter The Assembly should a second series materialise.“It’s interesting that the idea for this programme grew from the grilling ofEmmanuel Macron.” said Tim Nicholls, assistant director of policy, research and strategy at the National Autistic Society. “Wouldn’t it be great if we could see British politicians subjected to the same scrutiny by autistic interviewers?”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAutismEmmanuel MacronDanny DyerMichael SheennewsShareReuse this content"

How did the capital’s cultural landmarks end up under the thumb of the super-rich elite?Will ColdwellSat 14 Jun 2025 06.45 EDTShareWhen London’s Prince Charles Cinema has something to say, it declares it with large black lettering across its marquee. Once, during a summer heatwave, it beckoned punters with a blunt: SOD THE SUNSHINE COME SIT IN THE DARK. When its doors were boarded up during the first Covid lockdown it went for a rousing: WE’LL BE BACK. And after the coronation of King Charles: NO, WE ARE NOT CHANGING OUR NAME.As is clear from the repertory of films on show – David Lynch classics in 35mm, all-night Japanese horror marathons, Sing-a-long-a-Sound of Music and screenings ofThe Room(frequently with a live Q&A from director Tommy Wiseau) – the cult Leicester Square spot (Quentin Tarantino’s favourite UK cinema) has a unique place in London’s West End. When the cinema found itself facing an existential crisis following a prolonged period of fraught negotiations with its new landlord, passersby only needed to look up to learn that the venue had a fight on its hands. Just three words were pinned to the board: SAVE THE PCC.It was 28 January when the sign went up. The same day, the cinema launched a petition. It decried Zedwell LSQ, a subsidiary of Criterion Capital (one of the biggest property players in Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus), for using its “significant financial resources to intimidate us”. Zedwell, the Prince Charles said, was demanding new terms that would make its future unsustainable: higher  rent, a shorter lease and, crucially, a break clause that meant the cinema – which has been on the site since the 60s and operated under its current ownership since 1991 – could be forced to vacate with just six months’ notice.Within 24 hours, the petition had collected more than 100,000 signatories and triggered a slew of coverage.GQ magazine gathered commentsfrom Hollywood heroes including Paul Mescal, Robert Eggers and Christopher Nolan, the latter of whom simply said: “Film culture in Great Britain is unthinkable without the Prince Charles.” Danny Boyle told the magazine: “If this ‘ninth wonder of the world’ ever closes its doors, life will continue but London will die a little death.”View image in fullscreenThe Prince Charles Cinema before the coronation of King Charles.Photograph: James Veysey/ShutterstockAs the furore grew, attention shifted to the man behind Criterion Capital, a businessman named Asif Aziz. This wealthy property magnate – nicknamed “Mr West End” by newspapers after he bought the Trocadero in 2005 – was now thrust into the ring. In 2020, the Times asked if he was “Britain’s meanest landlord” in a story reporting on Criterion’s decision to take commercial tenants to court over unpaid rent during the pandemic. At the same time it was clashing with the Prince Charles, Criterion was ruffling feathers over its plans to buy the Central YMCA, a historic community gym and health club, which now seemed set to be developed into a Zedwell hotel.But to many, what was happening to the Prince Charles Cinema and the YMCA was about something bigger than a negotiation over rent, or the financial viability of a health club. It was about the persistent threat of closure that so many cultural and community spaces in London face, the impact of rampant commercialism on the city’s cultural diversity, and the seemingly unchecked power that developers such as Aziz wield. It was a familiar fable, one that has played out many times before, albeit with different venues and different landlords. As Kate Mossman wrote in a piece for theNew Statesmanlamenting the “death of the West End”: “No city in the UK has developers with the same flagrant disregard for its own culture as London.”Throughout all this, Aziz remained silent – until now. I wanted to find out: who was this publicity-shy property magnate with the power to shape the heart of the capital? What was Mr West End’s vision for, well, the West End? Was he a uniquely hard-nosed operator? Or was focusing on one man a distraction from deeper, systemic issues relating to how urban space is negotiated in the UK? “Asif is very personable,” John Walker, a former director of planning at Westminster council, tells me. “But is often misunderstood.”The first time Ben Freedman, the 64-year-old managing director of the Prince Charles, met Aziz, it was January 2023. Zedwell had just bought the freehold on the building from its previous owners, Soho Estates, and Aziz invited him to his office for a cup of tea. Freedman made the short walk to Babmaes Street, on the other side of Piccadilly Circus, where Criterion’s headquarters is tucked into the ground floor of a glassy modern office building. Inside, he was greeted by Aziz, 58, who is, in many ways, much like Freedman: charming, bespectacled, softly spoken, casually dressed. It was, as Freedman recalls, all very pleasant.Freedman, who knew the cinema’s current lease was due to end in September 2025, was interested in Aziz’s plans for the building. “He said: ‘I don’t really know,’” says Freedman. Aziz asked Freedman if they’d like to stay, to which Freedman said yes. “Then he asked me to do a presentation for his board as to why they should keep us.”Freedman put together a pitch deck, conscious that he was already on the back foot. “You’re a single operator dealing with a company that owns a big chunk of the West End,” he tells me, when we meet in the dimly lit foyer of the cinema in March. “You know … you’re a flea dealing with an elephant.” Still, he had some legal protection. The Prince Charles is covered by the Landlord and Tenant Act (1954), which entitles a tenant to a new lease at market rate unless the landlord intends to redevelop the entire building, or take it back for its own use. As long as Criterion wasn’t planning anything major, and they could agree to the terms of a new lease, everything should have been fine.View image in fullscreenThe London Pavilion building.Photograph: Mark Kerrison/In Pictures/Getty Images“We went back and forth,” says Freedman. “And he and I had a number of conversations about what rent we would be interested in paying.” At first, Aziz asked Freedman to make a proposal, then, “he said: ‘No, I need a figure beginning with this.’” Freedman made another proposal. “And he said: ‘No, I need more.’” Freedman became exasperated. “It was a conversation where you were bidding against yourself,” he says. By the end, the figure was nearly double the rent the Prince Charles was paying. The pair agreed it would be helpful to have an independent perspective, at which point Freedman commissioned two surveyor’s reports, which both independently stated that the existing rent was reasonable.In October 2023, Freedman – who by now was aware that Criterion was pursuing planning permission to convert the office space above the cinema into a hotel – again met a representative of the company (and its surveyor). Freedman shared what he had been advised would be a fair rent, and Criterion responded that it still believed it was worth double. “They said: ‘We’re going to search the market,’” says Freedman.A week later, Freedman had another meeting, this time with Aziz’s son, Omar, a director at Criterion. This encounter included some suggestions that Freedman found “bizarre”. The strangest was that they should sacrifice portions of the cinema. “‘Could you give up the circle, because we need it for access? Could you take away the front of the building so we can get wheelchair access to the hotel? Can you take a chunk of the auditorium so we can put a shop round the corner in Lisle Street, which we could rent out to somebody and that would mean that we would be able to afford your lower rent?’ It’s, you know, bonkers.” After that, things went cold.Under the 1954 act, when there is a year left on a lease, a tenant formally requests a new contract and the landlord has two months to respond. So in September 2024, Freedman put forward a proposal for a 15-year lease at the rent they believed was fair and they “waited, waited, waited”. In January this year, Criterion came back demanding a higher rent, a five-year lease and a break clause that would entitle it to – as Freedman puts it – “kick them out” with six months’ notice should it gain planning permission for a redevelopment.For Freedman, who had already been bracing himself for a legal battle, it was time for the nuclear option: going public. It was vital, he believed, to make it clear to Aziz that the Prince Charles was not simply your typical cinema.A couple of days later, a local councillor offered to broker a new meeting between landlord and tenant. So Freedman returned to Criterion’s office to speak with Aziz. This time, the atmosphere was tense.“He expressed disappointment that I hadn’t picked up the phone to him and had chosen to go public with the issue. I said: ‘We hadn’t been able to talk to anybody for 18 months …’”Yet progress, of sorts, was made. Aziz – informally, at least – agreed to drop the break clause, and said he’d be happy to agree to a 15-year lease. But he still wanted the rent increase, with an annual rent review. “And that’s in a market where rents are falling,” says Freedman. Criterion, Freedman says, has refused to provide any evidence that the higher rent it is proposing reflects the reality of the market.Freedman is still awaiting a response from Criterion to their counter-offer. And with every month that passes, the possibility of the dispute going to court – in which a judge will determine what is a fair lease – draws closer.London has always been under the thumb of powerful landlords, and they prefer to operate under the radar. Much of the city’s prime property is carved up between a handful of “Great Estates” that have held land there since Norman times: the Grosvenor Estate, the Cadogan Estate, the Gascoyne Estate. “Almost a thousand acres of central London remains in the hands of the aristocracy, church commissioners and crown estate,” writes Guy Shrubsole inWho Owns England?. “They own most of what is worth owning in central London.”Other players are also family firms, including Soho Estates, which was founded in 1949 by the pornographer Paul Raymond and has a £1bn portfolio. Relatively speaking, Criterion is the new kid on the block. Its portfolio in central London is small when compared with the Great Estates and the crown, but if you stand in the centre of Leicester Square or Piccadilly Circus and look in almost any direction then you will see a building that it owns.The aggregation of property into the hands of a small group has driven enormous change in the area. London’s major landlords are adept at driving up the value of their portfolio, rents included, often at the expense of the businesses that give a city its life. “More and more things are thought about simply through their financial value and less about their use value,”Mike Raco, a professor of urban governance at UCL, tells me. The consequence of this, in the simplest terms, is that the West End is being “hollowed out”.At the end of the day, property ownership rules the worldJonathan Glanz, a West End resident, former lord mayor of Westminster, and director of 45 West Group, a property management company, has seen the impact of this commercial homogenisation play out over 20 years. “It’s why, say, a chandelier repairer can no longer afford to be in Soho, why a startup business can’t be anywhere really in the West End,” he tells me. “Long-established family businesses have taken the view that their property is worth more than the businesses and have moved on.”How to slow this process is an enduring conundrum. “It’s all very well to say we need a local bakery or local shops,” says Dr Patricia Canelas, a lecturer in sustainable urban development at the University of Oxford, “but how do we make that happen?”A strong planning system is part of it, she tells me, and it is vital that communities shout when they are unhappy, “but at the end of the day, property ownership rules the world”.Fables about London and its developers are easily shoehorned into a David v Goliath narrative. Asif Aziz’s own story (I’m not the first to point out) more closely resembles that of Dick Whittington. Like Whittington, Aziz – who was born in Malawi in 1967 – arrived in the capital as a young boy with little to his name. While he has not risen to the rank of mayor of London, he is certainly close to the position; Aziz and Sadiq Khan can often be found rubbing shoulders at events in the capital. Today, Criterion Capital has a portfolio of prime real estate across London and the south-east worth about £6bn. Aziz now spends most of his time living in Abu Dhabi.View image in fullscreenThe Trocadero.Photograph: Anna Hristova/AlamyAziz, so the story goes, was 16 when he grasped the first rung of the property ladder. He bought two shops in Deptford, converting the top-floor storage rooms into flats. London’s streets may have been paved with gold, but much of Aziz’s early wealth was accumulated doing business in Angola, where he ran a food and consumer goods distribution firm called Golfrate. After selling it for $20m in 2005, he returned to London to embark on a shopping spree for the capital’s biggest jewels. Among them were the Criterion Building (from which Criterion takes its name), the London Pavilion and the Trocadero, three grand buildings that surround Piccadilly Circus, the beating heart of London’s West End.As Aziz’s property portfolio grew, so did his profile. Coverage of his business and personal affairs has not always been flattering. In 2011, the MP for Mitcham and Morden, Siobhain McDonagh, joined her constituentsfor a demonstrationat Criterion’s office in Piccadilly. They were upset that Azizhad sat on a tower blockin Colliers Wood for years, letting it fall into disrepair while the property accrued value. Speaking in parliament, she complained that the Trocadero had also been left collecting dust. “All we really want from Mr Aziz is for him to be a good neighbour,” she said. “Although if we are relying on people like him to behave decently of their own accord, we might have a very long wait.”Aziz is “charming, well-dressed and very courteous”, one property adviser told the Times, “but he doesn’t give anyone a chance – he squeezes for the last penny.” Elsewhere, Criterion has been accused of buying and closing local pubs, and presiding over a poorly maintained andcockroach-infested housing blockin Croydon. How much property Aziz really owns is hard to gauge. AsPrivate Eye has reported,he can be linked to numerous Isle of Man companies that hold titles to UK properties.But it hasn’t knocked him, or Criterion. “Asif’s glass is always more than half full; he is an eternal optimist,” Walker tells me. “I know some people have criticised Criterion Capital for buying and sitting on property, but that is not my perception … The reality is he has transformed some very difficult and challenging sites such as the Trocadero, which many others looked at and failed over many years. When he does things, he does them well.”At the heart of Aziz’s portfolio is the Zedwell hotel brand, spearheaded by his daughter Halima,which opened its flagship branch in the Trocadero in 2020, bringing back into use a floundering building that was once a brash video-game arcade but had spent much of the past decade decomposing. Entirely windowless, the hotel pitches itself as a sanctuary for sleep in the heart of the city. Whether it is a masterclass in branding or a vision of dystopia, it is a hit. A constant stream of guests flow in and out of the large minimalist lobby, where they can check themselves in on tablets before taking a lift to their rooms. The basic doubles are about the same size as small rooms in most budget hotels, but the walls are blank and the bed cocooned within a floor-to-ceiling wooden frame – like a box within a box. And when you turn out the light, there’s nothing but darkness. In 2023, Criterion pushed the Zedwell concept one step further, opening the first underground hotel at Tottenham Court Road, next door to the Central YMCA (in the face of strong opposition from the local community). It plans to scale up to 8,500 rooms by 2028 – a number of them above the Prince Charles.View image in fullscreenThe Veeraswamy – London’s oldest Indian restaurant.Photograph: Jeff Blackler/ShutterstockMr West End may be the main character of this story, but he is by no means the only antagonist in the area. In March, it was reported that Veeraswamy, London’s oldest Indian restaurant,might have to closeowing to a lease dispute with the crown estate – pitching a century-old Michelin-starred institution against King Charles himself. A petition has collected 14,000 signatures and the restaurant has applied to the courts to have its lease extended. It was also recently announced that Covent Garden’s Jubilee Gym is also going on the market due to financial challenges, contributing to the sense that only the most lucrative businesses and services can survive in this part of town. In a similar scenario to the Central YMCA, plans to sell it took place behind closed doors and without community involvement.The property companies – which in recent decades have begun to work increasingly closely with local authorities to maintain and add value to the area – use a particular language to describe the changes they have brought about – one of “uplifting communities”, “maintaining vibrancy”, or “preserving architectural integrity”. It’s a language in which Criterion is fluent. “Community impact and social value guide every aspect of our portfolio,” it stateson its website.In a statement, it blamed the decline in the West End on a regulatory environment that has “grown less supportive of imaginative proposals aimed at revitalising the area” and pointed to its “long-term view” in the stewardship of its assets.When Criterion talks about its socially minded endeavours, it cites the “revitalisation” of the Criterion restaurant (now home to a branch of the London chain Masala Zone), and its renovation of the Horses of Helios statue in Piccadilly Circus – a partnership with Westminster council and the crown estate that “not only preserves a significant piece of public art but also enhances the vibrancy of the West End”. It is also building a mosque and community space in the Trocadero.Aziz has invested heavily in supporting Britain’s Muslim community and tackling Islamophobia. Much of this work is done by the Aziz Foundation, of which his daughter Rahima is a trustee. It also supports initiatives and events that celebrate Muslim culture in the heart of London, such as the Ramadan Lights, again close to Piccadilly Circus, which wereswitched on by Sadiq Khanin February.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Then, one day, out of the blue, I received an email from Criterion’s head of communications. “I understand you have been inquiring about Mr Aziz,” she wrote. “We would like to invite you to one of his events, he will be attending and welcomes the opportunity to meet you.”So I find myself at an open iftar sponsored by the Aziz Foundation and held in Trafalgar Square. It turns out to be an unostentatious affair – and free to attend, which gives it a gentle, unhurried air in an area in which it’s hard to blink without spending a tenner. Musicians play on a small stage, families wander around; a collective calm encircled by red buses, taxis and hordes of tourists.I loiter in wait for Aziz; then, between phone calls, handshakes and waves to his familiars, Mr West End appears, slim and smiley in a simple blue jacket, jeans and trainers. He comes across as relaxed, unflappable. The Prince Charles situation, he assures me, with a shrug, is a lot of misinformation. Before, they were “paying nothing”, he says, and now have to pay market rent, so “it’s human nature to feel upset”. Anyway, in his view he’s always been a soft target for the media. “Is it Islamophobia …?” He leaves the question hanging in the air.It’s a fleeting encounter, but one question seems to catch him off guard. I remind him of his various nicknames: “Mr West End … the Meanest Landlord. How would you like to be known?”He smiles, purses his lips slightly and rocks on his heels. “No one has ever asked me that before,” he admits. I’m invited to drop by his office in a few days’ time.Before I sit down with Aziz, I visit the home of Patrick Joy, 75, a former postman who was a long-term user of the Central YMCA. Like most of its 10,000 plus regulars, he only learned the fate of the club when an email was sent out informing him that it was no longer financially viable, and that it had been sold. As part of a wider campaign to save the centre, Joy volunteered to put his name down for a high court challenge, calling for an injunction to pause the sale to Criterion.The case was dismissed and the centre was closed on 7 February.The YMCA was more than just a gym, it was a community centre. Especially for older people – a place where you can sit in the canteen and have a good chinwagJoy lives in a rented flat off Gray’s Inn Road, the front room decorated by colourful ornaments and artwork, including an eye-catching Technicolor picture of a tiger. He sits in a wide leather armchair in a brown cardigan and slippers, and tells me how he used to deliver letters all over the West End at dawn and go dancing at the Hippodrome at night. “I’m a West End man,” he tells me.As you’d expect from a postie, Joy has always been a morning person, and those were the sessions he attended at the YMCA. “It was more than just a gym … it was a community centre,” he says. “Especially for older people – a place where you can sit in the canteen and have a good chinwag.” He’s been embedded in the neighbourhood his whole life, but has watched it change in ways that don’t make sense to him. “It’s a case of big, big business taking over,” he says. “Big business just killing communities with no heart.”After leaving his house, I wander into Soho, past the shuttered frontage of the YMCA on the ground floor of the brutalist St Giles building, to meet David Beida, a sage-like community organiser, part of the Save the Central YMCA campaign, and a member of the Soho Society, who lives on Dean Street. There, in a room full of cigarette smoke and De Chirico prints, he conveys his cynicism for Criterion; what he views as its disinterest in the equilibrium of the area. “If it had been any other major West End property company,” he says, “they probably would have sat down and talked to us when they started buying it.”Camden council agreed to support the campaign (though admitted it had no power to stop the closure), and a meeting with representatives from Criterion was finally arranged. Andrew Shields, another campaigner who attended, says they hoped for a conversation about philanthropy, community and the role developers could play in preserving the West End. Instead, it resembled a business meeting in which the rent needed to occupy the building was floated, along with the possibility that the community could continue operating a portion of it.The campaigners, however, are determined to retain the entire building for community use. They are now developing a feasibility plan, and waiting to hear whether the building will be listed. “Our anger is not necessarily with Criterion, they’re a business. They buy buildings,” says Shields. “Our anger is with the directors of Central YMCA, who took that decision to sell. But with Criterion, it requires dialogue, and [since that meeting] we’ve not had any.”Shields tells me that all they want is to be listened to, for Criterion to “genuinely understand” that what’s been lost is more than just a building. The campaign continues to call on Criterion to live up to the community values it likes to boast of, but when it applied (successfully) to have theYMCA designated as an asset of community value, Criterion opposed it. In a recent social media post, the Save the YMCA campaign dubbed this the “duality of developers”.View image in fullscreenSoho parish primary school – the last of its kind in the area; after it came under threat of closure, the Aziz Foundation held a fundraiser in a bid to help save it.Photograph: Future Publishing/Getty ImagesThis duality can result in some surreal community events. In December, Criterion held an occasion to raise money for theSoho parish school– the last of its kind in the area. Parents, children and “stakeholders” gathered at St Anne’s Church on Dean Street. There were drinks and speeches, and a group of school pupils sang Little Donkey and We Saw Three Ships. “It felt a little … strange,” one parent who attended tells me. “Very corporate … there wasn’t much integrating between the community and the corporate people.” She felt as though it was designed to let the public know that Criterion was doing something for the community, “but hearing about the YMCA and the Prince Charles, it kind of did feel a bit like you’re not doing as much as you actually could do”.Later, I learn that one of Aziz’s daughters used to attend the school.Afew days after the iftar, two days after Eid al-Fitr, I arrive at Criterion’s headquarters. It’s an open plan space with a lively buzz. In the centre of the room, a number of architectural models are on show in glass boxes. Aziz greets me and I take a seat in his office, which is separated from the main room by a wall of glass. Inside hang contemporary oil paintings of Piccadilly Circus and family photographs. He hands me a copy ofMuslims Don’t Matterby Sayeeda Warsi from a pile of about a dozen books on a coffee table and insists I read it.“Property,” he says, leaning back in his chair, “is something tangible, something everyone sees.” From Aziz’s perspective, Criterion doesn’t behave any differently from the other estates in central London, “but here, it’s individually owned … there’s a person you can target. But I’m also targeted because I’m a champion of British Muslim issues. I’m very passionate about that. Very, very passionate.”Aziz has always felt something of an outsider – ever since he arrived in London aged six, living in a flat in Balham with a coin-operated meter – and, like many immigrants, has been shaped by those struggles. “I come from a family which has lost wealth because of” – he takes a long, careful pause – “political or other events. So financial survival is very important.” The rags-to-riches narrative is enticing, but feels a bit simplistic. I am curious how a 16-year-old goes about buying a house. “At auction,” he tells me, dodging the question.We talk about the Aziz Foundation, and I put it to Aziz that some people see a paradox in investing in a community with one hand, while seemingly disrupting local life with the other. “Our business interests are not at odds with our charitable interests,” he counters. He brings up the Soho parish school. “Twice it’s been through those threats of closing it down and we had a fundraising in December for that. Because it’s our community here.”We’ve not bought Prince Charles to close it down. Having it there adds value and panache to our building, to our hospitality offeringBut the thing is, I say, the school used the YMCA swimming pool, and I know a number of parents there are upset that it’s closed. He seems frustrated by the suggestion.“I repeat for the fifth or sixth time, we did not acquire YMCA to close it down. Same with Prince Charles. We’ve not bought Prince Charles to close it down. We have a planning application to convert the upper parts into a hotel. Having the Prince Charles Cinema there adds value and panache to our building, to our hospitality offering.”Aziz feels as if the Prince Charles row has become personal. His daughter Halima, who has dropped into the office and taken a seat beside us, points out that when the petition was kicking off, the words on the marquee were updated to read “Damn the Man”. “See,” he says, “they always have to individualise it.”There’s an awkward silence. I’m unsure whether to mention that a billionaire property developer is as much “the man” as you could imagine, or point out that it’s a nod to the famous line from the 1995 film Empire Records, “Damn the Man, Save the Empire”, in which the staff of an indie record store fight to stop it being sold to a chain. Besides, a negotiation with a landlordispersonal – it comes down to two people sitting down to cut a deal.I suggest to Aziz that one of the frustrations felt in London is that “market rents” have been pushing out certain businesses, often resulting in independent businesses being replaced by chains – the homogenising, “hollowing out” that UCL’s Mike Raco raised, and that people such as YMCA regular Patrick Joy feel. Besides, according to Freedman, the “market rent” proposed by Criterion is being plucked out of thin air – it’s simply a rate Aziz believes he can demand. I guess, I say, many people feel that people like you have the power to make a choice …“Of course we had a choice,” says Aziz.“We had a choice that we could have put in a planning application to demolish, put in a new cinema or a theatre and a far better building.”Some weeks later, I check in with Freedman. The cinema has been ticking along; it is currently screening Joe Wright’s adaptation of Pride & Prejudice for its 20th anniversary and, in keeping with its idiosyncratic way of operating, they’ve had to call in a ghost hunter to investigate the source of a mystery flood that has been blighting the building. It turns out that the cinema is home to numerous ghosts, but none are responsible for water damage.Repairs always need doing, but it’s difficult to know how to proceed while in limbo. Freedman is still waiting on a response from Criterion, and is upset to hear that Aziz continues to claim that this is a dispute about what the Prince Charles could pay, rather than what is fair. “We do not feel as though we are being treated as partners,” he says. “We feel as though we are being bullied.”In a statement, Criterion said the claim it has used “significant financial resources to intimidate the Prince Charles” is “completely unfounded” and “reflects the Cinema’s negotiating approach to date”. It is, it says, seeking “market terms” and details such as a break clause are a matter for negotiation. “Both parties have engaged professional surveyors and representatives to advise them,” it added. “Should commercial terms not be agreed upon, the statutory process enables either party to apply to the courts to resolve the matter.”There’s some good news, though. On 1 May, Westminster council approved the Prince Charles Cinema as an asset of community value, formally recognising what Freedman and thousands of others know to be true. “It raises the bar as far as planning permission is concerned,” says Freedman. “It is also recognition of the impact of the people who signed the petition and all the work we’ve done over the years. When you’re in a fight with someone who’s a lot bigger than you, then the more affirmation you can get the better.”The Prince Charles Cinema has always been a defiant venue, and that’s the attribute it’s displaying now. In his battle against London property’s Goliath, Freedman refuses to be ground down, but it is not a fight he particularly wants to be having. “It’s a huge waste of resources,” he says. “We would rather be running a  cinema.”Explore more on these topicsLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His fellow greats Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney both used the word in their tributes to the creative force behind the Beach Boys, whodied this weekaged 82. So did John Cale, Mick Fleetwood and Elton John. And so did Wilson’s bandmates, who wrote in a joint statement: “The world mourns a genius today.”You may imagine Wilson gradually accrued such a vaunted standing. Artistic legacy is largely dependent on the longevity of mass appeal, and the fact that the Beach Boys’ opusPet Soundsremains one of the most celebrated and beloved records of all time almost 60 years since its release is proof enough of his incredible talent.Wilson’s claim to genius status began with a 1966 PR campaign masterminded by the ex-Beatles publicist Derek Taylor. Fortunately, Wilson’s output justified it, and after spreading like wildfire through the British music press the “Brian Wilson is a genius” rhetoric quickly caught on, “especially with the UK public”, says Wilson’s biographer, David Leaf. It has been the consensus ever since.Do we just imagine musical geniuses are anointed in retrospect because we no longer have any? It is extremely difficult to argue that any artist of the last 30 years has reached the trailblazing standard of Wilson, Dylan, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Joni Mitchell and David Bowie. The remaining members of those acts are all over 80 (with the sole exception of Ronnie Wood at 78); Stevie Wonder is 75, Brian Eno is 77, Ralf Hütter, the surviving founder of Kraftwerk, is 78.View image in fullscreenThe Beach Boys in London in November 1964.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyThe most recent claimants to the musical genius title are generally considered to have been Michael Jackson andPrince, both of whom died relatively young. Soon, the very idea of a living legend will be a thing of the past.In pop music, which reveres the new, genius is synonymous with innovation. Obviously, it is no coincidence that all of our unique and innovative musical minds were of a similar generation, starting work in the 1970s – at the very latest – when all the new drum, guitar and keyboard sounds and most resonant, memorable melodies were there for the taking. Such was the virgin territory before them, theBeach Boyseven had the opportunity to sonically codify California, one of the most culturally significant places on the planet.“I guess I just wasn’t made for these times,” Wilson once sang. But if he hadn’t been operating in those lonely years, would he have been considered a genius at all?What is also quite clear is that musical progress didn’t abruptly end half a century ago. There is still as-yet-unheard music to be made – and made it is, all the time. Generic fusions, formal variations and experimental production techniques are not infinite but they are definitely not exhausted, and some have even coalesced into era-defining movements, as 21st-century genres such as grime, trap and hyperpop prove.View image in fullscreenPrince in 2007. He is one of the most recent claimants to the musical genius title.Photograph: Chris O’Meara/APAdele, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift – inoffensively palatableSome genres – including grime, which can be convincingly traced back to the British producer Wiley and his turn-of-the-millennium experiments; and hyperpop, the brainchild of the London producer AG Cook and his PC Music collective – even have specific originators. Yet they still haven’t produced any bona fide musical geniuses.First, the entirely explicable part. The demise of the monoculture – due to technology’s fracturing of the media and cultural landscape – means only the most aggressively mainstream and inoffensively palatable acts (Adele, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift) are able to command the same level of fame and musical familiarity as their 1960s counterparts.Meanwhile, invention has remained staunchly at the cultural fringes – and if it does get anywhere near the zeitgeist, the journey is leisurely. Grime took off a full decade after its creation, thanks to Skepta and Stormzy; so did hyperpop, which reached the masses last summer in the guise of Charli xcx’s Brat.View image in fullscreenWiley, a pioneer of grime in the early 2000s, did not see the genre take off until a decade later, with his fame eclipsed by other performers.Photograph: Ollie Millington/RedfernsThis is another reason why musical genius is so thin on the ground: the people who do the actual innovating rarely end up in the spotlight themselves. This seems especially so in comparison with the 1960s; it is impossible to separate personal achievement from the decade’s goldrush – a manic crusade to push pop and rock to its absolute limits.The famous rivalry between Wilson and the Beatles – healthy competition for the latter, says Leaf, if not so much for the former – accelerated progress and incentivised change. The pressure is also thought to have contributed to the decline in Wilson’s mental health later in the decade.But then comes the more mysterious part. What is so astonishing about Wilson is how many different groundbreaking things he did simultaneously. In the studio, “he was inventing a new way of making popular music,” Leaf says. “What he called modular recording – recording bits and pieces of a song and then piecing it together.” He also pioneered the idea of one person helming all elements of a recorded song: composition, arrangement, performance, mixing, production.On top of that, he did something lyrically radical. He transformed pop into an “emotional autobiography,” says Leaf. “He was determined to put his feelings on to the recording tape and share it with the world,” which at that time was very much not the norm. Many of pop’s canonical artists were similar: Dylan didn’t just single-handedly make popular music a vessel for poetry, he also infused it with an all-new attitude and emotional palette (cynicism, disgust, rebellion), while conflating his previous folk fare with rock to create an entirely new sound.Dylan’s decision to go electric has become emblematic of the musical genius’s requirement to shock. Even Pet Sounds, an onslaught of loveliness, disturbed the band’s record label with its leaps of progress, says Leaf.View image in fullscreenBob Dylan in 1974.

Technological advancement has always been woven into sonic novelty – the advent of synths (which Wilson also anticipated), for example, or sampling. Considering technology has accelerated in unimaginable, terrifying ways over the past 20 years, you’d think that might be reflected in the pop zeitgeist.Instead, we have a chart stuffed with tracks that essentially could have been made at any point in the past 50 years. Perhaps the late 20th century – and particularly the 1960s – created a sort of natural selection of music: we found the combinations of notes and rhythms that appealed most to the western human ear and that is what we have continued to rehash.AI to the rescue?Surely, then, this is a problem artificial intelligence may be able to solve. This is technology determined to get to know us more intimately than we know ourselves. What better way to continue the quest for novel pop perfection that Wilson embarked on 60 years ago?In theory, it could supplant human creativity. In actuality, AI is unlikely to wrest control of pop’s soul from humans. That’s because musical innovation, and even catchy melodies, have ceded importance to the branding of people. If Swift’s gargantuan success is anything to go by – which it probably is – pop’s future depends on the carefully honed appeal of an individual human personalities, not what they can do on a keyboard (the musical kind).View image in fullscreenTaylor Swift’s approach to her public image and the music business are groundbreaking, even if her music isn’t.Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAPSwift’s approach to her public image and the music business in general is groundbreaking in its own way, even if her music isn’t. We will be mourning her as a cultural figure at some point, but a musical genius? That would take some real cognitive dissonance.It seems unlikely we will do so with anyone by the end of this century; we have no currently minted visionaries, although time will tell if anyone retroactively earns the title. What is certain is that as the pop canon continues to splinter into thousands of smaller, personal rosters, we will be losing musicians who mean everything to some people, but not – like Wilson – something to almost everyone."

I stretch, go downstairs, fill a bowl with iced water and, the theme of Transformers playing in the background, write my journal (a list of emails-I-forgot-to-reply-to). I drink hot water with cider vinegar to regulate my blood sugar levels, followed by tea using the baby’s leftover milk. Dragging a chilled jade gua sha spoon across my face in an attempt to reverse the ageing process, I then make my young sons’ porridge. While they eat, I plunge my face into the iced water until I can’t breathe, and begin my three-step routine (two La Roche-Posay serums followed by SPF). Some mornings, I run. Others, I cry into a coffee, albeit one made with organic milk, before taking amushroom gummyto take the edge off the day. My partner and I divide childcare dropoffs – we’re late for both and broadly OK with that – and each have one day a week with the youngest.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This is my routine. You might think it’s elaborate and weirdly specific, and you’d be right. Yet we live in an age of routines shared online, often in pursuit of some sort of personal optimisation – I’m aiming for somewhere between writing 2,500 words before breakfast (Anthony Trollope) and 5am cold plunge (fitness guru Ashton Hall). And however elaborate my morning seems to you, to me, it isnothingcompared with the pernicious routine of the tradwife.View image in fullscreenFor the uninitiated:the tradwifeis a married woman, usually conservative and/or Christian, usually white (though not always), of the belief that her place is in the home. She is feminine, usually kempt, often dressed likeBetty Draper, but increasingly workout gear in neutral tones too. Though at home, she is not a stay-at-home mother, rather someone who performs as if she is, documenting her life in dizzying, up-close fashion for us to wonder: who’s doing the potty training?The tradwife is not new: in 1792, Mary Wollstonecraft described these sorts of women as birds “confined to their cages [with] nothing to do but plume themselves and stalk with mock majesty”. But in recent years she has rebranded, growing from traditional role to niche subculture, to full-blown digital movement (her current incarnation is theMaha – Make America Healthy Again – mom, who wangs on about her distrust of vaccines and suncream to camera in head-to-toe florals). Historically, tradwives earned nothing. These days some out-earn their husband through shilling products, presumably to pay for a small team of helpers to do the actual childcare.Last week, I watched Nara Smith, a 25-year-old, South African-German mother-of-threemakepannacotta from scratch in a Ferragamo dress. It would be impressive were she and her peers not so clearly sidestepping a traditional career for one that involved packaging their cookie-baking for the algorithm.As capitalism squeezes us ever tighter, the fantasy of escaping into being a wife and mother feels ever more vividI am not the first wrung-out mother to take umbrage with this sort of performance. Yet as the cost of living crisis squeezes us ever tighter, the fantasy of escaping into being a wife and mother becomes more vivid. I am, after all, a hard worker, a mediocre baker and a realistic mother whose life is a delicate balance between task and failure, app-reliance and guilt. One colleague describes me as “frazzled but focused”. So I prefer the term radwife.To be a radwife, you don’t need to be married. I’m not. Perhaps you saw children as a choice, not a mandate, or came to them slightly late (mid to late 30s), like me. You’re not afraid of giving them plain pasta four nights in a row provided they brush their teeth. You batch cook where possible, bribe your children when possible, and buy fish locally (though largely to offset the amount of parcels coming through the door). You miss deadlines for work, lose sleep overultra-processed food (UPF),and are overly familiar with the unsung heroics involved in “leaving the office early” to get the kids. But you can also use a drill, a lawnmower and always finish the veg box. Of course, this is often in tandem with a rad dad or partner, who shares the same tensions, childcare and anxieties.View image in fullscreenWhat else? The radwife is aware of trends, would never wear an elasticated waist (unless it’s her Adidas Firebird tracksuit – she burned her Lucy & Yak dungarees once the youngest started nursery), but always, always chooses comfort. Her heels are a bridge to her former life, and though she rarely wears them now, she’ll never get rid. Other radwife-ish things: baseball caps, a fringe (it’s that or botox), one wildly unsensible coat on principle. To unwind, she reads cookbooks like novels,Graziaat the doctor’s andthe LRBon the loo. She reads the Booker shortlist, though she’s a sucker for covers with interesting typefaces. For her holiday, she has packedOcean Vuong, but will quietly leaf through self-help book of the momentThe Let Them Theorywhen no one is looking. It’s with some discomfort that she watched a version of herself in Amandaland (Amanda) and The White Lotus 3 (Laurie)–it’s not uncommon for the radwife to be divorced.Radwife-ish things include baseball caps, a fringe (it’s that or botox). She reads cookbooks like novels, Grazia at the doctor’s and the LRB on the looThe tradwife caused a major stir globally; not surprising, perhaps, given that it is largely a fantasy role which hinges on personal wealth, and is almost totally removed from the maternal ideal it promotes (it’s also, in part, why Meghan Markle’sWith Love Netflix series, with its unnecessary pretzel decanting, feels so ill-timed). I’m not bothered by the perfectionism this movement peddles – wake up, it’s Instagram! – but I am by the way it impinges on normal life. When did making fish pie from scratch once a week become trad-coded? The difference is, tradwives idealise this stuff – the radwife strives to go beyond it.It’s precisely this tension that makes the radwife a perfectly imperfect parent, what developmental psychologist Donald Winnicott called a “good enough mother”. So you might forget to put sunscreen on your children sometimes – at least they’re wearing secondhand clothes fromVinted. You make socially conscious non-judgmental parenting decisions which prioritise your sanity over their sugar intake. We need conflicts “in order to survive painful choices”, says Ora Dresner, president of the British Psychoanalytic Association. There will not be a perfect decision and parenthood is defined – just like life – by ambivalence. We will see, inevitably, the good and the bad in every choice we make, “but we should not see conflict as a negative concept; that unless you are absolutely certain about your choice, you are failing”.“On the contrary,” Dresner says, “the ability to be aware of these often painful feelings is essential if the mother is to find the way that works best for her.” The reality is, it’s OK to feel bored by your children, but utterly lost without them. It’s OK to want to go to work, to drinks – but also OK to want to rush home to do phonics. “We as partners, friends and society must be aware of this and support mothers to feel validated as they try to find their way,” adds Dresner.Many mothers suffer from ‘churnout’: burnout from trying to shift back and forth at speed between partner, worker and mother modeRad is short for radical. But maybe it’s about being radically normal. Most mothers I know suffer from what I call “churnout”: burnout from trying to shift back and forth at speed between modes (partner, worker, mother). Writer Frankie Graddon of the Mumish substack talks about the ambient threat of “The Call” at work (a sick child) and the guilt of “beige dinners”. This might sound a little obvious. But we live in delicate times. Only the bravest among us are off social media, despite the fact that we know, on some level, that it is full of “false messages that others are doing far better”, says Dresner. “I don’t think it’s possible to find the perfect balance or perfect choice. But to be able to observe our conflicts, and to some extent tolerate them, might offer a degree of freedom from internal and societal pressures, and what social media drives in us,” she says.Ideally, we wouldn’t shapeshift so much. Ideally, we would live in a world in which there were time and resources to allow for parents to work less, or more flexibly, without barely scraping together the nursery fees. Four-day weeks. Cheaper, subsidised childcare. Instead, capitalism has taken the notion of empowerment and turned it into a world in which all hands must be on deck for the profit motive.Forsomewomen, it’s a form of feminism that means that if you’re not a high-flying earner, then who are you really? As Rosanna, a 35-year-old film producer and mother of two, tells me: “As much as I value the role of mother, I would feel ‘less than’ if I didn’t work – and I’ve certainly struggled with that feeling when out of work or looking for work.”View image in fullscreenCertainly, many tradwives are more interested in marketing than mothering. But if big business is responsible for the idea of putting a career first (see Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In and “girl bossing”, a mid-2010s movement that became a byword for pseudo-woke corporate feminism) and trad-wifing feels like a cop-out, something in the middle seems like a reasonable reaction. Rosanna loves parenting and loves working, but still feels that “capitalism sucks and rams this idea that unless you’re earning a living and acquiring status, you are not quite valued”.The other day, I was chatting to my friend Jo, who is a parent of two. She said that, initially, “motherhood shook me apart, identity wise, and I clung on to work as something to define me. But now I work to provide – and fulfil myself. I don’tneedthe workplace in the same way I once did.”Taking this metaphorical step away from work – from the churn of the machine – is not a betrayal of the 1970s feminist fantasy. That dream was co-opted, used to sell a life that only meant something if it was dedicated to corporations. When I’m scraping porridge off the pan, and I’m late for work, I think about the tradwife and wonder if she too burnt the porridge. Probably. But at least I’m OK with it.Lighting assistant: Declan Slattery. Styling assistant: Sam Deaman.

Preparation began on Friday morning, following Israel’s attack on Iran’s nuclear programme and its top military leadership.Asked whether the UK could be involved in helping Israel deflect retaliatory drone and missile strikes from Iran – which Tehran has said would make UK bases in the Middle East a target – the prime minister declined to say.What has Israel hit in Iran and who were the generals and nuclear scientists killed?Read more“These are obviously operational decisions and the situation is ongoing and developing and therefore I’m not going to get into the precise details,” he said. “But we are moving assets, we’ve already been moving assets to the region, including jets, and that is for contingency support across the region. So that is happening.”It is understood that, so far, theUK has not participated in any military actionand has not helped to knock out Iranian missiles targeted at Israel.Before leaving London, Starmer talked with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, Downing Street said, with both leaders stressing the need for calm.On the plane, Starmer said this had followed calls with President Emmanuel Macron of France, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, Netanyahu, and the US president.“I suspect that when we get to theG7there will be many other exchanges of views on an intense basis,” he went on. “We do have longstanding concerns about the nuclear programme that Iran has, and we do recognise Israel’s right to self-defence. But I am absolutely clear that this needs to de-escalate. There’s a huge risk to escalation for the region and more widely in terms of conflict. We have seen the impact already on the economy and oil prices.”Starmer also noted the conversation on Saturday between David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, and his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, in which Lammy urged calm.“We’re having ongoing discussions with our allies all of the time, both myself and David Lammy, as you’ve seen, who also spoke to the Iranians,” Starmer said. “Our constant message is de-escalate, and therefore everything we’re doing, all discussions we’re having are to do with de-escalation.”View image in fullscreenA building in Tehran that was hit by Israeli airstrikes.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPANo 10 has not yet set out if the UK was formally warned in advance of Israel’s strike. Asked about this, Starmer refused to say, while indicating there had been some prior knowledge.“I’m not going to go into what information we had at the time or since,” he said. “But we discuss these things intensely with our allies. But I’m not going to get into precisely what we knew, because it’s a constant flow of information between our allies, and between us and the US.”Starmer is flying first to Ottawa for bilateral talks with the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, before going on to the G7 venue in Kananaskis, in the western state of Alberta.Experts have warned that Iran’s threat to retaliate against the UK and its allies should be “taken seriously”, with Tehran countenancing actions that were “previously unthinkable”.Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow for Middle East security at the Royal United Services Institute, said the Iranian regime was in “survival mode” and wanted to shake off claims that it is a “paper tiger”.Ozcelik said that the prospect of Iran targeting UK, US and French assets would depend on its assessment of whether a diplomatic escape in the form of nuclear talks with the US is dead, and whether it believes it can absorb retaliation from western powers.Israel’s air might and Iran’s nuclear bunkers may make for lengthy conflictRead more“Iran’s options are limited but, feeling encircled, Tehran may assess it has no choice but to take risks that were previously unthinkable,” Ozcelik said. “This is why continued calls for de-escalation by the UK government matter. But diplomacy cannot come at the expense of preparedness; London will almost certainly pair its messaging with elevated military readiness, anticipating that Iran – under pressure and with fewer off-ramps – may resort to escalation either by design or miscalculation.”Marion Messmer, a senior research fellow in Chatham House’s international security programme, said the threats appeared to be “a pre-emptive warning” to the US, UK and France.“While Iran is unlikely to want to risk a broader escalation, the warning should be taken seriously,” she said. “Though Israel is an ally of the UK, France and US, it is the stronger party in this conflict. There doesn’t appear to be any immediate need of military support for Israel and a further escalation of the conflict isn’t in anyone’s interest.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsIsraelIranKeir StarmerG7CanadaBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

Israeli rhetoric reflected its leaders’ growing confidence that they have gained the upper hand, and raised questions over whether Israeli war aims could go beyond the stated objective of crippling Iran’s nuclear programme.The threat to destroy Tehran was delivered by Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, after Iran responded to the surprise Israeli attack on Friday morning with a barrage of several hundred ballistic missiles and drones, a small percentage of which succeeded in penetrating Israeli defences and killed three people in Tel Aviv and Rishon LeZion.Katz, whose forces have already razed large parts of Gaza, held Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responsible for Tehran’s fate.UK moves jets to Middle East as Starmer refuses to rule out defending IsraelRead more“The Iranian dictator is taking the citizens of Iran hostage, bringing about a reality in which they, and especially Tehran’s residents, will pay a heavy price for the flagrant harm inflicted upon Israel’s citizens,” Katz said. “If Khamenei continues to fire missiles at the Israeli home front, Tehran will burn.”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) targeted the air defences around the capital city on Saturday morning and became increasingly confident they had achieved complete air superiority and freedom of action.View image in fullscreenA damaged building in the aftermath of Israeli strikes in Tehran, Iran.Photograph: Majid Asgaripour/Reuters“The aerial road to Tehran is effectively open,” an IDF official said. Later in the day, Benjamin Netanyahu said: “In the very near future, you will see Israeli air force jets over the skies of Tehran.”Air force warplanes, the Israeli prime minister said, would target “any site and any target of the Ayatollah regime”, after dealing a “real blow” to Iran’s nuclear programme.A few hours later, Iranian media reported a “massive explosion” at a refinery in the port city of Kangan, linked to the South Pars gas field, the world’s largest. The media reports said it had been struck by an Israeli drone, which would be the first attack on Iran’s oil and gas industry, a development with potentially huge economic and environmental consequences. The IDF did not immediately comment on the attack, and Iran’s oil ministry said the resulting fire had been extinguished by late evening.Early on Sunday, both sides launched a fresh wave of attacks, with Israel saying that that it was attacking military targets in Tehran while explosions were heard over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.Iran said the Shahran oil depot in Tehran was targeted in an Israeli attack but that the situation was under control, and that a fire had erupted after an Israeli attack on an oil refinery near the capital. Israeli strikes also targeted Iran’s defence ministry building in Tehran, causing minor damage, Iran’s Tasnim news agency said on Sunday.In Israel, four people were killed in a missile strike near a house in Tamra, a predominantly Palestinian city in northern Israel. Israeli media reported another three people killed in the central town of Bat Yam. Scores of people were reportedly injured in the strikes.Iranian leaders maintained a defiant front. The president, Masoud Pezeshkian, pledged that continued Israeli attacks would produce a “more severe and powerful response”, the new Revolutionary Guards commander vowed his forces would “open the gates of hell” on Israel, and Iranian state media quoted officials aswarning the US, UK and France that their military bases and ships will be targetedif they helped shoot down Iran’s missiles and drones.MapThe US and France have already stated their readiness to defend Israel, and American media reports have suggested that US forces have already been in action. The UK government has said its forces had not provided any military assistance to Israel and the prime minister, Keir Starmer, has emphasised the need for de-escalation.Following through on the threat would be an enormous gamble for Iran, drawing western forces further into the conflict when it is already reeling under the force of sustained Israeli bombing.View image in fullscreenAn emergency worker at Rishon LeZion, a suburb of Tel Aviv, which was hit by an Iranian ballistic missile on 14 June.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianSpeaking at a session of the UN security council on Friday, the US diplomat McCoy Pitt warned: “No government proxy or independent actor should target American citizens, American bases or other American infrastructure in the region. The consequences for Iran would be dire.”At the same time, Israel’s air defences have shown themselves capable of minimising the danger posed by Iranian missiles and drones. The IDF said Iran had so far fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel and launched more than that number of drones but claimed the overwhelming majority had been intercepted.The Iranian response has also been further blunted by Israel’s targeted killing of Tehran’s senior generals, almost completely wiping out the top echelons of the chain of the command. On Saturday, the IDF claimed to have killed two more: the head of intelligence for the armed forces, Gholam-Reza Marhabi, and the commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ ballistic missile arm, Mohammad Hossein Bagheri.MapIn total since the start of the war, the IDF said Israeli warplanes had attacked 150 targets inside Iran with hundreds of munitions.Iranian state media said that a fighter jet hangar at Tehran’s Mehrabad airport had also been targeted. Iran’s state TV said about 60 people, including 20 children, had been killed in an attack on a housing complex in Tehran.Iran’s envoy to the UN security council, Amir Saeid Iravani, said on Friday that 78 people had been killed in the Israeli attacks, and that more than 320 were injured, most of them civilians. Alongside Iran’s top generals there were nine nuclear scientists among the dead, as Tehran was caught unawares by the Israeli assault.View image in fullscreenIsraeli strikes reportedly targeted strategic Iranian sites, including the Natanz nuclear facility.Photograph: @AirbusDefence/OSCAn IDF official described the targeted scientists as the “people who were main sources of knowledge, the main forces advancing the nuclear programme”.The Iranian government also said there was limited damage at its uranium enrichment plant at Fordow, its second enrichment facility but Israel denied having bombed it. On Friday,the IDF claimedto have inflicted “significant damage” at the plant at Natanz. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed the above-ground part of the Natanz plant had been destroyed but noted no apparent damage to its underground chambers.AnIAEA report saidthat attacks caused radiological and chemical contamination in the Natanz facility, but that it was manageable and there was no sign of higher radiation in the area around the plant. Iran also said there had been attacks on its nuclear site in Isfahan, which houses a uranium conversion plant, a fuel production unit and other facilities.1:15Israel intercepts Iranian retaliatory missiles – videoThe IAEA reminded Israel that attacks on nuclear sites were illegal and contrary to the UN charter, with a potential to cause “radioactive releases with grave consequences”.Israel’s justification for its attack on Iran was that the country was getting unacceptably close to acquiring a nuclear weapon, and specifically that it was working on weaponisation, the assembly of components into a warhead. That is a claimnot found in US intelligence assessmentsor in IAEA reports.An IDF official on Saturday gave more details of Israel’s allegation, claiming that Iranian technicians had been working on an explosive trigger mechanism for a nuclear bomb, and that part of that work was being done in Isfahan.“We have seen clear intelligence indicating that they are taking steps forward rapidly, that cannot be understood in any other way than for a nuclear bomb,” the official said.MapThe worst casualties on Saturday from the incoming missiles were in the West Bank, where five Palestinians, including three children, were killed, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent, reportedly by a projectile fired by Houthi forces in Yemen, who are Iranian allies.Over the first 24 hours of the conflict, three Israelis were also killed, two in Rishon LeZion and one in nearby Tel Aviv, with dozens injured and extensive damage to buildings.There were reports from Gaza of the Israeli shooting of large numbers of Palestinians trying to reach food distribution points on Saturday morning, but details were hard to confirm on the third day of a communications blackout after the severing of a critical cable by Israeli forces.View image in fullscreenA person stands near a damaged residential building after a ballistic missile strike in Tel Aviv.Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPAThe few missiles that pierced Israel’s defences caused significant damage but few fatalities. InTel Aviv on Friday night, smoke from one impact site rose up in columns so thick they obscured the city skyline.Israel’s ambulance service said 34 people were injured on Friday night in the Tel Aviv area, most with minor injuries. Police later said one person had died. Another two people were confirmed killed in a direct missile strike on central Israel on Saturday morning.The Israeli leadership and the IDF have insisted that its offensive against Iran, called Rising Lion, would continue until Tehran’s nuclear programme – which Netanyahu said was on the brink of producing weapons – was comprehensively destroyed.From Gaza to Ukraine to Iran, Trump’s ‘peacemaker’ promise collapsesRead moreAddressing the UN security council, the IAEA director-general, Rafael Grossi, warned of the potentially disastrous consequences of such attacks.The US role in the Israeli operation remained murky. In the run-up to the Israeli 200-plane attack, Donald Trump had publicly urged Israel to give diplomacy more of a chance before US-Iranian talks that were planned for Sunday. On Friday, the US president insisted he had been well informed of Israel’s plans and described the Israeli attack as “excellent”.ABC quoted a “source familiar with the intelligence” as saying the US had provided “exquisite” intelligence and would help defend Israel as needed.Explore more on these topicsIsraelIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But, instead of the usual festive fireworks, the sky was lit up bybright red anti-aircraft missilesstreaking across the horizon.“Seeing Iranian missiles over your heads worries you, you worry what’s going to come next. Will it be a war, destruction?” said Sahar over the phone. She sent a video to the Guardian that shows people in the park hurriedly packing up and looking up as the crack of anti-aircraft munitions rings out overhead.Iranians are reeling as the country enters itssecond day of open war with Israel, the most intense exchange of fire in the two countries’ histories, with a level of violence not seen in Iran since its war with Iraq in the 1980s.Fighting started whenIsraellaunched hundreds of airstrikes across Iran on Friday morning, killing its country’s top military leadership and hitting its nuclear facilities. Iran quickly responded with a barrage of missiles and drones, sparking a cycle of retaliatory violence between the two countries.Iran threatens to target American, British and French military basesRead moreIn Iran, which has had much of its air defence systems crippled in the initial wave of Israeli airstrikes, the death toll continues to climb, with at least 138 people killed and more than 320 wounded. About 60 of the total, including 20 children, were killed in one Israeli attack on a housing complex in Tehran on Saturday, according to state media.At least three people were killed and dozens wounded in Israel by Iranian strikes over the last two days.The ferocity of Israel’s strikes and the apparent ease with which it has decapitated Iran’s military has left Iranians, who grew up with an image of a military and security apparatus that was supposedly impregnable, stunned.In the first hours of Israel’s attacks on Friday, Iran’s military was caught flatfooted. Israeli jets flew across Iranian skies seemingly unchallenged, while drones reportedly planted weeks before sprung up from secret locations within the country itself.“Israel’s attacks came as a shock, with high-profile killings and the destruction it brought, and the fact that Tehran was attacked,” said Amin*, a businessman from Sistan Baluchestan.The sudden assault provoked confusion in the country.View image in fullscreenA damaged building in the aftermath of Israeli strikes in Tehran.Photograph: Majid Asgaripour/ReutersTraffic on the capital’s city’s roads was light as people sheltered in their homes and bread lines grew long as people prepared themselves for further days of war. A resident of Tehran said that goods were in short supply at the shops and markets she visited as people stocked up on supplies.Internet coverage was intermittent, and most of the people the Guardian spoke to struggled to send voice notes and messages.“We are panicking. Today, I had a flight for Mashhad from Sistan Baluchestan and it was cancelled. I am in a state of limbo,” Amin said.Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has threatened “severe punishment” in revenge for the attacks. The country has sentrepeated waves of ballistic missiles and dronesat Israel since Friday, some of which hit Tel Aviv.Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, in turn, warned Khamenei that “Tehran will burn” if it continues its attacks against Israel.There was a sense of satisfaction among some Iranians as they watched footage of missiles hitting Tel Aviv, and state TV played images on a loop. People in Tehran sat together watching jumbo screens, cheering as videos showed Iranian ballistic missiles targeting Israel.View image in fullscreenA banner with anti-Israel messages on top of a building in Tehran.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“Many people are celebrating and happy for Iran’s retaliation to Israeli aggression and are asking that Israel be taught a lesson. People in Iran hate Israel as we know it’s a mad country ruining the region,” said Sahar.Analysts said that Iran’s leadership had few good options in front of it as it decided what to do next in response to Israeli attacks. The network of proxies Iran had built across the Middle East to defend itself over the last four decades has been conspicuously silent since Friday, offering words of support but little more.“Iran is alone – unlike Israel, it doesn’t have the back up of a superpower. But the problem is from Iran’s perspective they see this as an existential peril. I don’t think they see any exit ramps,” said Ali Vaez, the International Crisis Group’s Iran project director.Strikes on Iran ease pressure on Israel to end starvation in GazaRead moreThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has said the US will support Israel in a military confrontation with Iran, and the US has warned Iran that there would be “dire consequences” if it or any of its proxies targeted US citizens or bases in the region.Iran’s leadership does not only fear a military defeat by Israel, but also internal unrest if its security apparatus is shaken. The Iranian government’s popularity has waned in recent years and it faced nationwide protests in 2022 after the death of a woman arrested by police for not wearing a headscarf.On Saturday, a separatist Kurdish party – the Council of the Free Life Party of Kurdistan (PJAK), which has clashed with the Iranian government, issued a statement calling for the people of Iran to mobilise against the Iranian government.Iranian riot police were pre-emptively deployed in Tehran amid calls from some student groups for protests, three students told the Guardian.“The regime is trying to do two things in parallel: it is trying to play on Iranian’s strong sense of nationalism … and it’s trying to crack down internally and make sure there is no space for any organised opposition,” Vaez said.The Israeli attacks and the prospect of a wider war has had a rally-around-the-flag effect for some Iranians, even those who do not count themselves as nationalists.“War brings destruction and that’s the last thing anyone wants. But it’s been imposed on Iran,” Amin said.* Names have been changedExplore more on these topicsIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

That shift was echoed in foreign ministries and newsrooms around the world.“The fact that Israel attacked Iran doesn’t mean [the war in] Gaza ended. Today we had dozens of people killed, the only difference is this will have far less attention than yesterday,” said Xavier Abu Eid, a political scientist and former adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organisation.“Israel’s message [with these attacks] is that there is no political solution for anything in the region. By striking Iran they want to sabotage the US-Iran negotiations as well as the international wave of support for concrete measures on Palestine.”The decision by Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, to take out the security threat posed by Iran’s nuclear programme had also defanged a significant diplomatic and economic threat to his government.Some of Israel’s closest allies in Europe had become increasingly outspoken about both the impact of the war in Gaza on civilians, andescalating violence by Jewish settlersagainst Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.Even historically strong alliances with countries such as the Netherlands and Germany had been faltering in the face of an 11-week siege of Gaza, UN warnings of a looming famine and repeated mass killings of hungry crowds trying to reach food distribution sites.The EU last month announced a human rights review of its wide-ranging free trade deal with Israel, with findings originally expected at meeting of the bloc’s foreign affairs council later this month.Its recommendations could pave the way for Europe to potentially leverage its considerable economic power as Israel’s biggest trade partner, accounting for more than 30% of imports and exports.The UK, Canada, France and Norway this month imposed sanctionson two Israeli cabinet ministers “for their repeated incitement of violence against Palestinian civilians”, and warned other steps could follow.The Franco-Saudi summit on a two-state solution raised expectations that major European nations were preparing to unilaterally recognise a Palestinian state. It alarmed Israel and its allies in the US so much that Washington issued a formal diplomatic warningagainst attending.For now, at least, that sense of diplomatic momentum that might halt the war in Gaza has gone. Even governments that have become more openly critical of Netanyahu’s war in Gaza will be reluctant to press for its end while missiles from Tehran are killing people in Tel Aviv.“Its regrettable that these attacks come at a time when there were interesting developments [on Palestine and the war in Gaza],” said one western diplomat.Emmanuel Macron said the attacks on Iran should “in no way make us forget Gaza”, and told journalists that the summit was only delayed for pragmatic security reasons. It would go ahead as soon as possible, he said, but could not set a date.In Gaza many people were oblivious to the war and all the diplomatic manoeuvring it had set off, because one of the longest communications outages of the war had plunged much of the territory into isolation.Phone and internet networks were down from Wednesday because of damage to key fibre-optic cables, the UN said. “Since April, Israeli authorities have denied more than 20 requests to carry [urgent repair] work,” the UN aid coordination office said.That meant they could not see new evacuation orders posted by Israel’s military spokesperson, or warnings that the war in Gaza would continue “with extreme force”.They also could not access announcements from the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, the new US and Israeli backed organisation distributing some food in the strip from compounds guarded by the Israeli military.“We were ordered to stand down,” the GHF said in a statement to international press. “We have asked the IDF to facilitate the ongoing delivery of aid as soon as possible.”GHF uses only Facebook to communicate with Palestinians. So hungry, oblivious crowds approached centres on Saturday morning, as they had done since late May. Gunfire from Israeli soldiers killed at least 15 of them.Israeli attacks killed at least seven other people overnight, local health authorities said. There had been a decline in airstrikes, as the Israeli military shifted its focus to Iran. But on Friday an Israeli military spokesperson warned that operations there would continue “with extreme force” and on Saturday new evacuation orders were issued.“Famine worsens, the siege intensifies, and the dead are everywhere,” Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif wrote in a post on X, saying Gaza was “immersed in complete isolation from the world”.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIranBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Acoalitionof more than 100 groups planned the protests, which are committed to a principle of nonviolence.Police in the northern Virginia city of Culpeperidentified21-year-old Joseph R Checklick Jr as the motorist there. No injuries have been reported;police saidthat they have filed reckless driving charges against Checklick, and that more charges may be filed. Organizers estimated that more than 600 protesters showed up in the town of 21,000.In San Francisco, at least four “No Kings” protesters in San Francisco were struck by a motorist who then fled the scene,according to NBC News. Law enforcement detained the individual, and stated that the protesters suffered non-life-threatening injuries.According to theSan Francisco Chronicle, tens of thousands of protesters are filling the streets across the Bay Area.

The state’s police and governor cautioned people to not attend demonstrations across the state “out of an abundance of caution”.Minnesota police are still searching for the suspect – whom officials have confirmed is Vance Boelter, 57 – in those shootings, and noted several No Kings protest flyers inside the vehicle.Explore more on these topicsUS newsProtestDonald TrumpCaliforniaVirginiaUS politicsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

That is the right thing to do on the basis of what she has put in her audit,” he said. “I shall now implement her recommendations.”Asked to set out a timeline for the inquiry, Starmer said: “It will be statutory under the Inquiries Act. That will take a bit of time to sort out exactly how that works, and we will set that out in an orderly way.”Starmer has previouslyresisted pressure for a new national inquiryinto grooming gangs, and said earlier this year it would delay justice for victims. He called for ministers to instead focus on implementing the recommendations of previous reviews.Casey wasasked to carry out a three-month national reviewon the scale and extent of grooming gangs in January after producing a report into sexual abuse in Rotherham.She was tasked with examining data not available to the initialnational inquiry led by Alexis Jay, and to look into the ethnicity and demographics of abusers and victims, as well as “the cultural and societal drivers for this type of offending, including among different ethnic groups”.Starmer said on Saturday that Casey’s “position when she started the audit was that there was not a real need for a national inquiry”, but that she had changed her mind after reviewing the evidence.In parallel to Casey’s review, the government asked Tom Crowther KC, who led an investigation in Telford, to help devise a model for a series of similar investigations in five towns where girls were abused,including Oldham.Ministers came under pressure over grooming gangs last year afterElon Muskspotlightedthe government’s decision to refuse Oldham council’s request for a second national inquiry. The US billionaire’s flurry of tweets on the subject brought the scandal back into public consciousness.On Friday, seven men who groomed two vulnerable teenage girls in Rochdalewere found guilty of multiple sex offencesafter a long-running trial. The court heard the men subjected the girls to years of misery and expected them to have sex with them “whenever and wherever they wanted”.Casey’s 2015 review into the scandal in Rotherham said there had been an “archaic culture of sexism, bullying and discomfort around race”, with councillors and staff fearing being labelled racist if they mentioned the ethnicity of perpetrators.In response to the announcement of a new national inquiry, Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative party leader, said: “Keir Starmer doesn’t know what he thinks unless an official report has told him so … I’ve been repeatedly calling for a full national inquiry since January. It’s about time he recognised he made a mistake and apologise for six wasted months.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

It’s like we’ve been told what’s going to happen, rather than been consulted – it’s almost like being a child.”‘A slap in the face’: Grenfell officials still working in housing eight years after fireRead moreThe government announced earlier this year that the tower, which is being held up by steel props, would be dismantled to ground level owing to safety fears. At the time of the decision, the Grenfell United group said that the voices of the bereaved had been ignored by the deputy prime minister and housing secretary, Angela Rayner.Survivor David Benjamin, who was in his girlfriend’s flat on the fourth floor at the time of the fire, said that eight years on from the tragedy, he hoped that “people would remember that it wasn’t just a building – it was our home”.He said: “I knew it was going to come down eventually, but I would have preferred that it stayed up until we at least got some justice. I still live nearby and it’s hard to have to see it – I always take time to reflect. We see ourselves as family here. It’s important that we keep that up moving forward.”View image in fullscreenGrenfell Tower seen before a silent walk in memory of those killed in the fire in 2017.Photograph: James Manning/PAFive architecture practices have been shortlisted by the Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission to lead the memorial’s design. Survivor Antonio Roncolato, who lived on the 10th floor, said he worried that there would be a lag between the tower’s demolition and the new structure, which will bear the names of the 72 people, aged between six months and 82, who were killed.“I feel that the time has come for the tower to be taken down,” he said. “But for me it’s important there is a plan in place – that the tower is not dismantled and then the ground remains sealed off for a year. For me, it’s very important that events like this take place and that we keep breathing down the necks of our politicians to make sure that the recommendations from the public inquiry are implemented.”Throughout the day, residents dressed in green arrived to pay their respects at the foot of the tower, laying white roses and praying alongside multifaith leaders. Joe Powell, the Labour MP for Kensington and Bayswater, acknowledged that the loss of the tower would mean not “having that reminder every day that we still don’t have justice”.‘Grenfell was caused by corporate greed’: report calls for far stronger penalties over unsafe claddingRead moreCalling for a national oversight mechanism, which would ensure greater enforcement of public inquiry recommendations, he said: “We shouldn’t have any government marking their own homework, regardless of what political party they are. Inquiries are very traumatising to victims and if we don’t actually learn the lessons from them then you know that feels, to me, like a governance problem.”The Grenfell inquiry, which concluded last year, found that “Each and every one of the deaths that occurred in Grenfell Tower, on the 14 June 2017 was avoidable.”Explore more on these topicsGrenfell Tower fireLondonGrenfell Tower inquirynewsShareReuse this content"

He said the plane went down seconds later.crash graphicSinha said that initial investigations showed the plane had reached a height of 650ft after takeoff, after which it began to descend rapidly and hit the ground in Meghani Nagar, 2km from Ahmedabad airport.The 227-tonne plane crashed into a hostel where medical students and their families were living.All but oneof the 242 people on board were killed in one of India’s worst aviation disasters in decades.The collision with the hostel also killed at least four student doctors and one doctor’s wife who was heavily pregnant, as well as several labourers and vendors working in the area.Indian aviation authorities would not be drawn into conjecture on the cause of the crash of the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, which has been the source of global speculation, but emphasised that “every theory going around about the crash will be looked at”.Sinha said the flight data recorder, known as the black box, had been recovered and was being looked into by investigators. A complete assessment of the incident would be completed within three months.Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu, the civil aviation minister, told the press briefing: “The decoding of this black box is going to give in-depth insight into what would have actually happened during the process of the crash.”A team of four UK aviation accident experts arrived in Ahmedabad, in the west Indian state of Gujarat, on Friday night to assist in the crash investigation.1:08‘I saw people dying in front of my eyes’: British survivor describes Air India crash – videoBy Saturday morning, the death toll had risen to at least 279, as investigators continued to comb through the wreckage and another body was recovered from beneath the wing of the plane. Families of the victims continued to gather at the Civil hospital in Ahmedabad where the dead were brought, as anger and frustration grew at the delay in handing over the bodies of their loved ones.Anil Patel, who lost his son Harshit, 30, and daughter-in-law Pooja, 28, in the crash, was increasingly agitated at the delay. He was among hundreds of relatives who had submitted DNA samples to help identify his son’s body but said he had received no information since.“We still don’t know exactly when we’ll get the body,” he said. He described his son and daughter-in-law as “all I had left” after his wife died of cancer six years ago. Harshit had moved to London two years ago but would video call his father every day.“Even yesterday, when I was sitting outside the postmortem block, I could smell the stench of charred bodies from inside,” said Patel. “It’s hard to accept that my son is also lying in there. I just want to bring them home soon. The longer they stay there, the more they’ll deteriorate. I just can’t bear the thought.”View image in fullscreenVehicles wait to transport the remains of the victims of the Air India crash in the compound of the Civil hospital in Ahmedabad, India.Photograph: Ajit Solanki/APRajnish Patel, additional medical superintendent at the hospital, confirmed that, more than 72 hours after the crash, only 11 DNA matches had been made identifying the dead and the remains of just three people had been handed back to their families.Authorities emphasised that the task of identifying people, whose bodies may have been heavily charred or dismembered from the force of the crash, was a complex task, slowing down the process of returning the victims to their families. Officials warned families that they may get their relatives’ remains in a “kit” rather than a coffin as many were in such a fragmented condition.“We are dealing with at least 250 samples, and for each match, we have to cross-verify it against this entire pool. It’s a process of elimination, and that naturally takes time,” said one official, speaking at the hospital, emphasising that the team at the hospital had been working through the night to accurately match the DNA to the bodies.For those who were waiting for the remains of multiple family members who died in the crash, they feared the handover could take several more days.The Syed family, including Javed Ali Syed, his wife, Mariam, and their two children, Zayn, five, and Amani, four, British citizens who lived in London and had been in Mumbai visiting family, were all among the dead. Javed’s distraught aunt and uncle had flown in from Mumbai to claim the bodies but said they had “no information from the hospital”.View image in fullscreenBritish citizens Javed Ali Syed, his wife, Mariam, both pictured, and their two children, Zayn, five, and Amani, four were among the dead.Photograph: FacebookMariam’s family originate from Pakistan, and so far they had not been allowed to travel to India to provide a DNA sample to identify her.

They’re telling us they have to wait for the EHRC revised guidance and we don’t believe this is true.”Since April’s ruling and subsequent interim advice issued soon after by the equalities watchdog, which amounted to a blanket ban on transgender individuals using toilets of their lived gender, much of the public discussion has focused on bathroom facilities, although the ruling has wide-ranging implications for service providers, public bodies and businesses.Smith said: “I wish we could stop talking about toilets all the time, because that wasn’t really the reason we went to court. We went to court about the prisons, about the rape crisis centres, about the hospitals, where people are uniquely vulnerable.”She also encouraged individuals to “keep pressure on MSPs and MPs”, and make use of the fighting fund announced by the writer and activist JK Rowling to launch their own actions.“We really need people to start challenging where they feel that organisations, local councils are not implementing the law. We’re very fortunate to have the fighting fund that JK Rowling set up and that will make a massive difference because when people start to realise that there’s a cost maybe they will start to apply the law.”Many organisations are awaiting the EHRC’s updated code of practice for public bodies, which is not expected to be ready until November, although others –including the Scottish parliament– have already changed policy to reflect the ruling.Leading charities includingRefugeandMindthis weekwrote to the watchdogsaying the current consultation timetable was too rushed for proper engagement.The Scottish Prison Service guidance states that transgender women prisoners are not eligible to be housed in the female estate if they have been convicted of serious offences, although recent reports suggest a number continue to be housed there under segregation rules.A Scottish Prison Service spokesperson said: “We have received the supreme court’s judgment and are considering any potential impact it may have.”A Scottish government spokesperson said: “The Scottish government has been clear that we accept the supreme court judgement.“As the judgment relates specifically to the guidance issued under the Scottish Government’sGenderRepresentation on Public Boards 2018 Act and stated that it was incorrect in relation to the definition referred to of ‘woman’ under the Equality Act, the guidance has now been removed and will be updated shortly to reflect the judgment.”“The Scottish Government has already begun work on implementation. We have established a Short Life Working Group to ensure support and consistency across Government.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandScottish politicsTransgenderActivismEquality Act 2010Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)GenderShareReuse this content"

Out of deference to Trump, the climate crisis has already been erased from the agenda.The largely informal talks provide a rare change for the leaders to press Trump about shared values and specifically on a timetable to impose further sanctions on Vladimir Putin, a step he has repeatedly delayed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy will also be present, marking the first time the two men will have met since Russia and Ukraine failed to agree a ceasefire in Istanbul.European leaders will test Trump to see if he will agree to the price cap on Russian oil being lowered from $60 a barrel to $45, a means of undercutting the Russian war budget. The concept of the cap was invented at theG7, and tightening it is included in Europe’s planned 18th sanctions package.The one area of unity may come in backing a strategy against China, including ensuring secure supply lines on critical minerals.But Trump’s erratic handling of the conflict betweenIsraeland Iran is likely to top a crowded agenda. The four European powers – Germany, France, the UK and Italy – will express their support for Israel’s right to defend itself, but in private calls to Trump have urged de-escalation.Diplomats had hopedIrancould be persuaded to attend the Oman-mediated talks with the US on Sunday, but the talks – from which Europe had been excluded and which offered the only hope of preventing further missile exchanges – have been cancelled.European leaders will seek an explanation about what persuaded Trump to give Israel a green light to strike Iran before talks involving his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, in Oman, had come to an end.It is not clear that European powers agree with the US negotiating stance that Iran must abandon any right to enrich uranium, a break from the compromise agreed in the 2015 nuclear deal.Iran deeply resents Europe’s lead role last week in ensuring it was censured by the board of the UN nuclear watchdog for failing to meet its nuclear safeguarding obligations. Iran believes the vote gifted Israel an excuse to launch its assault, so diverting the diplomatic path. Europe for its part said it had no option to press the vote due to the lack of Iranian cooperation with the UN nuclear inspectors.With the diplomatic route currently closed, western leaders at the summit will instead collectively have to assess how close Israel is to permanently destroying Iran’s nuclear facilities, and the risk that the country’s reeling leadership will declare that the lesson of the war is that its security can only be protected by rushing to build a nuclear bomb. Demands for the leadership to take the fateful step are being openly voiced by demonstrators and by politicians.Israel is trying to create the conditions for the regime to be overthrown but western diplomats report even internal critics of the brinkmanship over its nuclear programme are rallying to patriotic calls.Writing in Foreign Affairs Richard Nephew, a Iran deputy special envoy in the Biden administration, said: “Iran’s most dangerous uranium enrichment site at Fordow has been attacked, but there is no confirmation that its defences have been breached or that its couple of thousand of centrifuges have been destroyed.“There is also no indication that Israel has rendered unusable Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium. If that stockpile is still available, and if Iran’s centrifuges are still around, Tehran may be able to reconstitute a nuclear weapons programme in just weeks.“Iran could, for example, ship its hoard of 60% enriched uranium to Fordow (or a secret site) for further enrichment, quickly giving it enough uranium to make a bomb.“But to actually build a nuclear weapon, Iran needs more than weapons-grade enriched uranium. It also needs processing equipment that can turn the uranium into metal, shape it into weapons components, and then build the weapon itself. Doing all that in the midst of war will be difficult, especially given the world’s decades’ long effort to deny Iran the necessary gear.”Explore more on these topicsG7IsraelIranDonald TrumpCanadaMiddle East and north AfricaMark CarneyanalysisShareReuse this content"

How did this revolutionary portrayal of midlife desire come to inspire a generation of women?Sat 14 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 03.04 EDTShareWhen Miranda July’sAll Fourswas published in May last year, it triggered what felt like both a spontaneous resistance movement and the sort of mania last experienced when the final Twilight book dropped, except this time for women in midlife rather than teenage girls. Two friends separately brought it to my house, like contraband dropped out of a biplane. Book groups hastily convened, strategically timed for when the men were out of the picture.The story opens with a 45-year-old woman about to take a road trip, a break from her husband and child and general domestic noise. She’s intending to drive from LA to New York, but is derailed in the first half hour by a young guy, Davey, in a car hire place, to whom she is passionately attracted. The next several weeks pass in a lust so intense, so overpowering, so lusciously drawn, it’s like a cross between ayahuasca and encephalitis. The narrator is subsumed by her obsession, and disappears her normal life. The road trip is a bust from the start, but the effort of breaking the spell and going home looks, for a long time, like way too much for the narrator, and when she finally does, to borrow from Leonard Cohen (perhaps describing a similar situation), she’s somebody’s mother but nobody’s wife.The New York Times called it “the first great perimenopause novel”, which is incorrect – not because you could easily name 10 others, rather because what it ignited was not an honest heart-to-heart about hormones, but something far more radical. What if a woman just told the truth, about sex, monogamy, marriage, mortality, domesticity, friendship, the life of the mind? The disruption of norms would be so immense that you wouldn’t, as a reader, necessarily need your circumstances or feelings to correspond to the author’s for that to upend your life. One woman who nearly divorced her husband after reading it said: “I think what I felt, which I think is what a lot of us feel, is permission to be undone.”All Fourswas an immediate success. It spent nearly a year on the Indie Bestseller list. It was afinalist in the National Book Awardsin the US, as well as being named on the best books lists, 2024, by the New York Times, the New Yorker, Time, the Washington Post, PBS, Oprah, Vogue and Vulture.I was building on an internal world that I believed existed, not just in meNow, a year on, the paperback is coming out, and I’m talking to July as she waits to find out whether she has won the Women’s prize . Our conversation, which would normally be part-retrospective – there’s a funny bit in All Fours when she talks about the female artist’s lifecycle: first “hot young thing”, then wilderness years, and a final spurt of attention before you die – is instead all about the reaction to this book. “I wrote it as if it was OK – as if everyone knew what I was talking about,” July says, looking bluestockingy in round glasses, from her home in Echo Park, Los Angeles. “As if you could make a joke about something shameful, as if we had all already talked about that thing. Even though we hadn’t. So it was skipping a few steps, even to have humour about it. I was building on an internal world that I believed existed, not just in me.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Chantal Anderson/The GuardianMiranda July is 51, was born in Vermont to two writer parents, and has the ultimate boho CV – she said once that her last shitty job was at the age of 23, as a car-door-unlocker at Pop-A-Lock, a US chain of locksmiths, which makes her ability to make a living as, variously, a performance artist, a film-maker, a writer, almost mythical. She came to indie prominence withMe and You and Everyone We Know,her first full-length film, in 2005 – it won the best first feature at Cannes that year. It has the most endearing, infuriating sequence: someone buys a goldfish and ­accidentally drives off, having left it on top of his car. July, starring in the film because, realistically, she was the only person who could have, decides from inside her own car that the fish will certainly perish, and delivers an ode: “I didn’t know you, but I want you to know that you were loved.” Her voice was incredibly distinctive – she nailed all those universal feelings such as awkwardness, futility, delight, yet was as far as you could imagine from being an everywoman. There followed an exquisite book of short stories –No One Belongs Here More Than You– in 2007, and her first full-length novel,The First Bad Man, in 2015.View image in fullscreenMiranda July and John Hawkes in her 2005 film Me and You and Everyone We Know.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyCertainly, she always blurred the lines between herself and her protagonists. But When All Fours was published, it couldn’t escape anyone’s notice that July herself has a child, roughly the same age as the narrator’s, and separated from her husband two years before the book’s publication. Of course, it’s always assumed that authors borrow from life, but this seemed like a different order of autobiographical fiction. Being honest about feelings, even destructive, primitive, contradictory, overwhelming ones, is daring enough, but marrying them to real-life events felt cataclysmic, which almost created a feedback loop. Readers felt the story was so audacious it had to be true.They were invested in the truth of it, to the extent that, during a Q&A after a reading, “someone asked about Davey being a dancer, why was he?” says July. “And I went through the whole thing of my process, why I came up with that, and I could just feel the room kind of deflate. They wanted him to be a real dancer.”“My actual friends,” July says, her voice rising in mock outrage, “they know that so much of this didn’t happen. It definitely didn’t happen the way it’s written in the book. But even as I was talking to a writer friend, she said, ‘I keep forgetting that you didn’t just do what you did in the book. You had years of couples therapy and this long conversation with your husband, it’s totally different.’ And I was, like, ‘Are you kidding me?’ You have to hold that in your head. How is anyone else going to believe this isn’t real, if my friends can’t even remember?”What about her ex, though – Mike Mills, also a film-maker, Oscar-nominated in 2017 for his movie20th Century Women? Did he mind, or was he fine with it? July looks at me sardonically. “I don’t think those are the only two conceivable feelings.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotographs: Chantal Anderson/The GuardianI remember my ex saying to me, ‘I think you’re at your best when you’re closest to the bone as a writer.’ That was helpful to hearThe pair met at Sundance film festival in 2005, both there with their first movies. “So we met as artists, and we always talked about how there’s this bubble that’s sacred for each of us, you keep the bubbles separate. You know, you each get your own world, and you have your freedom within that. And so it’s not like it’s always easy, and for sure, there were parts of this that were hard. There’s a part of it that was very personal for him – this is the mother of my child, we’ll know each other for ever. And then there’s the part that’s a fellow artist. I remember him saying to me, ‘I think you’re at your best when you’re closest to the bone as a writer.’ So it’s not great, it’s not safe, but that was helpful to me to hear. I felt like the risk was worth it. The reward for not risking it seemed too modest.”A couple of months in from the publication of All Fours, everyone had a story about a woman who’d read it and blown her life up. But if you took a stroll through Goodreads, which is a kind of all-comers citizen book review site, something else stuck out: the people who one-starred it (about 5% of almost 140,000) didn’t just hate it, there were actively angry with it. The rage was fascinating. It was as if they’d been slapped. Many were angry at how graphic it was (there’s a famous, sexy scene with a tampon that would probably be a spoiler to describe). Commenters took umbrage. “It would be great if I could read a book by a well-known female author who wasn’t under the impression that descriptions of cutting matted hair from a dog’s ass or running her hands under her lover’s pee was ‘original’, ‘sharp’, or ‘illuminating’ writing,” wrote one. Many prefaced their scorn with the belief that women’s bodies were brilliant territory for a writer – uncharted, tumultuous, mysterious – just not like this. This gave them the ick.More than that, though, they were angry with the narrator, and nowhere was the conflation of fiction and fact more complete; if she was narcissistic, self-involved, “immature” then so was July. “Yeah, I need to talk about that with someone,” July says, “probably not you.” (I wish it could be me, but it sounds like she means a therapist.)Sometimes, it’s just that they weren’t expecting it – “They thought it was going to be a beach read.” But more importantly, “They’re very sympathetic to the husband.” Of course, it’s that – no question, he is betrayed by the narrator, not just with this brain fever emotional infidelity, but on an even more basic level; it’s that he’s so nice, so personable, so thoughtful, so empathetic, and yet … he’s not enough. “And I’m thinking, ‘I created the husband, too! So he’s also me!’” she says, laughing. This is possibly the most radical act of the book: not a woman getting divorced, but a woman leaving a Good Guy.The husband gets annoyed just once: when the narrator posts a photo of herself on Instagram, dancing suggestively. This section, which follows a period where the narrator works out in the gym and strives for a perfect physique, surprised me – it’s such a mainstream thing to do. It’s not a thousand miles from real life, either, as July also likes to uploads videos of herself shaking her insanely perfect, pretty much unshakeable ass (though fair play, the dances themselves are anything but mainstream). Today, July bristles a bit at the suggestion her character is in thrall to a beauty ideal when admiring her ass. “No, she’s been taking nude selfies, and then she’s surprised to see, ‘Hold on, it does look a little different down there.’ I think that’s what I was trying to capture.” Then she elaborates: “If ever I have something to do with fashion, or frankly, even if I just get quite dressed up and I’m photographed because I enjoy that, I do have conversations with other prominent women writers that are like, ‘I make sure that no one sees me having too good a time.’ I think, for women, the measurement of what seriousness looks like is still masculine.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It became a muster point for people who relished talking about the book, but an unusual number had also made a great change in their lives after reading it. What was interesting, when Iinterviewed some of them, was the sheer range of situations. There were readers who didn’t need an LA literary novelist and performance artist to tell them they were allowed their own feelings – readers who were already queer or polyamorous or non-binary, who nevertheless found a new permission to just get out of whatever situation they were in, forgo the security of a relationship for something more authentic and exploratory. There were readers who were from incredibly conservative backgrounds. There were women who didn’t leave their relationship, who simply left a job in which they felt no appreciation. There were women who changed the way they had sex. There were women who changed the way they related to their children, changed the time or attention they gave to friendships. We weren’t looking at a divorce manual, in other words, but “permission to be undone”. No wonder some people were angry. That is an incredibly dangerous licence, socially. A lot of things really rely on women who’ll hold it together for others, regardless of their own feelings.July says that the scale of readers’ responses has felt like more than an unusual wave of appreciation for a previously respected but niche artist and writer. “I had this movie [Me and You and Everyone We Know], that was the big change for me,” she says. “That experience was really about me, a new voice. All Fours is really about women. Reading and hearing about other people’s stories – the sense of isolation, the shame that I had while I was writing the book, it’s all been completely inverted.”This is one of the reasons “perimenopause novel” irks, as a thumbnail – situating these explosive feelings hormonally is just another way to say these feelings will pass, so don’t matter. But July is relaxed about that. “There have been different phases of shame and fear while I’m writing – there was more shame when I was younger. Then I got to the perimenopause and that was the last thing I wanted to be associated with. All the time I was writing, I was just thinking, ‘Why am I doing this? I can’t stop myself.’” The menopause conversation is much more developed in the UK than the US, she says, where nobody talks about it. “You could have a whole relationship with your gynaecologist and really not have it come up. Or you could say, ‘I have these symptoms,’ and they’d say, ‘If you’re suicidal, you can take hormones, but otherwise just ride it out.’ And that’s in LA!” It makes me think of all the other ways in which women in the US are peculiarly under-emancipated – not the recent, terrifying anti-abortion legislation, but the bread-and-butter stuff, such as the lack of significant maternity leave; does that feel connected? “I think it’s very intertwined with the healthcare system. We just don’t have reliable healthcare, period. So menopause is a luxury problem.”She notes, wryly, that “we don’t actually have a problem with rich, aspirational women” as protagonists, they just can’t be dissatisfied. It’s funny: on a Zoom she looks younger than her age, but not artificially so, or massively groomed; but in public, I’ve always found her stunning appearance incongruous, like, how can this woman feel out of place?Sometimes I pick up a book at the top of the bestseller lists, just to understand what’s going on. I’m reading a romcom. I was shocked by how graphic it isJuly’s The First Bad Man is 10 years old now, and even though it is mainly powered by sexual fantasies, they are so extravagantly weird that, when I read it, I didn’t even realise it was meant to be erotic. (That was partly context – literary erotic fiction wasn’t really a thing, then. You were either a Fifty Shades reader or you read grown-up stuff.) It wasn’t until July spoke at a book festival and described how she was masturbating so much while working on the book that her writer-friend said she had to sublimate, the way athletes do, or she was never going to finish it. Which was news to the audience just because, you know, who’s ever heard “I was masturbating … ” at a book festival?Technically, All Fours is a work of erotic fiction, which has a definition: that the sex doesn’t just happen, the characters are advanced by it. At the same time, it’s not a sex-beach-read, because that’s not July’s style. “Sometimes I pick up a book at the top of the bestseller lists, just to understand what’s going on,” she says. “I’m reading a romcom called Funny Story. I was shocked by how graphic it is … I don’t think I’m prudish, I was a sex worker at times in my life.”All Fours aims to do something different. “The joy of it, for me, was writing a thing I hadn’t seen written about sex, either because what constituted sex was new, or because nobody had ever described, like, a woman who takes a long time to come; the thoughts of the other person: is this a fool’s errand? Will I be able to do this? It was just really funny to me: ‘Tell me if you need a vibrator, tell me if I’m just gonna keep going at this. You know, if it’s humanly possible.’”View image in fullscreenHair and makeup: Phoebe Seligman using Leonor Greyl and Charlotte Tilbury.Photograph: Chantal Anderson/The GuardianYet this definitely isn’t slapstick sex; it’s meant, and felt. The narrator and her friend make a rigid distinction between mind-rooted fuckers and body-rooted fuckers – mind-fuckers are imagining a scene as they have sex (in one memorable description between the narrator and her husband, she says it’s like she stuck a giant TV to his head); body-fuckers are absolutely engrossed in the sensations of the body, their mind is nowhere – and there’s a memorable scene for that, too.What was the reason, creatively, that the narrator and Davey never have sex? “The point was to build it to this place where you felt like those were the only two options: she’s either going to have sex or she’s going to go home. I wanted to use all that built-up energy, that obsessive loop, so another way of thinking would present itself. That playing field, while it’s completely addictive to read about – and to live, frankly – is ultimately quite small. But it can be transformative, it can push you into the next area of your life. If the end result is that you fuck Davey, you might not get that birth of complexity.” Then she says the most surprisingly romantic thing. “When someone sees you, in a particular way, and that part of your soul that hasn’t really been seen is seen, it won’t go back into the box. And that’s a big problem, because your life isn’t built for it to come out of the box.”We speak before July travels to the UK for the Women’s prize. “Sometimes people will tip you off that you’re not gonna win. I’ve been looking for that email, and haven’t had it yet. But the important thing about this book is what it’s done to the conversation, for the culture. I don’t know if that’s the thing literary prizes are for.” ( In the end,she lost out toDutch debut novelist Yael van der Wouden.)It must feel strange and vulnerable, at this moment, to be an author who stands for – maybe not everything, but a huge amount of things that the US government absolutely cannot tolerate, whether that’s female emancipation or sexual and gender fluidity. “I tend to think the people who are most vulnerable to this are not so visible. What’s the deal with my neighbours? I’ve known them for 20 years, but I don’t know who’s here legally, why would I know their business? Who’s gonna notice if two of the people in that house are gone?” But it does touch her personally, and not just as a neighbour. “It’s really hard to get a grip on,” she says sadly. “Whether the most extreme takes are actually the most clear-eyed. Whether the people who are moving [abroad] have it right. I’m trying to figure that out right now.”Unlike her narrator, July did make it to New York, last week, where she entertained her friends in her hotel room (which will, if you’ve read it, remind you a lot of All Fours). This is how she described the experience on her Substack: “Two of my visiting friends were my age and both of them, in different ways, spoke about looking older, the hardness of that … One friend and I showed each other our thighs in the light to make sure the other one really saw our cellulite. I told her the truth: I had assumed hers was much more extreme because of how she had spoken about it over the years. For years, I had placed her in a different category from myself, cellulite-wise.” And that’s July – the political, the personal, the public, the intimate, the things you’re not supposed to think about if you want to be taken seriously or thought of as truthful, all with a voice that’s entirely relatable yet completely idiosyncratic.All Fours is out now in paperback (Canongate Books).

I’d been following an Instagram account for a drag performer called Iva Rosebud at the behest of a mutual friend who felt our work was similar.I’d been watching them from a distance for some time when one Friday night a message arrived suggesting a collaboration. Obviously it piqued my interest; it’s not like I had anything else to do – who knew how long the lockdown would go on for?I said I’d be keen to talk more and was instantly invited for 10am mimosas in the park. I knew then I was dealing with a kindred spirit.The following day was sunny and crisp as I arrived in the park excited to meet a new friend.View image in fullscreenJens and Lachie at a friend’s wedding in Sweden in 2023Lachie was wearing sunnies and a singlet with a shirt over the top that draped off his shoulder. He looked like a skater, so too-cool-for-school. But I knew from Instagram he could also be this incredibly glamorous woman. I didn’t quite know what to make of the juxtaposition, but I was intrigued.We lay on the grass, listening to Ella Fitzgerald and eating buttery croissants and delicious pastries. Well, I thought they were delicious; he gave me some sass for buying them at a supermarket while he had invested in a very nice bottle of sparkling (I’d come to learn his father is a wine chemist, so he had an advantage).We discussed jazz, golden era movies and the one-woman show Elaine Stritch at Liberty, which he’d watched at least 10 times. He was really passionate about it! The conversation flowed easily, the feels were feeling and then he asked if I wanted to go back to his to watch it.He assured me we wouldn’t break any Covid rules, but suffice to say we didn’t make it far into the film before social distancing became an abstract concept.We met up again two days later, then again the day after. The following weekend we had back-to-back engagements for four days. After two weeks of being in each other’s pockets I was really falling for him, and I realised I needed to get an outside perspective on who I was getting so close to so quickly.View image in fullscreenJens Radda as Skank Sinatra and Lachie Bartlett as Iva Rosebud.Photograph: Aubrey HaiveAt yet another park hang, this time with our friend Chris – the one who had encouraged me to connect with Iva Rosebud in the first place – Lachie arrived with a stunning bouquet of native flowers for me. It was the first time a suitor had given me flowers. I was touched, but also thought it might just be a move from his playbook.As soon as he took a bathroom break I pounced on Chris to give me the skinny. He assured me that Lachie, who he’d known for years, was no playboy and was in fact a hopeless romantic.Chris’s reassurance was all I needed to jump headlong into things with Lachie. We kind of did the lesbian thing after that and coupled up very quickly.The moment I knew: he bared his soul in a performance and I fell for his sensitive sideRead moreLachie’s honest and generous nature is what I love most about him, not least because it brings those things out in me too. I think I knew somewhere between the third mimosa and the opening number of Elaine Stritch that Lachie was the one for me, I just couldn’t believe he was for real.Three and half years later I can confirm Lachie is in fact a hopeless romantic and very committed and loving partner. We have a beautiful life; collaborating on our shows and living together in Melbourne. We have a whole room dedicated to our drag costumes, and we recently got a puppy whom we co-parent with our friend, burlesque performer Kate Foster. Lachie spends a lot of time making the garden beautiful. And he still brings me flowers.Jens Radda performs asSkank Sinatraat Qtopia Sydney from 14-22 JuneTell us the moment you knewShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

It has its perks, like getting to play on centre court during the Australian Open, but what he does mind is that it’s consideredsoremarkable that he is playing at all. That he is seen as extraordinary and there must be some magic trick that keeps him going.“What bugs me is that people give up their tennis when they have some kind of injury,” Young says. “I’m a monument to the medical profession because I’ve had so many injuries and I just persevere, and then tennis repairs you.”Wimbledon lifts prize pot to £53.5m but tells players more money is no quick fixRead moreJust as a sore calf doesn’t have to mean the end of the road for a runner, or a pulled hamstring signal the end of a football career, Young wishes the prospect of injury didn’t deter older people from playing sport. But staring down the barrel of a long rehabilitation process can be daunting, and returning to sport and exercise after injury undeniably gets harder as you age, so an ever-increasing amount of determination is required each time. This is not something Young is lacking.“Two new knees, a new hip, pacemaker for my heart, hearing aids in one ear and a cochlear implant in the other and two broken noses,” he says. “You just can’t keep a good man down.” Young’s doggedness is key to playing for so long – he just can’t stop, it’s not in his nature.Tennis has featured in Young’s life since school, along with rugby and then squash during his time as a fighter pilot in the New Zealand navy. But when he returned to work on the land in South Australia after the second world war, he could only pick up a racket a few times a year. It wasn’t until Young was 70 and retired that tennis became such a big part of his life. Winding around War Memorial Drive in Adelaide 30 years ago, he passed the tennis club with a billboard out front saying “good tennis players wanted” and thought he’d have a crack.View image in fullscreenHenry Young plays regularly at Memorial Drive Tennis Club in Adelaide.Photograph: Sia Duff/The Guardian“They said, ‘you have to get tennis lessons unless you belong to a tennis club,’ and I didn’t want to take lessons,” Young says. So he made up a club. “I said that I belonged to the Inglewood Tennis Club. [Inglewood] was the name of a neighbouring property where we used to play tennis. And they took it.” As Young had suspected, he played well enough to satisfy the recruiters at Memorial Drive so no lessons were required. “That’s when it started,” he says. “And I’m competitive so I started really playing, and making it my sport, which it still is.”Now a centenarian with three decades of competitive tennis under his belt, Young is preparing for the ITF Masters Championships in Croatia in October. He plays three to four times a week, often with his friend and sometimes doubles partner Gerry Prideaux, and spends a little time in the gym at his retirement complex. That training regime is about to diversify further. “I’ve bought myself a rowing machine,” Young says. “I’ve set it up next to the window … so every morning I’m going to do 20 minutes rowing in the Adelaide hills.”Young made history in 2023 as the first 100-year-old to play in the World Masters Individual Championships. “It’s only recently that they’ve started to make it a bit easier for me,” he says. “I used to have to play down in the 80-year-olds [age category]. But then they made it 85, now they’ve got the 90s, and some of the countries are even going to 95.” He’s sure it won’t be long before there are enough players over 100 to have their own age group too. “I’m doing my little bit to persuade people to keep on trying, because we’re all living longer these days.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His attachment to iced coffee is so strong that he’s always itching to get back home to it when he travels interstate. The coffee is the outlier in an otherwise fairly standard menu. “I like everything, I like my meat and my fish and vegetables … I make sure that I get that full variety,” he says. “I snack on nuts during the day and I’ve got my iced coffee, and that really keeps me fit.”However, Young’s number one tip for people of any age is no secret at all. “I would encourage everybody to play tennis,” he says, claiming the medical profession supports his view that it’s the best ball sport for you. “In tennis, win or lose, you gain something. It’s very nice to be able to say to the man at the other end of the tennis court, ‘it was a good win, but you had to work for it,’ and you both laugh. They’re the ones that you remember, the games that you really had to fight for, and that’s competition … it’s good for you.”Explore more on these topicsTennisAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is undeniably difficult. If we can’t laugh about it, we’re going to sob uncontrollably”.Mander’s spoof investigative examinations of Bluey characters, and a video about his children inexplicably losing a slice of pizza in the car (it emerged weeks later “almost mummified”), are among his biggest hits.Michael McIntyre“I’ve always made content on things that I was experiencing, and it doesn’t come much bigger than parenting,” he says. “I’m amazed we don’t talk about it more.”For some, it’s really paying off. Szeps, who has a background in social media advertising, has been living off his Instagram account’s sponsored content for four years and growth is up 50% year on year.It helps, too, that there will always be new parents.

Szeps, who moved to Australia from America in 2017, has a theory as to why some of the dozen or so male “power hitters” in the parenting humour space are men talking exclusively to women – and it’s down to old-fashioned gender roles.“We don’t want women necessarily to be brutally honest about how hard parenting can be, because that makes us worried for the kids. When a man does it, it’s much more accepted,” he says.Parenting jokes sometimes break into the wider satirical space, of course.

The ‘menswear guy’ is posting through itDerek Guy, a popular fashion writer, revealed his family escaped to the US without documentation. It sent the far right into an online frenzyChristopher MathiasSat 14 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 18.52 EDTShareDerek Guy was a relatively unknown menswear writer with 25,000 followers on Twitter in 2022. Now, in 2025, Guyhas1.3 million followers on the platform, now called X, where this week both the vice-president of the United States and the Department of Homeland Security posted threats to deport him from the US – the country he has called home since he was a baby.“Honestly didn’t expect this is what would happen when I joined a menswear forum 15 years ago,” Guy quipped onXon Monday. “Was originally trying to look nice for someone else’s wedding.”The threats targeted at Guy, a fashion writer known forlampooningthesartorial decisionsof rightwing figures, includingJD Vance, marked another alarming escalation in the White House’s ongoing project to mass deport millions of immigrants – raising the prospect of an administration wielding deportation as a weapon of retribution against its critics.But Guy’s story also laid bare the transformation of X. In a few short years, the platform has become a place where Maga and other far-right influencers not only rule the roost, but can see their trollish posts perhaps dictate policy. X may now be a sincerely dangerous place for some users to post their thoughts.Derek Guy: the notorious fashion tweeter on Sunak’s short trousersRead moreIt all started withElon Musk. After taking over Twitter in 2022, the world’s richest man oversaw theimplementationof an algorithmic “for you” tab that pushed content from a bizarre array of influencers on users. Through a fateful quirk in the algorithm, Guy was among the platform’s new main characters, his incisive commentary about men’s fashion suddenly ubiquitous on people’s feeds. Guy, who got his start years earlier commenting in menswear forums before launching a blog called Die, Workwear!, was suddenly beingprofiledin GQ andinterviewedby Slate. Everyone started calling him the “menswear guy”.Musk later rechristened Twitter as X, further loosening moderation on the platform, and restoring the accounts of users previously banned for bigotry or harassment. X became even more of a far-right haven, with white supremacist and neo-Nazi accountsrisenfrom the dead. Meanwhile Guy was frequently going viral, namely for posts teasing prominent Maga figures for their ill-fitting suits – bringing attention to the wrinkles on Trump’s trousers, and the “collar gaps” on Stephen Miller’s suit jackets.By 2025, of course, Trump and Miller were back in the White House, pursuing a campaign promise to “remigrate” millions of everyday people out of America. In recent weeks they appeared to ramp up this ethno-nationalist project, with disturbing footage emerging online of masked, heavily armed Ice and DHS agents abducting Latino people from schools and courthouses, or kidnapping them off the streets, often separating them from their children.Guy felt compelled to stand up and be counted.In a longposton X, he recounted his family’s harrowing story of escaping war in Vietnam, a journey that ended with his mom carrying him across the US border while he was still an infant. Guy revealed that he was one of millions of undocumented people living in the US.“The lack of legal immigration has totally shaped my life,” he wrote. “It has made every interaction with the law much scarier. It has shaped which opportunities I could or could not get. It has taken an emotional toll, as this legal issue hangs over your head like a black cloud.”He was sharing his story to “push back against the idea that all undocumented immigrants are MS-13 members”, he wrote. “I know many people in my position and they are all like your neighbors.”Guy’s post sent far-right influencers on X into a feeding frenzy. “JD Vance I know you’re reading this and you have the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever,” a user named @growing_daniel wrote about Guy’s announcement. (@Growing_Danielappearsto be the founder of a tech startup calledAbel, that uses artificial intelligence to help police write up crime reports.)Vance did see the post,replyingwith a gif of Jack Nicholson from the movie Anger Management, slowly nodding his head with an intense, menacing look. A short time later, the official account of the Department of Homeland Security joined the fray. The federal agencyquote-tweeteda post from another far-right account, which noted Guy’s undocumented status, with a gif from the movie Spy Kids, showing a character with futuristic glasses that can zoom in on a subject from a great distance.The message to Guy was clear: we’re watching you. Vance and DHS did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment about the posts.Prominent far-right figures were ecstatic. “IT’S HABBENING,”postedJack Posobiec, a Maga operative with more than 3 million followers on X. Michael Knowles, the prominent Daily Wire pundit, posted a photo of El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, wearing a blue-and-white sash over his suit jacket. “Hey @dieworkwear,” Knowleswroteto his one million followers, “what are your thoughts on this outfit?” The subtext of Knowles’s tweet was also clear: Bukele haspartneredwith the Trump administration to hold immigrants deported from America, with no due process, in El Salvador’s most notorious gulag.Guy was aghast at the response. “The cruelty in today’s politics feels horribly corrosive,” he wrote. “Bringing up that hard-working immigrant families — undocumented, yes, but not violent criminals — are being ripped apart based on immigration status doesn’t bring compassion or even pause, but gleeful cheers.”Longtime critics of X pointed to the deportation threats as evidence of the platform’s perils. “...It’s been turned into a political weapon for people who wish to use it to harm others,”notedjournalist Charlie Warzel, the author of a recentAtlantic essayarguing for people to abandon X. “It’s not the marketplace of ideas - you do not have to participate in this project! very simple!”For now, Guy – who politely declined to comment to the Guardian about this week’s saga – is still on X, using all of this week’s attention for what he sees as good causes.“ICE raided a downtown LA garment warehouse, arresting fourteen garment workers,” he wrote. “Many of those detained were the primary breadwinner for young children and elderly relatives. Would you consider donating to help these families?”He also took time to taunt those calling for his deportation. When an account belonging to a luxury wristwatch dealer chastised him for “disrespecting” immigration laws, Guy responded with a one-thousand word history of how the flow of immigrants and refugees across borders over the past two centuries led to the creation of Rolex, among other luxury watch brands.He alsoreplieddirectly to Vance’s post threatening to deport him. “i think i can outrun you in these clothes,” Guy wrote, posting a photo of the vice-president seated at a political conference, his ill-fitting suit pants riding up to his calves. “you are tweeting for likes. im tweeting to be mentioned in the National Archives and Records,” Guy added.Guy then told the vice-president where immigration agents could find him: “Here is my house,” the “menswear guy” wrote, posting an image of a Men’s Wearhouse storefront.This article was updated on 14 June 2025 to correct that the movie the gif of Jack Nicholson was from was Anger Management, not The Departed.Explore more on these topicsJD VanceUS immigrationMen's fashionUS politicsXVietnamVietnam warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It means Mercedes’s Russell and defending champion Verstappen will line up on the front row together,a fortnight after their collision in Spain.Formula One: Mercedes’ Russell snatches pole for Canadian grand prix – as it happenedRead moreTheRed Bulldriver Verstappen accelerated into Russell and was demoted from fifth to 10th by the stewards at the Circuit de Barcelona. He was also hit with three penalty points which leaves him one point away from a race ban.Moments after he landed his second pole in as many years in Montreal, Russell joked of his rivalry with Verstappen: “We are mates so we are all good. I’ve got a few more points on my licence to play with, so let’s see.”But when the subject arose in the post-qualifying press conference, Verstappen did not see the funny side. “I don’t need to hear it again,” he said. “It is really pissing me off. You speaking about it on Thursday, it is such a waste of time. It is very childish.“I don’t want to say too much because it is really annoying this world that we live in.”Russell insisted earlier this week that Verstappen’s attempts to “scare” him in Barcelona did not work and he believes a ban for the Dutch driver – if he reaches 12 points – would be justified. On Saturday, Russell said: “I don’t think any driver goes out there looking to crash into somebody and get penalty points on their licence. Max is one of the best and there is no reason for him to race any differently.“But I am not sitting here thinking he will give me more room but probably the opposite to prove a point so I will keep an eye on that. We are here to win and we will not do something which jeopardises the race.”Norris is 10 points behind Piastri and his championship challenge has been derailed by errors in qualifying. He made another two in Montreal when it came to the crunch, aborting the final right-left chicane on his first run in Q3 and then grazing the wall on the exit of Turn 7 with his last effort to leave him seven tenths off the pole pace and four places and half-a-second behind Piastri in the otherMcLaren.“It is a very easy track to push 1% too much and pay the price – and that’s what happened today,” said Norris. “Mistakes have cost me. A podium will be tough because we don’t have the pace we have had of the past few races. I am not as confident as in other places but I am confident we can go forward but it will be a struggle.”Kimi Antonelli will line up from fourth for Mercedes, one place ahead of Ferrari’s Lewis Hamilton. Charles Leclerc made an error on his last lap and is eighth on the grid.View image in fullscreenLando Norris endured a frustrating afternoon in Montreal.Photograph: Christopher Katsarov/APMeanwhile, Derek Warwick has been suspended from his role as a driver steward in Montreal as a result of “recent unauthorised media comments”, the FIA announced. The 70-year-old former driver’s suspension follows remarks circulated by a gambling platform about a variety of matters including the 10-second penalty given to Verstappen at the Spanish Grand Prix.The FIA confirmed that Enrique Bernoldi, who raced for the ArrowsFormula Oneteam, will replace Warwick in Montreal, but added: “After discussion, Derek acknowledges that his comments were ill-advised in his role as an FIA steward and has apologised.

The world’s top two players slipped to an 8-4 second round defeat at the Eissporthalle in Frankfurt, where Martin Schindler and Ricardo Pietreczko made the most of the backing of a partisan home crowd to seal a comprehensive victory.Littler and Humphries,who both received MBEsin King Charles’s birthday honours, were made to pay for missed doubles, with the 18-year-old in particular turning in an off-colour display in a country where he has endured previous disappointments.A delighted Schindler, who had insisted in advance that the English duo were “beatable”, told Sky Sports: “I was right because we believed in ourselves. We have been putting in a solid performance, and obviously the double 16s from Ricardo just went in, so we are very happy to go through. Today was one step and tomorrow is the other. That’s it.”Booed by the home crowd, Littler started nervously and the Germans took the first two legs, but his 123 check-out put England on the board before a 64 finish levelled it up at 2-2.Gary Oldman and Roger Daltrey knighted in king’s birthday honoursRead moreHowever, the teenager missed three darts at a double in the fifth leg to allow Pietreczko to win it with a 106 out-shot, and another in the sixth as the Germans restored their advantage. And after Humphries had hit 25 rather than bull going for 122, they went in at the break 5-2 ahead.Pietreczko took out 101 after the resumption before Germany went 7-2 up and although Littler and Humphries took the next two, they eventually succumbed as a return of just four doubles from the 11 chances they created ultimately proved costly.Germany’s reward is a quarter-final against Australia, who routed Argentina 8-1 with Damon Heta and Simon Whitlock proving too strong for Jesus Salate and Victor Guillin despite missing 21 of their 29 attempts at doubles.Gerwyn Price and Jonny Clayton secured Wales’ passage with a resounding 8-2 win over the Philippines. The Welsh pair, who claimed the crown in 2020 and 2023, powered their way through to a last-eight tie against Hong Kong with the minimum of fuss despite the first three legs going against the darts.However, Scotland’s Peter Wright and Gary Anderson found themselves on the wrong end of a demolition job as they went down 8-0 to the Netherlands in just 15 minutes. Danny Noppert and the world youth champion, Gian van Veen, who took out 130 to claim the fourth leg on Scotland’s throw, were in inspired form, averaging 100.2 and converting eight of the 12 darts they had at doubles to breeze through to a meeting with the Czech Republic.William O’Connor and Keane Barry eased the Republic of Ireland to a showdown against neighbouring Northern Ireland with an 8-3 victory over Switzerland in which they were always in control.Northern Ireland were comfortable winners over South Africa as Josh Rock and Daryl Gurney eased them to an 8-2 success.

In fact, getting penalised against.Russell inspires Bath to Premiership title despite late Leicester fightbackRead more“That was a strategical point for us to try and dominate there and in mauls as well. That was completely nullified, it cost us field position. I think with three minutes to go it was nine penalties to two. It is impossible to manage a field position scenario with that outcome.“I’ll always have a slightly biased lens, but I don’t believe we were that much more foul than them. It was frustrating to say the least.”He said he would seek official clarification about Cole’s yellow card and some of the scrum calls. “If the game is sending players to the sin-bin for that … what do I say? If I say something, I’ll get myself in strife and take away from the other team. I just have to beat myself up inside and try and keep as much as I can inside.“They won the competition and they deserve it. I’ve got my feelings on the referee’s performance, but I’ll take that up with the head of refereeing.”Cole was in tears at the end of his final game before retirement. Cheika is also moving on after one season, but pronounced himself “very proud” with his side’s effort. The Tigers won the try count by three to two, but as a consequence of two yellow cards played a quarter of the game with 14 men.“We showed so much grit and determination. We got nothing back from the referee at all and we kept on coming back and turning up. All year we’ve had the expression about trying to embrace the heat, when it gets tough to try to revel in that scenario.“Early in the season we still weren’t understanding how to get around that situation. We did today. From all different avenues there were fires going everywhere, whether they were set up by the opposition or the ref. We were able to deal with that and get ourselves back in the game.”Bath’s captain, Ben Spencer, believes “the sky is the limit” for his champion side after the club’s first English league title for 29 years, suggesting it could be the prelude to a period of sustained success for a team who have hoisted an unprecedented three trophies this season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For years they have been smeared as chokers, but no more.“While we were batting we could hear the Aussies using that dreaded word: choke,” said Temba Bavuma, the South Africa captain. “We came in with a lot of belief and a lot of doubters. We got ourselves into the final, there were doubters as to the route we took. This win squashes that. Here’s an opportunity for us as a nation, divided as we are, to unite.”Markram steers South Africa to historic World Test Championship final triumphRead moreAiden Markram, who scored a match-changing 136 before falling six runs from victory, said the result had redefined South Africa’s Test team. “It’ll be great to not have to hear that again,” he said of being labelled chokers. “To have got the job done and to get rid of that is quite a big thing for this team. All the questions that have been asked in the past have now been answered.”Bavuma, who scored 66 in the second innings, much of it while struggling with a hamstring injury, said he hoped the triumph would unify his nation. “The word that comes to mind is special: special for this group, special for myself and special for the country,.“As a country, it’s a chance for us to rejoice in something, to forget about our issues and really come together. I hope it inspires and continues to inspire our country.

It’s not easy being captain of South Africa and all the sacrifices, all the disappointment, it feels worth it. When you’re going through it, giving up is always an option but something kind of wills you on. For me, it was that moment there. To be recognised as more than just a Black African cricketer, but to be seen as someone who’s done something the country has wanted.”While there was tears of joy from some of the winning team during their celebrations Markram’s had come the previous evening, when with victory starting to seem not just achievable but inevitable, he sealed his century. “I was pretty emotional,” he said.“From about quarter past five the game slowed down. I had a bit of time to look around and see all the fans, my family, all my mates that were there, to look up at the changing room. And then I was like: ‘Yes. We’re here now.

The Slovenian had grabbed the overall lead the day before when he shot clear on the short closing climb.On the penultimate stage, a 131.7km run from Grand-Aigueblanche, Pogacar’s UAE Team Emirates teammate Pavel Sivakov reduced the leading pack by setting a ferocious tempo at the front at the start of the 20km final climb to Valmeinier ski resort.Tadej Pogacar goes solo for Dauphiné stage win to reclaim yellow jerseyRead moreWith 12km to go,Pogacar upped the tempo, standing on his pedals and rocketing clear. As on Friday, only Jonas Vingegaard, his main Tour de France rival, and the young German Florian Lipowitz could respond. Vingegaard settled into a dogged pursuit.Pogacar, without rising out of his saddle again, was able to maintain an uncatchable pace. He increased his lead to as much as 30 seconds before relaxing towards the end. He cruised across the line 14 seconds ahead of Vingegaard, quivering with effort as he came home.“Jonas was really strong – I did not want to go too deep myself,” said Pogacar. “It was a super-hot and long climb. Luckily, I had enough time to ease up in the last kilometres and recovered. Happy I could defend the jersey like this.”Lipowitz was again third at 1min 21sec. The Belgian Remco Evenepoel, who had led the overall classification until Friday, finished fifth, as he had on Friday, losing 2:39. With one stage to go, Pogacar increased his lead to 1:01 over Vingegaard, 2:01 over Lipowitz and 4:11 to Evenepoel in fourth.View image in fullscreenJonas Vingegaard in pursuit of Tadej Pogacar near the Col de la Croix de Fer.Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty ImagesFor much of the stage, Vingegaard’s lieutenants on the powerful Visma team launched attack after attack, but they could not shake off Pogacar, or Sivakov, either going up or down the day’s biggest climb, the Col de la Croix de Fer.Pogacar said: “We wanted to take control on all the climbs, but Visma tried with all the attacks. I was pretty happy with how Pavel and the team rode today. It was sort of defence, to not get attacked by everyone from Visma.”He complained at the way Visma had tried to drop him on the descent of the Col. “They went a little bit dangerous in the first kilometres of the downhill,” he said. “I didn’t like that, but it’s modern cycling.”As the start of the Tour de France on 5 July approaches, Pogacar beat Vingegaard to take a third stage victory in the race. It was also the 98th stage win of the Slovenian’s career, breaking his tie with the French sprinter Arnaud Démare for most by an active rider.He has a chance for one more on Sunday when the race finishes with another mountainous stage, 133.3km from Val-d’Arc to the Plateau du Mont-Cenis.Explore more on these topicsCyclingTadej PogačarJonas VingegaardnewsShareReuse this content"

At first, standard protocol was observed for uncategorised piles of paper. The 21 City Ground programmes, spanning 50 years from September 1963 to November 2012, were packed away in a dark cupboard, ignored and unread. But finally taking the time to study them has paid dividends: a rich seam of history leaps off the pages in clear, elegant black-and-white type.A charmer and a stickler: Jeremy Alexander was a Guardian sport mainstay for 57 years | Matthew EngelRead moreForest’s presence in the top-flight’s upper echelons evoked the club’s halcyon days and plenty has been written about the Brian Clough-Peter Taylor era. Less attention has focused on Clough’s often entertaining programme notes during his 18-year tenure – while the editions outside Clough’s time are a fascinating way of charting Forest’s trajectory, as well as how profoundly football and wider society have changed.For West Ham’s visit in September 1963, pre-decimalisation, the programme cover price is 6d (2.5p). “Some of their players have established themselves in the International field,” reads the section on the visitors. “Bobby Moore is holding the right-half berth for England … others with not so familiar names at the moment, but with the right sort of ability, include inside-forward Geoff Hurst.”Prescient player profiles aside, the 60s adverts may be the most interesting element. “If your party runs into hundreds ask for a special train,” reads a message from British Railways, encouraging football fans to charter their own services for away days. “Commission paid on full train loads for a guaranteed number of passengers.” What chance of that now? The back page advertises the latest in cars: “Meet the new Hillman Imp – an inspiration in light car design. Accelerates from 0-50 m.p.h. in 15.5 seconds.”View image in fullscreen‘Meet the new Hillman Imp – an inspiration in light car design’Onwards to 1972, on 23 September, the back page of Forest Review is given over to Player’s No 6: “The most popular filter cigarette in Britain.” Edward Heath’s Conservative government had reached an agreement with the tobacco industry the previous year and the message at the bottom – “Every packet carries a government health warning” – was a recent, significant development.Leading from the front, meanwhile, is an appeal from the chair, Ken Smales, urging supporters to buy a copy of the 1972 Nottingham Forest Annual. “At only 15p it is certainly not a profit-making venture, but an honest effort by the club to inform the fan of some of our activities,” Smales writes. (Formerly a first-class cricketer for Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, Smales would give more than 35 years of service to Forest.)View image in fullscreenNottingham Forest v West Ham, September 1963, featuring a British Railways advert inviting fans to charter special services for away matches.On to 1979-80, the season of Forest’s second European Cup triumph, with the Clough era at its peak. The quality of the side facing Brighton on 17 November is certainly notable: Shilton, Anderson, Gray, McGovern, Lloyd, Needham, O’Neill, Bowles, Birtles, Francis, Robertson. The sole substitute is listed as “To be announced”, which thelate Guardian writer Jeremy Alexander– who donated the programmes – has crossed out and replaced with “Bowyer”. Despite their strength Forest were beaten 1-0 by the club Clough had left in 1974 for his brief spell at Leeds.View image in fullscreenViv Anderson enjoys a game of snooker with his fiancee, Debra, in 1983.On Saturday 19 April – less than six weeks before Forest defeated Hamburg at the Bernabéu for that second European Cup – they welcomed Derby; a player of the year voting slip is still tucked inside. Clough is pictured cheerily accepting a large bottle from the director of Bell’s Whisky, his manager of the month prize for March.Clough’s fondness for drink becomes still more apparent. With Watford the visitors in September 1982, a “friendly bet” between the manager and Scotland’s John Robertson is relayed to readers. “I bet I can do without a drink longer than you can do without a cigarette,” Clough told the winger. Hard to imagine a modern Premier League manager doing anything similar.“I like the chairman,” declares Clough of Elton John for that meeting with Graham Taylor’s Watford. “Those people who thought his presence as a figure head was something of a gimmick have been made to eat their words.” There is also a profile of the winger Calvin Plummer (Dislikes: Smoking, traffic jams), who toured apartheid South Africa that same year.View image in fullscreenBrian Clough previews a 1989 meeting with Arsenal.“At Home With Viv Anderson” is the most engaging feature for the meeting with QPR in September 1983: the future Arsenal and Manchester United full-back is pictured enjoying a game of snooker on his new table. “I must admit I enjoy having a table in the home,” Anderson said. “Although the novelty has worn off a bit, it’s a good way to relax.”Towards the end of the decade Clough’s irreverent style has developed further. “Poor old Bella Lugosi [sic] would have turned in his grave if he had seen our performance against Arsenal here last season,” he writes in September 1989 for the Gunners’ visit. “For any thick bonses [sic] who don’t know who Bella Lugosi was – he used to be a horror movie actor. And a good one at that!”View image in fullscreenThe late Nigel Doughty on the cover of a City Ground programme in 2012.Moving through the 2000s the programmes become shinier and more colourful but considerably less attractive. With Forest struggling on and off the pitch, the calibre of players on display declines accordingly.Poignantly, the final cover of the collection is a full-page picture of Nigel Doughty, published for the first home game after the Forest owner’s death in 2012. A tribute from the chief executive, Mark Arthur, reveals that Doughty, a Labour supporter, had often feared it was morally wrong to plough cash into a football club when there are “so many other worthwhile causes”.With football ever-more fuelled by vast amounts of money, Doughty’s social conscience feels more needed today – and is harder to come by among the current crop of football club owners. It’s also an example of the kind of historical perspective – along with the simple nostalgic thrill – brought by dusting off a pile of old matchday programmes.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestBrian CloughfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is not the open-hearted Britain I rememberJack NichollsI used to be proud of my birthplace for its cosmopolitan tolerance. Visiting now, it feels like stepping back decadesSat 14 Jun 2025 16.00 EDTShareIwas visiting family in London when the British supreme court handed down itsunexpected ruling: under the Equality Act, sex was now considered “binary” in law, which meant transgender people could be banned from single-sex spaces of their gender identity. The Labour government, which had come into office promising us “dignity”, capitulated. But, not to worry, soothed a minister, Pat McFadden, “There isn’t going to be toilet police.”A few days later the toilet police got me.It was my last night in London before returning to Australia. I was in full makeup and a dress when my female friends took me out dancing at an alternative hub that has always prided itself on being an accepting space. And for an hour everything was great. We danced and drank and shouted incoherent enthusiasms to each other. But as the gin and tonics settled in my bladder, I felt my anxiety building. In 15 years of visiting Britain I have been presenting feminine in public without any problem, including using women’s bathrooms.But now I needed to piss, and I was afraid.‘British feminism needs reshaping’: Kate Nash on her new single about trans rightsRead moreSensing my discomfort my friends loyally announced their own need to pee. So we filed through a maze of corridors until we got to the pair of doors that have bifurcated so much of my life.And there she was. The literal toilet police. She was a stocky woman marking each visitor as they approached the door and, as we passed, she raised a finger of doom and pointed it at me. “NO,” she commanded, then rotated the finger towards the masculine pictogram. “Yougo there.”We froze. I didn’t want to speak, ashamed of further betraying myself by my voice. Drunk and anxious as I was, the idea of going to that male bathroom, alone, was just impossible.It was as a young adult in London that I first felt fully able to embrace my genderMy friends came to the rescue, telling the guard to back off and escorting me into the women’s, which was crowded with people. Gaze fixed downwards to hide my humiliation, I pushed into a cubicle and peed. My head was ringing, there were raised voices outside, then the rap at the door.“OUT!”There was commotion, complete strangers were clamouring, I think, in my defence. The toilet policewoman ignored it all. I was obviously leaving anyway; there was nothing to be gained now but my humiliation.I can’t remember if I was given a chance to wash my hands.For a minute afterwards I stood crying against the wall. Then the toilet policewoman returned and took up position in front of me. She looked a little ashamed, and she touched a now-gentler hand to my arm.“It’s not me,” she said. “It’s just the way things are now.”“Just the way things are” means Britain has become a country where trans people can be yanked from their sports teams; where cash-strapped businesses can be forced to ghettoise their customers or potentially face legal action; and where cisgender women deemed insufficiently feminine fear abuse by self-appointed bathroom vigilantes.Because that’s the thing about oppression: it widens. It affects us all.I was born in the United Kingdom and consider it my second home. For years I have recognised its cultural pessimism and economic stagnation but I still loved it for its humour, its history and particularly for its cosmopolitan tolerance. It was as a young adult in London that I first felt fully able to embrace my gender. And while on this trip my Australian partner and I had been discussing immigrating to Britain, trying to picture what it would be like to make a life there.Disabled campaigners watching ‘in horror’ as trans people face toilet segregationRead moreWell, my experience made one thing clear. It would feel like stepping back 20 years in time, to a world that prickles against your skin in a hundred ways and where every outing is consumed by the need to “pass” as a survival strategy. Where it’s easier to be silent than to speak.It’s not just Britain. In Trump’s America, transgender soldiersare being purged from the militaryand trans visitorsare cancelling travel to the USout of fear of discrimination. In April the Hungarian governmentpassed a constitutional amendmentbanning any assembling of queer people. Across the world it’s not just bathroom doors that are slamming shut for transgender people.In this moment of global reaction, Australia has never felt so much like an island refuge. And I am deeply grateful for that. But I mourn the open-hearted country that I remember Britain being.When a traveller lands at Heathrow airport, they are met by posters of beaming Britons, arms outstretched, above the words WELCOME! In the wake of this court ruling, the sentiment rings hollow.I may not have been allowed to wash my hands. But the British state has made it clear that it has washed its hands of me.Jack Nicholls is a British-Australian essayist and speculative-fiction writer based in MelbourneExplore more on these topicsTransgenderOpinionLGBTQ+ rightsGendercommentShareReuse this content"

It is racism, pure and simpleSarah CreightonNorthern Ireland has always seen high levels of violence against women and girls. Blaming migrants is a useful way to distract from thatSat 14 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 04.48 EDTShareIn 1972, loyalist paramilitaries fired bullets into the home of aCatholic woman, Sarah McClenaghan. That night she was at home with her lodger, a Protestant, and her disabled teenage son, David. After forcing her son to get his mother’s rosary beads, proving that she was Catholic, a loyalist paramilitary raped Sarah. David was tortured. The gang then shot them both, David dying of his wounds.I thought about David and Sarah as I watched rolling news of thepogroms in Ballymena. I thought about them in light of the lie that violence against women and girls has been imported to Northern Ireland via migrants or asylum seekers. It’s always been here.The rioters say they are acting to drive out foreigners who pose a threat to women and girls. The irony isn’t lost on anybody with knowledge of the local area. Modern-day loyalist paramilitaries are reportedly involved with the violence. In the Belfast Telegraph this week, journalist Allison Morris reported that members of theSouth East Antrim Ulster Defence Association are among the rioters. “The organisation,” she writes, “has been regularly named by our sister paper, the Sunday Life, as protecting sex offenders.” Morris regularly faces death threats for her brave reporting.The riots in Ballymena are about racism and nothing more. Hatred smothers every brick and petrol bomb thrown. Nobody causing trouble cares about women or children. There are no legitimate concerns at the heart of this. Local Facebook groups with links to the far right are asking for addresses to hit – Roma people are the main target of their ire. Flyers posted around towns and cities call for people to take a stand to protect “our women” and “our Christian values”.‘In 14 years, never anything like this’: Ballymena’s foreigners describe fear after riotingRead moreThe trigger for the violence in Ballymena was the trauma and pain of a local family. Earlier in the week, two 14-year-old boyswere arrested and chargedwith the attempted rape of a young girl. Romanian interpreters were required at court.After the arrests, the alleged victim’s family asked for support and solidarity from their local community. Hundreds did so, peacefully protesting to show the family that they weren’t alone. Then came the violence. The chief constable of the Police Service ofNorthern Ireland(PSNI) said the victim of the alleged assault has been “further traumatised” by the rioting. Her family have publicly called for the violence to stop.Women have never been safe in Northern Ireland. Generations bore the weight of the Troubles, running households and raising children with absent husbands. Hundreds were murdered in the conflict. During the peace talks that led to the Good Friday agreement, theWomen’s Coalition, a political party, described the 30-year conflict as an “armed patriarchy”.Northern Ireland isn’t a place where women and girls are cherished. The PSNI recorded4,090 sexual offences in Northern Irelandin 2023-24.Twenty-five women have been killedin five years, mostly by white men from Northern Ireland.I knew one of them: Natalie McNally. We used to be mates. She last contacted me to ask about the home-buying process (I used to be a conveyancing solicitor). Natalie was buying her first house and the process was dragging on. She was killed in that same house in December 2022, her 15-week-old son in her belly. I was holding my own four-week-old son when I learned that she was dead. The trial isdue to take place in November, with the accused previously indicating that he is pleading not guilty.View image in fullscreenPeople gather at Queens University Belfast to protest against the rise in femicide in Northern Ireland, 16 October 2024.Photograph: HeadlineX_/AlamyWell, some say, if we have lots of homegrown criminals, we don’t need more. This is, again, another racist argument, an age-old trope that non-white men are sexual deviants. The problem is men, full stop. In every country in the world, in every community and every faith, people hate women. Misogyny doesn’t respect borders. Fascists want to talk about foreign men to distract from their own disgusting behaviour.Immigration concerns have featured heavily in the news. Because of the Troubles, Northern Ireland always had low levels of migration. That has changed in recent years. Net migrationreached its highest levels in 15 yearsin 2024. No doubt this has changed certain areas and proved alienating for local people and migrants alike. However, according to a Northern Ireland assembly report, Northern Ireland is still theleast diverse region of the UK. Only 3.4% of people are from a minority ethnic group, compared to 18.3% in England.Before migrant numbers rose, Northern Ireland’s public services were on their knees. The health service has all but collapsed. The housing system is under considerable strain, we don’t have enough housing to meet demand and rents have risen to unaffordable levels.People have migrated into this mess. It would be churlish to deny that higher numbers have put pressure on the system. But it’s a flat-out lie to blame migrants and refugees for this country’s ills. Migrants didn’t decimate the NHS. Refugees didn’t underfund social housing and homeless services. Local and nationalpoliticians did that. They are doing very little to fix the systems that broke under their watch. It’s easier to blame people working as Deliveroo drivers.Northern Ireland needs to tackle its fondness for racism and xenophobia. Racially motivated hate crime is at its highest level since records began. It affects every community, Catholic and Protestant. You can’t “legitimate concern” your way through a pogrom and doing so only validates hatred.If women in Northern Ireland rioted every time one of us was attacked, the country would lie in ashes.Sarah Creighton is a lawyer, writer and political commentator from Northern IrelandDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Some, nostalgic for the world that was, reject “unfreedom” as an exaggerated description of our situation. Others, seeing reality clearly, nevertheless hide from the unnerving implications.Some people, a minority, experience the changes that have come to America in 2025 as liberation. They are free to say and do what they want with impunity and without shame. On the other side of the spectrum, many who are not free now also were not before, and they suffered no illusion that they were. Now, they might raise an eyebrow to the rest of us, asking if we now see what this country has long been for some people, much of the time.But for most in this country, unfreedom is a novel experience. What makes this condition confounding is that our unfreedom doesn’t yet look like it does in Russia or China – it is still partial. Most in this country can still enjoy a dinner out with friends, loudly deploring the current state of affairs. For most, authoritarianism has not snuffed out the pleasures, private or communal, of a spring morning in the park. In fact, most of us can still read about horrors while lying on the grass, soaking up the sun.The newly unfree live with cognitive dissonance. You hear of people like doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk and labor leader David Huerta innocently walking down the street or protesting outside an immigration detention center, or even presiding in their courtroom – being arrested, detained or abducted. Institutions founded on principles of free expression or the rule of law have quickly abandoned them to avoid financial losses. People hesitate to travel abroad for fear of what will happen when they try to return to the country they’ve called home. And now, we have 2,000 national guard troops and 700 marines sent to a city to repress protest against the wishes of the governor and mayor. After Los Angeles, more Americans are conscious of our growing unfreedom.When – if – you wake up to our shared condition of unfreedom, you face an existential choice. Do you act on what you know to be true, or do you hide? Too many corporate titans, university presidents and heads of major law firms are behaving as though they are powerless. Members of Congress admit that they are afraid to speak up. Judges talk openly about the threats they face to their safety.Those leading powerful institutions still have leverage. They still have power. We must call on them to unite and exercise it. Silence and hiding will offer no lasting reprieve.But regular people, everyday people, face a different challenge. In order to act, they must first discover their power – and learn how to use it.What should using that power look like? A dilemma for those awake to our growing unfreedom is that the tools we know how to use to change things no longer seem to work. Protests are crucial in raising awareness, but often don’t compel those in power to change course. Representatives are less responsive to our advocacy. The rules have changed. Reason, evidence and expertise don’t carry the day. Norms we once took for granted are gone.There are ways we can oppose authoritarianism, using techniques that haven’t been used at a scale for decades. These tools are our inheritance. They have been passed down for centuries, by abolitionist campaigners, labor organizers and anti-colonial leaders. Gandhi famously revived them in the early 20th century, inspiring many leaders in the US civil rights movement. The Black freedom struggle, this country’s leading democracy movement, has in turn inspired nearly every peaceful, people-powered movement around the world since. This is the lineage of strategic nonviolence to which we must now return. These are the tools we must rediscover.View image in fullscreenSue. Protest. Vote. Then, rinse and repeat. In recent years, pro-democracy advocates have faithfully followed that formula. These strategies have prevented many abuses. But they did not prevent an authoritarian movement from gaining strength. And they won’t be enough to prevent what we now face: the prospect of years of authoritarian rule, or something far worse.So what is to be done?Much depends on how quickly civil society can remake itself for this new era. We can learn from previous generations of change-makers in the US, and from contemporaries around the world today, who have won by deploying a booster formula for times such as these. It is simple:Disrupt. De-legitimize. And draw defectors.To be clear, the formula of sue, protest and vote remains absolutely necessary – but is not sufficient.Lawsuits curbed the worst excesses of Trump’s first term and have been among the few speed bumps slowing the current administration’s much more aggressive rampage against civil liberties and the rule of law. But we are already seeing open defiance of court orders.When Trump was asked whether he was obligated as president to uphold the constitution in the case of Kilmar Ábrego García, who had been wrongly deported from the US, he replied: “I don’t know.” While Ábrego García is now back on US soil, preventing this particular collision course, other contempt trials continue to play out and legal experts fear many more opportunities for Trump to even more brazenly defy the courts.History also suggests reasons to avoid placing too much hope in the courts, because they cannot always be counted on to save us. Consider Dred Scott v Sandford in 1857, when the supreme court ruled that Black Americans were not citizens; Plessy v Ferguson in 1896, upholding racial segregation; Korematsu v United States in 1944, allowing Japanese citizens to be interned in camps; or Trump v United States just last year, in which the court needlessly expanded the doctrine of presidential immunity. Lawsuits buy us essential time, but by themselves are not a sufficient safeguard of our freedoms.In fact, history further suggests that the courts move in concert with public opinion – and are often pushed by people who take bold action. The supreme court only affirmed same-sex marriage rights, for instance, afterpublic support had increasedfollowing years of organizing and advocacy.Protests also play a vital role in building the confidence of those opposed to an authoritarian government’s policies. They help people see they are not alone. And they help embolden those in power who may be sympathetic to the opposition.But while protest remains an effective means of focusing pressure and raising awareness, protest alone can’t force authoritarian coalitions to change. Authoritarians revel in their power to defy dissidents – and can become violent in doing so, as we have seen in Los Angeles this week. Authoritarians have also learned to disregard many types of dissent. Erica Chenoweth, a leading scholar of protest, found thatprotest movements have recently become less effectivein unseating despots around the world, due in part to authoritarians’ growing savvy in repressing them or waiting them out.Meanwhile, sociologistZeynep Tufekciand journalistVincent Bevinshave reported that mass protests facilitated by social media lack the power of protests of a previous era because they are not undergirded by organizations that can negotiate and adapt tactics as circumstances change. Mass protest is essential, but it is not a panacea.Voting is crucial. But rulings on everything from redistricting to campaign finance to voter suppression bills make clear that elements of the federal judiciary are all too happy to disenfranchise voters across the nation. And we cannot wait for communities to make their voices heard at the polls. What happens now will determine whether this country even has free and fair midterm elections.The situation is dire. But as we look to the other movements that have successfully defeated authoritarianism and achieved democratic breakthroughs, it’s useful to maintain perspective. Movements in places like South Africa, Brazil and the Jim Crow south succeeded under conditions far worse than those we face today – when the right to vote and to protest did not exist, when courts were uniformly hostile, when the media and other major institutions were captured. How can it be possible to prevail under such conditions?View image in fullscreenRev James Lawson came into the Los Angeles community center and greeted everyone personally. Some two decades later, I still remember how intently he listened to the two dozen immigrant-rights organizers who had come seeking advice on how we might achieve a federal path to citizenship for undocumented people living in the US. We described a strategy focused on mass mobilization, skillful advocacy with policymakers, and expert communications to frame the problem and solution.His response was kind but firm. Our strategy wouldn’t work, he said. We were playing by the rules of someone else’s game. This Black American leader had seen the full truth of this country – the horrors as well as the heroism – and from that experience learned some hard truths. He wanted to share them with this group of mostly first-generation immigrants, many of whom still believed what we read in textbooks about how change happens. If we wanted to succeed, he said, we would have to engage in nonviolent disruption at a scale big enough to force a moral and economic crisis that would bring about change.We weren’t ready or able to take Rev Lawson’s advice then. We pursued a strategy that achieved some important gains in policy, but were unsuccessful in our efforts to pass federal immigration reform.Maybe we are ready to listen to him now.Rev Lawson knew more about disruption than perhaps any living American. He was, as Dr Martin Luther King Jr called him, the “leading nonviolence theorist in the world”. In the 1950s and 60s, he trained thousands of civil rights leaders and marchers, including John Lewis, to meet violence with love and dignity. He worked closely with the Little Rock Nine, who led the desegregation of an Arkansas high school, helping them muster the courage to remain composed as they walked into school amid a barrage of violent hate. He prepared the brave participants in Nashville’s sit-ins to desegregate lunch counters. He was instrumental in organizing the freedom rides in protest of the defiance of the ruling ordering the desegregation of buses.I’d first met Rev Lawson over a decade before that meeting, as part of a small training on principles of nonviolence that he held for organizers in Los Angeles. I had studied Gandhi and the ideas he’d developed during the Indian independence struggle. I was part of the Aids movement, and I’d witnessed a lot of death and government-sponsored cruelty. I thought I knew the material, but what Rev Lawson taught me in our first meeting shook me to the core.I had expected a master class in tactics. How do you plan a sit-in? How do you get press attention? What police tactics can you anticipate? Where do you have lawyers waiting? Instead, Rev Lawson devoted the first few hours of the training inviting us into deep introspection. He opened a dialogue about love, and asked if we loved our opponents. My attitude was well-captured by Tina Turner: “what’s love got to do with it?”While I had viewed nonviolence as a strategy, Rev Lawson understood nonviolence as a way of life. He believed the principles and techniques he taught couldn’t work without this depth of commitment. You couldn’t win defectors to your side without taking the moral high ground, and you couldn’t convincingly fake love for any length of time.We spent the next few hours of the training on building discipline. How do you conduct yourself facing unimaginable pressure and violence? I remember him inches from my face, calling me names and threatening me, trying to provoke a reaction. At the end, he assessed our performance. Did we manifest love, even to our opponents? Did we maintain the composure under fire that he demanded? With a glance, he let me know that I had done much better with discipline than with love. I’d been resolutely nonviolent, but was obviously smoldering inside.Rev Lawson was teaching us the art and science of nonviolent disruption. This is the hidden electric current that has powered the great episodes of American progress. WEB Du Boisexplainedthat it was enslaved people themselves, and not white northerners, who broke the back of the plantation economy and won their own freedom by engaging in a loosely coordinated “general strike” that fatally damaged the southern cause. In more recent decades, the United Farm Workers’grape boycottof 1965 andstrikes by teachersin 2018 andautoworkersin 2024 are iconic examples of nonviolent disruption that delivered results.Disruption differs from protest in a key sense. Where protests are designed to capture attention, Rev Lawson constantly reminded us that disruption is not always loud and noisy. Sometimes it involves sitting where you’re not supposed to, not buying what you usually do, or not showing up for work. The point is that disruption must exact real economic or political costs on authoritarians and their collaborators.During the early days of the administration, we have already seen such methods yield results. Take the ongoingboycott of Targetover its diversity, equity and inclusion policy rollback, which has depressed the chain’s foot traffic and stock price, or the widespreaddisavowal of Tesla, resulting in a worldwide sales crisis for Elon Musk’s once-trendy automaker. Or look at the Los Angeles unified school district’s refusal to give federal immigration authorities access to the city’s schools.These acts of non-cooperation create friction, and friction slows the consolidation of authoritarianism. Each act of non-cooperation, of disruption, inspires others to use the power they have to throw sand in the gears.It’s an encouraging start. But there is more that must be done to revive the tools Rev Lawson, who died in 2024, left us for times such as these. I am inspired by an organization called Free DC, which is leading the way in revitalizing the lineage of nonviolence for this generation by training and organizing thousands of people across our nation’s capital to stand up for the capital city’s right to home rule, defend workers at federal agencies and protect immigrants. It is a fitting place to begin; Washington DC is still a colony and it is reeling from the firings of thousands of its residents, government workers, without cause.To meet the moment, it will be crucial to scale the work of organizations like FreeDC across the nation and train tens of thousands more in the proud nonviolent tradition that Rev Lawson and his fellow civil rights pioneers left us.View image in fullscreenThousands of people have descended on town hall meetings around the country opposing cuts to Medicaid, which provides essential healthcare and elder care to nearly 80 million people. Some of those showing up are members of unions, community groups and disability groups. Others are people who have never taken action before for whom Congress’s decision is a matter of life and death. Camilla Hudson came to Washington DC to defend Medicaid because she has an autoimmune disease that requires expensive treatments.She explainedthat without prescription drug coverage, “it’s terrifying … I would have to leave the US because I will die here.”These people may have voted for Trump, for Harris or not at all in 2024. Medicaid is even more important to people in red states than blue states. Most of them would not show up to a rally to defend the rule of law, but they are highly motivated by an issue that hits close to home. The activism is having a huge impact assome unlikely voicesin Congress – who have been otherwise loath to break from the administration – openly declare their opposition to cuts.Meanwhile, thousands of people around the country have mobilized to protect their immigrant co-workers, co-parishioners and neighbors. The upswelling of support in Los Angeles, for example, includes union members,people of faithand relatives of immigrants who were not active before the recent raids.This is what it means to de-legitimize – and it goes hand in hand with disruption. De-legitimization, the process of driving down public support for authoritarian policies, recognizes that an administration with policies polling in the 20s or low 30s will be less able to execute its agenda or prevail in the courts than a government whose policies are supported broadly by the public.The goal is to win over everyday people through organizing, helping them understand the connections between the challenges they’re facing and the harmful actions of the administration. This process will ideally help people identify authoritarian strategies, allowing them to better resist propaganda. If done well, organizing can also serve to strengthen citizens’ commitment to democratic principles by offering them an experience of democracy in practice each day, rather than as a quadrennial abstraction.To this end, the administration’s “flood the zone” attacks on so many cornerstones of American life offer not only the biggest organizing imperative, but also the biggest organizing opportunity of our lifetimes. We must harness the power of the many millions of Americans who now feel under threat, including older Americans, veterans, the US-citizen children and spouses of immigrants, the parents of disabled and trans kids, and the large number of people who would be affected by cuts to Medicaid, including patients and medical workers. To name a few.Unexpected constituencies are raising their voices. Take scientists, who have long sought to protect their research by staying away from politics. Recognizing that the administration’s actions are not only undermining their own work but destroying the scientific enterprise for a generation, they are speaking out and even organizing marches of their own.Perhaps the greatest organizing challenge facing the pro-democracy coalition in the US will be bridging between the largely middle-class constituency that is fired up about attacks on the rule of law and the largely working-class base that is focused on kitchen table issues – not on a system that hasn’t been working for them. Without the latter group, the coalition will not be big enough to succeed.We must not be seen to be working to restore a broken system, but rather to transform it through a new vision, with accompanying policy goals. That may include, for example, campaigns for workers’ rights to help dissolve the unnatural bond between billionaires and some blue-collar voters that fuels the authoritarian coalition.We must develop and demonstrate alternatives that people will believe in.View image in fullscreenDisruption and de-legitimization lead to the third key objective: drawing defectors. These efforts must be targeted across the ideological spectrum and they must be achieved at two levels: that of institutions and individuals. Authoritarians rely on support, whether passive or active, from key pillars of society: corporations, churches, police and media outlets, among others. Under pressure, institutions like law firms and Columbia University shamefully moved from neutrality to active collaboration with authoritarianism.It does not have to be this way. Harvard’s recent decision to challenge the administration in court is an example of institutional defection, moving from the sidelines to active opposition. It did not happen by accident. Harvard’s action was the culmination of a massive behind-the-scenes organizing campaign of faculty, students, donors and alumni. Similar efforts are taking place across law firms, foundations and other universities.Employees have considerable leverage when it comes to winning defections at scale among businesses, faith institutions, tech companies, the military and law enforcement. They can push their institutions to not “obey in advance” and instead openly resist authoritarianism. Many individuals across the country who are concerned about the advance of authoritarianism forget the power they can wield over the institutions they are a part of. Now is the time to use it.It is also necessary to win defections at the level of everyday people. Consider the example of Women of Welcome, a group of evangelicals who educate and engage other Christians on issues related to immigrants and refugees. This group recently led a delegation of evangelical women to the southern US border to provide aid to asylum seekers and listen to their stories. They are not progressives – but they are taking a strong public stand for immigrants and recruiting their neighbors in communities that have been broadly receptive to the Trump administration’s xenophobic appeals.In seeking to build a pro-democracy coalition, members of the opposition must resist the impulse to write off, shame or expel those with whom they have disagreed in the past and may still disagree on many important issues. The imperative of defeating authoritarianism must supersede internecine fights or purity tests. It is essential to talk to everyone.Embodying the moral character taught by civil rights leaders like Rev Lawson – acting nonviolently and showing love to those on the other side – will be vital in creating the kind of attractive, welcoming gateway for defectors to join the movement. Doing so will help to create a pro-democracy majority that extends beyond our traditional allies in the progressive movement.I may finally grasp what Rev Lawson meant when he said that love is our secret weapon. When a mom and her three school-aged children were detained by Ice in the small upstate New York town of Sackets Harbor (ironically, the home of Tom Homan, the administration’s immigration enforcement “czar”), public school teachers and administrators swung into action, engaging in aggressive advocacy. These educators may or may not have been politically engaged before, but their care for their students moved them to take a stand, speak up and choose opposition over collaboration. They won – the mom and kids are free as a result of their courage.View image in fullscreenWe face considerable obstacles in trying to prevent the consolidation of authoritarianism in the United States. But the truth is that they are smaller than those encountered by prior generations. The freedom rides, orchestrated in part by Rev Lawson, are now iconic, but we forget the violence that riders encountered in the process. Following the successful Birmingham campaign to win desegregation in 1963, four little Black girls were killed in the 16th Street Baptist church bombing. The next year, civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were the victims of a deadly KKK conspiracy in Mississippi.Yes, the physical threats to judges, politicians, election officials and citizens in the United States are real. Yes, immigrants have been taken off the streets and held without due process. Fortunately, as worrying as this week’s troop deployment to California should be to all of us, we still have a precious window of time to organize and dissent openly. We can take hope from cases around the world when everyday people have made that choice in large numbers.U-turns happen. Scholarshave foundthat 73% of episodes of authoritarian breakthrough around the world in the last 30 years have been followed by democratic revivals. Sometimes, those revivals bring about an even stronger democracy than what came before. But U-turns aren’t self-executing. And the time to act is limited – comparable cases like India and Hungary suggest that if authoritarianism is not effectively challenged in the first couple of years, it can deepen and become the new normal for a decade or more.Our aspiration cannot be to return to the before times. The rotten fruit of authoritarianism grew in the soil of obscene inequality and insufficiently democratic institutions. We must therefore not only oppose autocracy, but propose something better – democratic alternatives that are ready to go if we can awaken from this nightmare.Rev Lawson and his contemporaries did not promise an easy path. Millions of us will have to reckon honestly with our current reality. We will need to make the choice to act. We will need to contribute our time, talent and money strategically. We will have to tap deep reservoirs of courage and love we didn’t know we had. Rev Lawson’s key teaching was hopeful: if we do those things, we can get free.Deepak Bhargava has been an organizer and campaigner for 30 years and is the co-author of Practical Radicals: Seven Strategies to Change the World.

If only, they ask, the wheels of the banking industry could be cranked to spin faster, surely much more money could be generated and we would all be rich.While Rachel Reeves boasted of the huge benefit to economic growth from public investments in rail and renewable energy as central pillars of the government’sspending review, in truth it is not enough to propel the economy forward.To generate the kind of income that will pay for the next 30 years of an ageing society,plans to link Manchester and Liverpoolby a marginally faster and more reliable train, though good in itself, is not the answer. The Treasury knows it is just an upgrade to existing services and will deliver only incremental returns.To turbocharge growth, the chancellor wants private money to take the lead, partnering government to share the burden of building bridges and tunnels and spurring investments in whizzy new ventures.And as a start, the Treasury wants the shackles taken off the bankers so they can become more inventive in the way they make money, taking risks that were previously frowned upon, if not banned, and rewarding themselves accordingly.It is 18 years since Northern Rock’s high-risk mortgage lending began to unravel and 17 years since Lehman Brothers went bust. Long enough, it seems, for memories to fade, and with them concerns about the damaging consequences of light-touch regulation.That said, it’s easy to see why the temptation to let the banks loose is back on the agenda. UK banks are among the most profitable in Europe and London plays host to the largest number of foreign banks. The UK’s unicorn businesses – those privately held startup companies worth more than £1bn – rank in number behind only the US, India and China.Some startups are considered to be at the forefront of the financial technology boom, including Revolut and Monzo. What could be better for Britain than to leverage a fintech industry that already has a worldwide reputation?Revolut has championed handling funds invested in cryptocurrencies, and for this service, and its banking and wealth management, it has emerged as the most successful European fintech of the past decade. It wasvalued at $45bnlast year. And there is no stopping the chief executive, co-founder and 25% owner,Nikolay Storonsky. He plans to expand into mortgages and consumer lending to challenge the major lenders, as well as growing in the US.Monzo is the digital bank best known for its coral pink debit cards. After 10 years, the company announced its first profit last year, of £15.4m, after more than doubling revenues to almost £900m.Reeves also wants pension funds to take more risks, which is a boon for an asset management industry that has fallen out of favour with the public in recent years due to its high charges and failure to deliver returns that better passive investments.Last week, the House of Lords financial services regulation committee gave Labour’s mission a boost. It attacked the main City watchdogs – the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority – for having “a deeply entrenched culture of risk aversion”. In a report that the Treasury will have privately welcomed, the committee said the regulators were partly to blame for holding back economic growth.If the FCA and PRA, which have already pledged to reduce the paperwork and oversight of the City, become more trusting of its ability to manage risk, there is likely to be a sugar rush of activity, much as there was during the noughties.Labour has helped get the ball rolling by lifting the bankers’ bonus cap, to allow publicly listed banks to join the bonanza of rewards enjoyed by executives in Revolut and Monzo.Monzo may have made only £15.4m profit but this modest sum was not to be re-invested. It was enough to warrant big payouts, including a £12m bag of cash and shares that Reuters said most likely went to the chief executive, TS Anil.Underscoring how light-touch regulation is matched by executive pay bonanzas, areport last monthby the jobs website eFinancialCareers found that bonuses in the UK’s investment banks had risen by 26% year on year, beating their equivalents in Asia, Europe and the US. The average bonus payout for a City executive was about £110,000. And the trickle-down effect works in finance. At junior levels, bonuses increased by as much as 133%, the survey found.Labour’s backbench MPs know how this play ends. After all the partying and profit-making, there will be a severe hangover. And when that happens, the taxpayer is asked to save the day. Somehow, the profits of the financial sector belong to the bosses and the losses belong to the people.Explore more on these topicsFinancial sectorFintechExecutive pay and bonusesEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

This also just happens to be the 79th birthday of President Donald J Trump. As commander-in-chief, he will take the salute from a viewing platform on Constitution Avenue.But this is not a mere vanity project, as some critics have claimed. History really matters to the US’s 47th president. One of Trump’s last acts before reluctantly leaving the White House in January 2021 was topublish a reportby his “1776 Commission”, created to “restore understanding of the greatness of the American Founding”. Deliberately, the commissioners included few university historians because universities were described as often being “hotbeds of anti-Americanism, libel, and censorship that combine to generate in students and in the broader culture at the very least disdain and at worst outright hatred for this country”.The 1776 Commission demanded a return to truly “patriotic education”, declaring: “We must resolve to teach future generations of Americans an accurate history of our country so that we all learn and cherish our founding principles once again. We must renew the pride and gratitude we have for this incredible nation that we are blessed to call home.”In this spirit, on 2 May this year,the president postedthat he was renaming 8 May and 11 November respectively as “Victory Day for World War II and Victory Day for World War I” because “we won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance”, and it was time for the US to “start celebrating our victories again!”The parade on 14 June is also intended to raise the curtain on a spectacular nationwide celebration of the 250th anniversary of US independence, extending right across the country and culminating on 4 July 2026. According tothe White House website, one feature will be a video history series that “tells the remarkable story of American Independence. It will highlight the stories of the crucial characters and events that resulted in a small rag-tag army defeating the mightiest empire in the world and establishing the greatest republic ever to exist.”History on parade, indeed. As is often the case, Trump does start with a valid point. After he witnessed the extravaganzaof Bastille Day in 2017, where French and American troops marched down the Champs-Élysées to celebrate the centenary of the US’s entry into the first world war, he was determined to stage a parade of his own. So what’s wrong with that? Shouldn’t countries be proud of their past?OK (if you don’t mind the cost). But pride should be rooted in honesty, especially when Nato in Europe is engaged in a proxy war in Ukraine against Vladimir Putin, a systematic falsifier of history. And if we’re trying to be honest, world wars aren’t like the World Series with one country trumping all the others and winning almost single-handedly.Take the second world war. On 3 May this year, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedevdismissed Trump’s claimsas “pretentious nonsense”, asserting that “Victory Day is ours and it is 9 May. So it was, so it is, so it will always be!” Medvedev is now an obedient Putinist, but he and other Russians rightly point to their huge losses in 1941-45 – roughly 27 million people. Stated differently, in the three years from June 1941 to June 1944, between Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union and the D-day landings in Normandy, more than 90% of the German army’s battle casualties (killed, wounded, missing and prisoners) were inflicted by the Red Army. That puts Alamein and Tunis, Anzio and the liberation of Rome into a different perspective.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump at the annual Bastille Day military parade in Paris, 14 July 2017.Photograph: Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty ImagesYet Americans can rightly say that they were in a league of their own as a “superpower” – a word coined in 1944 to signify “great power and great mobility of power”. Their huge C-47 transport planes and the B-17 and B-24 bombers allowed the US to wage war right across the world. Their modern fleets of aircraft carriers, built to avenge Pearl Harbor, island-hopped across the Pacific to Japan itself. The Pacific war ended with the firebombing of Tokyo and the nuclear obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Or consider the speed of the remarkable breakout from Normandy that enabled allied armies to liberate Brussels on 3 September 1944, occupying positions they had not expected to reach until May 1945. When an astonished Winston Churchill asked how the GIs were being fed and supplied, US general Omar Bradley said he was running trucks up to the front “bumper to bumper, 24 hours a day”. Ford delivered the goods.But Britain also played a crucial part in victory. Had our embattled island gone the same way as Scandinavia, France and the Low Countries in the summer of 1940, Hitler would have thrown all his resources against the Soviet Union, while Roosevelt’s US would probably have turned in on itself and concentrated on defending the western hemisphere. Instead, a combination of Churchillian leadership, modern fighters linked to the new Chain Home system of radar and the courage of the RAF pilots managed to keep Hitler at bay. Eventually, Britain became the essential supply base and launchpad for the liberation of Hitler’s Fortress Europe.And so in 1944-45, the allied armies converged on Germany from east, west and south. Of course, it was an unholy alliance, animated by divergent aims and values. But the extermination of nazism was a goal all the allies shared.Trump is waging war against his own citizens in Los Angeles | Judith LevineRead moreWith this in mind, let’s glance back to the US’s most important victory: independence. Yes, this was in large measure a David v Goliath story of “a small rag-tag army defeating the mightiest empire in the world”. The US’s independence was indeed testimony to George Washington’s leadership and his troops’ courage and resilience (reinforced by his insistence on inoculation against the smallpox epidemic). But this wasalso a world waras the British empire battled against its global foes. Crucially, by the 1780s Britain lost naval supremacy because (unusually) three rival seapowers had combined against it: France, Spain and the Dutch. It was blockade by the French fleet that forced Lord Cornwallis’s historic surrender at Yorktown in 1781 and British acceptance of American independence.The purpose of historical research is to set events in context, not to boost national pride. The story of the US’s founding, like that of Hitler’s defeat, reminds us that allies matter – in the past, the present and the future. That should not be forgotten when history goes on parade.David Reynolds’s most recent book is Mirrors of Greatness: Churchill and the leaders who shaped him.

Now the US risks being mired in another warMohamad BazziIf Trump wants to be the peacemaker he claims to be, he must negotiate a new deal with TehranSat 14 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 05.02 EDTShareBefore dawn on Friday, Israel unleashed a wave of air strikes against more than100 targets in Iran, including nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and air defense systems. The surprise Israeli attack also killed some of Iran’s most senior military commanders and nuclear scientists. The Iranian regime called it a “declaration of war” – and western powers raced to prevent a wider regional conflict that could draw in the US along with other countries in the Middle East.While the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, claims that he’s trying to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, the attack is as much intended to blow up ongoing negotiations between Tehran and Donald Trump’s administration. While Trump’s overall foreign policy has been a disaster, for months he hadresisted Netanyahu’s pleasto give Israel a green light to attack Iran, with US assistance. Trump insisted he wanted a chance to negotiate a deal with Iran’s leaders that would compel Tehran to give up its nuclear program in exchange for relief from US and other international sanctions.Benjamin Netanyahu must be stopped | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreAfter Friday’s attacks, Trump suggested the Iranian regime could still be convinced to negotiate,saying Tehran“must make a deal, before there is nothing left”. He added that Israel could carry out further attacks that would be “even more brutal”. Before Trump’s aggressive comments, his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had gone out of his way to explain that Israel had taken“unilateral action”and warned Tehran against targeting US military bases or embassies in the Middle East. “We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio said.It’s hard to imagine that Netanyahu would have launched such a brazen attack against Iran without at least some tacit support from Trump. Like all modern US presidents, Trump has lavished Israel withbillions of dollars in weaponsand has undermined international law and institutions like the UN security council to shield Israel from criticism. But Trump also prizes his reputation as a dealmaker, and he had invested significant political capital in negotiating an agreement with Iran. In a call this week, the president reportedlytold the prime ministerhe preferred diplomacy.By attacking Iran and torpedoing the negotiations, Netanyahu outplayed Trump – and the Israeli leader may well ensnare the US in a new Middle East conflict that Trump insists he does not want. Since Netanyahu unleashed multiple wars in the region after the Hamas attack on southernIsraelin October 2023, he’s confident that the US will always bail him out. Even after Israel launched a war on Gaza, a two-month ground invasion of Lebanon and frequent attacks on Syria, it continues to receive virtually unlimited US weapons and political support from Washington.Is it any surprise that Netanyahu has been emboldened to take greater risks that undermine several of Israel’s neighbors and now threaten to engulf the wider Middle East in a regional war? Starting with steadfast support from Joe Biden’s administration and continuing with Trump, Netanyahu knows that the US will always protect Israel from the costs of its escalation and adventurism. And US taxpayers are footing the bill: from October 2023 through September 2024, theUS provided Israelwith nearly $18bn in weapons, while the Pentagon spent another $4.9bn on its own military activities in the Middle East. That’s $22.7bn in US funding that enabled Netanyahu to prolong Israel’s brutal war on Gaza, an offensive in which Israel hascommitted war crimesand sparked accusations of genocide.For its part, the Trump administration announced in February that it would send more than $8bn innew weapons to Israel– continuing Biden’s failed policy of unrestrained arms shipments and unwavering political support for Netanyahu. Trump, the supposedly grand dealmaker, has so far failed to use the most effective leverage he has over the Israeli premier: the provision of US weapons and political cover.Despite Trump’spersistent claimthat he wants to be a peacemaker who ends America’s legacy of forever wars, he now risks becoming yet another US president who is mired in a disastrous conflict in the Middle East – thanks to his refusal to restrain Netanyahu, a US ally who has not yet paid any price for his warmongering.In his inaugural address in January, Trump reinforced his desire to establish himself as a mediator who will end global conflicts, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and avoid new wars entirely. “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier,”he said. Trump had also stewed for years over the fact that his predecessor, Barack Obama, won the Nobel peace prize during his first year in office in 2009, while Trump was passed over for the honor, even though he had brokered a series of diplomatic deals in 2020, known as the Abraham Accords, between Israel and several Arab states.If Trump has any hope of winning a Nobel prize – or even salvaging a minor legacy as a peacemaker – he will need to fix theIranagreement he tore up seven years ago.In 2018, during his first term, Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from a deal that was signed by Obama, and had taken years for Iran to negotiate with six world powers, under which Tehran limited its nuclear enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief. The 2015 agreement, which Trump had called a “disaster”, allowed Iran to continue producing nuclear fuel at low levels, enough to operate nuclear power plants but not to produce weapons. After Trump abandoned the original deal, Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon than ever before. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as of early this year, Tehran hadenriched enough uraniumto produce six nuclear weapons, although Iran would still need up to a year of additional work to develop an actual nuclear warhead and deploy it on a missile.In the early weeks of his second term, Trump seemed eager to negotiate a new deal with Iran:he sent a letterto Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying the US wanted to restart negotiations that had been abandoned by the Biden administration. As he often does in negotiations with foes and enemies alike, Trump then issued a threat, warning Iran’s leaders that if diplomacy failed, they would be subjected to “bombing the likes of which they have never seen before”.In March, Trump dispatched his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to lead a team of US negotiators to meet with top Iranian officials in mostly indirect talks mediated by Oman. Since then, Iran and the US have held five rounds of talks. The next round of negotiations was supposed to be held on Sunday, with Witkoff heading to Oman.During its attacks on Friday,Israel killed Ali Shamkhani, one of the top Iranian officials responsible for nuclear negotiations with the US. A top aide to Iran’s supreme leader, Shamkhani was not officially part of the Iranian delegation in the current round of US talks, but he played a pivotal role in overseeing nuclear policy.Iran haspulled outof the latest round of talks scheduled for this weekend. Netanyahu might have destroyed Trump’s chance at making a deal with Iran – and the prime minister has increased the likelihood of yet another disastrous war.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpIsraelUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Today’s protagonist is Sabrina Carpenter, a pop star whose music videos have got a Brooklyn priestdemotedand might have played asmall rolein getting the mayor of New York, Eric Adams,indicted.On Wednesday, Carpenterrevealed the cover artfor her forthcoming album Man’s Best Friend in a social media post, which featured two photos side by side. One was a closeup of what appears to be a fluffy dog with a collar bearing the words “man’s best friend”. The other is a photo of Carpenter on her hands and knees in front of a man who is pulling her by the hair.The imagery has caused controversy and drawn mixed reactions. On the one hand, you’ve got people who think Carpenter is being clever. On the other hand, you’ve got people who think she is being crass and catering to the male gaze in a way that is extremely unhelpful to women.In the latter camp isGlasgow Women’s Aid, a Scottish group that helps victims of domestic violence. They have called the imagery “regressive” and “a throwback to tired tropes that reduce women to pets, props, and possessions and promote an element of violence and control”.Women of West Virginia: inform on yourself to the miscarriage police! | Arwa MahdawiRead moreSome people on social media vehemently disagree. “i am a little concerned about peoples inability to immediately clock that the cover is obviously a commentary on the way women are treated, especially with the context of manchild [the lead single from the album] and the album being called man’s best friend like guys omfg think,” someone in the “Sabrina’s doing satire!” camp posted. That gotover 53,000 likes.(I, myself, am a little concerned about people’s inability to use apostrophes.)Meanwhile, Diet Prada (an influential Instagram account with more than 3.4 million followers)posted a pictureof the video with the line “let women be h*rny on main” and a caption that essentially called Carpenter’s critics stupid prudes.I’m all for letting “women be h*rny on main” but I’m having a hard time seeing Carpenter’s cover art as either satire or sex-positive feminism. Sure, some of the best satire is extremely subtle. But this isn’t subtle or sex-positive – it’s just soft porn pandering to the male gaze.At a different point in time I suppose you might be able to make the case that this sort of imagery was edgy and subversive. Madonna, for example, used her sexuality to challenge social norms. But at the current moment, when sexualized imagery is everywhere, women’s rights are being aggressively rolled back in the US, and there isbacklash to women’s rightsaround the world, Carpenter’s cover art isn’t subverting anything.The hair-grabbing visual is in particularly poor tasteconsidering recent court testimonythat Sean “Diddy” Combs grabbed his then girlfriend Cassie Ventura by the hair and dragged her into another room where he assaulted her. There is also verydisturbing videosurveillance of Combs assaulting Ventura. If Carpenter’s fans can’t see all the problems with this imagery, then it’s because internalized misogyny is everywhere – and it’s a real bitch. (Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution.)None of this, to be clear, is an attack on Carpenter. In my best middle-aged woman voice I’d like to say thatI’m not angry, I’m just disappointed.I think Carpenter is very talented and particularly appreciate her track record on taking down awful men. Please, Sabrina, you’ve helped take down one mayor. Why not train your creative energy on trying to stop Andrew Cuomo, the disgraced former governor of New York, who has spentmillions of dollars in taxpayer moneyon an aggressive legal battle against the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, from becoming mayor of New York? Forget man’s best friend, pull that off and you’ll be a lot of women’s best friend.Trump says Greta Thunberg needs anger management lessonsThe activist, who was recentlydeported from Israelafter taking part in an attempt to bring a symbolic aid shipment to starving Gaza, responded by saying the worldneeds more angry women.

Arguably Osborne. We haven’t had one since then. They’re the long-lasting ones.”The fact thatRachel Reevesis not on that list will elicit no surprise in No 11, where Johnson is seen as a nitpicking critic, naive about the constraints of politics.Supremely confident and resolutely wonkish, throughout his 14 years at the top of the IFS thinktank the 58-year-old economist has exuded a baffled frustration at the standard of political debate about fiscal policy.View image in fullscreenThough critical of George Osborne’s spending cuts, Paul Johnson praises the former Tory chancellor’s single-mindedness.Photograph: Matt Cardy/AFP/Getty ImagesHe is critical of George Osborne’s deep spending cuts, which had “really negative long-term effects” on some public services. But he praises the former Tory chancellor’s single-mindedness.“You knew where he was coming from, because he had a pretty clear idea on the fiscal side, at least: we’re doing austerity, we’re bringing the size of the state back down to where it was pre-financial crisis and we’re largely doing that through spending cuts.”By contrast, he expresses exasperation with Labour’spartial U-turn on the winter fuel allowance– though he admits the pressure to do so was external.“I don’t think people have any sense of scale,” Johnson says. “This was partly the fault of the government, of course, but this was a small thing, a billion pounds or so, which is now going to make virtually no savings at all.”Reeves took the public by surprise when she announced thewinter fuel cut, blaming what she claimed was a £22bn hole in the public finances.View image in fullscreen‘It’s going to be very weird in the autumn,’ says Johnson of not being the IFS boss when Rachel Reeves delivers her second budget.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAJohnson, once a Treasury civil servant himself, concedes there is some information the chancellor could not have known about before Labour came to power. For example, the Home Office failed to account properly for spending on asylum seekers – but, he argues, both major parties were well aware there was a reckoning coming.“We said that all the way through the last election. And the parties just said, ‘no, no, no, no’. Until after the election. When they suddenly made up – or partly made up – ‘oh, look, we’ve discovered a black hole. We never knew anything about this.’ So it’s really frustrating.”Johnson reserves his strongest condemnation for Reform UK and the Green party, whose approach to fiscal policy during the last election he decries as “outrageous”.“I do put Reform and the Greens in exactly the same bucket here. Not just to be politically balanced, but because they are very, very similar, in the sense that Reform had, I can’t remember, £100bn, £150bn of tax cuts and no spending cuts. They just said: ‘We’ll just get some efficiencies.’ And then the Greens had massive unfunded spending increases.”And Johnson sees this unwillingness to face reality as increasingly worrying, given the pressures on spending are only likely to increase.“If you look over the next five to 10 years, what have we got coming down the line? We’ve got at least £20bn on defence spending, probably. Continued increases in health spending. Huge pressures on social care. Pension spending. You’re going to lose £30bn of revenue from taxing petrol. You put all of that together and you’ve got a really big challenge.”Labour has promised not to increase the main revenue raisers, including income tax, VAT and national insurance. But Johnson is sceptical that much more can be raised from the wealthy and insists moderate earners will eventually have to pay more, unless spending is slashed.“There’s a choice here. You can stop all sorts of handouts to pensioners, and you could ration some of the things that you get on the NHS. You could have less focus on some aspects of the education system. But if you want all of those things, then you’ll probably going to have to pay more tax,” he says.View image in fullscreenJohnson decries the fiscal policy of Reform UK and the Green party at the last election as ‘outrageous’.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPASurrounded by boxes in his utilitarian office in Bloomsbury, Johnson is preparing for a fresh start.

I’ll probably be sat in a committee meeting, and I will definitely miss it. It’s going to be quite hard. I will miss the drama, the sense of being slightly on the inside, sort of explaining things to the public.”Successive chancellors – Johnson has marked the homework of eight – have waited with trepidation for the IFS’s assessment of their plans.Jeremy Hunt, who held the post from October 2022 to July last year, said: “Paul was often the swing vote as to whether a budget unravelled. You never really relax until after the IFS verdict.”Some leftwing economists accuse him of being too sympathetic to austerity. “I find it extraordinary how little accountability has been applied to the IFS, and Johnson in particular,” says James Meadway, who advised the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and hosts the Macrodose podcast.Whether his influence has been for good or ill, the era of economic policy Johnson has witnessed close up has certainly not been auspicious.He arrived in post in 2011, when the scars of the global financial crisis were still visible. Fresh shocks followed from the Brexit referendum, the Covid crisis and the surge in energy costs after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – coinciding with Kwazi Kwarteng’s brief tenure in No 11.He says the two referendums on his watch – Brexit, and before that, Scottish independence in 2014 – were the hardest period for the IFS, because the institution took a clear view on the fiscal implications of the decisions, causing it to be accused of partisanship.“We are narrowly economic. And so, in both cases, the economic and fiscal issues, I think were perfectly straightforward. But I think it’s perfectly reasonable to have to balance them against other things,” he says.“I think there is a perfectly good case for Brexit from a point of view of sovereignty and controlling your borders and so on, but we know that over the short and medium run, it’s going to have a negative economic effect. Of course it is.”As far as today’s government is concerned, he detects an unwillingness to confront the public with unavoidable tradeoffs.Asked whether he is optimistic about the future for fiscal policy, as he heads off for a quieter life, Johnson says: “I have moments of optimism. I had a moment of optimism at the Labour party conference last year when Keir Starmer basically stood up and said: ‘There are tradeoffs here and, you know, we want growth and if that means a road through your back garden, tough.’ And I thought here’s a prime minister who’s actually talking about tradeoffs. It’s been less obvious since then.”Returning to the winter fuel debacle, the eternally bemused Johnson says: “They [ministers] feel pushed by us, the electorate. Now, is that their fault for not selling it properly? Did they announce it at the wrong time? Is it the electorate’s fault for not being serious? Is it just a reflection of our fractured country? I don’t know, but it’s quite hard to be optimistic, because you do think, ‘if you can’t do that, what the hell can you do?’”Explore more on these topicsInstitute for Fiscal StudiesEconomic policyRachel ReevesTax and spendingEconomicsThinktanksinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The festivities are scheduled for 24-26 June, although some say the wedding itself will not be held until 28 June.Despite the scant information, for months the Italian press has been filled with hearsay about everything from the 200 guests – notably Kim Kardashian, Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey and Ivanka Trump – and their €9,000-a-night hotel rooms, to the contingent booking out the entire water taxi fleet and the many designer dresses the bride will wear during the celebrations.View image in fullscreenA ‘No Bezos’ banner on the bell tower of San Giorgio basilica.Photograph: Marta SottorivaWhile the city’s leaders are fully embracing the merriment and, moreover, the riches they claim the festivities – rumoured to be costing £8.4m – will bring to the city, their political rivals argue that the event will not benefit ordinary Venetians in the slightest.“This wedding is causing much friction, especially because it is happening at a time when Venice, already invaded by uncontrolled tourism, is completely worn out,” said Giovanni Andrea Martini, a councillor for the opposition.To make up for it, Martini would like Bezos, the world’s third-richest person, to help address the affordable housing shortage by donating money towards restoring the more than 1,000 council homes that lie abandoned.Brugnaro has insisted the wedding will not bring any inconvenience to the city and has condemned the anti-Bezos campaigners as “shameful”.Sottoriva says the issue is not necessarily the people getting married per se, although she admits that Bezos’s associationwith Donald Trumpand Amazon’s record onworkers’ rightsdoes not bode well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Further protests over Ice raids are expected on Saturday.The modification in guidance comes after Trump said on Thursday that changes to protect certain industries were in the works.“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,”Trump wrote on Truth Social.“We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!” he added in the post.Trump campaigned on a platform of mass deportations of undocumented migrants with criminal records or histories, but that expanded in recent weeks as Ice came under White House pressure to increase its daily quota of arrests to 3,000 and the policy appeared to shift to arresting undocumented immigrants with no criminal records.That potentially affected tens of thousands of workers embedded in the agriculture, construction and hospitality sectors and raised the politically indigestible specter of family separations.The elevated arrest targets were publicly promoted by Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, who reportedly told Ice officials in late May they needed to “just go out there and arrest illegal aliens”.In the new Ice guidance,later confirmed by the Wall Street Journal,King appeared to acknowledge that the Miller’s quota targets would be affected. “We acknowledge that by taking this off the table, that we are eliminating a significant # of potential targets,” he wrote.Trump was reportedly warned by his agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, that farmers – a key Republican-supporting constituency – were concerned that Ice enforcement would affect their businesses.The Wall Street Journal reported last weekthat businesses were being hurt because sweeps of non-criminal foreign workers were driving changes in shopping behavior. The outlet cited a 3% drop in Coca-Cola’s sales volume over the first three months of the year, in part because of a pullback by Hispanic shoppers.Colgate-Palmolive, Modelo brewer Constellation Brands, and restaurant chains including Wingstop and El Pollo Loco have also said that decreased spending by Hispanic consumers had hurt sales.“We have seen a huge decline in traffic,” Régis Schultz, CEO of JD Sports, the parent company of the Hispanic-targeting Shoe Palace retail chain, told analysts in May. “You can see definitively the impact” of the immigration policy, he added.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationHospitality industryAgricultureFarmingDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Nor is it a buzzy A-list hotspot, where the chefs will vet your social media before you have even arrived.Instead, it is the Ritz: the 119-year-old British institution where denim is outlawed, etiquette is king and selfies are met with a disapproving frown.Hailed the best restaurant in the UK this week by the National Restaurant awards, the hallowed dining hall of one of London’s grandest hotels harks back to a time of heavy tablecloths and silver service, straight-backed chairs and seven courses.A meal at the Mayfair hotel, whose gilded restaurant is as renowned for its stringent dress code (men are expected to wear a jacket and tie) as its £62 crêpe suzette, was described by the competition’s judges as a “wonderful and memorable assault on the senses”.View image in fullscreenThe Ritz restaurant was awarded its second Michelin star in FebruaryBut what do its patrons, who come from far and wide to sample the beef wellington and hay-aged Bresse duck servedarts de la table, really think?“It’s second to none – there’s nothing else like it,” says Yvonne Robertson, a 55-year-old fitness instructor from Glasgow who came last year and is now back for a photograph under the hotel’s arches.“It’s first class – a whole-day experience. We got all dolled up and were in there for hours.”It is no wonder that for many it is a once-in-a-lifetime trip: the restaurant’s three-course lunch menu rings in at £92, while the five-course à la carte dining experience will set you back £199 (throw in another £700 if you want the prestige wine pairing).“It’s not cheap,” admitted the competition judges, “but when eating at this level of luxury you wouldn’t expect it to be.”Robertson’s companion, Audrey O’Neill, an administrator, is inclined to agree. “It’s exceptional,” she says. Just try not to drop anything on the floor. “My champagne glass fell off the table – I was mortified,” she says, laughing. The waiters came to her assistance faster than you could say: “White gloves.”In the hotel lobby, which smells like fresh peonies, French perfume and, well, money, even the hotel’s youngest patron is enamoured of the chandeliers and soft piano music. “It’s her first trip to the Ritz,” says 38-year-old Marie-Claire Lowry, motioning to her baby daughter, Marlie, who is propped happily on an ornate green sofa with a crumbled scone.“Everything is pristine,” says Lowry, who is treating her mother, Janice Lowry, to a “posh cup of tea” for her 74th birthday. They will not quite make it all the way into what the judges called “London’s most decadent dining room” this time, but will definitely be back.“We dropped something of the baby’s on the floor and we’re not even worried because it’s probably so clean,” she says. “Even my hands smell amazing from the soap in the bathrooms.”Headed by the executive chef, John Williams, the historic dining room – visited by prime ministers and princesses, and painted in a pink colour palette designed to complement a lady’s blush – was quietly awarded its second Michelin star in February. Now, it has beaten Notting Hill’s celebrity favouritethe Ledburyto be crowned best in show.Not everyone, though, is quite so charmed by its grandeur.“I had a very nice beef wellington,” says Clayton Such, a 44-year-old chief executive from San Francisco. “But I’m not sure it’s thebestrestaurant in the UK. I think the whole vibe of the Ritz … is people who want to pretend to be wealthy versus just being wealthy.”It did not help that he was politely but firmly told to put on a jacket and tie for dinner when he wandered down from his hotel room in a short-sleeved shirt. “It definitely seems like a place where people want to put on airs,” he says.Explore more on these topicsLondonRestaurantsHotelsAwards and prizesFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some of the 62 said they had hadsuicidal thoughts because of the pressure exerted by the telecoms group– while many claimed the company’s actions made them fear they would lose their livelihoods, homes or life savings after running up personal debts of more than £100,000.Vodafone, which says the legal claim is worth £85.5m, has consistently argued the case is “a complex commercial dispute between Vodafone UK and some franchise partners and we refute the claims”.Responding to news that the 12 current franchisees are having their contracts terminated, a Vodafone spokesperson said: “We are focused on building a successful and thriving franchise programme. As a result, we have a clear duty to do everything we can to support those franchise partners who are committed to our joint success.“The dispute has been ongoing for over two years and a number of the claimants have remained within the franchise programme and had their contracts renewed during that time. However, we are increasingly concerned about the impact negative campaigning is having on our franchise programme.”The spokesman added: “After careful consideration, and with disappointment, we therefore decided it was no longer viable for us to work with franchise partners who are supporting the negative campaign against the business.”A franchise is a type of licence that allows a company to sell a product or service under another business’s brand name, in return for paying certain costs such as rent and wages. As part of their deals, Vodafone franchisees were paid commissions based on the handset and airtime revenues they generated from customers visiting their stores.The court papers allege that the FTSE 100 company acted in “bad faith” by unilaterally cutting fees to its franchisees; imposing swingeing fines on them totalling thousands of pounds for seemingly minor administrative errors; and then pressuring them into taking out loans and government grants to keep their businesses afloat.Vodafone said it strongly refutes that the company “unjustly enriched” itself and said it had conducted a number of investigations into the allegations, which resulted in the company making “a number of improvements to our franchise partner programme”.The group’s investigations “concluded that some actions between Vodafone and franchise partners had not always adhered to the standards we expect, however no evidence of misconduct was found”. The mobile operator has added that it had paid back almost £5m to franchisees including the “retrospective reimbursement of fines and clawbacks”.It has since emerged that, two years before the high court claim was launched,whistleblowers had warned a series of senior Vodafone executivesthat scores of its franchised store owners faced financial ruin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In thenaturalist’s acclaimed new film, Ocean, which highlights the destructive fishing practice of bottom trawling, he says he has come to the realisation that the “most important place on Earth is not on land but at sea”.View image in fullscreen‘The most important place on Earth is not on land but at sea,’ says Sir David Attenborough in his acclaimed new film, Ocean.Photograph: Keith Scholey/PAThis message, backed by undeniable indicators of poor ocean health, has boosted calls for more ocean governance and protection. The mood at this week’s UN ocean summit in Nice, which ended on Friday, was that if ever there was a defining “moment” for the ocean, it was happening here, in France’s Côte d’Azur.But there was also a sense of this sentiment being shared in the wider world, where, partly thanks to the summit, many are finally waking up the reality of the serious decline of something thatmakes up more than 70% of the Earth’s surface.By the end of the first day, on the roof of the conference centre overlooking the Mediterranean,Emmanuel Macron, the French president and co-host, declared the summit a success. “Never before have so many heads of state and governments met to discuss the seas,” he said, citing the figure of 60 world leaders, three times as many as attended the second UN ocean conference in Lisbon in 2022. About 190 ministers were also in Nice. The US did not attend.But what, with the eyes of the watching world, was actually achieved for the future health of oceans?View image in fullscreenA school of barracudas in the Galapagos. In 2024, Greenpeace called for the creation of a high seas marine protected zone to secure a much wider area around Ecuador’s famous archipelago.Photograph: Ernesto Benavides/AFP/Getty ImagesThe most important accomplishment was that enough countries either ratified orformally committedto ratifyingthe high seas treaty. Once ratified, this agreement will help achieve an agreed global target of protecting 30% of the world’s seas by 2030. It will provide the first legal mechanism for the creation of protected areas in the high seas, international waters that cover almost two-thirds of the ocean.The treaty is expected to now come into force by 1 January 2026, said Macron. This alone is an achievement: the early stages of the high seas treaty took 20 years of negotiations before agreement was reached in 2023. Now it could be months away from becoming a reality.António Guterres, the UN secretary general, called the pace of progress “a record”. “I see a momentum and an enthusiasm that was difficult to find in the past,” he said.The Pacific island states have banned bottom trawling … the EU is full of countries that are still doing thisRalph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s environment ministerThe summit does not carry the weight ofa climate Cop, the annual UN climate change conference where governments and other stakeholders gather to discuss and negotiate on climate action,nor is it legally binding. But it has come at a critical moment for threats facing the seas.In April, Donald Trump made a move tofast-track deep-sea mining under US law,sidestepping international efforts to regulate the industry. The conference saw four new countries – now 37 – joining France in calling for a moratorium, pause or ban ondeep-sea mining, amid warnings of “irreversible” damage to ecosystems should it go ahead.Trump’s actions, which were criticised by China, which also wants to mine, have had the effect of “strengthening people’s commitment to multilateralism” and building alliances at a key moment, says John Hocevar, oceans campaign director at Greenpeace USA. “In July, the International Seabed Authority meets to discuss, hopefully, a moratorium on deep-sea mining.”More than 90 ministers issued a symbolic statement in Nice reaffirming their support for thestrongest possible plastics treaty, to be negotiated when talks resume in August.View image in fullscreenA plastics treaty is to be negotiated when talks begin again in August.Photograph: Wonderful Nature/ShutterstockRémy Rioux, a former French negotiator on climate finance at the 2015 Paris agreement, and director general of ADF, France’s development bank, says that Macron has adopted similar diplomacy at the ocean summit that made Cop21 a success.“There was significant numbers of heads of state in the room, which represents something,” Rioux says. “I’m proud that France has provided a voice to those who are not heard.”But, in terms of finance, we “are still way behind what the UN say is needed”.‘Ticking timebomb’: sea acidity has reached critical levels, threatening entire ecosystems – studyRead morePacific nations, who contribute least and stand to suffer most from the effects of the climate crisis, sea level rise and ocean pollution, welcomed the chance to talk to Macron. But they were quick to remind larger, more polluting nations that they needed to do more.Moetai Brotherson, the president of French Polynesia, announced the creation of thelargest protected marine area in the world. It will cover 5m sq kilometres, the nation’s entire exclusive economic zone and will restrict destructive activities such as bottom trawling and deep-sea mining. A fifth will be designated a highly or fully protected area, where only traditional Tahitian boats, ecotourism and scientific exploration are allowed.“By doing what we are doing, it will putpressure on other countries, including France, to do more,” he says. “Turning this area into a marine protected area is one thing. Ensuring that laws are not broken is another. The responsibility of big nations is not to come and lecture us, but to help us.”View image in fullscreenAn Ocean Rebellion activist dressed as Emmanuel Macron.

The EU is full ofcountries that are still doing this.”At the start of the conference,the French president found himself under firefor failing to ban bottom trawling in protected marine areas. France announced that instead it would “limit” the practice and seek to protect 4% of its metropolitan waters.One of the strongest critics of France’s role in the summit, was the granddaughter of Jacques Cousteau. France “over-compromised and under-delivered”, she says.View image in fullscreenThe environmental activist Alexandra Cousteau said France had ‘over-compromised and under-delivered’ at the talks .Photograph: Ntb Scanpix/Reuters“This was the moment for France to lead – and they missed it,” says Alexandra Cousteau, also an adviser to international oceans organisation, Oceana. “President Macron promised action on bottom trawling in marine protected areas but delivered only artificial limits and empty words. That’s not leadership – that’s evasion.”Despite its achievements, the summit highlighted how much is yet to be done. A study by National Geographic Pristine Seas and Dynamic Planet found, for example, that in order to meet the global target of 30x30,85 new marine protected areaswould need to be created daily. So far,less than 3%of the ocean is given this extra protection.Yet, overall the mood was high, boosted by a surge of enthusiasm for protecting the world’s seas.“I hate to say it out loud, but it has been better than I expected,” says Hocevar. “The ocean is having a moment and this was the best opportunity to demonstrate momentum.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentSeascape: the state of our oceansUnited NationsEmmanuel MacronDeep-sea miningDavid AttenboroughOceansFishing industryanalysisShareReuse this content"

They were sadly both confirmed deceased at the scene and their families have been informed.“Scene guards remain in place and inquiries are ongoing by the relevant agencies.”Anyone with information has been asked to contact police.A spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it was aware of the incident and its “thoughts are of course with the friends and family at this difficult time”.The CAA added: “We will work closely with the relevant authorities to understand what happened and are awaiting the report into the incident.”The national governing body, British Skydiving, said it would investigate and send a report to the coroner, police, the CAA, British Skydiving Safety and Training Committee and any other relevant authorities, the BBC reported.A statement from British Skydiving said: “British Skydiving has been notified of a tragic accident in which two jumpers lost their lives.“Our deepest condolences go to their families, friends and the entire skydiving community.”Dunkeswell aerodrome is a former RAF site located in the Blackdown Hills area, close to Devon’s border with Somerset.The aerodrome’s website said it was built and set up as an US naval base during the second world war and, at 839ft above sea level, is the highest licensed airfield in the UK.Skydiving deaths in the UK are statistically rare with tandem jumps being particularly safe.The British Parachute Association has previously said in the UK in the last 20-year block studied, from 2001-20, there were reportedly no tandem skydive fatalities.Explore more on these topicsDevonnewsShareReuse this content"

Netflix added the most customers in a quarter in its history in the final three months of 2024, with 55% choosing its ad-supported package. About a third of its 300 million-strong global subscriber base are now watching with ads.Disney+ followed suit in late 2022 and has since amassed 157 million ad-tier subscribers, including its US-only ESPN and Hulu services. And in February last year, Amazon startedautomatically introducing adsto the 200 million potential monthly viewers of Prime Video, requiring customers to pay if they wanted an ad-free experience.However, research into streaming households shows that homes that watch with ads are “lighter” viewers, in the words of one media agency executive, compared with those who pay for higher-priced, ad-free packages.A snapshot of UK streaming in the fourth quarter of 2024 showed thatNetflixhouseholds with advertising-supported subscriptions watched an average of 22 minutes less content a day than those with an ad-free subscription, a difference of almost 22%.Netflix is estimated to have about 17.6 million subscribers in total in the UK, of whom just over 4 million are on an ad-supported package, according to Ampere Analysis.At Amazon’s Prime Video, which is estimated to have about 12 million UK users, the same trend has emerged. Viewers who accepted ads watched an average of 23 minutes less content a day than those who had opted to pay for an ad-free experience – a difference of 44%.While viewing minutes were not available for Disney+ UK subscribers, the research showed it had the narrowest gap, with those on ad-supported accounts watching just five fewer minutes of content a day on average than those paying for an ad-free subscription.Matt Ross, the chief analytics officer at the streaming research firm Digital i, says two distinct types of viewer have emerged, but adds that lower levels of viewing in ad-supported households is partly because those subscriptions also typically offer access on fewer devices.“We’ve seen that more engaged viewers typically opt for ad-free tiers, valuing the uninterrupted experience they provide,” Ross says. “More premium plans offer multiple simultaneous streams, which appeals especially to larger households and families. This combination of premium features and flexibility often results in higher daily activity for ad-free plans.”Nevertheless, the phenomenon of “light viewers” will be grasped by UK broadcasters trying to stop the deep-pocketed US giants conquering the streaming advertising market in the same way as they have the world of paid subscriptions.“The appeal of the global streamers’ ad tiers to advertisers doesn’t stack up against the streaming services offered by British broadcasters,” says one senior TV industry executive.Certainly in the UK, at least, the drive into advertising by the big US streamers has had a mixed reception from the media agencies that buy commercial space for brands.Netflix started with a gung-ho attitude, buoyed up by the success it had had building a huge paid subscriber base and the belief advertisers would leap at the chance to be able to place commercials in its mega-hits for the first time.However, it demanded almost 50% more than ITV or Channel 4’s services charge for advertising, alongside a hefty commitment to a minimum spend, despite initially only having a small audience and extremely limited ability to target ads.“The rollout was a disaster,” says the chief executive of one media agency. “Take-up was underwhelming, to say the least. They had to try again six months later and lost their lead over rivals and are now behind the curve in terms of pricing, data and reach versus, say, Amazon.”Amazon charges about the same as the public service broadcasters’ streaming services, while Disney+ charges more, despite having the smallest base of the big three US streamers, a situation the media executive describes as a “mad outlier, given their volume”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His archive of copied documents was exfiltrated separately. But London got hold of his trove only after Mitrokhin gave up trying to get the US to take him seriously.“TheCIAturned Mitrokhin away multiple times, sometimes due to decisions of those on the ground and sometimes due to instructions from headquarters,” said Gordon Corera, a former BBC correspondent who has written a new book about the defector. “This would be the source of bitter recriminations later when his value became clear.”Mitrokhin’s findings formed the basis for hundreds of counterintelligence investigations across the world during the 1990s. His defection was made public in 1999, when a book about his findings was published jointly with the historian Christopher Andrew. Mitrokhin lived under a new identity in Britain,and died in 2004.The 1999 book mentioned in passing that Mitrokhin had first offered his services to the US, but it transpires that there was more than one attempt, and Mitrokhin was furious the Americans had turned him down, making it clear to them later that Britain had been his second choice.Mitrokhin, an introvert who was sent to work in the KGB archives after a failed career as a spy, was motivated by a sense of disgust at the KGB and its role in the Soviet system and made it a condition of his defection that the documents he had copied should be made public. Many of his original files wereopened to the public at an archive in Cambridge in 2014, although some of them have now been closed again due to privacy concerns.His notes contained the names of hundreds of agents in the west who had collaborated with the KGB. In Britain, the name that got the most attention wasMelita Norwood, who was 87 when the Mitrokhin revelations were published. She admitted passing information about the British nuclear programme to the KGB. There was also detailed historical information aboutthe “illegals”, Moscow’s most secret spies who lived under deep cover disguised as westerners.Mitrokhin retired from the KGB in 1984, but it was only after the Soviet collapse, in 1992, that he decided to offer up his secret archive to western intelligence services. He travelled, disguised as a dishevelled villager so as not to attract attention from border guards, with a sample of his documents hidden below lengths of sausage in a scruffy bag. The disguise was so good that when he arrived as a “walk-in” at the newly opened US embassies in Riga and Vilnius, he was not taken seriously. On one occasion, a cable about him was sent back to CIA headquarters, but was not acted on.Instead, he tried the British embassy, and a young diplomat in Vilnius offered him a cup of tea and suggested he return later, when MI6 officers could be sent out to assess his credibility. When that happened, MI6 realised that the strange walk-in was sitting on a potential goldmine. In a strange twist, the Treasury refused to pay the substantial costs for his exfiltration and resettlement, and so MI6 asked the Americans, who ended up footing the bill for the defector they had originally turned down, in exchange for full access to his material.During a meeting in London with an FBI and CIA team, introduced to Mitrokhin by their British counterparts, the defector erupted in anger. “It is your fault that because you turned me down I am here with the British … I always wanted to be in the US,” he said.Corera said he did not ask for or receive any help from MI6 in his research for the book, though it is understood that he was able to speak to former operatives who were involved in the Mitrokhin case. For the first time, he reveals the details of how Mitrokhin was exfiltrated from the Soviet Union with his family by MI6 operatives using a tourist minibus as a disguise.Corera said he was drawn to the story of Mitrokhin because he had the feeling that in 1999 the importance of Mitrokhin’s disclosures was somewhat lost, given the sense that the cold war was over and the west had little to fear from Moscow’s spying.“I think he is one of the most under appreciated spies and defectors in cold war and post cold war history. It’s only now in hindsight more than 25 years after news of his defection becomes public you can see how important he was,” he said.The Spy in the Archive: How one man tried to kill the KGBby Gordon Corera, is published by William CollinsExplore more on these topicsEspionageCold warRussiaMI6CIAnewsShareReuse this content"

Conspiracy theorists also claim the vaccine causes people todie suddenly, or that the shots implant microchips or impart 5G connectivity.Meghan McCain recently endorsed, in a now-deleted social mediapost, an unregulated supplement company’s “spike detox” for those who “regret” getting vaccinated.Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, called the mRNA Covid shots the “deadliest vaccine ever made,” incorrectlyclaimingthe vaccines cause more illnesses and deaths than they prevent.Kennedy rose to greater prominence through the pandemic as previously fringe conspiracies about vaccines began dominating more mainstream narratives.“Anti-vaccine sentiment goes back to the first days of vaccines in the 1700 and 1800s,” said John Moore, professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College.“It’s been a perpetual theme in society for 200-plus years, but it has been turbocharged by the Covid pandemic.”Some states are now consideringlawsagainst mRNA vaccines, and US health officials have taken several steps to limit Covid shots in recent weeks.Officials with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announcedplansto limit boosters to older people and those with certain health conditions, as well asplans to conductplacebo-controlled clinical trials again.The CDC removed the vaccination recommendation for pregnant people and softened the recommendation for children’s shots.About 165,000 Americans were hospitalized and 40,000 died in the previous year because of Covid, the CDC said at an April meeting.About 6,700 of those hospitalizations were among children, especially young children, and 152 children died from Covid in that time, the data showed.About 5% of children under five are vaccinated against Covid –ratesmuch lower than other age groups.“That’s why, if you look at the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths for children now, especially young children less than four years old, it’s really not much different than the beginning of this pandemic,” Offit said.There’s also “extensive evidence” for benefits to pregnant people and their babies, he said.While the FDA recently approved Moderna’s “next generation” Covid vaccine, which was even more effective that their current shot in clinical trials, the agency limited the new shot only for older adults and for people aged 12 to 64 with health conditions putting them at higher risk.The FDA also announced newrequirementsfor mRNA Covid vaccine makers to add additional warnings about the risks of myocarditis, or heart inflammation, based on data the FDA has not made public.During the Biden administration, Moderna received two awards totaling $766m to develop potential bird flu vaccines.Despite the changeover in administrations, Moderna’s work continued as normal – until February, when health officialssaidin an article that the funding was being reviewed. Moderna hadn’t received any notification of this review, which recently culminated in having the funding cancelled.Halting the H5N1 vaccine research, which was in phase 3 trials, leaves the US vulnerable in a potential flu pandemic, Nuzzo said. It also means other countries could build upon US investments to procure the vaccines for themselves.mRNA has shown promise in treating pancreatic cancer and other cancers, as well as rare conditions and hard-to-treat infectious diseases.Moderna, for instance, is working on vaccines for melanoma, lung cancer, norovirus, flu, and CMV, or cytomegalovirus, a fairly common infection that can cause lasting health problems for infants. The company also has an RSV vaccine, currently approved for older adults, that could be expanded for other age groups.But those efforts could be hampered by the administration’s moves against mRNA and terminations of vaccine scientists and independent advisors who offer vaccine recommendations.“We don’t want to see kids kicked out of school because a 12-year-old girl is not getting her fifth Covid booster shot,” Marty Makary, head of the FDA, said in a recentinterview. Yet no states require Covid vaccination for school attendance.Pushing back against mandates is a common tactic from anti-vaccine activists working to dismantle all vaccine mandates, Offit said.In addition to claiming the Covid vaccines are deadly, Kennedy has “also said no vaccine is beneficial”, he said.Kennedy recently unveiled asweepingandcontroversial$50m research project on autism, including anautism research database.If that effort somehow links autism to vaccines – despite decades of studies showing no connection – it could open lawmakers up tolawsuits, Offit said.“He could manipulate the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program,” Offit said. If Kennedy adds autism to the compensable list of injuries, “it would break the program”.That would mean the people who experience very rare severe side effects from vaccines may then face challenges getting compensated.And it could prompt vaccine makers to stop producing routine childhood immunizations because of legal liability. “It’s a fragile market,” Offit said.Kennedy “is an anti-vaccine activist, science denialist and conspiracy theorist”, he continued. “I think that he will continue this onslaught against vaccines.”Explore more on these topicsUS healthcareTrump administrationVaccines and immunisationUS politicsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

He said many now saw the platform as an opportunity to adapt to what he described as “the most significant media disruption since the printing press”.UK news companies including the Daily Mail, the Telegraph and Reach, which publishes the Daily Mirror, have all launched newsletters on Substack.McKenzie said the Post had approached Substack about hosting its writers. “We’ve talked to them, but there’s no formal agreement or partnership, and they wouldn’t need to talk to us to be able to go out and attempt to do those things,” McKenzie said. “They need to persuade the writers, creators, the journalists, publishers, not us.“If they’re helping to bring more exposure to those writers and drive audiences to them, if it’s designed in that way – and I’m not 100% sure what the ultimate outcome is going to be – that could be really good for everyone.”Substack has become increasingly influentialsince its launch in 2017. It allows anyone to publish and distribute digital content, primarily through newsletters, and charge a subscription. It has also been branching out into podcasts and video.The potential tie-up comes after Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of the Post,provoked its comment editor to walk outafter he announced its comment pages would be more narrowly focused on pieces that supported and defended “personal liberties” and “free markets”. The move was seen as an attempt by Bezos tosafeguard his relationship with President Trump.However, the Post – under its British chief executive and publisher, Will Lewis – is trying to find other ways of drawing in readers following reported losses of $100m (£74m) last year, including a project to host comment pieces from other sources on its website.Reach has launched dozens of Substacks this year alone, covering topics from book trends to Liverpool FC. The Telegraph has just started to post content on a royal family Substack, while the Daily Mail has a Substack dedicated to showbiz news.“All of a sudden really, a bunch of legacy news organisations are trying to see how they can take advantage of Substack,” McKenzie said. “That’s a really welcome change in mindset. At first people looked at us as if we were a curious instrument and then they started to look at us as maybe we were a threat, because some talent would prefer to go independent on Substack rather than be in a newsroom.“People are starting to understand that Substack is not just a publishing system that helps people make money, but it’s also a network and it represents new land to build on, where new media products can be born and built. Legacy institutions can build those just as well as newcomers. It’s a big opportunity era.”He said Substack was supposed to be a “disruptor of social media”, rather than the traditional media, allowing longer writing instead of viral content. He said he had “no regrets whatsoever” about having resisted overtures from Elon Musk to buy the site.McKenzie said Substack was trying to find new workable models for media amid the struggles of traditional outlets to hold on to rapidly fragmenting audiences. “It’s not a problem with demand for quality journalism,” he said. “It’s a problem with the business model and so there has to be a reinvention. We’re almost at the point where the fire has razed through the forest and there are a few trees still standing. It’s time to replant the forest. We’re living through the most significant media disruption since the printing press.”View image in fullscreenSubstack allows writers to monetise their content.Photograph: Timon Schneider/AlamyWhat is Substack?Substack allows anyone to create digital content, which then sits on a dedicated website and can be sent directly to the inboxes of subscribers. It has also branched out into audio and video features in an attempt to benefit from the podcast boom. Crucially, it allows writers to charge a subscription for some or all of their pieces.The ability to monetise content has allowed some established writers to break away from traditional titles and go it alone. According to an analysis by the Press Gazette, the number of Substack newsletters with at least $500,000 (£369,000) in annual subscriptions revenue alone has doubled in two years. Some of the writers on the site have become influential in US politics, including Bari Weiss and Matt Yglesias.In the UK, it has provided a platform for new local news sites where newspapers have disappeared from the map or had their reporting staff significantly cut back. New ventures include The Manchester Mill, launched by the journalist Joshi Herrmann, and London Centric, launched by the former Guardian journalist, Jim Waterson.Explore more on these topicsSubstackWashington PostNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesUS press and publishingnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite keyrulingsin his favor, Khalil has been detained since March,missing the birth of his son.His advocates were hopeful earlier in the week that he was close to walking free. On Wednesday, Judge Michael E Farbiarzruledthe Trump administration could no longer detain Khalil on the basis of claims that he posed a threat to US foreign policy. The federal judge in New Jersey said efforts to deport him based on those grounds were likely unconstitutional.Farbiarz had given the US government until Friday morning to appeal against the order, which the Trump administration did not do. Khalil’s lawyers thenarguedhe must be released immediately, but the government said it would keep him detained in aremote detention facility in Louisiana. The administration argued it was authorized to continue detaining him based on alternative grounds – its allegations that he lied on his green-card application.On Friday, Farbiarz said Khalil’s lawyers had failed to present enough evidence that detention based on the green-card claims was unlawful, suggesting attorneys for the 30-year-old activist could seek bail from a Louisiana immigration judge.Khalil’s have strongly rejected the government’s assertions about problems with his green-card application, arguing the claims were a pretext to keep him detained.“Mahmoud Khalil was detained in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinian rights,” Amy Greer, one of his attorneys, said in a statement on Friday evening.“The government is now using cruel, transparent delay tactics to keep him away from his wife and newborn son ahead of their first Father’s Day as a family. Instead of celebrating together, he is languishing in [immigration] detention as punishment for his advocacy on behalf of his fellow Palestinians. It is unjust, it is shocking, and it is disgraceful.”Khalil has previously disputed the notion that he omitted information on his application.In a filing last week, he maintained he was never employed by or served as an “officer” of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, as the administration claims, but completed an internship approved by the university as part of his graduate studies.Khalil said he also stopped working for the British embassy in Beirut in December 2022, when he moved to the US, despite the administration’s claims that he had worked in the embassy’s Syria office longer.The Friday ruling prolonging his detention came the same day agroup of celebrity fathersfilmed avideoreading Khalil’s letter to his newborn son. The Father’s Day campaign, published by the American Civil Liberties Union,called for Khalil’s freedomand included actorsMark Ruffalo,Mahershala Ali, Arian Moayed and Alex Winter.Earlier in the week, when there was a ruling in Khalil’s favor, Dr Noor Abdalla, his wife, released a statement, saying: “True justice would mean Mahmoud was never taken away from us in the first place, that no Palestinian father, from New York to Gaza, would have to endure the painful separation of prison walls like Mahmoud has. I will not rest until Mahmoud is free.”Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, has previously claimed Khalil must be expelled because his continued presence would harm American foreign policy, an effort that civil rights advocates said was a blatant crackdown on lawful free speech.Explore more on these topicsMahmoud KhalilUS immigrationUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

If part of this was due to a storming set taking in their new hit Common People, debuts for their future hits Mis-Shapes and Disco 2000, and the star power of singerJarvis Cocker, it was also down to their look.There was Steve Mackay, bass guitarist, in a fitted shirt and kipper tie, Russell Senior on violin in a blue safari shirt, keyboardist Candida Doyle in sequins and – of course – Cocker, in his now signature secondhand 70s tailoring.Fast forward to 2025 and Pulp have their first album in 24 years,More, and a tour taking in the UK, Europe and the US. It is a moment that will put their music and their style back in the public eye.While the bucket hats, parkas and round specs of Oasis, the otherBritpopband on tour this summer, are likely to dominate what young men are wearing, Pulp’s look is an alternative one that celebrates the secondhand.View image in fullscreen‘The influence of Pulp’s look in the 90s was partly about the sugar high of its eclectic, graphic take on nostalgia but also its accessibility.’ Pulp in 1998.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty ImagesAs Cocker writes in his book Good Pop, Bad Pop, his first jumble-sale buy, a garish 70s shirt, was “the real beginning of the Pulp aesthetic”. Its pomp can be seen in videos such as for1993’s Babies– with Cocker topless in a flared suit, Mackay in another garish print and Doyle in mod-ish stripes.The influence of Pulp’s look in the 90s was partly about the sugar high of its eclectic, graphic take on nostalgia but also its accessibility.“[Other bands] had a secondhand look, but Pulp made it a little bit more colourful, not quite kitsch, but on the edge of kitsch,” says Miranda Sawyer, the author of the Britpop history Uncommon People.Doyle says: “They obviously looked stylish but you did think, ‘OK I can get that stuff’. We were skint for a lot of the first 10 years being in Pulp. I used to find some amazing things [in charity shops].”Three decades later, and secondhand shopping once again dominates the way young people dress. Peter Bevan, 30, a stylist and contributing editor of the Rakish Gent, says: “Everyone I know who’s my age or younger shops in charity shops, in vintage shops, Depop, Vinted. I don’t know many people that buy loads of new things any more.” Asurvey in 2023found that 64% of gen Z will look for an item secondhand before buying it new.While part of this is likely down to cost and environmental concerns, the haphazard nature of secondhand shopping is championed as a way to express yourself through clothing. “Everyone who looks cool [now] is doing them rather than trying to do something else,” adds Bevan, who says this is why Pulp appeal. “Although obviously [Pulp] all made very considered choices that work together you can tell that they’re [each] dressing for them[selves] as well.”View image in fullscreen‘You can tell they’re each dressing for themselves’. Pulp in 1995.Photograph: Mick Hutson/RedfernsJames Millar, a 22-year-old guitarist in the band the Sukis, regularly shares videos of his Cocker-like looks to the band’s103.4k TikTok followers, and watched Pulp perform in Dublin this week. “[Cocker] is heavily influenced by 70s fashion … but he’s not doing 70s cosplay. When I see pictures of him, and what he wears, it just looks like him,” he says.While Doyle bristles at being classed as a Britpop band – “we don’t associate with [it] because of the union jack,” she says – they will inevitably becompared with Oasis, with both bands touring this summer. Style-wise, Bevan says Pulp come out on top. “I like the Oasis look but [they were originally about a] counter-culture fashion moment. Now it feels like they’re meant to look like they’re not trying hard in a fashion way but in reality they are trying really hard to look cool. Pulp all have their own personal sense of style that goes way beyond throwing on a Stone Island windbreaker and a pair of jeans.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s good with tassels, because when you move, it comes with you.”She says clothes were even part of what helped form Pulp in the first place. “We all grew up in Sheffield, and if you dressed a bit strangely, you stood out. So we’d all congregate at the same venues,” she says, adding insight that sounds like a lost lyric from revenge of the nerds anthem, Mis-Shapes: “There’d be townies and weirdos, squares and students.”Perhaps the enduring appeal of Pulp’s style is once again about the triumph of Mis-Shapes, with its lyrics of “misshapes, mistakes, misfits”, and how expressing your personality through the lucky dip of secondhand clothing is a win. “Jarvis understands his appeal,” says Sawyer. “He’s accentuating all the things that people have picked on him for. He’s saying, ‘I’m a tall weed or whatever you wanted to call me. This is who I am and, actually, I look great’.”Explore more on these topicsPulpBritpopJarvis CockerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It begins, of course, with Margaret ThatcherLucy ManganSat 14 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTShareHello and welcome to the latest addition to Adam Curtis’s growing compendium of documentaries I have unofficially entitled How Did Things Get So Shit? Let Me Explain in a Weirdly Uplifting Manner. Previous volumes include The Century of the Self, The Power of Nightmares, The Trap: What Happened to Our Dream of Freedom, All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace, HyperNormalisation, Can’t Get You Out of My Head and Russia 1985-1999: TraumaZone.Even if you have not had the challenging pleasure of watching, the titles alone should be enough to evoke most of the concerns found therein – the rise of individualism, the fragmentation of old systems, the political vacuums new people and powers have rushed to fill, the death rattle of formerly dependable entities on which western civilisation has traditionally rested and once allowed us to sleep peacefully at night, the creeping destabilisation of all things, and so very much on.The new entrant is a five-part series called Shifty. It is a rare purely UK-focused dissection of recent history, built around the idea that the growing atomisation of society has ushered in an age in which the concept of a shared reality on which we can all depend has dissolved – and with it any hope of a functioning democracy. Come on in, guys, the water’s lovely! Though we can’t even agree that it’s wet any more.In Curtis’s trademark telling – a vast, kaleidoscopic assemblage of archive clips from news reports, TV shows, vox pops, pop videos, home videos, celebrity and political profiles and whatever else he has found that serves his purpose, cleverly curated, wittily juxtapositioned and bouncily soundtracked – the decline began, as so many seem to have done, with Margaret Thatcher. The series begins with her opening her study door to a group of children escorted in by her favourite man-of-the-people Jimmy Savile because – well, how could it not? Once that clip had been found, it was going in.From there, we follow Britain through the 1980s – the Falklands, the Troubles, the miners’ strike, Kelvin MacKenzie, Wham!’s first tour, the advent of CCTV, the transformation of houses from homes into assets, art and fashion into diffusion lines, all of them uncoupling the old ways from the new powers, truth from reality or Britain from its moorings in some way. On we go through the next decade as old imperial ways, people and myths struggle to survive under the onslaught of new media, new tech, new economic experiments and a new privileging of individual independence, self-interest and the profit motive that was absolutely never going to end badly for anyone.New Labour arrives in the fifth and final episode, however, and the idea of society arranged around working for the common good is restored. I’m kidding! “They couldn’t escape the world they had inherited and its pessimism about human motives.” Not simply regarding the electorate – the venality and sleaze that had enshrouded the Tory party over the preceding years (and may I say that there really should be a public health warning any time clips of David Mellor are to be shown, whether or not you lived throughthe Antonia de Sancha scandal) had also eroded all remaining trust in politicians and Blairites “just accepted the belief that politicians were always self-interested”. If you watch party conference clips closely, you can see the light in Gordon Brown’s eyes gradually going out. The last noble mien.We stop before Brexit and Donald Trump, but it is clear how Curtis believes the seeds have been sown for all our current sorrows. Is the viewer persuaded? It depends where you start from, of course – I can’t speak for anyone who wasn’t already halfway there before kick-off as I was – and it will depend perhaps even more on how you feel about this most Marmite of film-makers. Now that I have learned to let his films wash over me, to pay attention but not drill down as they go, then wait and see how they work on my consciousness afterwards, I manage much better and admire much more. But perhaps that is partly a function of context too. It is an increasing rarity to stand in the presence of anyone with an idea, a thesis, that they have thoroughly worked out to their own satisfaction and then present stylishly, exuberantly and still intelligently. The hell and the handcart feel that bit more bearable now.Shifty is on BBC iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAdam CurtisreviewsShareReuse this content"

For proof, see this schadenfreude-fuelled documentary aboutRob Ford, the bellicose former conservative mayor of Toronto. Ford’s rolling scandals in office include public drunkenness, smoking crack with gun-runners, and lying about everything. Talking heads in the documentary, sensitively titled Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem (Netflix, from Tuesday 17 June), remember him as “an everyman … without a shred of credibility … who turned city hall into a circus”. That seems unfair. Circuses aren’t that bad, and I refuse to believeevery mansmokes crack cocaine.Most documentaries wring every ounce of lurid detail from their subjects. This guy has more chaos than fits inside 49 minutes. We do get thrillingly grainy footage of him twirling his crack pipe, slurring first-degree murder threats with Mortal Kombat-levels of specificity, and making bizarre rants in Jamaican patois, against what or whom I’m not sure. First-hand sources are film-maker’s gold, and Ford is happy enough to spend his lowest points around people who video everything. These people never have good phones though, do they?There isn’t space to do more than mention Ford’s extensive legal and domestic troubles, nor critique his executive choices, which included voting against grant money for HIV programmes, removing bike lanes and declaring transit workers an emergency service so they couldn’t strike. In one council meeting, Ford reportedly stated: “Those oriental people work like dogs.” He later apologised for the remark, which he had intended as a compliment.Shamelessness and emotional dysregulation are fantastic traits for reality TV; at some point they became necessary for public office too. Trainwreck feels like a rear-view mirror on that turning point. Ford swings between joking around, puce-faced outrage and meek apology. He resembles a baby, which makes strange sense. If it’s unfair to attack appearance, let’s just say he was a voluptuous blond, and voters in the western world have a type. It is impossible to imagine a woman or an ethnic minority candidate getting away with one of the bad decisions Ford compulsively makes. Those folks can’t even wear tan.View image in fullscreenSpeechless … Ford outside City Hall in Toronto, 2013.Photograph: Mark Blinch/ReutersThe story – and our glee in watching it – is complicated by the fact that Ford is a casualty of addiction issues. The question of who, how and when we forgive is a live one. Does it make a difference if the wrongdoer demands we move on, as Ford does? His popularity remained high. He would have been re-elected but in 2014, was diagnosed with an aggressive abdominal tumour anddied in 2016. That same year Trump was elected president. There’s a sick familiarity to the way controversies bounce off the Canadian mayor. The way he demonises the media as liars when he knows another scandal is about to break. The way he is able to position himself as a victim, and voters eat it up.There is an attempt at balance. “I’m proud to show this side of the story, and … why I stood by him through thick and thin,” says his former head of security. The Rob-Ford-was-a-good-man argument here hinges upon a story we’re told about a time the mayor was buying himself a Subway sandwich. Upon learning there was another order waiting but no driver, Ford delivered the stranger’s sub himself. Doesn’t make him Nelson Mandela, does it? By his own reckoning he made $35 plus three bucks as tip. Why does he have that much time in the day?Trainwreck shows Ford going door to door, asking people if their fridge freezers are working correctly, and taking a water-jet to graffiti. That’s not governing; that’s being a handyman. We all need to be more serious about public office. While politics will always be about public perception, it shouldn’t be reduced to entertainment, and ideally should be distinguishable from true crime. Otherwise the only winner is social media clips and documentaries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was gripped by this grainy footage, of a mayor fighting the public, or ploughing into an elderly female councillor, while barrelling across the chamber floor in a state of agitation. He might have been on his way to the Speaker’s podium, to rip off his shirt and yell: “Are you not entertained?” I was.

Gone are the dreadlocks – Jesse, now 44, removes his cap to reveal a bald head when asked if the controversial hairstyle will ever return – but their youthful spirit remains. This month, they will hit the road to play their chart-topping debut album, Reflector, in full, marking its 25th anniversary.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningFor many Australians, Killing Heidi is the sound of growing up. “It’s like sunscreen, cut grass, those things that have a time recall … Are we one of those? Are we sunscreen?” Ella, 42, quips.The Hoopers were teenagers when they won Triple J’s Unearthed competition in 1996. Radio veteran Myf Warhurst met them a few years later when she was starting out at the station, and immediately noticed their “magic dust”.“I just remember how gorgeous and delightful they were, these little country kids who were clearly bursting with talent and charisma,” Warhurst says. “I don’t know if we knew they were going to go as big as they did at that point, but you could certainly tell they were going to make something happen.”I don’t know if anyone can be successful in quite the same way as we were … it was different [then]Ella HooperAnd they did. When Reflector was released in March 2000, it became the fastest-selling Australian album in history at the time. Its major singles, Weir and Mascara, were inescapable. As a preteen, I was struck by the sight of a girl not much older than me – Ella was 17 then – rocking colourful hair, piercings and a don’t-care attitude. Killing Heidi was a perfect crossover act: friendly enough for mainstream radio, with an edge that appealed to the alternative crowd.For the siblings, it was all a whirlwind. “I remember performing at the Big Day Out for the first time … When you see it in people’s faces in the crowd, the sea of people going, ‘this is the set we’ve been waiting for’ – I was deeply complimented by that,” Ella recalls. “There were other things that happened [that festival], like the Red Hot Chili Peppers mentioning us on stage … That really blew my mind. It still does, that we did that on our first album.”Killing Heidi perform Mascara at Big Day Out in 2001The nature of local success has changed since, as streaming and social media has homogenised music consumption worldwide. “I don’t know if anyone [in Australia] can be successful in quite the same way as we were – I don’t often see those white-hot moments where it’s just everywhere,” Ella says. “I can’t think of any that have gone through that since [the likes of] Silverchair and Jet … It was different.”Over the next few years, the Hoopers and their bandmates – drummer Adam Pedretti and bassist Warren Jenkin – released records and toured relentlessly. “We were always looking to the next thing,” Jesse says. Then, in 2006, they suddenly disappeared.View image in fullscreenKilling Heidi backstage with Richard Wilkins at Push On at Luna Park, Melbourne in 2000.Photograph: Martin Philbey/WireImageElla and Jesse both laugh when I ask what actually happened.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They formed a new acoustic duo, The Verses. Ella began her solo music career, appeared on TV shows like Spicks and Specks and hosted radio programs. Jesse started working in music education and mentoring. In 2013, Ella proclaimed that Killing Heidi would never get back together: “I don’t think I could sing such youthful and youth-based songs convincingly any more,”she saidat the time.So what’s changed? “Our stories were so teenage, so young and so connected to a version of me … When I said that in 2013 I was still probably trying to distance myself,” Ella says. “I needed to mature, to be able to go back and put my hand on 15-year-old Ella’s shoulder … I don’t think you can do that just a few years out from being that age. It takes a little longer to become an adult that can hold different phases of yourself.”View image in fullscreen‘The music tells the story of our teenage times’ … Ella and Jesse Hooper in 2025.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianKilling Heidi started performing again in 2016, when they were invited to headline the Queenscliff music festival, and have played festivals almost every summer since – with no plans to record new music. Pedretti is still behind the kit, and Clio Renner (keys) and Phoebe Neilson (bass and backing vocals) add “a lot more feminine power”, Jesse says.The band was billed to play Reflector in full at Good Things festival last year, but due to technical difficulties they never got through the whole set. The upcoming tour will be the first time the record has ever been performed in its entirety. “I had to put on the CD to remember,” Ella jokes.Playing this music together is particularly meaningful for the siblings these days – as Ella points out, they are each other’s only remaining immediate family. “[The music] tells the story of our teenage times, which connects us to who we were when our family was different,” she says. “It’s very special.”The 25 Years of Reflector touris in Adelaide 20 June, Perth 21 June, Brisbane 26 June, Sydney 27 June and Melbourne 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsAustralian musicPop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

What to read at a modern ceremony? Plus, leading poets pick their favouritesTell us: what poem would you choose to read at a wedding?Caroline BirdSat 14 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTShareImarried my wife in October 2022 and, in the lead-up, it was obviously my job to source the wedding poems. I have published seven poetry collections, I read poetry every day, I own more than a thousand poetry books. I should have read through my favourites till I found the perfect fit. But that’s not what I did.Instead, for some bizarre reason, I sat down at my laptop and furtively Googled the words “wedding poem”. Why do we all do this, poets included? Well, I think, even though we want to express something deeply personal, the word “wedding” makes us all panic and reach for stock texts. Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s How Do I Love Thee? or The Passionate Shepherd to His Love by Christopher Marlowe (“Come live with me and be my love”) or Ecclesiastes 4 (“Two are better than one”).View image in fullscreenCaroline Bird and her wife on their wedding day.Photograph: Kerri Bough/KB photographyUp until very recently, a wedding was no place for reinvention. Now, gay marriage is legal in Britain; heterosexual couples can have civil partnerships; you can get married in a yurt or a cave or on a rollercoaster. But the old traditions die hard, and despite these new freedoms, the word “wedding” still influences our imaginations in ways that can feel alienating or limiting. When it comes to the “wedding poem”, even a Star Trek-themed do will find us translating the same old Shakespeare sonnet into Klingon.My friend and fellow poet Rachel Long and I decided the time was right for a brand-new wedding anthology, “alternative poems for alternative weddings”, shaking up the genre. When a publisher picked up our idea we felt smug that we would be getting paid to spend months reading love poetry – now all we had to do was pull together 100 wedding poems that fitted our brief of “something new”. We arrived at thePoetryLibrary in London, the largest public collection of modern poetry in the world, armed with a list of our favourite contemporary poets. The hard part, we agreed, would be whittling them down.In order to sift for suitable poems, we’d given ourselves these criteria:1) Does not necessarily need to mention weddings, but must believe in the concept of lasting love.2) The hope must outweigh the sadness.3) No profoundly grim last lines.Simple, right? As we quickly discovered, these criteria ruled out nearly every contemporary love poem ever written. Our Poetry Library days looked something like this: two women hunched in silence over poetry books, speed-reading and frowning. Our dialogue consisted mainly of “No”. Occasionally one of us would say, “Maybe?” – and the other would sit up like a meerkat, briefly hopeful – then we’d read on and say: “Oh no, sorry, the last line is about the inevitability of death.” Charles Simic’s Listen begins “Everything about you, my life, is both make-believe and real” – promising, I thought – then ends with “a small child leaping out of a window with its nightclothes on fire”. Fantastic ending, not a wedding poem.Sometimes one of us was sure, then the other would take a closer look and ask, ‘Isn’t this about an affair?’Sometimes one of us was sure – “Yes! This is a beautiful wedding poem!” – then the other would take a closer look and ask “Isn’t this about an affair?”, or “But doesn’t this leave the reader with a deep, pervading loneliness?” or, and this became a frequent question, “Is it a bit too sexy?” Could a wedding poem really proclaim, “I place your ring on my cock where it belongs”? (American Wedding by Essex Hemphill.) As the piles of books dwindled, our list barely grew. Days went by, then weeks, then months. Reading love poems became a slog.As summer turned to autumn, Rachel and I spent the evenings manically texting each other vast threads of poems from our personal bookshelves. What the hell did we actually mean by a wedding poem, anyway? What were we looking for? Love poems, of course. But what kind? As our reading attested, a huge majority of contemporary love poems are tinged with doom; and this is expected, after all, as often the emotional key to effective poetry is contradiction, an alloy of joy and sadness, anxiety and hope, clashing together to spark the unparaphrasable world of a poem.View image in fullscreenRachel Long.Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty ImagesHowever, if a celebrant stood up and said, “Statistically 42% of marriages end in divorce,” they’d be breaking the rules of the day and perhaps get a glass of prosecco thrown in their face. The point of a wedding is to provide you with enough optimism, support, encouragement and affirmation to sustain you through the hard times ahead; therefore, to be a wedding poem, a love poem mustn’t let in too much hard reality, or predict the end of love, or contain so much emotional ambiguity that it pours a gravy boat of sorrow over the vol-au-vents. But what about tone? What tone should a wedding poem have?We realised this was the wrong question. Every wedding, every couple is different. The dream of the “perfect wedding poem” is something that speaks directly, seemingly specifically, to a particular love. We can all picture that guy standing up to the microphone to awkwardly read a poem, using words (and a wooden poetry voice) that sound nothing like him. Well, I’m a firm believer that if a poem speaks to you, it will speak like you when you read it aloud. So, we didn’t want a “one-size-fits-all” anthology. We needed to be braver. Maybe a wedding poem could be a bit sexy? Or reflect real love in a difficult world? Unrequited, probably not, but funny and irreverent? Yes. These were alternative poems for alternative weddings, after all, be they small, huge, camp as Christmas, hilarious, glamorous, shotgun, a third wedding held in a nursing home, or the low-key but profound culmination of a 40-year love.I’m a firm believer that if a poem speaks to you, it will speak like you when you read it aloudWho says a wedding poem should feature stars, skies and rivers? Who limited our imaginations in that way? What about vacuum cleaners, the Tapton Bridge, black Chevrolets, cheese and onion rolls, brass bands, scaffolding and kittiwakes? What about “the ethereal gleam of wet tarmac”? (Michael Pederson.) Or laughter that “fills up the corners of the room with a thousand upside down cartoon bats”? (Hera Lindsay Bird.)After all, weddings need poems because poetry can express the inexpressible, translate longing into language, throw a can of paint over an abstract feeling. We reach for poems on these days because “love” is too small a syllable to elaborate on the endless uniqueness of the heart. So, rather than creating a safe generic tone across the whole anthology, we decided to include all tones, so that at least one poem would speak to a reader’s wedding specifically. Perhaps the couple are two lighthouses joined by a “beam of alignment” (Two Lighthouses by Julia Darling)? A Mr and Mrs “unveiling each other” (Measuring Light by Theresa Lola)? Masons, building a wall of “sure and solid stone” (Scaffolding by Seamus Heaney)? “Pure flame and song” (Serenade by Terrance Hayes)? “Two fat cats in love” (Cat Worship by Golnoosh Nour)? “Less silk and lace, more heather and thistle” (A Boy Gets Married by Lewis Buxton)? Or flying to the moon “by the speed of queer zest” ( i love you to the moon & by Chen Chen)?Finally, we had an anthology of one hundred (and one) newly selected poems for the big day, of all sizes, flavours and styles. Some are cheeky, some are weird, some sexy, subtle, domestic, ecstatic and sweet. You won’t find many featured in your frantic Google search, but we can assure you that their hope outweighs their sadness, and they all believe in lasting love.Something New: Alternative Poems for Alternative Weddings edited by Caroline Bird and Rachel Long is published by Picador.

Delivery charges may apply.Alternative readings for the big dayTwo LighthousesbyJulia DarlingI would like us to live like two lighthousesat the mouth of a river, each with her own lamp.We could see each other across the water,which would be dangerous, and uncrossable.I could watch your shape, your warm shadow,moving in the upper rooms. We would have jokes.Jokes that were only ours, signs and secrets,flares on birthdays, a rocket at Christmas.Clouds would be cities, we would look for omens,and learn the impossible language of birds.We would meet, of course, in cinemas, cafes,but then, we would return to our towers,knowing the other was the light on the water,a beam of alignment. It would never be broken.The KissbyStephen DunnShe pressed her lips to mind.– a typoHow many years I must have yearnedfor someone’s lips against mind.Pheromones, newly born, were floatingbetween us. There was hardly any air.She kissed me again, reaching that placethat sends messages to toes and fingertips,then all the way to something like home.Some music was playing on its own.Nothing like a woman who knowsto kiss the right thing at the right time,then kisses the things she’s missed.How had I ever settled for less?I was thinking this is intelligence,this is the wisest tonguesince the Oracle got into a Greek’s ear,speaking sense. It’s the Good,defining itself. I was out of my mind.She was in. We married as soon as we could.Excerpted from Everything Else in the World: Poems. Copyright (c) 2006 by Stephen Dunn.

All rights reserved.Poets pick their favourite wedding poemsAndrew McMillanThe joy of a wedding is the singular love celebrated within a community; and the party afterwards, of course. The Wickedest, by Caleb Femi, is a collection that captures that vibe perfectly, and a great one to read aloud would be Max Meets Shelley on the Balcony. It begins: “like a planet flung I danced / unroped”. A perfect start or end to any ceremony.Joelle TaylorLawless and adventurous, XIII from Adrienne Rich’s Twenty-One Love Poems in The Dream of a Common Language is a poem to launch a lesbian marriage.The rules break like a thermometer,quicksilver spills across the charted systems,we’re out in a country that has no languageno laws, we’re chasing the raven and the wrenthrough gorges unexplored since dawnwhatever we do together is pure inventionthe maps they gave us were out of dateby years …It is a sonnet to another way of life, another kind of love, its unmapped territory being the thrill of it. It ends with a moving sense of ancestry, of wrong-walking women connected across time.Wendy CopeAt our wedding a friend read the Apache Wedding Blessing. My favourite lines are “Now there is no more loneliness / For each of you will be companion to the other”. It ends: “May your days be good and long upon the earth.” I later learned that it is “fake folklore”, written in 1947. I’m glad I didn’t know that at the time. I still like it.Michael RosenWhen I got married we read pieces about things we liked that were personal to us, so they don’t really translate – but here’s a new poem:When you get marriedthey ask you to write an inscriptionThink of it as beinglike taking out a subscription.You should sign itwith a feeling of elationand hope it won’t endwith a cancellation.Mary Jean Chan“At twenty, yes: we thought we’d live forever. /At forty-five, I want to know even our limits.” I love Adrienne Rich’sTwenty-One Love Poems, which speaks about love as a political act, one that arrives like a revelation and endures against all odds in a patriarchal and violent world. Elsewhere, Rich writes, “I choose to love this time for once / with all my intelligence”.Len PennieWe tend to think of love as a completed action, a noun trapped in amber, a red rose. I wrote a poem called The Vow, which will be published in my new collection, Poyums Annaw, to acknowledge love as a verb, a choice, an action and commitment that’s continually taken every single day. It’s a visceral, embodied action unique to every person and relationship. It celebrates what it is “To be loved through each compromise, question or qualm / To be sheltered from storm and enshrined in the calm / To be held, not like glass, but the end of a deal”. And ends: “I am yours for as long as you’d like to be mine / If you ask me, I’m certain, forever is fine.”Harry Josephine GilesLove is overburdened with old images, so we need poems to help us see it clearly again. In Gràdh (Love) Aonghas Pàdraig Caimbeul compares it to a bird hanging upside down, eating nuts from a feeder:Cho daingeann’s a tha gràdh,a’ crochadh an sinsna speuran.(How solid / love is / hanging there / in the air.)Marriage is one of those heavy stories that wants lightening up if it’s to sing: this simple lyric, in ordinary Gaelic worn smooth by good use, could bring breath into the ceremony so that people can see love hanging there in the air above them.Rishi DastidarA friend once commissioned a poem from me for his wedding. I wrote something I thought was plangently romantic. I was summoned to a crisis meeting, where the bride-to-be said: “Can you make it funny?” Now if asked for a wedding poem I’d suggest Victoria Kennefick’sDeposition, with its ardent evocation of the marriage between waves and cliffs: “silt and foam, my wedding dress; spray and salt, my veil”.Explore more on these topicsPoetryRomance booksWeddingsLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The results are stunning – and chillingDiane SmythSat 14 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 06.49 EDTShareIn September the Pompidou Centre in Pariscloses for five yearsfor renovation. The building is nearly 50 years old and needs to be cleared of asbestos, and to reconnect with Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers’ original design after years of architectural accumulations. Many of the departments are already moving into temporary new homes, including the huge Bibliothèque publique d’information, the public library usually based on the second floor. Nearly all of its contents have been emptied out, but before it’s stripped back altogether, Wolfgang Tillmans has been invited to deconstruct it another way. His show,Rien ne nous y préparait – Tout nous y préparait(Nothing could have prepared us – Everything could have prepared us) covers all 6,000 sq metres of the space.It’s an inspired setting because Tillmans’ work circles around questions of information. He makes documentary photographs but questions the parameters of photographic vision. In his ongoing Truth Study Center he collates newspaper cuttings, photographs, photocopies, drawings and objects on trestle tables, encouraging viewers to consider these elements and their claims to veracity; his installations are always site-specific, and take a nuanced approach to display. Situated in the Bpi, Rien ne nous y préparait – Tout nous y préparait is a meditation on knowledge, how it is organised, and where its limitations lie. “I do trust my eyes, I want to trust observation, study, but for that it is very important that I sharpen my eyes to how I see, how we record, what we capture,” says Tillmans.View image in fullscreenMaking it look easy … Moon in Earthlight by Wolfgang Tillmans.Photograph: Courtesy Galerie Buchholz, Galerie Chantal Crousel, Paris, Maureen Paley, London, David Zwirner, New YorkThe artist had been invited to show work from throughout his 40-year career, but this isn’t a retrospective and it isn’t arranged chronologically. Instead it’s a response to the space, and it’s a space with a big personality. The Pompidou’s distinctive blue pipes snake across the ceiling and a bold carpet covers the floor, mostly grey, with some lime green stripes and squares, and the occasional stain. The carpet also features purple patches in seemingly abstract designs; this is an even older carpet, already there when the grey one was added in 2000. The fitters cut around bookshelves and partitions to lay the grey and so, when those fixtures were removed, a ghostly imprint of the library was revealed. For Tillmans the resulting palimpsest suggests a photographic negative, and it’s something he was keen to keep; elsewhere he’s retained shelving, library books, magazines, the photocopying room, tables, individual study booths and signage.The vacated BPI requires an exceptionally talented – and prolific artist – but Tillmans makes it look easy. Celebrated images such as Moon in Earthlight (2015) share wall space with the fire extinguishers; a long, thin corridor suggesting a rat run is home to a mid-1990s series on a street rodent. Some of the images are displayed at very large size, such as The State We’re In, A (2015), a documentary shot of a paradoxically ever-changing sea, or Panorama, right (2006), and Panorama, left (2024), which each measure six metres long. These huge works are cheek-by-jowl with much smaller images, even postcard dimensions, creating a physical experience worlds away from same-size online viewing. Some prints are framed, some clipped up, some stuck to the wall, each suggesting questions about how photography isolates what it shows.Not that Tillmans is sniffy about mass-reproduction. Vinyl-printed versions of the Panorama images are also installed in Berlin’s Berghain nightclub, the exhibition booklet informs, while tables towards the end of the space gather his work with magazines, including Arena Homme+ and Butt. There are also tables devoted to his photobooks, one displaying every spread of 1997 publication Concorde, a testament to 1960s techno-utopianism and cross-channel co-operation. At the end of the exhibition there’s a BPI reading table, complete with reading lights, and his monographs free to flip through. In the Autoformation [“Self-education”] booths there are videos on demand, allowing visitors to explore as they choose. Elsewhere are reproductions of image and text pieces Tillmans circulated online and as posters, exhorting readers to vote Remain, or against Marine Le Pen or Donald Trump. Some of these images and texts made it on to T-shirts, and there are photographs of people wearing them. “What is lost is lost forever,” reads a rallying cry about Brexit, a message the march of time has made forlorn. Nothing could have prepared us, though on the other hand Tillmans did try.View image in fullscreenParadoxical … The State We’re In, A, by Wolfgang Tillmans.Photograph: Courtesy Galerie Buchholz, Galerie Chantal Crousel, Paris, Maureen Paley, London, David Zwirner, New YorkTillmans isn’t anti-technology at all, speaking excitedly at the press view of the new possibilities afforded in the 2000s by ever-faster digital cameras. One of the intriguing aspects of this show is seeing how consistent his interest in technology has been, with very early works such as distorted black-and-white photocopies from 1988 sitting happily alongside contemporary prints.A final room is a sound installation, 2018’s I want to make a film, in which Tillmans narrates a potential project looking at digital technologies, while another installation, Travelling Camera (2025), hovers across the back of a digital 4k screen, a usually hidden infrastructure he has dotted with found fragments such as seashells and postage stamps. It’s not kit for the geeky sake of it, as evidenced by a large photograph of Russian troops in Moscow, shot in 2005. Tillmans is asking what we know, and how; what we notice, or are shown, and what remains obscure.At the Pompidou Centre, Paris, until 22 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsPhotographyreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’d walk up to the till, place my Barbie or Britney Spears CD player on the counter, and before the cashier had the chance to ask if we wanted a bag, I’d blurt out: “This is a present for my sister, it’s not for me!” Sharing a smirk with my mum, they’d offer replies such as, “Wow, she’ll love it!” and “Aren’t you a kind brother?” (If you hadn’t already guessed, I do not have a sister.)This was a regular occurrence in my childhood in the early 2000s. I was acutely aware, even as early as the age of five or six, that these were not the usual toys a little boy should be playing with. Where was myAction Manor Scalextric track? Why were my bedroom walls covered in posters of pop stars wearing crop tops and not footballers with muddy knees?View image in fullscreenPikachu costumes are a popular choice at Pride parades.Composite: Guardian Design; PRBarbie and Britney may have been my secret vices, but there was another phenomenon I, and a lot of other children my age, quickly became wrapped up in:Pokémon. The Japanese media franchise – currently the highest-grossing in the world – reached its “Pokémania” peak around this time.Video games, trading cards, figurines, and an anime TV series – thePokémonuniverse had them all. I was obsessed. My parents were left dumbfounded when I could name all the original 151 species by heart, and less than happy when I drew a huge pokéball on my bedroom wall in crayon.View image in fullscreenJordan Page in Pikachu costume.Photograph: Courtesy of Jordan PageAs a queer child, I could love Pokémon freely. Unlike other children’s media and toys of the time it wasn’t strictly gendered. While my badge maker and Polly Pockets were clearly marketed towards girls (and my short-lived possession of them was mixed with shame), nobody had a problem with my love of Pokémon, because anyone could be a Pokémon trainer, and for a while everyone wanted to be one.There were singing, dancing Pokémon that were fluffy and cute, and that – shock! – I was drawn to. Nobody cared which one was your favourite, because everyone had the same goal: to become the ultimate Pokémon master. Looking back, in what was incredibly ahead of its time, there were gender-neutral and gender non-conforming Pokémon. There was even one slightly resembling a drag queen.The human villains in the original TV show, Jessie and James of Team Rocket, regularly dressed in clothes associated with the opposite sex and subverted gender roles, and this never attracted the kind of frivolous concern about “confusing” children that it would today. Longtime Pokémon fans have debated their queerness in online forums, even if queerness is never mentioned in the show. For that matter, aside from the odd crush, heterosexual relationships weren’t central to the show’s storylines, either.View image in fullscreenTeam Rocket … Jessie and James (left), carrying his trademark rose.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyPokémon “battled”, but it was hardly violent enough to make me squirm or put me off in the way that hyper-masculine, weapon-wielding characters from other TV series and video games did. I felt excluded for not liking shows with these attributes, but in the Pokémon universe, I fitted in.In 2016, the augmented reality gamePokémon Gocatapulted the franchise back into public consciousness. By the end of the year, it had been downloaded more than 500m times. A community of LGBTQ+ fans – whether teenagers fresh to the franchise or adults who grew up with the original series – formed, and now it’s common to see Pikachu at Pride or get-ups resembling Ash Ketchum (the show’s original protagonist) in drag bars. The franchise has since embraced this community, introducing more visibly gender-fluid human characters.Though my relationship with Pokémon remains firmly in the early 2000s, I’m grateful that it provided me with a world free of gender norms that I didn’t relate to, a world that shielded me from being judged for what I really liked.Feeling a pang of nostalgia as I began writing this, I searched for the soundtrack of the first Pokémon movie on YouTube, only to discover that none other than a teenage Britney Spears sings a song on it. It’s made for children and it’s called Soda Pop, so obviously it’s awful. But if anything, discovering it is a full-circle moment for me, and in my mind, cements the fact that Pokémon has a place in queer culture through and through."

I ended up walking down Broadway as evening fell. It’s an area that’s already a visual spectacle – there are all these amazing retro marquees, billboards and neon signs. I spotted this sign reflected in a puddle just off the sidewalk and set up my composition.”Nynatten didn’t have to wait long for a person to pass by. He didn’t speak to to the stranger, nor does he remember what was written on the sign, but, he says: “I like that. It makes it abstract, enigmatic; it keeps people guessing.”He later made minor adjustments to the brightness, contrast and white balance. Nynatten hopes that his images make people feel as though they have watched a “really great five-second movie teaser. I find the pop of colour on an otherwise bleak sidewalk intriguing. It’s a hint that there might be something exciting to see just off camera.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Who am I to tell you how to enjoy your time with your most beloved – and who am I to tell you what they ought to be drinking, seeing as these days that’s invariably informed by gendered marketing and targeted campaigns?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I am, however, writing a column forNational Beer Dayon 15 June (the same as Father’s Day – yawn). Why am I doing this? Well, today is the night before, AKA New Beers’ Eve, and isn’t a pun as glorious as that worth celebrating?If you’re taking the time to observe the occasion, it’s worth enjoying your beer properly, so the ideal is to enjoy a pint in a pub, where the nectar is poured fresh, the lines are clean, the glassware is bespoke (ideally), and the server doesn’t care whether you live or die (unideally). But if you’d rather pay £3 instead ofthe new national average of £5for a single beer, you’re probably better off staying home, so I asked some industry folk, each of them no stranger to replicating the best drinking experiences in a domestic setting, how to achieve the perfect serve without leaving the house.For Matthew Curtis, drinks writer and founder of drinks magazinePellicle, it all starts with the cleanliness of the glass, which is, naturally, a little more tricky to achieve at home than at a bar, where specialist kit is involved. “Clean it thoroughly with hot, soapy water and using a dedicated brush. If you use a dishwasher, you’re going to get oil and residue on the glass, which will cause nucleation of bubbles on the insides and your beer won’t keep a head. Also, before use, always rinse the glass with cold water to make sure there’s no dirt on it.”Elizabeth Townsend, meanwhile, may ownKerroo Brewing Co, but at home she uses anEdel stemmed glassto get the most from her beer: “It keeps your drink nice and cold, because you’re not holding on to it like a pint glass, plus the rim allows more aromas to get to your nose.”Karen Edith Millar, who runsAll Good Beer’s bottle shop in east London, has another, more unexpected, tip: “You can make any rubbish lager from the back of the fridge instantly drinkable by chucking a dash of Campari into it, because the bitterness of the Campari takes away that sweet flavour you can get in more cheaply made beers. If you’re a fan of a west coast IPA’s hoppy bitterness, for instance, it will really scratch that itch.”That said, if you’re anything like me and a beer has a maximum life expectancy of about two hours once it gets through your front door, there may not be any rubbish lagers in your fridge to begin with, so this week’s pick features a selection of brilliant beers that require no additions.Celebrate new beers’ eve with a bangKirin Ichiban Premium Beer First Press£3.80 (500ml) Starry Mart, 5%.

The best bit is neither the tomato flesh nor the bread, it’s the salted tomato water that runs down the back of my hands and threatens to meet my elbows. It’s liquid electricity and one of my favourite earthly flavours. It could make a great stock, or a delicious martini, perhaps even a marinade for ceviche, but here it’s thrown in at the end to refresh a dish of gently cooked tomatoes, beans and dill. Perfect for dunking anything but elbows into.Grated tomato and butter beans with olive pangrattatoIdeally, you’ll need a food processor or blender for the pangrattato; if you don’t have one, tear the bread into small chunks, then toss with the olives, spread out on a chopping board and chop through a few times until you have a fine-ish crumb.Prep10 minCook30 minServes46-8 largeripe tomatoes(750g)Fine sea salt85g sourdough(ie 1 big slice), chopped, plus extra to serve30g pitted kalamata olives(about 8)Extra-virgin olive oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 tsp ancho or aleppo chilli flakes2400g tins butter beans, drained and rinsed – I likeCirio25g dill, leaves picked to get 18g, roughly choppedGrate the tomatoes into a bowl and discard the skins.

But can it help us manage our money? We put some common personal finance questions to the free version of ChatGPT, one of the most well-known AI chatbots, and asked for its help.Then we gave the answers to some – human – experts and asked them what they thought.PensionsWe asked:I am 35 years old and want to ensure I have a comfortable retirement. I earn about £35,000 a year and have a workplace pension, in which I have saved £20,000. My employer contributes 4% of salary. I would like to retire at 60 and want to ensure I have enough in my pension pot to not worry about money later in life. Do I need to save more?ChatGPTsaid*:A comfortable single-person retirement requires roughly £43,000 a year of spending (in today’s money) while a moderate lifestyle might need £31,000 a year. Covering £43,000 a year over a 20- to 30-year retirement implies a very large pension pot of about £793,000 in addition to the state pension. A moderate £31,000 a year needs £478,000 in savings.Your state pension will kick in at 67 and is about £12,000 a year, much less than the £43,000 needed for comfort and it does not arrive until seven years after you retire. This “pre-state pension gap” could well exceed £150,000. You must plan to fund all expenses for seven years on your own savings.Even optimistic growth leaves you well below the £500,000 to £800,000 needed. You’ll need to save more – much higher than 9%. Vanguard [an investment adviser] suggests saving 12% to 15% of your pay a year (including employer contributions). Legal & General offers a rule-of-thumb savings percentage of half your age: at 35, that means 17.5% of your salary. Since your employer already gives 4%, you might target 11%. Don’t forget UK tax relief: your 20% basic-rate relief effectively makes every £80 you save cost you only £60 net.Consider topping up with a lump sum or contributing to a stocks and shares Isa.Read ChatGPT’s full answer hereView image in fullscreenChatGPT’s responses were largely limited to general summaries and sometimes included inaccuracies.Photograph: Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockSteve Webb, a partner at the pension consultants LCP, says:Using thePensionsand Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) standard for a “comfortable” and moderate income seems a reasonable place to start.For someone aged 35 today, the state pension age by law will be 68 (and could be higher by the time they get there) so the reference to 67 in the reply is incorrect.The PLSA says you need £43,000 a year after tax, so that implies a pre-tax income of very roughly £50,000; you get £12,000 a year of this from state pension age, but for the first eight years of retirement (before the state pension kicks in) you would need this to come from your pension pot. This means you will need £635,000 on current calculations.The figure of £793,000, therefore, looks over the odds, though there may be an assumption (not made explicit) that a quarter is always taken in tax-free cash. The person using AI needs to understand what assumption has been made around tax-free cash to clarify what is going on.It is good the AI explains that in the first years of retirement you are relying solely on your private pension pot, a kind of basic “cashflow modelling” many advisers would do as standard.The rules of thumb are a decent starting point, although the one about saving at a percentage which is half your age is for people who only start saving at that age.One omission is that there is no reference to the possibility of an additional employer match. Some firms will pay more if you pay more, and that would make additional workplace saving much more attractive than the suggested alternative of an Isa. Another omission is that if you buy an annuity at 60, you may want to think about things such as inflation protection, and these would increase the size of pot you needed to target.I don’t think it’s a bad reply aside from the error on state pension age. But you would want to go deeper in terms of understanding the assumptions made.MortgagesWe asked:We have 20 years left on our mortgage and our current rate is due to run out in a few months. The loan to value is about 50%. What are the best rates on the market? Should we go for a two-year or five-year fix? Or should we stay put and hope that that rates come down?ChatGPTsaid:The very cheapest two‑year fixes are about 3.7% to 3.8% and five‑year fixes are about 3.8% to 3.9% for borrowers with large deposits. With 50% equity you should qualify for the lowest-rate tier.For example, Lloyds Bank has a two‑year fix at 3.72%. These often have arrangement fees (typically £999) so factor them into any calculation. For five‑year fixes, Lloyds offers 3.78%.If you did nothing, your mortgage would revert to the lender’s standard variable rate, which are typically much higher – about 7-8%. An SVR can jump if rates rise, and lenders are not required to pass on cuts in full.If you expect further rate cuts, a two‑year deal lets you refinance again sooner at (hopefully) lower rates. The downside is more frequent remortgaging: after two years, you’ll need another deal.Five-year deals are likely to be a few tenths higher but give peace of mind for longer and protect you if market rates jump or stay elevated. If stability of repayments is your priority, a five‑year fix is often recommended.Most analysts expect further modest cuts – economists at Barclays predicted the bank rate could fall to 3.5% by early 2026. That could push mortgage offers down further, but likely not to the ultra-low levels seen pre-2020.Many experts lean toward taking a fixed rate now (especially to avoid the very high SVR) and revisiting options after a year or two.Read ChatGPT’s full answer hereView image in fullscreenChatGPT can be helpful as the starting point of broader research into mortgages.Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PADavid Hollingworthof the broker L&C Mortgagessays:This response is not even close to the level of advice that a qualified adviser would provide. What it does provide is a quick spin around some of the things that have been going on in the market, along with a general overview of elements the borrower may want to think about.The AI response is a bit of a mishmash and veers from quite specific information, such as specifying the Lloyds rate, to more general observations. Aside from the fact that this deal is now defunct, it also required the borrower to be a current account customer. Criteria will be as much a factor for many borrowers as the deal itself.It does highlight that there’s an arrangement fee to factor in, but borrowers need to understand there are options that can reduce or remove those costs, which could work much better for someone with a smaller mortgage.It feels a bit mixed about what may or may not happen with rates – the bottom line is that none of us know and, as far as I know, that includes AI.Because it was asked about two- and five-year rates, it fails to consider whether another option could fit better. An adviser would take a borrower through that, which could open up something like a three-year deal, fixing for 10-plus years and the existence and pros and cons of variable rate deals, too.The response may give some food for thought to borrowers and help them consider the questions they want to cover with a human adviser. Most borrowers will have had a browse online of “best buy” deals and coverage of what’s happening in the market before seeking individual advice. ChatGPT may offer another way to drag a very general summary together quickly as part of that research.Funding universityWe asked:I have two children (12 and 15), both of whom are in secondary school. Both want to go to university when they finish school. What is the best way for me to start saving and how much will I need to put together? They will be going to university in the UK. Can they get student loans? How much will accommodation cost us?ChatGPTstarted with details of the government loans for tuition and living costs and when they need to be repaid. It says these children would qualify for the minimum maintenance loan of between £3,907 and £6,853 depending on where they work and study.It then said:It’s wise to start saving now with dedicated education savings. JuniorIsasallow up to £9,000 a year for each child in tax-free savings or investments. Any growth is tax-free, and funds are released when the child turns 18.Even small regular deposits (eg £50-£100/month) into a Jisa, or a high-interest children’s savings account, can add up. Other options include premium bonds, a stocks and shares Isa (higher risk, higher potential return), or simply a regular savings account in the parents’ name. Consider investments for long-term growth: index funds or diversified portfolios can beat savings rates, though with risk of loss.It added that you should encourage children to save and to check for bursaries and scholarships.Read ChatGPT’s full answer hereView image in fullscreenThe AI chatbot did a ‘decent job of spelling out’ how much going to university could cost, says one expert.Photograph: aberCPC/AlamyCharlene Young, a senior pensions and savings expert at AJ Bell, says:It did a decent job of spelling out the facts of how much uni could cost, and the probable level of loan that could be applied for.It falls short on explaining the differences that would help someone make the right decision for their circumstances. A discussion with a real person would involve questions asking for extra information to give a more comprehensive answer.When saving or investing for children, we often talk about putting on your own oxygen mask first, such as checking you have a cash buffer or emergency fund for those unexpected costs. I’d want to double check that you don’t have any unsecured, high-interest borrowing outstanding – the AI answer doesn’t really explain that, starting from an assumption your own finances are in good shape.A pot such as a junior Isa makes sense for a specific goal such as university costs, but that money is locked away until the child turns 18 – and after that, it switches to an account in their own name that they can spend as they wish.It was good to see the AI suggest involving the child in all financial discussions to help them become a bit self-sufficient and mitigate some of those risks, but the answer did not spell out the important access at age 18 point.We know that investing gives the best chance of growing money over the long term – above cash and rises in the cost of living. But the short investment window between now and the time the eldest child would go to university was not mentioned at all as a risk.A specific fund recommendation from AI would be a bit of a red flag, but it’s helpful to give people an idea of what could be considered or where to find more information. For example, what is an index fund, or a diversified portfolio and what are the likely costs.Here, a real adviser could make a formal recommendation, or an expert could point out how to research different types of funds.InsuranceWe asked:I have just bought my first home and am expecting a child with my partner. What types of insurance do we need and how much should we spend? We travel on holidays every year and both work full time.ChatGPTgave a list of insurances and explained what each does, including what policies typically provide and exclude. For example, it said “life insurance pays a tax-free lump sum or regular payout if a policyholder dies during the term… A Which? comparison found a 30-year-old could insure £300,000 (25-year term) for about £113 per year.”It said the key policies to get in this case were life insurance, income protection, critical illness cover, buildings insurance, contents insurance, and travel insurance.It said:“To save on premiums, you can bundle cover as insurers often discount multi-policy customers. A joint life policy (pays on first death) is cheaper than two single life policies, but note it ends on first claim. Sometimes buying separate dual life (first-death) and second-death life insurance can be optimal. Rates vary widely so get multiple quotes.”Read ChatGPT’s full answer hereView image in fullscreenChatGPT’s response on travel insurance was described as ‘very simplistic’.Photograph: Sina Ettmer/AlamyGraeme Trudgill, chief executive of the BritishInsuranceBrokers’ Association saysthe response is “very generic” and does not take into account the complexities of insurance. Brokers, he says, are able to negotiate with providers on behalf of the consumer and know what the best policies are on the market.Kathryn Knowles from brokers Cura Insurancesays some of the advice on critical illness cover was confused and did not properly distinguish it from income protection, which advisors have to do.AndGarry Nelson from AllClear Travel Insurancesays the AI’s response on travel insurance is “very simplistic” and fails to help people in what they need, be it a single trip or annual policy. “This is as far as ChatGPT can go in my opinion for travel insurance enquiries – ie offering a general description as it is not regulated to offer anything more detailed or complex,” he says.The verdictThe responses from ChatGPT were largely limited to general summaries about the various topics – and sometimes even contained inaccuracies. They may be a useful introduction and guide, but lack the level of detail needed to make serious decisions that could cost thousands of pounds. It’s a good place to start if you want an idea of some of the things you need to think about before making decisions – but if you want advice, you should be better off with a human.* The responses from ChatGPT have been edited for this articleWhat to ask and howYou will get better detail in an answer if you provide a lot of information, such as your age, your salary and what debts you have, rather than just asking a general question.Check your privacy settings to ensure you are comfortable with how ChatGPT processes your data. You may well want to ensure your chats are not being used for training.Don’t rely on the AI to tell you about the most up-to-date products. Instead do your own research or go to an adviser. The AI is better placed to give plans or broad strategies.Use it as a jumping-off tool, not for a final plan. While you might get some good general details, don’t make any decisions without doing your own research as well or consulting an expert.If you don’t understand a term, ask the AI to break it down for you – for example, you might want to know what the difference is between types of loan available when you go to university.On the free version of ChatGPT, click “Run Deep Research” in the tools section of the query box to get a more extensive report on your query, as we did in collating this article.

Turning my gaze north, there is the entire Llyn peninsula leading east to the peak of Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon), no doubt weighed down by thousands of visitors. Up here there are just two of us in an utterly peaceful landscape. No clouds on the horizon. No surprises.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I lie down for a few minutes and feel myself drift off. There are no human voices to be heard, only birds. Summer has come early to these mountains and I wouldn’t be anywhere else, drinking in that particular kind of tranquillity to be found on a peak under a blue sky.Mountains were not always seen as appropriate places to relax on a summer’s day. Those lofty, mist-wreathed realms held surprises, most of them nasty, such as trolls and demons. Maybe a few ancient folk knew perfectly well that mountains in summer were wonderful, but they weren’t the sort to publicise the fact: the solitary shepherd, gold prospectors not yet consumed by gold fever, and the workers who put up drystone walls – they all must have known the joy of lazing on a summit, perhaps seeing shapes in clouds.Changing culture and taste took a revolution led by artists and poets, men such asNicolas Poussin, who in the 17th century tried to win people over with paintings of mysterious peaks and epic landscapes. Unfortunately, he couldn’t resist adding a fallen Grecian column and a nymph draped in wispy stuff. It took another 150 years before the German artistCaspar David Friedrichrelocated the wispy bits to the mountain tops, evicted the nymphs, and added one rugged poetic type, gazing out over the towering tors with a vaguely proprietorial air. His Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog(1818, now in Hamburg at the Kunsthalle) remains the most evocative depiction of the romantic ideal.View image in fullscreenA close-up of Caspar David Friedrich’s painting Wanderer above the Sea of Fog (1818).Photograph: AlamyAfter that painting, summer in the mountains wasde rigueur,but it turned out that Friedrich’s sturdy 19th-century mountaineer was actually looking for a place to build a man-shed. All over the continent, wealthy romantics started funding simple dormitory accommodation, often precariously balanced on vertiginous crags. These mountain refuges were vital in allowing people to access the peaks, and became a huge part of my own enjoyment of the mountains.The first to be built wasRefuge des Grands Muletson Mont Blanc in 1853. There is still a hut there, rebuilt a couple of times, perched at 3,051 metres (10,009ft), overlooking the Bossons glacier. My own favourite,Rifugio Nuvolau, is a period classic in the Dolomites, built in 1883 and a haven of stout carpentry, hearty food and astonishing sunsets. Not all are antiques:Monte Rosanear Zermatt is an aluminium solar-powered box that sits above the Gorner glacier and requires ropes and crampons in order to reach it.Some huts are very high indeed: theMargheritaon the Italian Monte Rosa is, at 4,554 metres, the highest building in Europe. Sweden’sLåktatjåkko(1,228 metres) is both high in altitude and latitude: it’s 155 miles (250km) inside the Arctic Circle and often buried in snow, even in summer. Digging to the front door is worth the effort: they serve fantastic waffles with cloudberry jam.The staff in these huts are usually charming and helpful. Not all guests, however, are so wonderful. “There was one British visitor who, during the course of the night, pushed all the other sleepers along the dormitory bench,” complained one French guest after staying inRefuge de Ciottulu di i Moriin Corsica. “He left a huge empty space behind him and we were all squashed up in one corner.” (I’ve no idea why I rolled like that. I was fast asleep.)View image in fullscreenA 19th-century photo of Refuge des Grands Mulets on Mont Blanc, Europe’s first mountain refuge.Photograph: Heritage Image Partnership/AlamyMaking a reservation in one of these treasures can require persistence. The famous ones are often booked out, but many of the huts I’ve mentioned have alternatives nearby.Where there are no mountain huts available, a tent is not always needed. In Romania’s Carpathians, I’ve slept in hay ricks after jolly evenings drinking plum brandy with farmers. Sadly, the hay rick is disappearing as agriculture modernises, but the Carpathians remain a fine mountain destination.Oncea local hunter persuaded me to go on a bear hunt(no guns involved). We climbed through shady pine forest and golden flower-sprinkled meadows to warm rock and vast vistas. The hunter described a recent incident when he was chased up a tree by a bear. He proved it by showing his rucksack, complete with claw marks. On our descent, we stumbled on a fresh bear track and, for a second, the idyllic evening was shot through by lightning bolts of adrenaline.An undeniable fact of mountain life is that moments of arcadian bliss can be abruptly ended. You go up in sun, and descend in a wild storm. The unpredictable must be expected. Helm Crag in the Lake District was a favourite of Romantic poet William Wordsworth and for that reason many go to commune with nature.My favourite refuge is a period classic in the Dolomites, built in 1883 and a haven of stout carpentry, hearty food and astonishing sunsetsOne blustery lunchtime, I was sitting a little below the craggy summit about to enjoy a picnic when a group on the top suddenly flung their grandmother into the air. Caught by the wind, the old lady was whipped sideways and down, straight into the sandwich that was about to go in my mouth. Ash-scattering ceremonies really should be more careful. The ancestor went to her final resting place tainted with Branston pickle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To climb the Rhinogydd (often anglicised to Rhinogs), I based myself at the off-grid retreat of Garth Gell farm, all lovely hand-worn woodwork, flagstone floors and dusty books.The Rhinogydd are often touted as the most rugged mountain chain south of Hadrian’s Wall, which is a bit hard on the North Pennines and Cheviots, but the paths are certainly steep and challenging, deterring many visitors. The chain stretches for about 13 miles, with the highest point at Y Llethr (756 metres) where the 360-degree panorama is really special. The view is, of course, a big part of the attraction. We go up because we can see further.View image in fullscreenRhinog Fach and Llyn Hywel from Y Llethr in the Rhinogydd, Wales.Photograph: Shoults/AlamyMy snooze on Rhinog Fach is interrupted by my companion. “Look!” he says. The best summer mountain experiences always have that unexpected moment: the bear jumps out and claws your rucksack, human remains land in your picnic … that kind of thing. I sit up, suddenly alert.“On the wall. Down there.”There’s a bird, its pale chest striped with grey, its tail fanned out in annoyance as a horde of smaller birds are mobbing it. And then it calls.I have never considered the cuckoo to be a mountain bird, but there it is at 600 metres on a Welsh hill. And at the same time, away to the west, the haze lifts a little and the blue horizon puckers behind the last bit of Wales. The Blackstairs Mountains of Ireland have appeared.

When her body fell short, her protection disappearedAlexandra Diamond-RivlinSat 14 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 01.03 EDTShareI have never been excited about fancy dress, but when I received the invitation to a Sopranos-themed party a couple of months ago, I knew immediately who I wanted to go as: Adriana La Cerva. As a transgender woman, I empathised deeply with Adriana. I loved her wit, naivety, garish glamour and scandalous moments – the same reason I admire so many of the women in my trans community. Just look to Hunter Schafer or Alex Consani if you want a masterclass in all the above.View image in fullscreenAdriana La Cerva (Dreade Matteo) in The Sopranos.Composite: Guardian Design; Photo 12/AlamySome of Adriana’s one-liners – “If you think I’m gonna blow this guy for your sick purposes, you are sadly mistaken” – contain the sort of lewd, campy bravado of a ballroom queen. This is not the aspiration of gender transition, of course. But it does approximate to some of the ways trans women respond to their exclusion by a culture that expects women to be respectable, polite and discreet about their sexualities.But there is a more devastating side of Adriana that speaks to the trans experience: her quest for belonging. She longed for approval not only as a source of validation, but as a means of securing safety and stability. Her greatest struggle was that she craved acceptance from men and the family, even though she could never quite fit into their world.Adriana’s death in The Sopranosis devastating. After betraying the Soprano crime family by choosing to cooperate with the FBI rather than face prison, she confesses to her abusive fiance, Christopher. He turns her in and she is then lured into a car and taken to a quiet forest to be killed.As a trans woman, I identified with Adriana, and not just because of that iconic wit, naivety, glamour, and scandalousness. Adriana never belonged. She was beautiful, but in the end, it wasn’t enough.View image in fullscreenBetrayed … Adriana (Drea de Matteo) with her on-screen husband, Christopher (Michael Imperioli).Photograph: Getty ImagesFor much of the series Adriana was viewed by the men around her as a classic trophy wife: young, hot, highly desirable. This doesn’t last. Adriana’s deterioration is slow and drawn out. First, she is diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, which the mafiosos find sexless and amusing. Then, she reveals to Christopher that a previous abortion may have left her infertile. His cruel retort – “You knew you were damaged goods and didn’t tell me” – laid bare his true feelings for Adriana, steeped in ownership and manipulation. Her infertility is also the first real moment we see Adriana begin to lose her power and feminine status. By the end, she dealt with the same predicament many trans woman face too, fighting for recognition, social acceptance and protection.The Sopranos cast reunites in New York City: ‘Everyone up here, that’s a family’Read moreWhen I think about what it’s like to live by the sharpest edge of patriarchal violence, my own life feels stranger than fiction. Adriana resonated with me because she navigated a world where the stakes were highest for women whose biologies didn’t align with extremely narrow standards of femininity, where falling short meant not just humiliation, abandonment and alienation, but life-threatening risk. It’s no exaggeration to say that my survival is inextricably tied to my appearance – to my body’s ability to “pass” and conform to misogynistic ideals of femininity, just to exist safely in public.The writers of The Sopranos spared us from having to watch our beloved Adriana die: we hear the gunshot, but the camera pans away. It’s tempting to interpret this as an invitation to picture some other universe in which she survives. When I walked into the party wearing her tiger-print bodysuit, the one that wentTikTok virallast year, I wondered if I was in some way trying to live out the fantasy that the character gets to live an alternative future, one without the constant threat of patriarchy. Dreaming that it could happen feels personal, somehow.Whatever I hope for Adriana’s future, I hope for mine, too."

I’ve been here once before, a couple of years ago, but my memory of the place is fragmentary. I’ve remembered, for example, that you can’t get the car anywhere near the house – you have to lug your stuff across a beach and over some rocks – and have packed accordingly. But the view from the top of the rocks still comes as a disheartening surprise.“I forgot about the second beach,” I say, looking at the house in the distance.“I didn’t,” my wife says. “Press on.”As we trudge along the sand, I think: how could I not remember this? Along with my bag I am carrying my wife’s suitcase – whose wheels have never been less use – just as I did two years ago. It’s precisely the sort of personal hardship I pride myself on being able to relate in numbing detail.Once we’re in the house my brain serves me no better: I’ve retained a memory of the layout, which turns out to be back-to-front. This will cause me to lose my way over and over again in the course of the coming week: seeking a terrace, I will end up on a balcony, and vice versa.“It’s not that I don’t remember it,” I say to my wife the next morning. “It’s that I’m remembering it wrong.”“Do you remember getting up in the middle of the night to stand in the cupboard?” she says.“Yes, I do remember that,” I say. “And I wasn’t trying to stand in the cupboard, I just thought it was the bedroom door.”A few days later more friends arrive. We have all been on holiday together many times before, in varying configurations, with and without children. These memories form the basis of a lot of the conversation.One evening I walk into the kitchen where a few people are preparing supper. They’re talking about an Easter weekend in Dorset long ago, and laughing about egg-rolling in terrible weather.“I was there,” I say. Everyone stops talking and turns to look at me.“Were you?” says Mary, dubiously.“Yeah,” I say. “The weather was bad, as you say, and we went egg-rolling.” I try to think of another detail from the weekend that will convince them of my presence, but absolutely nothing comes to mind. Maybe, I think, I wasn’t there. My wife walks in.“What are we talking about?” she says.“Easter in Dorset,” says Chiara.“I remember that,” my wife says. “Egg-rolling in the rain.”“That’s right!” says Mary.‘Your recollection is remarkably accurate,’ I say to my wife. ‘Which is weird, because you weren’t there’“When I said that, everybody looked at me as if I had dementia,” I say. Everybody looks at me again, in a way that makes me want to go and stand in a cupboard.I recently read that to retrieve a memory is also, in some way, to rewrite it. Frequently recalled episodes are particularly fragile – the more you remember them, the more fictionalised they become. But to be honest, I’m not even sure I’m remembering this correctly.The next day everyone spends the afternoon reading on the terrace. At some point I fall asleep. When I wake, my book is resting on my face, the sun has set, and I am alone.I find everyone else in the kitchen, cooking. I open a beer and listen as my wife tells a story about a holiday in Portugal from 20 years ago. She is recounting the part about the hired van getting a flat tyre while going down a hill. This, at least, I remember.“The tyre came right off the wheel and started rolling ahead of us,” she says. “We watched as it rolled all the way down, and halfway up the next hill, till it slowed and stopped. Then it started rolling back down towards us.”Tim Dowling: I need to drop everything so I can get back to doing nothing – and quicklyRead more“Well, almost,” I say.“What?” she says. “Am I telling it wrong?”“No, you’re being remarkably accurate,” I say. “Which is weird, because you weren’t there.”“Yes I was,” she says.“No, it was just me and him,” I say, pointing to a friend whom I’ll call Paul, because his real name is Piers.“Yeah, it was just us,” says Paul.“But I remember the wheel coming off,” she says. “I can see it.”“It’s because he’s told you the story so many times,” says Paul.“My memory has infiltrated your brain to become your memory,” I say.“That’s so sweet,” says Paul.“If you’ve got any more of mine,” I say, “I’d quite like them back.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Tim Dowling columnFamilyFriendshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It isn’t orange and black, but an iridescent green, and I need to hunker down to reach its level.The green tiger beetle is widespread in Britain, and at least to the ants and caterpillars that it predates, it is every bit as threatening as the big catimmortalised by William Blake. Magnified, its fearful symmetry becomes more apparent, its mouth parts ferocious, the dandyish purple of its elegant legs more richly obvious.One other thing I appreciate about the green tiger beetle is how easily it’s identified. There are thousands of beetle species in Britain, and they’re not always this easy to tease apart. It makes the green tiger especially exciting to kids, a secure toehold in the shifting complexity of nature. And it’s that question, of inspiring the next generation to explore the marvels around them, that’s on my mind.View image in fullscreen‘More and more, the park and its users are perceived by politicians as just another part of the tourist industry.’ Burbage Rocks in the Peak District national park.Photograph: Nigel Beasley/AlamyThe day I spot my tiger, the chief executive of the Peak District national park publiclyfloats the idea of a tax on visitors. After a decade of deep cuts by successive governments, the authority has been stripped to the bone and can now focus only on its statutory functions, particularly planning.Earlier this year, itannounced cutsto its outreach programme at local schools and visitor centres. More and more, the park and its users are perceived by politicians as just another part of the tourist industry. This seems at odds with the far‑reaching vision of the postwar Labour government that created the parks when the country was almost broke. A connection to nature was, in their eyes, a necessary part of life that should be free to all.Next year is the Peak District national park’s 75th anniversary. I expect the government will bask in the achievement of its predecessor.

Its front yard – no grass, just desert rock – is home to 62 rainbow-painted dinosaurs, dragons, turtles and spiders. A sign on the garage reads: “Shan-gri-la Prehistoric Park”, complete with visiting hours.On a recent spring Friday at noon, the garage door hums open, letting in the harsh sun. Steve Springer, or “Dinoman” as he’s lovingly known by regulars of the park, ties a short black apron printed with cartoon dinosaurs around his waist. At 72, he likes to wear flip-flops with black socks and round glasses that make his eyes look tiny.We are at Steve’s Dinosaur House, a makeshift project aiming to provide education in an entertaining way for the general public. Steve spends about half of his retirement income keeping the park running – about $2,000 a month.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenNo talk of politics or religion is allowed. You come here to get away from the worldSteve ‘Dinoman’ SpringerParked inside the garage is his pride and joy: the Dinomobile, a mid-1990s sedan wrapped in digitized dinosaur graphics and electric green rims. Playful dinosaur stuffed plushies peer out from every window, and the rear license plate shouts in all caps: “DINOMAN”. In the corner hangs an LED TV screen playing a six-hour loop of dinosaur videos Steve has pulled and edited from YouTube. Along each wall, candy, chips and cookies are lined up neatly on folding tables.It’s a funhouse, an arcade, a makeshift carnival where the mood is always joyful. “No talk of politics or religion is allowed. You come here to get away from the world,” Steve insists.Inside the house, Steve quickly prepares for the day, placing sour pops in the empty freezer. “It’s just me here, so I eat out about six times a week,” he says. His bookshelves are neatly lined with thousands of horror and science fiction films. Awards for outstanding teacher are hung on the wall.View image in fullscreenWith summer around the corner, Steve packs up the inflatable Easter decorations, stores the pastel LED lights and eggs, and switches themes again: “Summer Dragon Days”. His back porch holds aisle after aisle of clear plastic bins stacked 10 ft high, labeled: July 4, Valentine’s Day, Easter, Christmas, Halloween, summer. Inside: disco balls, pool floats, water guns, bunny inflatables, Valentine hearts, fabric donuts.Out front, people start to trickle in. “How we doin’ today? We got new stuff,” Steve calls out, grinning.View image in fullscreenJanam Riffle and his mom, Jenny, are regulars. “He’s now 10, and we’ve been coming since he was five,” she says. “While I was waiting on my disability to go through, I was very poor, and this was somewhere I could take him and it didn’t cost anything. You know when you go to Disneyland as an adult and it still makes you happy? That’s the feeling I get when I come here.“We really needed to come today. The school held a fire drill and Janam is disabled, making it hard for him to do the stairs, so I said: ‘Let’s go to Dinoman to cheer up.’”As the day wears on, the line stretches down the driveway and into the street. Scooters and bikes pile up while kids wait. Everyone gets a turn – and everyone plays for free. At the entrance, they sanitize their hands and grab a plastic grocery bag. Each person chooses three items from bins filled with Cow Tales and Starbursts, Takis and Lays, bouncy balls, rubber ducks, squishy creatures. “Hooray, we got a winner!” Steve cheers, pulling a ticket from his apron. Lucky guests get bonus toys or coveted “Dinobucks”, good for things like cooking sets, Barbie dolls and skateboards.View image in fullscreenSanta has one day and I have the other 364Steve ‘Dinoman’ Springer“Dine-do-man,” a tiny girl calls. “Help me reach this toy!” Her parents wait in the car – she’s got the routine down cold. Several high schoolers walk straight to the snack section, grab their food and gun it home – a free munchies oasis in the walled suburban villages outside of Las Vegas.Dinoman knows the regulars. And he knows the kids that need an extra snack or two as well.“Santa has one day and I have the other 364,” he says.Tiffany and Ken Koo and their two kids, Aiden and Kaiden, eight and nine, have been coming since they were born. They make the 30-minute drive every Friday and often give back by volunteering their time polishing the neon green rims of the Dinomobile or cleaning the back patio with their dad. “We love to help Dino Steve because he helps us so much,” Ken said. The couple also run a free clinic for their local Buddhist temple.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFor them, going to a movie for a family of four and buying popcorn costs more than $70. “Even the gumball machine is a dollar. Here, all of us can play. It’s entertainment for the whole family,” Tiffany said. They exit to the front yard to play a series of games.Steve spends thousands on his project every month, but he also receives donations, and he can rely on his credit card.After three decades of teaching middle school and running a classroom candy shop, Steve missed the kids. “My dad was a workaholic,” he says. “I knew early I didn’t want that.”View image in fullscreenHe shrugs. “I’ve got everything I want. What else should I do with the money?”When he dies, he plans to sell off the dinosaurs, the Dinomobile and the house to fund scholarships.Inflation means fewer toys, but Steve does his best to keep the magic alive. At 4pm, he shuts the garage and moves the perishables and chocolate inside. His feet ache, but he climbs into the Dinomobile and drives 12 minutes to The Pit, a crowded local restaurant.View image in fullscreenAt his table, he unpacks a few plastic dinosaurs and a sign advertising the park. He brings his own croutons, parmesan and cracked pepper – items not supplied by the restaurant – then orders his usual: salad, a rare Pit burger, fries cooked exactly 60 seconds and a Dr Pepper slushie.After dinner, he heads across the lot to Dollar Tree, weaving through aisles he knows by heart. Twenty years of running the park has taught him what works. He tops off the night at the Sinclair dinosaur-themed gas station, then swings back to The Pit for one last Dr Pepper slushie.It’s Friday night. Dinoman has done enough for one day.View image in fullscreen"

This was established well in advance of Friday’s attack and used to destroy Iran’s air defences, the officials said.The Mossad, an abbreviation of the Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations in Hebrew, has scored many such victories in almost 80 years of undercover operations, earning a unique reputation for audacious espionage, technological innovation and ruthless violence.The new operation in Iran comes just 10 months after the service managed tosabotage thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah operativesin Lebanon, an attack that killed 37 people and injured about 3,000 others while crippling the militant Islamist organisation.The service then contributed to the air offensive thatwiped out Hezbollah’s leadershipin a matter of days.Over decades, the Mossad has built up deep networks of informants, agents and logistics in Iran. This has allowed a series of operations includingthe assassination with a remote-controlled automatic machine gunof a top Iranian nuclear scientist travelling at speed in a car on a remote road,the infection with malware of computers running key parts of Iran’s nuclear programmeand the theft of an archive of nuclear documents. Last year, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, wasassassinated with a bomb placed in his favourite roomin a government guesthouse in Tehran.View image in fullscreenCCTV footage of the moment a pager exploded in a vegetable shop in Lebanon.Photograph: Balkis Press/Abaca/Rex/Shutterstock“This most recent operation is impressive, of course, but Iran has been an open book for Israeli intelligence for a decade or more,” said Yossi Melman, a veteran Israeli security reporter and author.Melman said those pictured setting up missile launches in the grainy videos released by the Mossad were likely to be Iranians. “The boots on the ground inside Iran are not Israeli, so they have to be recruited, trained, equipped, and deployed. Then all the components of the weapons have to be smuggled in. It all needs a lot of professionalism and skill.”Unusually, Israeli officials have highlighted the role of Aman, the military intelligence service, in building up targeting information for the Israeli offensive.Though Aman and the Mossad often work closely, it is the foreign service, much smaller, that gets most of the attention. Even then, most of the Mossad’s work is never known outside tightly restricted circles.For decades, few had even heard of the Mossad, which was formally established in 1949. Former agents were ordered not to tell even their family or their previous employment and the service never admitted its involvement in any operation.Yossi Alpher, who took part in some of the service’s best-known operations in the 1970s, told the Guardian last year: “Everything the Mossad did was quiet, no one knew. It was a totally different era. The Mossad was just not mentioned. When I joined, you had to know someone to be brought in. Now, there is a website.”The Mossad’s senior officials have long been more likely to spend their time on sensitive diplomatic missions, briefing senior Israeli decision-makers on regional political dynamics or building relationships abroad than recruiting spies or running operations such as that targeting Iran this week.From Munich 72 to 7 October attack: the chequered history of the MossadRead moreFor decades, the Mossad oversaw years-long clandestine efforts to build up “enemies of Israel’s enemies”, such as Kurds in Iran, Iraq and Syria, and Christians in what is now South Sudan. As with many of its efforts, this had mixed success.The Mossad is blamed by some for ignoring warnings about the reputation of Maronite Christian militia in Lebanon for brutality and ethnic hatred, and encouraging Israel’s disastrous invasion of that country in 1982, in which thousands of civilians were killed.The Mossad also played a significant, though still little-known, role in the covert supply of arms to Ayatollah Khomeini’s Iran to help fight Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, as part of the Iran-Contra scandal during Ronald Reagan’s presidency.View image in fullscreenThe funeral procession in Tehran for Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.Photograph: Iranian Supreme Leader’S Office/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockThe mythical reputation of the Mossad has been bolstered by films and TV series, with screenwriters attracted to some of the service’s best-known exploits.One of the most famous isthe 1960 capture in Argentina of Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi officer who was a key organiser of the Holocaust. Others includestealing warships from the French navy in 1969, warning of impending attack by Egypt and Syria in 1973 and providing key intelligence for the famousraid on Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976 that freed Jewish and Israeli passengershijacked by Palestinian and German extremists.In 1980, the service set up and rana diving resort on Sudan’s Red Sea coastas a cover for the clandestine transport of thousands of members of Ethiopia’s Jewish community to Israel. The Mossad spies lived among tourists before being forced to close down the operation after five years.After a deadly attack by Palestinian extremists on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972, the Mossad led a campaign to disrupt the networks and groups responsible. The effort ended when a Mossad team shot dead a Moroccan waiter in Norway in the mistaken belief he was a Palestinian Liberation Organization security official, and then made further errors leading to their arrest and trial by local authorities.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Israel was forced to hand over an antidote and relations with Jordan were badly damaged. In 2010,agents were caught on CCTV camera in Dubaiduring another assassination.Then there is thefailure to learn anything that might have warned of the Hamas raids into southern Israel on 7 Octoberthat killed 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and led to the abduction of 251. The attack prompted the Israeli offensive in Gaza, the current war with Hezbollah and, indirectly, the new confrontation with Iran.Former Mossad officials say the service only gets noticed when things go wrong. This is not quite true, though – as the release of the Iran videos shows.Melman said one of the Mossad’s aims – particularly with the publicity – is to sow fear among Iranians. “The aim is psychological. The Mossad is telling the Iranian regime: we know everything about you, we can wander into your home when we like, we are an omnipotent force,” said Melman. “It’s also a very good way to boost the morale of the Israeli public.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelThe MossadMiddle East and north AfricaEspionageIrannewsShareReuse this content"

But US Steel and Nippon Steel said in a joint statement that the agreement stipulates that approximately $11bn in new investments will be made by 2028 and includes giving the US government a “golden share” – essentially veto power to ensure the country’s national security interests are protected.“We thank President Trump and his administration for their bold leadership and strong support for our historic partnership,” the two companies said. “This partnership will bring a massive investment that will support our communities and families for generations to come. We look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again.”The companies have completed a Department of Justice review and received all necessary regulatory approvals, the statement said.“The partnership is expected to be finalized promptly,” the statement said.The companies offered few details on how the golden share would work and what investments would be made.Trump said Thursday that he would as president have “total control” of what US Steel did as part of the investment.Trump said then that the deal would preserve “51% ownership by Americans”. The Japan-based steelmaker had been offering nearly $15bn to purchase the Pittsburgh-based US Steel in a merger that had been delayed on national security concerns starting during Joe Biden’s presidency. Trump opposed the purchase while campaigning for the White House, yet he expressed optimism in working out an arrangement once in office.“We have a golden share, which I control,” said Trump, although it was unclear what he meant by suggesting that the federal government would determine what US Steel does as a company.Trump added that he was “a little concerned” about what presidents other than him would do with their golden share, “but that gives you total control”.Still, Nippon Steel has never said it was backing off its bid to buy and control US Steel as a wholly owned subsidiary.The proposed merger had been under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, during the Trump and Biden administrations.The order signed Friday by Trump said the CFIUS review provided “credible evidence” that Nippon Steel “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States”, but such risks might be “adequately mitigated” by approving the proposed national security agreement.The order does not detail the perceived national security risk and only provides a timeline for the national security agreement. The White House declined to provide details on the terms of the agreement.The order said the draft agreement was submitted to US Steel and Nippon Steel on Friday. The two companies must successfully execute the agreement as decided by the treasury department and other federal agencies that are part CFIUS by the closing date of the transaction.Trump reserves the authority to issue further actions regarding the investment as part of the order he signed on Friday.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS foreign policyJapanUS unionsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Albanese has previously described the tariff regime as an act of economic self-harm by the White House.Albanese will raisepossible benefits for the US militaryfrom Aukus, including industrial capability for submarine construction, as well as infrastructure investment for maintenance of US subs at the Henderson naval base, south of Fremantle.“WhatAukuswill do is improve the productivity of the defence forces of both the United States and Australia, which is why it is in our interest,” he said.Trump is due to land in Canada on Sunday night local time, after overseeing a military parade in Washington coinciding with his 79th birthday.When he attended the 2018G7summit in Canada, Trump refused to sign the joint leaders’ statement and accused the then prime minister, Justin Trudeau, of being “very dishonest and weak”.This time, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, has ditched the traditional communique to avoid a fight among G7 leaders.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, high tides swept the algaeinto the Coorong, an internationally significant Ramsar wetland at the mouth of the Murray River.Once there, the algae began “reproducing madly” in the nutrient richwaters of the North Lagoon, according to estuarine ecologist Faith Coleman.Among the dead were mostly benthic species – estuarine snails, shore crabs, baby flounder and “a thick stew of dead polychaete worms” – a crucial food source for shorebirds and fish.‘A horror movie’: sharks and octopuses among 200 species killed by toxic algae off South AustraliaRead moreLevels had declined from their peak but the smell of rotting fish remained, along with algal spores buried in the sediment. “As soon as it warms up again, the likelihood is [the algal bloom will] be back,” Coleman said.The marine heatwave, a contributing factor to the bloom, persisted off the coast of SA, according to an11 June update, which showed increases in chlorophyll – an indicator of algae concentrations – along the Coorong coast and western Gulf Saint Vincent.CoorongFourth generation fisherman Gary Hera-Singh was one of the first to notice the lagoon’s colour turn a “dark, orangey-brown”.“We had a big storm event, a lot of seawater got pushed around, and this algal bloom found its way into the Coorong and has just created havoc since,” he said, and there were still “massive patches – 100 acres at a time” where the bloom was flourishing.Hera-Singh has witnessed the health of the Coorong decline in his lifetime, but said in 41 years of fishing the impact of the algal bloom was the worst event he had seen.The Coorong, a 120km narrow band of water separated by sand dunes from the Southern Ocean, together with lakes Alexandrina and Albert, is considered a wetland of international significance, providing critical habitat for fish, water birds and many threatened species. The North Lagoon – the area affected – is an important nursery for fish such as mulloway and bream.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailProf Peter Gell, an expert in Ramsar listed wetlands, said the wetlands had degraded over a long period of time, with barrages (structures that control water flow) added in the 1950s, higher nutrient loads and extended periods of reduced flow from the Murray.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Restoration efforts would help build the resilience of the Coorong and marine areas, she said.The system was already under pressure, said Dr Nick Whiterod, an ecologist and science program manager at the Coorong Lower Lakes Murray Mouth Research Centre. But the recentdroughtand unusual algal blooms had been “eye openers” to many people, he said.Last year, a tropical species of blue-green algal bloomed in Lake Alexandrina for the first time, and had persisted, Whiterod said. Now thatkarenia mikimotoihad got into the Coorong, there was concern it too would bloom again.The Coorong was vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, like sea level rise and reduced river flows, he said.“Ocean temperatures are heating up. It’s creating conditions that are conducive to algal blooms all around the world,” he said. “Our ecosystems are really stressed, we are getting to a period of time where some may not have the capacity to recover.”Explore more on these topicsSouth AustraliaAustralian climate and environment in focusAdelaideWaterClimate crisisMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

The strategy is meant to radiate strength but not aggression.“The uncertainty that Aukus introduces is that we are buying submarines that actually have the capabilities to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles on to an enemy land mass,” says Roggeveen.“That is an offensive capability that’s ultimately destabilising. We should be focusing on defensive capabilities only.”Those advocating for a more defensive approach, including Albert Palazzo from the University of New South Wales, point out that it ismore costly to capture groundthan it is to hold it.The argument has been bolstered by Ukraine’s ability to stall the advance of a larger adversary, aided by its use of relatively cheap underwater and airborne drones.On the question of alternative uses for the submarine money, the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments recentlyasked teams in Washington and Canberrato consider how Australia might rebalance its defence force structure over the next decade.In the experiment, four out of the six teams – including all three Australian teams – opted to cancel the nuclear submarine deal, citing concerns about British industrial capacity, complexities of the program and the delivery timetable.Social costTotal defence funding is forecast to nearly double in dollar terms over the next decade, from $56bn in this financial year to $100.4bn in 2033-34.The increase in defence spending as a share of the economy is less pronounced, but still marked: from 2% now to 2.4% over the same period.Saul Eslake, an independent economist, says higher defence spending is coming at a time of substantially higher demands on the public purse across a range of areas, from aged care, to disability services and childcare.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now she is busy preparing banners, handing out flyers and shouting through megaphones in squares as she joins dozens of activists in whipping up resistance to the “umpteenth gigantic event” she says that risks turning the world heritage site – which has long suffered from the effects of excessive tourism – into a playground for the rich.Sottoriva is referring to the star-studded nuptials between the billionaire Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, and Lauren Sánchez, a former TV journalist. The days-long shindig, expected to begin from 24 June, will be the biggest wedding held in Venice sinceGeorge Clooney married Amal Alamuddinin 2014.While Venice residents mostly embraced the Clooneys’ fairytale big day, the Bezos wedding has been met with much more antipathy. As soon as Venice’s millionaire mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, confirmedin Marchthat the couple would be getting married in the city, activists mobilised their “No space for Bezos” campaign.View image in fullscreenA ‘No space for Bezos’ poster on a wall in Venice. Residents say they don’t want the city to be transformed into a playground for billionaires.Photograph: Andrea Pattaro/AFP/GettyPosters featuring an image of Bezos’s head on a rocket blasting into space – in reference to his Blue Origin space tourism venture – have appeared across the city. The campaigners have also been spreading the word by handing out flyers at various traditional Italian food festivals, known assagre, and hosting public meetings. Their boldest pre-wedding stunt so far was to erect a banner reading “No Bezos” on the bell tower of San Giorgio basilica on the Venetian island of the same name, where the couple are rumoured to be exchanging their vows.Was this a hen do or a humanitarian mission to liberate Paris? Either way, give Lauren Sánchez an award | Marina HydeRead more“There’s a lot of anger in the air because once again the council has enslaved itself to the logic of profit – our city has been sold to the highest bidder,” Sottoriva said. “Every time an event of this kind happens, the city comes to a standstill, certain areas become inaccessible and even more tourists arrive. This wedding really is the symbol of all that is wrong withVenice.”The details of the nuptials are top secret, with Brugnaro’s council feeding the ire by not even confirming the precise dates. The festivities are scheduled for 24-26 June, although some say the wedding itself will not be held until 28 June.Despite the scant information, for months the Italian press has been filled with hearsay about everything from the 200 guests – notably Kim Kardashian, Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey and Ivanka Trump – and their €9,000-a-night hotel rooms, to the contingent booking out the entire water taxi fleet and the many designer dresses the bride will wear during the celebrations.View image in fullscreenA ‘No Bezos’ banner on the bell tower of San Giorgio basilica.Photograph: Marta SottorivaWhile the city’s leaders are fully embracing the merriment and, moreover, the riches they claim the festivities – rumoured to be costing £8.4m – will bring to the city, their political rivals argue that the event will not benefit ordinary Venetians in the slightest.“This wedding is causing much friction, especially because it is happening at a time when Venice, already invaded by uncontrolled tourism, is completely worn out,” said Giovanni Andrea Martini, a councillor for the opposition.To make up for it, Martini would like Bezos, the world’s third-richest person, to help address the affordable housing shortage by donating money towards restoring the more than 1,000 council homes that lie abandoned.Brugnaro has insisted the wedding will not bring any inconvenience to the city and has condemned the anti-Bezos campaigners as “shameful”.Sottoriva says the issue is not necessarily the people getting married per se, although she admits that Bezos’s associationwith Donald Trumpand Amazon’s record onworkers’ rightsdoes not bode well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Out of deference to Trump, the climate crisis has already been erased from the agenda.The largely informal talks provide a rare change for the leaders to press Trump about shared values and specifically on a timetable to impose further sanctions on Vladimir Putin, a step he has repeatedly delayed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy will also be present, marking the first time the two men will have met since Russia and Ukraine failed to agree a ceasefire in Istanbul.European leaders will test Trump to see if he will agree to the price cap on Russian oil being lowered from $60 a barrel to $45, a means of undercutting the Russian war budget. The concept of the cap was invented at theG7, and tightening it is included in Europe’s planned 18th sanctions package.The one area of unity may come in backing a strategy against China, including ensuring secure supply lines on critical minerals.But Trump’s erratic handling of the conflict betweenIsraeland Iran is likely to top a crowded agenda. The four European powers – Germany, France, the UK and Italy – will express their support for Israel’s right to defend itself, but in private calls to Trump have urged de-escalation.Diplomats had hopedIrancould be persuaded to attend the Oman-mediated talks with the US on Sunday, but the talks – from which Europe had been excluded and which offered the only hope of preventing further missile exchanges – have been cancelled.European leaders will seek an explanation about what persuaded Trump to give Israel a green light to strike Iran before talks involving his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, in Oman, had come to an end.It is not clear that European powers agree with the US negotiating stance that Iran must abandon any right to enrich uranium, a break from the compromise agreed in the 2015 nuclear deal.Iran deeply resents Europe’s lead role last week in ensuring it was censured by the board of the UN nuclear watchdog for failing to meet its nuclear safeguarding obligations. Iran believes the vote gifted Israel an excuse to launch its assault, so diverting the diplomatic path. Europe for its part said it had no option to press the vote due to the lack of Iranian cooperation with the UN nuclear inspectors.With the diplomatic route currently closed, western leaders at the summit will instead collectively have to assess how close Israel is to permanently destroying Iran’s nuclear facilities, and the risk that the country’s reeling leadership will declare that the lesson of the war is that its security can only be protected by rushing to build a nuclear bomb. Demands for the leadership to take the fateful step are being openly voiced by demonstrators and by politicians.Israel is trying to create the conditions for the regime to be overthrown but western diplomats report even internal critics of the brinkmanship over its nuclear programme are rallying to patriotic calls.Writing in Foreign Affairs Richard Nephew, a Iran deputy special envoy in the Biden administration, said: “Iran’s most dangerous uranium enrichment site at Fordow has been attacked, but there is no confirmation that its defences have been breached or that its couple of thousand of centrifuges have been destroyed.“There is also no indication that Israel has rendered unusable Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium. If that stockpile is still available, and if Iran’s centrifuges are still around, Tehran may be able to reconstitute a nuclear weapons programme in just weeks.“Iran could, for example, ship its hoard of 60% enriched uranium to Fordow (or a secret site) for further enrichment, quickly giving it enough uranium to make a bomb.“But to actually build a nuclear weapon, Iran needs more than weapons-grade enriched uranium. It also needs processing equipment that can turn the uranium into metal, shape it into weapons components, and then build the weapon itself. Doing all that in the midst of war will be difficult, especially given the world’s decades’ long effort to deny Iran the necessary gear.”Explore more on these topicsG7IsraelIranDonald TrumpCanadaMiddle East and north AfricaMark CarneyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Israeli rhetoric reflected its leaders’ growing confidence that they have gained the upper hand, and raised questions over whether Israeli war aims could go beyond the stated objective of crippling Iran’s nuclear programme.The threat to destroy Tehran was delivered by Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, after Iran responded to the surprise Israeli attack on Friday morning with a barrage of several hundred ballistic missiles and drones, a small percentage of which succeeded in penetrating Israeli defences and killed three people in Tel Aviv and Rishon LeZion.Katz, whose forces have already razed large parts of Gaza, held Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responsible for Tehran’s fate.UK moves jets to Middle East as Starmer refuses to rule out defending IsraelRead more“The Iranian dictator is taking the citizens of Iran hostage, bringing about a reality in which they, and especially Tehran’s residents, will pay a heavy price for the flagrant harm inflicted upon Israel’s citizens,” Katz said. “If Khamenei continues to fire missiles at the Israeli home front, Tehran will burn.”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) targeted the air defences around the capital city on Saturday morning and became increasingly confident they had achieved complete air superiority and freedom of action.View image in fullscreenA damaged building in the aftermath of Israeli strikes in Tehran, Iran.Photograph: Majid Asgaripour/Reuters“The aerial road to Tehran is effectively open,” an IDF official said. Later in the day, Benjamin Netanyahu said: “In the very near future, you will see Israeli air force jets over the skies of Tehran.”Air force warplanes, the Israeli prime minister said, would target “any site and any target of the Ayatollah regime”, after dealing a “real blow” to Iran’s nuclear programme.A few hours later, Iranian media reported a “massive explosion” at a refinery in the port city of Kangan, linked to the South Pars gas field, the world’s largest. The media reports said it had been struck by an Israeli drone, which would be the first attack on Iran’s oil and gas industry, a development with potentially huge economic and environmental consequences. The IDF did not immediately comment on the attack, and Iran’s oil ministry said the resulting fire had been extinguished by late evening.Early on Sunday, both sides launched a fresh wave of attacks, with Israel saying that that it was attacking military targets in Tehran while explosions were heard over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.Iran said the Shahran oil depot in Tehran was targeted in an Israeli attack but that the situation was under control, and that a fire had erupted after an Israeli attack on an oil refinery near the capital. Israeli strikes also targeted Iran’s defence ministry building in Tehran, causing minor damage, Iran’s Tasnim news agency said on Sunday.In Israel, four people were killed in a missile strike near a house in Tamra, a predominantly Palestinian city in northern Israel. Israeli media reported another three people killed in the central town of Bat Yam. Scores of people were reportedly injured in the strikes.Iranian leaders maintained a defiant front. The president, Masoud Pezeshkian, pledged that continued Israeli attacks would produce a “more severe and powerful response”, the new Revolutionary Guards commander vowed his forces would “open the gates of hell” on Israel, and Iranian state media quoted officials aswarning the US, UK and France that their military bases and ships will be targetedif they helped shoot down Iran’s missiles and drones.MapThe US and France have already stated their readiness to defend Israel, and American media reports have suggested that US forces have already been in action. The UK government has said its forces had not provided any military assistance to Israel and the prime minister, Keir Starmer, has emphasised the need for de-escalation.Following through on the threat would be an enormous gamble for Iran, drawing western forces further into the conflict when it is already reeling under the force of sustained Israeli bombing.View image in fullscreenAn emergency worker at Rishon LeZion, a suburb of Tel Aviv, which was hit by an Iranian ballistic missile on 14 June.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianSpeaking at a session of the UN security council on Friday, the US diplomat McCoy Pitt warned: “No government proxy or independent actor should target American citizens, American bases or other American infrastructure in the region. The consequences for Iran would be dire.”At the same time, Israel’s air defences have shown themselves capable of minimising the danger posed by Iranian missiles and drones. The IDF said Iran had so far fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel and launched more than that number of drones but claimed the overwhelming majority had been intercepted.The Iranian response has also been further blunted by Israel’s targeted killing of Tehran’s senior generals, almost completely wiping out the top echelons of the chain of the command. On Saturday, the IDF claimed to have killed two more: the head of intelligence for the armed forces, Gholam-Reza Marhabi, and the commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ ballistic missile arm, Mohammad Hossein Bagheri.MapIn total since the start of the war, the IDF said Israeli warplanes had attacked 150 targets inside Iran with hundreds of munitions.Iranian state media said that a fighter jet hangar at Tehran’s Mehrabad airport had also been targeted. Iran’s state TV said about 60 people, including 20 children, had been killed in an attack on a housing complex in Tehran.Iran’s envoy to the UN security council, Amir Saeid Iravani, said on Friday that 78 people had been killed in the Israeli attacks, and that more than 320 were injured, most of them civilians. Alongside Iran’s top generals there were nine nuclear scientists among the dead, as Tehran was caught unawares by the Israeli assault.View image in fullscreenIsraeli strikes reportedly targeted strategic Iranian sites, including the Natanz nuclear facility.Photograph: @AirbusDefence/OSCAn IDF official described the targeted scientists as the “people who were main sources of knowledge, the main forces advancing the nuclear programme”.The Iranian government also said there was limited damage at its uranium enrichment plant at Fordow, its second enrichment facility but Israel denied having bombed it. On Friday,the IDF claimedto have inflicted “significant damage” at the plant at Natanz. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed the above-ground part of the Natanz plant had been destroyed but noted no apparent damage to its underground chambers.AnIAEA report saidthat attacks caused radiological and chemical contamination in the Natanz facility, but that it was manageable and there was no sign of higher radiation in the area around the plant. Iran also said there had been attacks on its nuclear site in Isfahan, which houses a uranium conversion plant, a fuel production unit and other facilities.1:15Israel intercepts Iranian retaliatory missiles – videoThe IAEA reminded Israel that attacks on nuclear sites were illegal and contrary to the UN charter, with a potential to cause “radioactive releases with grave consequences”.Israel’s justification for its attack on Iran was that the country was getting unacceptably close to acquiring a nuclear weapon, and specifically that it was working on weaponisation, the assembly of components into a warhead. That is a claimnot found in US intelligence assessmentsor in IAEA reports.An IDF official on Saturday gave more details of Israel’s allegation, claiming that Iranian technicians had been working on an explosive trigger mechanism for a nuclear bomb, and that part of that work was being done in Isfahan.“We have seen clear intelligence indicating that they are taking steps forward rapidly, that cannot be understood in any other way than for a nuclear bomb,” the official said.MapThe worst casualties on Saturday from the incoming missiles were in the West Bank, where five Palestinians, including three children, were killed, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent, reportedly by a projectile fired by Houthi forces in Yemen, who are Iranian allies.Over the first 24 hours of the conflict, three Israelis were also killed, two in Rishon LeZion and one in nearby Tel Aviv, with dozens injured and extensive damage to buildings.There were reports from Gaza of the Israeli shooting of large numbers of Palestinians trying to reach food distribution points on Saturday morning, but details were hard to confirm on the third day of a communications blackout after the severing of a critical cable by Israeli forces.View image in fullscreenA person stands near a damaged residential building after a ballistic missile strike in Tel Aviv.Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPAThe few missiles that pierced Israel’s defences caused significant damage but few fatalities. InTel Aviv on Friday night, smoke from one impact site rose up in columns so thick they obscured the city skyline.Israel’s ambulance service said 34 people were injured on Friday night in the Tel Aviv area, most with minor injuries. Police later said one person had died. Another two people were confirmed killed in a direct missile strike on central Israel on Saturday morning.The Israeli leadership and the IDF have insisted that its offensive against Iran, called Rising Lion, would continue until Tehran’s nuclear programme – which Netanyahu said was on the brink of producing weapons – was comprehensively destroyed.From Gaza to Ukraine to Iran, Trump’s ‘peacemaker’ promise collapsesRead moreAddressing the UN security council, the IAEA director-general, Rafael Grossi, warned of the potentially disastrous consequences of such attacks.The US role in the Israeli operation remained murky. In the run-up to the Israeli 200-plane attack, Donald Trump had publicly urged Israel to give diplomacy more of a chance before US-Iranian talks that were planned for Sunday. On Friday, the US president insisted he had been well informed of Israel’s plans and described the Israeli attack as “excellent”.ABC quoted a “source familiar with the intelligence” as saying the US had provided “exquisite” intelligence and would help defend Israel as needed.Explore more on these topicsIsraelIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

That shift was echoed in foreign ministries and newsrooms around the world.“The fact that Israel attacked Iran doesn’t mean [the war in] Gaza ended. Today we had dozens of people killed, the only difference is this will have far less attention than yesterday,” said Xavier Abu Eid, a political scientist and former adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organisation.“Israel’s message [with these attacks] is that there is no political solution for anything in the region. By striking Iran they want to sabotage the US-Iran negotiations as well as the international wave of support for concrete measures on Palestine.”The decision by Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, to take out the security threat posed by Iran’s nuclear programme had also defanged a significant diplomatic and economic threat to his government.Some of Israel’s closest allies in Europe had become increasingly outspoken about both the impact of the war in Gaza on civilians, andescalating violence by Jewish settlersagainst Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.Even historically strong alliances with countries such as the Netherlands and Germany had been faltering in the face of an 11-week siege of Gaza, UN warnings of a looming famine and repeated mass killings of hungry crowds trying to reach food distribution sites.The EU last month announced a human rights review of its wide-ranging free trade deal with Israel, with findings originally expected at meeting of the bloc’s foreign affairs council later this month.Its recommendations could pave the way for Europe to potentially leverage its considerable economic power as Israel’s biggest trade partner, accounting for more than 30% of imports and exports.The UK, Canada, France and Norway this month imposed sanctionson two Israeli cabinet ministers “for their repeated incitement of violence against Palestinian civilians”, and warned other steps could follow.The Franco-Saudi summit on a two-state solution raised expectations that major European nations were preparing to unilaterally recognise a Palestinian state. It alarmed Israel and its allies in the US so much that Washington issued a formal diplomatic warningagainst attending.For now, at least, that sense of diplomatic momentum that might halt the war in Gaza has gone. Even governments that have become more openly critical of Netanyahu’s war in Gaza will be reluctant to press for its end while missiles from Tehran are killing people in Tel Aviv.“Its regrettable that these attacks come at a time when there were interesting developments [on Palestine and the war in Gaza],” said one western diplomat.Emmanuel Macron said the attacks on Iran should “in no way make us forget Gaza”, and told journalists that the summit was only delayed for pragmatic security reasons. It would go ahead as soon as possible, he said, but could not set a date.In Gaza many people were oblivious to the war and all the diplomatic manoeuvring it had set off, because one of the longest communications outages of the war had plunged much of the territory into isolation.Phone and internet networks were down from Wednesday because of damage to key fibre-optic cables, the UN said. “Since April, Israeli authorities have denied more than 20 requests to carry [urgent repair] work,” the UN aid coordination office said.That meant they could not see new evacuation orders posted by Israel’s military spokesperson, or warnings that the war in Gaza would continue “with extreme force”.They also could not access announcements from the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, the new US and Israeli backed organisation distributing some food in the strip from compounds guarded by the Israeli military.“We were ordered to stand down,” the GHF said in a statement to international press. “We have asked the IDF to facilitate the ongoing delivery of aid as soon as possible.”GHF uses only Facebook to communicate with Palestinians. So hungry, oblivious crowds approached centres on Saturday morning, as they had done since late May. Gunfire from Israeli soldiers killed at least 15 of them.Israeli attacks killed at least seven other people overnight, local health authorities said. There had been a decline in airstrikes, as the Israeli military shifted its focus to Iran. But on Friday an Israeli military spokesperson warned that operations there would continue “with extreme force” and on Saturday new evacuation orders were issued.“Famine worsens, the siege intensifies, and the dead are everywhere,” Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif wrote in a post on X, saying Gaza was “immersed in complete isolation from the world”.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIranBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

He said the plane went down seconds later.crash graphicSinha said that initial investigations showed the plane had reached a height of 650ft after takeoff, after which it began to descend rapidly and hit the ground in Meghani Nagar, 2km from Ahmedabad airport.The 227-tonne plane crashed into a hostel where medical students and their families were living.All but oneof the 242 people on board were killed in one of India’s worst aviation disasters in decades.The collision with the hostel also killed at least four student doctors and one doctor’s wife who was heavily pregnant, as well as several labourers and vendors working in the area.Indian aviation authorities would not be drawn into conjecture on the cause of the crash of the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, which has been the source of global speculation, but emphasised that “every theory going around about the crash will be looked at”.Sinha said the flight data recorder, known as the black box, had been recovered and was being looked into by investigators. A complete assessment of the incident would be completed within three months.Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu, the civil aviation minister, told the press briefing: “The decoding of this black box is going to give in-depth insight into what would have actually happened during the process of the crash.”A team of four UK aviation accident experts arrived in Ahmedabad, in the west Indian state of Gujarat, on Friday night to assist in the crash investigation.1:08‘I saw people dying in front of my eyes’: British survivor describes Air India crash – videoBy Saturday morning, the death toll had risen to at least 279, as investigators continued to comb through the wreckage and another body was recovered from beneath the wing of the plane. Families of the victims continued to gather at the Civil hospital in Ahmedabad where the dead were brought, as anger and frustration grew at the delay in handing over the bodies of their loved ones.Anil Patel, who lost his son Harshit, 30, and daughter-in-law Pooja, 28, in the crash, was increasingly agitated at the delay. He was among hundreds of relatives who had submitted DNA samples to help identify his son’s body but said he had received no information since.“We still don’t know exactly when we’ll get the body,” he said. He described his son and daughter-in-law as “all I had left” after his wife died of cancer six years ago. Harshit had moved to London two years ago but would video call his father every day.“Even yesterday, when I was sitting outside the postmortem block, I could smell the stench of charred bodies from inside,” said Patel. “It’s hard to accept that my son is also lying in there. I just want to bring them home soon. The longer they stay there, the more they’ll deteriorate. I just can’t bear the thought.”View image in fullscreenVehicles wait to transport the remains of the victims of the Air India crash in the compound of the Civil hospital in Ahmedabad, India.Photograph: Ajit Solanki/APRajnish Patel, additional medical superintendent at the hospital, confirmed that, more than 72 hours after the crash, only 11 DNA matches had been made identifying the dead and the remains of just three people had been handed back to their families.Authorities emphasised that the task of identifying people, whose bodies may have been heavily charred or dismembered from the force of the crash, was a complex task, slowing down the process of returning the victims to their families. Officials warned families that they may get their relatives’ remains in a “kit” rather than a coffin as many were in such a fragmented condition.“We are dealing with at least 250 samples, and for each match, we have to cross-verify it against this entire pool. It’s a process of elimination, and that naturally takes time,” said one official, speaking at the hospital, emphasising that the team at the hospital had been working through the night to accurately match the DNA to the bodies.For those who were waiting for the remains of multiple family members who died in the crash, they feared the handover could take several more days.The Syed family, including Javed Ali Syed, his wife, Mariam, and their two children, Zayn, five, and Amani, four, British citizens who lived in London and had been in Mumbai visiting family, were all among the dead. Javed’s distraught aunt and uncle had flown in from Mumbai to claim the bodies but said they had “no information from the hospital”.View image in fullscreenBritish citizens Javed Ali Syed, his wife, Mariam, both pictured, and their two children, Zayn, five, and Amani, four were among the dead.Photograph: FacebookMariam’s family originate from Pakistan, and so far they had not been allowed to travel to India to provide a DNA sample to identify her. They also wanted her and the children’s bodies brought back to the UK when they were finally handed over.“But we are worried, as we’ve been told the bodies are already badly deteriorated. If it takes even more days to get them to London, what will happen to them? How can we say goodbye in that state?” said Javed’s uncle Rafiq Ahmad.Thesole surviving passenger, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, whose escape from death was widely described as a “miracle” by experts, remained in hospital in Ahmedabad under observation but was said to be recovering.Dr Gameti, of Ahmedabad Civil hospital, said Ramesh was “doing very well and will be ready to be discharged anytime soon”.Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaAir transportPlane crashesSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The couple captured the happy time they had in India in a series of social media posts, including getting henna tattoos, shopping for fine fabrics and other gifts and driving through chaotic traffic in a tuk-tuk.They arrived in Ahmedabad just a day before flying back. Fiongal had posted in a video: “So, it’s our last night in India and we’ve had a magical experience. Some mind-blowing things have happened. We are going to put all this together and create a vlog.

Along with their parents, they both had a proclivity towards modernisation without changing traditional values.“Both my sisters know what is right and what is wrong, thus whatever work they carried out, in academics or fashion, they always got success with no conflicts amongst peers or seniors.”Renjitha Gopakumaran NairRenjitha Gopakumaran Nair was returning to the UK after a holiday to see family in her home country. The nurse and mother had just left her job at Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth, Hampshire, and is thought to have been in the UK for a year.Her former colleagues at the NHS hospital said she was a “beautiful lady” who showed her patients and co-workers “so much love and care”.Gopakumaran, said to be in her 40s, “had the biggest heart and brightest smile”, one former colleague said.Arjunbhai PatoliyaArjunbhai Patoliya, 37, had travelled to India from London to scatter the ashes of his late wife, Bharatiben Patel, in a river in the village that they both grew up in. She had died just three weeks earlier from cancer.The pair are survived by their two daughters,eight and four years old. The children had been left with Patel’s sister while their father flew to Vadiya in Gujarat. A close friend and neighbour of Patoliya told the Telegraph: “He is just like my son. He was a nice person, a very nice person. It’s an accident. I don’t know what to say, I’m speechless – such a lovely neighbour. He was such a lovely character, he looked after me as well from time to time.”Patoliya was a furniture designer and was described by the neighbour as being a “family” person who was very active in the community.Sayedmiya and Nafisabanu Inayatali, and their son, Waqueeali, 25, and daughter, Taskin, 22Sayedmiya Inayatali, 48, had flown over to India to visit his 90-year-old mother with his wife, Nafisabanu, 46, and their children.Shahid Vhora, 52, a relative, had texted the family before the flight to let them know he would pick them up at Gatwick when they arrived.He told Metro: “I can’t believe this has happened. I was preparing to pick them up. They had been visiting Sayedmiya’s mother.“They took a picture as they were about to board. They were so happy to be coming home … When I received the news of the crash I was devastated. We are a very close family, we all live together. My life has been torn apart.”Sayedmiya was an IT programmer who lived in Wembley with his family. Vhora described the family as “perfect” and very hard-working, adding that Taskin was studying to be a doctor and Waqueeali had been working in IT like his father.He said: “Sayedmiya and myself did everything together. We have had so many happy times. Now I have to go to India to try to sort things out.”Adnan MasterAdnan Master, 30, was visiting relatives in India with his wife and child. It is understood he was travelling back to London by himself; his family live in Forest Hill.A friend of Master told the Telegraph that he was “probably one of the nicest guys you’d ever meet”. They added that he had two jobs, both as a delivery driver and working in a DIY shop in east London.They said: “He was just one of the hardest-working people you’d ever meet. He just didn’t stop, and everything he did was for his family. Everything he spoke about was for his family: ‘I want to make my child have a good life.’”Vijay RupaniVijay Rupani, a former chief minister of Gujarat who led the state until 2021, was killed in the crash. A tribute was made to the member of the governing BJP party by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, who remembered Rupani as “simple and gentle in nature” and “hard-working”.View image in fullscreenVijay Rupani.Photograph: Mint/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesRupani was travelling back to London, where his family had planneda Father’s Day and religious celebration. The family has since travelled to India, the Guardian understands, and had met Modi.“I am not ready to accept that Vijaybhai is no more with us,” Modi said in a tribute on X. “We have worked shoulder to shoulder in many challenging times. Vijaybhai, who was simple and gentle in nature, was very hard-working and committed to the ideology of the party.”Panna NagarFor 15 years, Nagarwas headteacher of Northfleet nursery school in Kent. She is remembered by her grandchildren as “the heart of the family”.“She shaped our lives in more ways than we can count and she will be sorely missed,” said a Facebook post by her granddaughter Ciara Chudasama.A tribute from Northfleet nursery school remembered Nagar as more than just an educator.“She was a guiding light, an inspiration, and a champion for every child and staff member lucky enough to walk through her doors.”Ranjitha GopakumaranGopakumaran, 42, was returning to the UK where she worked as a nurse after a visit to her village in Kerala.She is remembered as “the brightest among all the children in our family”, her uncle Unnikrishnan Panthaplavil told Indian news outlet The Quint.Kinal MistryKinal Mistry, 24, was dropped off by her father at Ahmedabad airport, whenSuraj Mistry took a family photograph, not knowing it would be their lastas she promised to meet again soon.View image in fullscreenThe last family selfie taken of Suraj Mistry and his daughter Kinal Mistry at Ahmedabad airport.Photograph: Family handoutSpeaking at the Civil hospital in Ahmedabad, a tearful Mistry told the Guardian he remembered his daughter as “a wonder” and “beautiful, inside and out”.“She lit up every room with her smile, she could strike up a friendship with anyone,” he said. “That’s just who she was.”Prakash Lal MinarhiaPrakash Lal Minarhia had been working as a chef in London for 15 years. He had returned to India to perform rituals after the recent death of his father.Relativestold the Guardianon Friday that they still had not been able to bring themselves to inform his mother and wife, who remained in their village, about the crash.“Until we have his body, nothing is certain,” said Uday Lal Minarhia.Sahil Salim Ibrahim PatelPatel, from a small village in Gujarat, was en route to London for a dream scholarship that he believed would change his family’s life for ever.

It’s like we’ve been told what’s going to happen, rather than been consulted – it’s almost like being a child.”‘A slap in the face’: Grenfell officials still working in housing eight years after fireRead moreThe government announced earlier this year that the tower, which is being held up by steel props, would be dismantled to ground level owing to safety fears. At the time of the decision, the Grenfell United group said that the voices of the bereaved had been ignored by the deputy prime minister and housing secretary, Angela Rayner.Survivor David Benjamin, who was in his girlfriend’s flat on the fourth floor at the time of the fire, said that eight years on from the tragedy, he hoped that “people would remember that it wasn’t just a building – it was our home”.He said: “I knew it was going to come down eventually, but I would have preferred that it stayed up until we at least got some justice. I still live nearby and it’s hard to have to see it – I always take time to reflect. We see ourselves as family here. It’s important that we keep that up moving forward.”View image in fullscreenGrenfell Tower seen before a silent walk in memory of those killed in the fire in 2017.Photograph: James Manning/PAFive architecture practices have been shortlisted by the Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission to lead the memorial’s design. Survivor Antonio Roncolato, who lived on the 10th floor, said he worried that there would be a lag between the tower’s demolition and the new structure, which will bear the names of the 72 people, aged between six months and 82, who were killed.“I feel that the time has come for the tower to be taken down,” he said. “But for me it’s important there is a plan in place – that the tower is not dismantled and then the ground remains sealed off for a year. For me, it’s very important that events like this take place and that we keep breathing down the necks of our politicians to make sure that the recommendations from the public inquiry are implemented.”Throughout the day, residents dressed in green arrived to pay their respects at the foot of the tower, laying white roses and praying alongside multifaith leaders. Joe Powell, the Labour MP for Kensington and Bayswater, acknowledged that the loss of the tower would mean not “having that reminder every day that we still don’t have justice”.‘Grenfell was caused by corporate greed’: report calls for far stronger penalties over unsafe claddingRead moreCalling for a national oversight mechanism, which would ensure greater enforcement of public inquiry recommendations, he said: “We shouldn’t have any government marking their own homework, regardless of what political party they are. Inquiries are very traumatising to victims and if we don’t actually learn the lessons from them then you know that feels, to me, like a governance problem.”The Grenfell inquiry, which concluded last year, found that “Each and every one of the deaths that occurred in Grenfell Tower, on the 14 June 2017 was avoidable.”Explore more on these topicsGrenfell Tower fireLondonGrenfell Tower inquirynewsShareReuse this content"

They were sadly both confirmed deceased at the scene and their families have been informed.“Scene guards remain in place and inquiries are ongoing by the relevant agencies.”Anyone with information has been asked to contact police.A spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it was aware of the incident and its “thoughts are of course with the friends and family at this difficult time”.The CAA added: “We will work closely with the relevant authorities to understand what happened and are awaiting the report into the incident.”The national governing body, British Skydiving, said it would investigate and send a report to the coroner, police, the CAA, British Skydiving Safety and Training Committee and any other relevant authorities, the BBC reported.A statement from British Skydiving said: “British Skydiving has been notified of a tragic accident in which two jumpers lost their lives.“Our deepest condolences go to their families, friends and the entire skydiving community.”Dunkeswell aerodrome is a former RAF site located in the Blackdown Hills area, close to Devon’s border with Somerset.The aerodrome’s website said it was built and set up as an US naval base during the second world war and, at 839ft above sea level, is the highest licensed airfield in the UK.Skydiving deaths in the UK are statistically rare with tandem jumps being particularly safe.The British Parachute Association has previously said in the UK in the last 20-year block studied, from 2001-20, there were reportedly no tandem skydive fatalities.Explore more on these topicsDevonnewsShareReuse this content"

That is the right thing to do on the basis of what she has put in her audit,” he said. “I shall now implement her recommendations.”Asked to set out a timeline for the inquiry, Starmer said: “It will be statutory under the Inquiries Act. That will take a bit of time to sort out exactly how that works, and we will set that out in an orderly way.”Starmer has previouslyresisted pressure for a new national inquiryinto grooming gangs, and said earlier this year it would delay justice for victims. He called for ministers to instead focus on implementing the recommendations of previous reviews.Casey wasasked to carry out a three-month national reviewon the scale and extent of grooming gangs in January after producing a report into sexual abuse in Rotherham.She was tasked with examining data not available to the initialnational inquiry led by Alexis Jay, and to look into the ethnicity and demographics of abusers and victims, as well as “the cultural and societal drivers for this type of offending, including among different ethnic groups”.Starmer said on Saturday that Casey’s “position when she started the audit was that there was not a real need for a national inquiry”, but that she had changed her mind after reviewing the evidence.In parallel to Casey’s review, the government asked Tom Crowther KC, who led an investigation in Telford, to help devise a model for a series of similar investigations in five towns where girls were abused,including Oldham.Ministers came under pressure over grooming gangs last year afterElon Muskspotlightedthe government’s decision to refuse Oldham council’s request for a second national inquiry. The US billionaire’s flurry of tweets on the subject brought the scandal back into public consciousness.On Friday, seven men who groomed two vulnerable teenage girls in Rochdalewere found guilty of multiple sex offencesafter a long-running trial. The court heard the men subjected the girls to years of misery and expected them to have sex with them “whenever and wherever they wanted”.Casey’s 2015 review into the scandal in Rotherham said there had been an “archaic culture of sexism, bullying and discomfort around race”, with councillors and staff fearing being labelled racist if they mentioned the ethnicity of perpetrators.In response to the announcement of a new national inquiry, Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative party leader, said: “Keir Starmer doesn’t know what he thinks unless an official report has told him so … I’ve been repeatedly calling for a full national inquiry since January. It’s about time he recognised he made a mistake and apologise for six wasted months.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Preparation began on Friday morning, following Israel’s attack on Iran’s nuclear programme and its top military leadership.Asked whether the UK could be involved in helping Israel deflect retaliatory drone and missile strikes from Iran – which Tehran has said would make UK bases in the Middle East a target – the prime minister declined to say.What has Israel hit in Iran and who were the generals and nuclear scientists killed?Read more“These are obviously operational decisions and the situation is ongoing and developing and therefore I’m not going to get into the precise details,” he said. “But we are moving assets, we’ve already been moving assets to the region, including jets, and that is for contingency support across the region. So that is happening.”It is understood that, so far, theUK has not participated in any military actionand has not helped to knock out Iranian missiles targeted at Israel.Before leaving London, Starmer talked with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, Downing Street said, with both leaders stressing the need for calm.On the plane, Starmer said this had followed calls with President Emmanuel Macron of France, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, Netanyahu, and the US president.“I suspect that when we get to theG7there will be many other exchanges of views on an intense basis,” he went on. “We do have longstanding concerns about the nuclear programme that Iran has, and we do recognise Israel’s right to self-defence. But I am absolutely clear that this needs to de-escalate. There’s a huge risk to escalation for the region and more widely in terms of conflict. We have seen the impact already on the economy and oil prices.”Starmer also noted the conversation on Saturday between David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, and his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, in which Lammy urged calm.“We’re having ongoing discussions with our allies all of the time, both myself and David Lammy, as you’ve seen, who also spoke to the Iranians,” Starmer said. “Our constant message is de-escalate, and therefore everything we’re doing, all discussions we’re having are to do with de-escalation.”View image in fullscreenA building in Tehran that was hit by Israeli airstrikes.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPANo 10 has not yet set out if the UK was formally warned in advance of Israel’s strike. Asked about this, Starmer refused to say, while indicating there had been some prior knowledge.“I’m not going to go into what information we had at the time or since,” he said. “But we discuss these things intensely with our allies. But I’m not going to get into precisely what we knew, because it’s a constant flow of information between our allies, and between us and the US.”Starmer is flying first to Ottawa for bilateral talks with the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, before going on to the G7 venue in Kananaskis, in the western state of Alberta.Experts have warned that Iran’s threat to retaliate against the UK and its allies should be “taken seriously”, with Tehran countenancing actions that were “previously unthinkable”.Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow for Middle East security at the Royal United Services Institute, said the Iranian regime was in “survival mode” and wanted to shake off claims that it is a “paper tiger”.Ozcelik said that the prospect of Iran targeting UK, US and French assets would depend on its assessment of whether a diplomatic escape in the form of nuclear talks with the US is dead, and whether it believes it can absorb retaliation from western powers.Israel’s air might and Iran’s nuclear bunkers may make for lengthy conflictRead more“Iran’s options are limited but, feeling encircled, Tehran may assess it has no choice but to take risks that were previously unthinkable,” Ozcelik said. “This is why continued calls for de-escalation by the UK government matter. But diplomacy cannot come at the expense of preparedness; London will almost certainly pair its messaging with elevated military readiness, anticipating that Iran – under pressure and with fewer off-ramps – may resort to escalation either by design or miscalculation.”Marion Messmer, a senior research fellow in Chatham House’s international security programme, said the threats appeared to be “a pre-emptive warning” to the US, UK and France.“While Iran is unlikely to want to risk a broader escalation, the warning should be taken seriously,” she said. “Though Israel is an ally of the UK, France and US, it is the stronger party in this conflict. There doesn’t appear to be any immediate need of military support for Israel and a further escalation of the conflict isn’t in anyone’s interest.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsIsraelIranKeir StarmerG7CanadaBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

Some of the 62 said they had hadsuicidal thoughts because of the pressure exerted by the telecoms group– while many claimed the company’s actions made them fear they would lose their livelihoods, homes or life savings after running up personal debts of more than £100,000.Vodafone, which says the legal claim is worth £85.5m, has consistently argued the case is “a complex commercial dispute between Vodafone UK and some franchise partners and we refute the claims”.Responding to news that the 12 current franchisees are having their contracts terminated, a Vodafone spokesperson said: “We are focused on building a successful and thriving franchise programme. As a result, we have a clear duty to do everything we can to support those franchise partners who are committed to our joint success.“The dispute has been ongoing for over two years and a number of the claimants have remained within the franchise programme and had their contracts renewed during that time. However, we are increasingly concerned about the impact negative campaigning is having on our franchise programme.”The spokesman added: “After careful consideration, and with disappointment, we therefore decided it was no longer viable for us to work with franchise partners who are supporting the negative campaign against the business.”A franchise is a type of licence that allows a company to sell a product or service under another business’s brand name, in return for paying certain costs such as rent and wages. As part of their deals, Vodafone franchisees were paid commissions based on the handset and airtime revenues they generated from customers visiting their stores.The court papers allege that the FTSE 100 company acted in “bad faith” by unilaterally cutting fees to its franchisees; imposing swingeing fines on them totalling thousands of pounds for seemingly minor administrative errors; and then pressuring them into taking out loans and government grants to keep their businesses afloat.Vodafone said it strongly refutes that the company “unjustly enriched” itself and said it had conducted a number of investigations into the allegations, which resulted in the company making “a number of improvements to our franchise partner programme”.The group’s investigations “concluded that some actions between Vodafone and franchise partners had not always adhered to the standards we expect, however no evidence of misconduct was found”. The mobile operator has added that it had paid back almost £5m to franchisees including the “retrospective reimbursement of fines and clawbacks”.It has since emerged that, two years before the high court claim was launched,whistleblowers had warned a series of senior Vodafone executivesthat scores of its franchised store owners faced financial ruin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Variations on the menu include Jamaican jerk chicken with guava jam, brown sugar bacon doused in ranch dressing, and Granny Smith apple slices coated in brie and mozzarella.But the sandwich shop offers more than elevated comfort food. All Square, which also operates a food-truck catering service, exclusively hires formerly incarcerated Minnesotans.“It started with the idea of: how do we respond to this systemic issue of excluding formerly incarcerated folks from, well, everything once we welcome them home?” said Emily Hunt Turner, a civil rights lawyer who founded the restaurant in 2018.The name All Square refers to the shape of the grilled cheese sandwich as well as the idea that those who served their time deserve a chance to restart their lives with a clean slate.Hunt Turner, 41, said she built the menu around grilled cheese in part because the relatively low overhead allows her to focus on her true mission: supporting people coming home from prison.Each year, Hunt Turner and her team hire five full-time fellows who were recently released from prison. Over the next year, those workers cook, clean and serve tables, earning up to $23 per hour, including tips.View image in fullscreenA grilled cheese sandwich at All Squared.Photograph: Ackerman + GruberWhen they’re not working at the restaurant, the fellows have access to a host of services, including therapy and workshops aimed at helping them launch their own businesses.Taqee Abdul-Hakim, a fellow from the 2022 class, began working at the restaurant just one month after he was released from prison. He said the free therapy sessions helped clear his mind and dream bigger. The weekly paychecks allowed him to find an apartment and provide for his two young children, even enrolling one in gymnastics. Just as importantly, he said, flipping sandwiches with other formerly incarcerated people helped him stay out of trouble.“I needed to reshape my friend group after I got out,” Abdul-Hakim said. “At All Square, it was nice to have those types of friends who are in the same position as me, who have been through it but trying to better our lives at the same time.”She earned $20 doing laundry for a friend. Now this entrepreneur washes 7,000lb a monthRead moreAll Square is part of a broader social enterprise of the same name. The non-profit, which has 25 employees and a $3m annual operating budget, also runs a law firm that provides services to justice-impacted Minnesotans and helps incarcerated people train in the law.Hunt Turner founded All Square after working as an attorney for the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, where she saw first-hand how difficult it was for people with criminal histories to access housing.“We were getting complaints from all over the country where folks were saying they’re being discriminated against on the basis of having a criminal record,” she said. “This kind of perpetual punishment is not something we can turn away from.”Anestimated70 million Americans, about one in three adults, has an arrest or conviction on their record. They facehigh rates of homelessnessand steep barriers to employment. One in three formerly incarcerated people isunemployed, according to federal statistics, and being without a jobdoubles the oddsof returning to prison.View image in fullscreenJuliet takes an order from customers at All Squared on 15 May 2025.Photograph: Ackerman + Gruber“We heard a lot from fellows that outstanding debt – child support arrears, student loan debt, traffic citations – can be such a barrier to starting over,” Turner said. “So we established a debt-alleviation fund that dispenses up to $2,000 in debt relief as they transition to the next chapter of their lives.”To build the restaurant, Turner raised $250,000 from a Kickstarter campaign and a Minneapolis Foundation grant; she also sold a few dozen $1,000 memberships to the “Grilled Cheese for Life” club. Revenues from the restaurant support the organization’s other operations.“The magic ingredient of All Square is that it’s not dependent on fundraising or donors,” said Bruce Reilly, a founding board member of the organization and an advocate for the formerly incarcerated. “People might not write you a $1,000 check, but they might come buy a sandwich every day for the next 10 years.”The sandwiches are a hit, but some local groups question whether All Square is the best vehicle to support the Black and brown communities that are disproportionately involved with the justice system.“Because it’s not founded or directed by justice-impacted people, it’s not equipped to help our community through re-entry,” said Kevin Reese, co-founder and co-executive director of the local organization Until We Are All Free.Turner said the issue of representation and privilege is something the organization wrestles with constantly as it expands in size and ambition. “From our perspective, broad-based support and allyship are vital to forging social movements,” she said.The program has graduated 56 fellows and provided $130,000 in debt relief and seed capital, Turner said. Graduates have gone on to launcha coffee importerand a custom grills shop, among other enterprises.Abdul-Hakim, the 2022 fellow, used a $10,000 seed capital grant from All Square to launch a towing company, Mow-Tow. In addition to earning a living wage at the restaurant, he said the fellowship taught him how to create a business plan and build up his credit.“If I didn’t come across All Square, to be honest, I don’t think I’d be down the path I’m on now,” he said.Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisThe New Face of Small BusinessMinnesotaUS prisonsFoodEntrepreneursSmall businessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It means Mercedes’s Russell and defending champion Verstappen will line up on the front row together,a fortnight after their collision in Spain.Formula One: Mercedes’ Russell snatches pole for Canadian grand prix – as it happenedRead moreTheRed Bulldriver Verstappen accelerated into Russell and was demoted from fifth to 10th by the stewards at the Circuit de Barcelona. He was also hit with three penalty points which leaves him one point away from a race ban.Moments after he landed his second pole in as many years in Montreal, Russell joked of his rivalry with Verstappen: “We are mates so we are all good. I’ve got a few more points on my licence to play with, so let’s see.”But when the subject arose in the post-qualifying press conference, Verstappen did not see the funny side. “I don’t need to hear it again,” he said. “It is really pissing me off. You speaking about it on Thursday, it is such a waste of time. It is very childish.“I don’t want to say too much because it is really annoying this world that we live in.”Russell insisted earlier this week that Verstappen’s attempts to “scare” him in Barcelona did not work and he believes a ban for the Dutch driver – if he reaches 12 points – would be justified. On Saturday, Russell said: “I don’t think any driver goes out there looking to crash into somebody and get penalty points on their licence. Max is one of the best and there is no reason for him to race any differently.“But I am not sitting here thinking he will give me more room but probably the opposite to prove a point so I will keep an eye on that. We are here to win and we will not do something which jeopardises the race.”Norris is 10 points behind Piastri and his championship challenge has been derailed by errors in qualifying. He made another two in Montreal when it came to the crunch, aborting the final right-left chicane on his first run in Q3 and then grazing the wall on the exit of Turn 7 with his last effort to leave him seven tenths off the pole pace and four places and half-a-second behind Piastri in the otherMcLaren.“It is a very easy track to push 1% too much and pay the price – and that’s what happened today,” said Norris. “Mistakes have cost me. A podium will be tough because we don’t have the pace we have had of the past few races. I am not as confident as in other places but I am confident we can go forward but it will be a struggle.”Kimi Antonelli will line up from fourth for Mercedes, one place ahead of Ferrari’s Lewis Hamilton. Charles Leclerc made an error on his last lap and is eighth on the grid.View image in fullscreenLando Norris endured a frustrating afternoon in Montreal.Photograph: Christopher Katsarov/APMeanwhile, Derek Warwick has been suspended from his role as a driver steward in Montreal as a result of “recent unauthorised media comments”, the FIA announced. The 70-year-old former driver’s suspension follows remarks circulated by a gambling platform about a variety of matters including the 10-second penalty given to Verstappen at the Spanish Grand Prix.The FIA confirmed that Enrique Bernoldi, who raced for the ArrowsFormula Oneteam, will replace Warwick in Montreal, but added: “After discussion, Derek acknowledges that his comments were ill-advised in his role as an FIA steward and has apologised.

Here’s what the settlement does and what’s nextBryan Armen GrahamSat 14 Jun 2025 04.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 04.32 EDTShareCollege athletes spent decades fighting for the right to make money from their name, image and likeness (NIL). In 2021,they won. Now, a $2.8bn NCAA settlement is set to compensate hundreds of thousands of current and former athletes who missed out on those earnings. But not everyone thinks the deal is fair.Eight female athletesfiled an appeal this week, arguing the agreement violates Title IX, the US law banning sex-based discrimination in education. They say the way the money is divided, largely favoring football and men’s basketball players, shortchanges women by more than $1bn.Their appeal has paused all back payments, potentially delaying them for more than a year. However, the NCAA’s new plan to allow schools to pay current players directly starting 1 July will still go ahead.So what does this all mean for athletes as well as the future of college sports? Here’s what’s going on …What is the NCAA settlement about?The NCAA agreed to pay $2.8bn to compensate athletes who were previously barred from earning income off their name, image, and likeness (NIL), including things like video game appearances, jersey sales, or social media sponsorships. The settlement covers athletes going back to 2016.It also clears the way for a major change: beginning 1 July 2025, colleges will be allowed to directly share revenue with current players, up to $20.5 million per school per year.It’s a major shift from the NCAA’s traditional amateurism model, which argued that athletes should only be compensated with scholarships, not salaries or endorsement income.Who’s appealing the deal and why?Eight female athletes who competed in soccer, volleyball, and track have filed an appeal. Their names include Kacie Breeding (Vanderbilt) and Kate Johnson (Virginia), along with six athletes from the College of Charleston.They argue the deal violates Title IX, the federal law that bans sex-based discrimination in education. Specifically, they say the settlement gives up to 90% of the money to men in football and basketball, depriving women of $1.1bn in rightful compensation.What is Title IX and how does it apply here?Title IX is a 1972 US law requiring equal access and treatment for men and women in federally funded education programs, including athletics. Colleges must offer comparable resources, scholarships and participation opportunities across men’s and women’s sports.The female athletes argue that since NIL bans affected both genders equally, compensation for those bans must also be equitable, and that using historical TV revenue (which favors men’s sports) ignores systemic barriers women have faced in marketing and media exposure.What did the judge say about the Title IX argument?US district judge Claudia Wilken approved the settlement last week and rejected Title IX-based objections, saying they fell outside the scope of the antitrust case. The female athletes disagree and are now asking the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to intervene.View image in fullscreenThe UNC Tar Heels celebrate a December win against the Wake Forest Demon Deacons at WakeMed Soccer Park in Cary, North Carolina.Photograph: Ryan Hunt/Getty ImagesWhat happens to the money in the meantime?Because of the appeal, no back pay will be distributed until the court rules. That delay could last several months or longer. According to the NCAA’s lead attorney, the organization will continue funding the settlement pool, but the money will sit untouched until the case is resolved.Why is most of the money going to men’s football and basketball players?The current payout formula is based on historical media revenue and licensing data. Because football and men’s basketball generated the majority of money for schools – especially through TV contracts – those athletes stand to receive the most compensation.Critics say that approach bakes in decades of inequality, because women were denied the same marketing exposure and investment in the first place.What are the broader concerns about this settlement?Some worry that schools will cut so-called “non-revenue” sports – like wrestling, swimming or gymnastics – to fund revenue-sharing with top athletes. Others fear this pushes college sports closer to a professional minor league system, undermining education and competitive balance. Still others say that without clear Title IX guidance, women may continue to be marginalized even in a post-amateurism era.What happens next?The Ninth Circuit will now review the appeal. Briefs are due by 3 October, and while both sides say they’ll push for speed, appeals in this court have been known to take 12 to 18 months.Until the case is resolved, no back payments will be made to athletes who played between 2016 and 2021. But the revenue-sharing era is coming, whether or not the NCAA is ready for it.Explore more on these topicsCollege sportsNCAACollege footballCollege basketballGymnasticsUS sportsexplainersShareReuse this content"

Since then he has played 751 games for the club, scoring 248 goals, while also scoring 45 goals in 131 games forGermany. He has won 13 Bundesliga titles, two Champions Leagues and a World Cup. He will retire at the end of the Club World Cup after a career played entirely at the highest level and yet still nobody has been able to quite work out what he is.Is he a centre-forward? Is he a false 9? Is he a wide forward, a second striker, an attacking midfielder? Is he all of those things, none of those things or some of those things some of the time? Louis van Gaal loved him; Pep Guardiola never seemed quite so sure.Thomas Müller: the modest assassin | Uli HesseRead moreMüller is not especially quick, not especially dominant in the air and does not beat players with close technical skill, but he is obviously a player of the highest level. Then there’s his puzzling goals record: how did a player who averaged roughly a goal every three games managed not only to win theGolden Boot at the 2010 World Cupbut also the Silver Boot at the following tournament? (Even odder is that the five goals he scored in South Africa were his only international goals that year.) The best explanation of Müller perhaps came from his own mouth. “I am aRaumdeuter,” he said in 2011 – an interpreter of space.He has that capacity a great goalscorer, a Gerd Müller or a Gary Lineker, has to anticipate where the ball will drop, but he is not a poacher. He has the ability of a Luka Modric or a Xavi to find space in a hectic midfield, but he is not a playmaker.Raumdeuterhas become such an accepted phrasethat it is a role that can be assigned to forwards on the video game Football Manager. It is not entirely clear whether Müller was making a joke when he said it.Müller’s football may be hard to identify, but it is nothing to his sense of humour. Whenhe claimedthat Robert Lewandowski’s nickname was “Robert Lewangoalski”, before pausing, nodding and opening his eyes wider as though imploring people to laugh, it initially seemed he was making an inexplicably bad joke. Then the thought occurred that he perhaps knew that and the joke was actually how inane is a lot of football’s banter culture.View image in fullscreenBayern fans display a banner in support of Müller marking his 25th anniversary at the club.Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/ReutersAt that moment, the entire notion of the press conference seemed in danger of imploding under the weight of its own futility. This was Eric Morecambe, it was Larry David, it was Stewart Lee, a ludic recklessness with form that not only managed to be funny by not being funny, but interrogated the entire notion of funny.It is the same with his coinage ofRaumdeuter, which is itself a pun, albeit a rather better one that Goalandowski.Traumdeuteris German for an interpreter of dreams, a term popularised by Sigmund Freud.Traumis derived from the Old Icelandicdraumrvia the Middle High Germantroumand initially meant phantom or illusion. The English “dream”, which emerged in the 12th century, shares the same root.Deutercomes originally from proto-Indo-Europeantē̌u-, which meant something like “swell”; it’s also the root of words such as thumb, thigh and thousand. More appositely, it is the origin ofþeuðō, an early Germanic term meaning a lot of people, that came to be used to mean tribe. A couple of thousand years ago, if you spoke the demotic language as opposed to Latin, you were in effect said to be speakingþiudiskaz– that is,þeuðō-ish –which over time evolved to becomeDeutsch.Deutenbecame a verb meaning to make clear for the mass of the people. That sense remains indeutlich– clearly, significantly – oreindeutig– clearly, obviously; and, to a lesser extent inbedeuten– to mean.Deutenitself is slightly more sophisticated thanziegen– to show – but not as scientific asinterpretierenoranalysieren: to interpret, not in the sense of translating, but of explaining.With that context, Müller’s apparently unremarkable statement that he is aRaumdeutercan be seen not only as a description of what he is, but of what he is not. He is not a player who deals in phantoms, illusions and dreams; he is a pragmatist. He sees space – better than almost anybody else of his generation – and through his movement, his assists and his goals he explains it to the mass of the people: those watching it in the stands or on television who do not have his extraordinary grasp of the shape and dynamics of the game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Müller, in his own way, was just as central to Germany’sfourth World Cup successas Beckenbauer was to its second.View image in fullscreenThomas Müller (centre) scores Germany’s third goal against England in the last 16 of the 2010 World Cup.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIn those Jogi Löw sides of 2010 and 2014, he was the attacking brain of the side, the player who ensured the counterattacks were devastating. After finding space in a crowd box to head the first goalin the semi-final in 2014, it was Müller, revelling in the chaos of the Brazilian meltdown, who orchestrated the 7-1.Müller retires as the joint-most successful German player in terms of trophies won, although he would edge ahead of Toni Kroos were Bayern to lift the Club World Cup. But more than that, Müller defined not only a position but an entire, and idiosyncratically German, way of thinking about the game. He is the embodiment of the process that brought the World Cup.Explore more on these topicsBayern MunichInside footballGermanyFootball tacticscommentShareReuse this content"

At first, standard protocol was observed for uncategorised piles of paper. The 21 City Ground programmes, spanning 50 years from September 1963 to November 2012, were packed away in a dark cupboard, ignored and unread. But finally taking the time to study them has paid dividends: a rich seam of history leaps off the pages in clear, elegant black-and-white type.A charmer and a stickler: Jeremy Alexander was a Guardian sport mainstay for 57 years | Matthew EngelRead moreForest’s presence in the top-flight’s upper echelons evoked the club’s halcyon days and plenty has been written about the Brian Clough-Peter Taylor era. Less attention has focused on Clough’s often entertaining programme notes during his 18-year tenure – while the editions outside Clough’s time are a fascinating way of charting Forest’s trajectory, as well as how profoundly football and wider society have changed.For West Ham’s visit in September 1963, pre-decimalisation, the programme cover price is 6d (2.5p). “Some of their players have established themselves in the International field,” reads the section on the visitors. “Bobby Moore is holding the right-half berth for England … others with not so familiar names at the moment, but with the right sort of ability, include inside-forward Geoff Hurst.”Prescient player profiles aside, the 60s adverts may be the most interesting element. “If your party runs into hundreds ask for a special train,” reads a message from British Railways, encouraging football fans to charter their own services for away days. “Commission paid on full train loads for a guaranteed number of passengers.” What chance of that now? The back page advertises the latest in cars: “Meet the new Hillman Imp – an inspiration in light car design. Accelerates from 0-50 m.p.h. in 15.5 seconds.”View image in fullscreen‘Meet the new Hillman Imp – an inspiration in light car design’Onwards to 1972, on 23 September, the back page of Forest Review is given over to Player’s No 6: “The most popular filter cigarette in Britain.” Edward Heath’s Conservative government had reached an agreement with the tobacco industry the previous year and the message at the bottom – “Every packet carries a government health warning” – was a recent, significant development.Leading from the front, meanwhile, is an appeal from the chair, Ken Smales, urging supporters to buy a copy of the 1972 Nottingham Forest Annual. “At only 15p it is certainly not a profit-making venture, but an honest effort by the club to inform the fan of some of our activities,” Smales writes. (Formerly a first-class cricketer for Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, Smales would give more than 35 years of service to Forest.)View image in fullscreenNottingham Forest v West Ham, September 1963, featuring a British Railways advert inviting fans to charter special services for away matches.On to 1979-80, the season of Forest’s second European Cup triumph, with the Clough era at its peak. The quality of the side facing Brighton on 17 November is certainly notable: Shilton, Anderson, Gray, McGovern, Lloyd, Needham, O’Neill, Bowles, Birtles, Francis, Robertson. The sole substitute is listed as “To be announced”, which thelate Guardian writer Jeremy Alexander– who donated the programmes – has crossed out and replaced with “Bowyer”. Despite their strength Forest were beaten 1-0 by the club Clough had left in 1974 for his brief spell at Leeds.View image in fullscreenViv Anderson enjoys a game of snooker with his fiancee, Debra, in 1983.On Saturday 19 April – less than six weeks before Forest defeated Hamburg at the Bernabéu for that second European Cup – they welcomed Derby; a player of the year voting slip is still tucked inside. Clough is pictured cheerily accepting a large bottle from the director of Bell’s Whisky, his manager of the month prize for March.Clough’s fondness for drink becomes still more apparent. With Watford the visitors in September 1982, a “friendly bet” between the manager and Scotland’s John Robertson is relayed to readers. “I bet I can do without a drink longer than you can do without a cigarette,” Clough told the winger. Hard to imagine a modern Premier League manager doing anything similar.“I like the chairman,” declares Clough of Elton John for that meeting with Graham Taylor’s Watford. “Those people who thought his presence as a figure head was something of a gimmick have been made to eat their words.” There is also a profile of the winger Calvin Plummer (Dislikes: Smoking, traffic jams), who toured apartheid South Africa that same year.View image in fullscreenBrian Clough previews a 1989 meeting with Arsenal.“At Home With Viv Anderson” is the most engaging feature for the meeting with QPR in September 1983: the future Arsenal and Manchester United full-back is pictured enjoying a game of snooker on his new table. “I must admit I enjoy having a table in the home,” Anderson said. “Although the novelty has worn off a bit, it’s a good way to relax.”Towards the end of the decade Clough’s irreverent style has developed further. “Poor old Bella Lugosi [sic] would have turned in his grave if he had seen our performance against Arsenal here last season,” he writes in September 1989 for the Gunners’ visit. “For any thick bonses [sic] who don’t know who Bella Lugosi was – he used to be a horror movie actor. And a good one at that!”View image in fullscreenThe late Nigel Doughty on the cover of a City Ground programme in 2012.Moving through the 2000s the programmes become shinier and more colourful but considerably less attractive. With Forest struggling on and off the pitch, the calibre of players on display declines accordingly.Poignantly, the final cover of the collection is a full-page picture of Nigel Doughty, published for the first home game after the Forest owner’s death in 2012. A tribute from the chief executive, Mark Arthur, reveals that Doughty, a Labour supporter, had often feared it was morally wrong to plough cash into a football club when there are “so many other worthwhile causes”.With football ever-more fuelled by vast amounts of money, Doughty’s social conscience feels more needed today – and is harder to come by among the current crop of football club owners. It’s also an example of the kind of historical perspective – along with the simple nostalgic thrill – brought by dusting off a pile of old matchday programmes.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestBrian CloughfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even as a 15-year-old the playmaker was ambitious, knowing his talent would take him to the top. He might have expected to reach the Premier League earlier but he is ready to take the next steps atManchester City.Vulliez worked at Lyon for 12 years and from the moment he witnessed an eight-year-old Cherki he knew the club had a glorious talent on their hands. This week Citypaid £30.5m for the France international, who could make his debut against Wydad AC on Wednesday at the Club World Cup. Lyon’s academy coaches were soon gossiping about the two-footed generational talent who dribbled past opponents, created chances and plundered goals in the youth setup.Beyond the apathy: the Manchester City and Chelsea fans off to the Club World CupRead more“He was a special player when he was young because he was able to play with both feet,” Vulliez says. “He loves football and he loves to play. I think it’s special because he just wants to play football and challenge opponents, one against one, one against two, and score goals. When he was young it was very amazing because his technical level was very high and he’s able to do many things with the ball.”Coaches would set drills for Cherki but he put his own spin on things because his technical ability was above that of his peers, powered by self-confidence as he made his way as a throwback to the mavericks of yesterday. He felt the need to show off and those trying to impart knowledge could not be too upset that he disobeyed orders by turning a finishing session into something akin to performance art, scoring from crosses with tricks and flicks, when the others were doing their best to sidefoot the ball home.Aged 15 – and playing four year groups up – Cherki was part of a talentedLyonUefa Youth League side that beat Manchester City 4-1 in England, helped by his coming off the bench to score. Lyon realised he had outgrown the academy and pushed him to play with the first team aged 16. The talent was there but Cherki, a viral sensation thanks to clips of his balletic qualities, did not immediately know how to utilise it effectively in Ligue 1.Manchester United were rumoured to be keen at that time and Lyon had to fight hard to keep Cherki, requiring the then president, Jean-Michel Aulas, to convince him his hometown club was the best place for him. Many clubs have kept an eye on Cherki, including tracking his stats and highlights reels, but it has taken almost six years since his first-team debut for the playmaker to be lured across the Channel. There was some concern at Lyon about the size of Cherki’s entourage and whether they provided a distraction. Many close to him wanted to push through an earlier exit but Lyon insisted he stayed until this summer despite offers in January.View image in fullscreenCherki is with his new teammates at the Club World Cup.Photograph: Marco Bello/ReutersAs a natural entertainer, Cherki was eager to show his flamboyance in the first team but he needed to work out how to utilise his skills and make more right decisions than wrong against experienced opponents. He has learned from the early mistakes, his goal contributions improving each season.“He was very resilient because he was very young,” says Vulliez. “Adidas was his sponsor and everybody talked about him on social media. It was difficult for him because when he started in the first team he was not very efficient because he played like a young player in the professional league and so he failed. Sometimes the fans smashed him so it was difficult for him but he was always focused on training and on football.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They taught him and he learned a lot with them and I think it was great for him because I think in Lyon he found a balance with his family and with the players inside the professional team who can teach him. He needed three or four years to become a great player like today.”Pep Guardiola has shaken things up at City in recent months, signing eight players as he attempts to revitalise the team, withRayan Aït-Nouri and Tijjani Reijndersamong others hoping to make their debut in the US. Cherki’s ability to beat opponents in tight spaces and create chances made him an obvious candidate to reinvigorate and ignite a team that often looked short of ideas in the final third in the past season. Cherki can play anywhere in Guardiola’s front four, having often been utilised as a central striker in his youth, but his favoured role is No 10. He scored 12 goals and created 20 for Lyon during the past season, which is encouraging news for Erling Haaland.“It was a long time but now the maturity is coming, psychological maturity, and now I think he’s a new player and it’s a big step now for him,” says Vulliez. “Last season was a big step and the new season will be a very big step at Manchester City.” Cherki is still chasing those dreams and together he and City could achieve some ambitious objectives.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityClub World CupLyonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His switch to Spurs feels like a break-up but we wish him wellSat 14 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 08.09 EDTShareDon’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened.Thomas Frank is no longer Brentford’s managerand that’s not easy to write. We knew the day was drawing near but it’s still a bitter pill to swallow. It feels like a break-up, a one-sided one where we do not get the chance to ask why and how. And the grief supporters are experiencing is because we were so emotionally invested in a partnership that brought us so much joy in the near seven years we had together.Rewind to October 2018, when Frank was appointed as Dean Smith’s successor, and not many of us would have thought we would now be looking forward to a fifth campaign in the top flight. There is much to be grateful to Frank and his team for. They brought us the fabled BMW (Saïd Benrahma, Bryan Mbeumo and Ollie Watkins); theybroke our playoff hoodooat the 10th time of asking to take us to the Premier League; they set club records and beat some of the best teams in the land. It really has been quite the ride.Friday 13 August 2021; Brentford took on Arsenal under the lights, with television cameras broadcasting our first game in the Premier League. Frank made his entrance, arms waving, urging fans young and old to bring the noise. They delivered, as did the team.We had announced our arrival with a 2-0 win, and we’ve not been lower than 16thsince, which is some achievement for a side expected to go straight back down.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank celebrates with the home crowd after Brentford’s 2-0 win over Arsenal in August 2021 – their first game in the Premier League.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockFrank would often bring up the “we’re just a bus stop in Hounslow” chant in our early years back in the top division. It was self-deprecating, a way to take ownership of how QPR supporters had mocked us a few years before, and its use by the manager showed he got it and he got us. Likewise we got him. That bond came from the culture cultivated at the club. A them-against-us mentality. We do not have the financial riches many in the Premier League have so we have had to do things differently in order to compete; using data as well as traditional methods to scout the lower leagues for the next big thing. We were also one of the first clubs in the top flight to employ a set-piece coach and a throw-in coach. It’s theBrentfordway; a method of finding an edge. We cannot challenge the giants in wealth or stature but we can be smarter than them.Hence Frank working out pretty quickly that the brand of football that got us promoted was not going to work in the Premier League. Certainly not straight away. So in the first few years after coming up we played a dogged style, balls over the top to maximise the strengths of Ivan Toney. Yet one of Frank’s biggest assets is his ability to adapt, to mix things up. So in more recent seasons we have pressed from the front but, when the occasion has required it, also sat back and waited for our chance to counterattack. What has always remained, though, is hard work right across the team. That comes from the manager.Belief is another of Frank’s strengths. He puts trust in his players and they repay him with performances on the pitch. For instance, when Toney was not named in the England squad for the last World Cup in Qatar, the very next game he scored a brace against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium toearn us a much-deserved win. The conversations around the importance of Toney to us and not England, instigated by Frank, would no doubt have been key to ensuring there was fire in the striker’s belly.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank developed strong relationships with his players, including Ivan Toney who thrived under the Dane before his departure to Saudi Arabia last year.Photograph: Nigel French/PAAnd when Toney left for Saudi Arabia last summer,the Brazilian Igor Thiago came in as his replacement. But he got injured in pre-season so someone else was required to fill the No 9 role. Up stepped Yoane Wissa with 19 goals, his best league return, alongside tributes to the love and support Frank had shown him in the buildup to the campaign. It was, from Wissa, a clear testament to the very human qualities of the man in charge.A manager’s lifespan is now around two years. We were never meant to have almost seven with Frank. So what was intended to be a short-term relationship with no strings attached became long term and meaningful. It is also now at an end. We were not ready to say goodbye, not with so much still to be achieved.It will also take some time getting used to not seeing Frank in the home dugout, and it will be even stranger to see him in that of another team. Take care of him, Tottenham – and thanks for the memories, Thomas.Natalie Sawyer is a broadcaster and lifelong Brentford supporter.Explore more on these topicsBrentfordThomas FrankTottenham HotspurcommentShareReuse this content"

The world’s top two players slipped to an 8-4 second round defeat at the Eissporthalle in Frankfurt, where Martin Schindler and Ricardo Pietreczko made the most of the backing of a partisan home crowd to seal a comprehensive victory.Littler and Humphries,who both received MBEsin King Charles’s birthday honours, were made to pay for missed doubles, with the 18-year-old in particular turning in an off-colour display in a country where he has endured previous disappointments.A delighted Schindler, who had insisted in advance that the English duo were “beatable”, told Sky Sports: “I was right because we believed in ourselves. We have been putting in a solid performance, and obviously the double 16s from Ricardo just went in, so we are very happy to go through. Today was one step and tomorrow is the other. That’s it.”Booed by the home crowd, Littler started nervously and the Germans took the first two legs, but his 123 check-out put England on the board before a 64 finish levelled it up at 2-2.Gary Oldman and Roger Daltrey knighted in king’s birthday honoursRead moreHowever, the teenager missed three darts at a double in the fifth leg to allow Pietreczko to win it with a 106 out-shot, and another in the sixth as the Germans restored their advantage. And after Humphries had hit 25 rather than bull going for 122, they went in at the break 5-2 ahead.Pietreczko took out 101 after the resumption before Germany went 7-2 up and although Littler and Humphries took the next two, they eventually succumbed as a return of just four doubles from the 11 chances they created ultimately proved costly.Germany’s reward is a quarter-final against Australia, who routed Argentina 8-1 with Damon Heta and Simon Whitlock proving too strong for Jesus Salate and Victor Guillin despite missing 21 of their 29 attempts at doubles.Gerwyn Price and Jonny Clayton secured Wales’ passage with a resounding 8-2 win over the Philippines. The Welsh pair, who claimed the crown in 2020 and 2023, powered their way through to a last-eight tie against Hong Kong with the minimum of fuss despite the first three legs going against the darts.However, Scotland’s Peter Wright and Gary Anderson found themselves on the wrong end of a demolition job as they went down 8-0 to the Netherlands in just 15 minutes. Danny Noppert and the world youth champion, Gian van Veen, who took out 130 to claim the fourth leg on Scotland’s throw, were in inspired form, averaging 100.2 and converting eight of the 12 darts they had at doubles to breeze through to a meeting with the Czech Republic.William O’Connor and Keane Barry eased the Republic of Ireland to a showdown against neighbouring Northern Ireland with an 8-3 victory over Switzerland in which they were always in control.Northern Ireland were comfortable winners over South Africa as Josh Rock and Daryl Gurney eased them to an 8-2 success. Elsewhere, there were wins for the Czechs over Malaysia and Hong Kong against Sweden.Explore more on these topicsDartsLuke HumphriesLuke LittlernewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, getting penalised against.Russell inspires Bath to Premiership title despite late Leicester fightbackRead more“That was a strategical point for us to try and dominate there and in mauls as well. That was completely nullified, it cost us field position. I think with three minutes to go it was nine penalties to two. It is impossible to manage a field position scenario with that outcome.“I’ll always have a slightly biased lens, but I don’t believe we were that much more foul than them. It was frustrating to say the least.”He said he would seek official clarification about Cole’s yellow card and some of the scrum calls. “If the game is sending players to the sin-bin for that … what do I say? If I say something, I’ll get myself in strife and take away from the other team. I just have to beat myself up inside and try and keep as much as I can inside.“They won the competition and they deserve it. I’ve got my feelings on the referee’s performance, but I’ll take that up with the head of refereeing.”Cole was in tears at the end of his final game before retirement. Cheika is also moving on after one season, but pronounced himself “very proud” with his side’s effort. The Tigers won the try count by three to two, but as a consequence of two yellow cards played a quarter of the game with 14 men.“We showed so much grit and determination. We got nothing back from the referee at all and we kept on coming back and turning up. All year we’ve had the expression about trying to embrace the heat, when it gets tough to try to revel in that scenario.“Early in the season we still weren’t understanding how to get around that situation. We did today. From all different avenues there were fires going everywhere, whether they were set up by the opposition or the ref. We were able to deal with that and get ourselves back in the game.”Bath’s captain, Ben Spencer, believes “the sky is the limit” for his champion side after the club’s first English league title for 29 years, suggesting it could be the prelude to a period of sustained success for a team who have hoisted an unprecedented three trophies this season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Slovenian had grabbed the overall lead the day before when he shot clear on the short closing climb.On the penultimate stage, a 131.7km run from Grand-Aigueblanche, Pogacar’s UAE Team Emirates teammate Pavel Sivakov reduced the leading pack by setting a ferocious tempo at the front at the start of the 20km final climb to Valmeinier ski resort.Tadej Pogacar goes solo for Dauphiné stage win to reclaim yellow jerseyRead moreWith 12km to go,Pogacar upped the tempo, standing on his pedals and rocketing clear. As on Friday, only Jonas Vingegaard, his main Tour de France rival, and the young German Florian Lipowitz could respond. Vingegaard settled into a dogged pursuit.Pogacar, without rising out of his saddle again, was able to maintain an uncatchable pace. He increased his lead to as much as 30 seconds before relaxing towards the end. He cruised across the line 14 seconds ahead of Vingegaard, quivering with effort as he came home.“Jonas was really strong – I did not want to go too deep myself,” said Pogacar. “It was a super-hot and long climb. Luckily, I had enough time to ease up in the last kilometres and recovered. Happy I could defend the jersey like this.”Lipowitz was again third at 1min 21sec. The Belgian Remco Evenepoel, who had led the overall classification until Friday, finished fifth, as he had on Friday, losing 2:39. With one stage to go, Pogacar increased his lead to 1:01 over Vingegaard, 2:01 over Lipowitz and 4:11 to Evenepoel in fourth.View image in fullscreenJonas Vingegaard in pursuit of Tadej Pogacar near the Col de la Croix de Fer.Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty ImagesFor much of the stage, Vingegaard’s lieutenants on the powerful Visma team launched attack after attack, but they could not shake off Pogacar, or Sivakov, either going up or down the day’s biggest climb, the Col de la Croix de Fer.Pogacar said: “We wanted to take control on all the climbs, but Visma tried with all the attacks. I was pretty happy with how Pavel and the team rode today. It was sort of defence, to not get attacked by everyone from Visma.”He complained at the way Visma had tried to drop him on the descent of the Col. “They went a little bit dangerous in the first kilometres of the downhill,” he said. “I didn’t like that, but it’s modern cycling.”As the start of the Tour de France on 5 July approaches, Pogacar beat Vingegaard to take a third stage victory in the race. It was also the 98th stage win of the Slovenian’s career, breaking his tie with the French sprinter Arnaud Démare for most by an active rider.He has a chance for one more on Sunday when the race finishes with another mountainous stage, 133.3km from Val-d’Arc to the Plateau du Mont-Cenis.Explore more on these topicsCyclingTadej PogačarJonas VingegaardnewsShareReuse this content"

Until that point, he was heading for an early exit. McIlroy returned to the course to post 74 on Saturday, leaving him 10 over for the week, before addressing the media for the first time since Tuesday. McIlroy’s body language suggested he would rather be elsewhere.“It’s much easier being on the cut line when you don’t really care if you’re here for the weekend or not,” said McIlroy in only half-joking tone. “I was sort of thinking, do I really want two more days here or not?

You don’t know how you’re going to react to such a, I wouldn’t say a life-altering occasion, but at least something that I’ve dreamed about for a long time.

There, news broke that his driver had failed a standard test for a non-conforming face. No other player was named in the initial report, despite the fact that the eventual champion, Scottie Scheffler, encountered the same problem. McIlroy had avoided post-round press conferences for six major days in a row before Saturday. At Oakmont he referenced “frustration” with the press.“That was a part of it,” said McIlroy, on whether driver-gate had prompted him to step back from media duties. “At Augusta I skipped you guys on Thursday, so it’s not out of the ordinary.

But not even she can quite comprehend the impossible magic of her last seven days at Queen’s Club.When the 37-year-old arrived in west London she had lost nine matches in a row and looked in danger of dropping out of the world’s top 100. Now, unfathomably, she has powered into a WTA 500 final after winning six matches in a row – including two in qualifying – and beaten three players in the world’s top 15.Emma Raducanu pulls out of Berlin Open with ‘lingering’ back problemRead more“To be honest, I cannot believe it,” Maria said. “It’s a dream come true.”The German’s latest scalp was arguably her best yet as she defeated the reigning Australian Open champion, Madison Keys, who many fancy to go all the way at Wimbledon, 6-3, 7-6 (3) in a semi-final high on shot-making and finesse.But what made it extra-special for Maria was that her daughters, Charlotte, 11, and Cecilia, four, were there with her, even if Cecilia – who goes to sleep when she hears tennis balls bouncing – had nodded off in her pram.“We are travelling all the time together,” she said. “They are at all the tournaments with us from the beginning. It’s super-special to have them around, and to live these moments with them, it’s something amazing.”Maria’s game has long been built on chaos. She likes to fiddle and slice, to seek unorthodox angles and patterns, to leave her opponents lost in her matrix. Her one-handed backhand is unusual these days and the way she slices her forehand makes it even harder for her opponents to find their rhythm, especially on grass.But although she reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 2022, she had never beaten Keys in three attempts and was considered to be a 9-2 outsider coming into the match. Once again, though, she did not read the script.If Maria was nervous beforehand, it did not show. Despite the swirling wind, the World No 86 held her opening service games comfortably before breaking to go 3-1 up when Keys hit a backhand long. From then on she dropped only four points on serve for the rest of the first set.View image in fullscreenMadison Keys, the regining Australian Open champion, was beaten 6-3, 7-6 (3) by Germany’s Tatjana Maria.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersIt wasn’t that Keys was playing badly. But her power was sometimes left untamed and she had no answer to the wiles and guiles of her opponent. One example from many: early in the second set, Maria lured Keys in with a drop shot before an impeccable lob volley floated over her head.Maria continued to press and at 2-2, Keys had to save a break point with a 118mph ace. When the American had a chance of her own in the next game it could have been a momentum changer, but she let it slip and soon the players were in a second set tie-break.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But from then on Maria was unstoppable. A backhand pass and a 116mph serve put her on the verge of victory before a mis-hit Keys smash sealed the win.Maria seemed at a loss to explain how she had turned her game around after not winning a match between late March and early June. “You always have to keep going,” she said. “You can never stop, no matter how it goes. I’ve had my ups and downs but I love to play tennis, I love this sport, and we live for these special moments.”This was certainly special. Having been a 159-1 outsider to win Queen’s at the start of the week, Maria has now beaten three players in the world’s top 15, including the former French Open finalist Karolina Muchova and the 2022 Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina.Her reward is an extra 320 ranking points, a spot just outside the top 50 in the live WTA world rankings, and a place in Sunday’s final against Amanda Anismova, who beat the Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 in the other semi-final.And who is to say that this magical fairytale is over yet?Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Can ChatGPT help you to manage your money?We asked a chatbot some common finance questions – and then ran its responses past human expertsShane HickeySat 14 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTShareArtificial intelligence seems to have touched every part of our lives. But can it help us manage our money? We put some common personal finance questions to the free version of ChatGPT, one of the most well-known AI chatbots, and asked for its help.Then we gave the answers to some – human – experts and asked them what they thought.PensionsWe asked:I am 35 years old and want to ensure I have a comfortable retirement. I earn about £35,000 a year and have a workplace pension, in which I have saved £20,000. My employer contributes 4% of salary. I would like to retire at 60 and want to ensure I have enough in my pension pot to not worry about money later in life. Do I need to save more?ChatGPTsaid*:A comfortable single-person retirement requires roughly £43,000 a year of spending (in today’s money) while a moderate lifestyle might need £31,000 a year. Covering £43,000 a year over a 20- to 30-year retirement implies a very large pension pot of about £793,000 in addition to the state pension. A moderate £31,000 a year needs £478,000 in savings.Your state pension will kick in at 67 and is about £12,000 a year, much less than the £43,000 needed for comfort and it does not arrive until seven years after you retire. This “pre-state pension gap” could well exceed £150,000. You must plan to fund all expenses for seven years on your own savings.Even optimistic growth leaves you well below the £500,000 to £800,000 needed. You’ll need to save more – much higher than 9%. Vanguard [an investment adviser] suggests saving 12% to 15% of your pay a year (including employer contributions). Legal & General offers a rule-of-thumb savings percentage of half your age: at 35, that means 17.5% of your salary. Since your employer already gives 4%, you might target 11%. Don’t forget UK tax relief: your 20% basic-rate relief effectively makes every £80 you save cost you only £60 net.Consider topping up with a lump sum or contributing to a stocks and shares Isa.Read ChatGPT’s full answer hereView image in fullscreenChatGPT’s responses were largely limited to general summaries and sometimes included inaccuracies.Photograph: Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockSteve Webb, a partner at the pension consultants LCP, says:Using thePensionsand Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) standard for a “comfortable” and moderate income seems a reasonable place to start.For someone aged 35 today, the state pension age by law will be 68 (and could be higher by the time they get there) so the reference to 67 in the reply is incorrect.The PLSA says you need £43,000 a year after tax, so that implies a pre-tax income of very roughly £50,000; you get £12,000 a year of this from state pension age, but for the first eight years of retirement (before the state pension kicks in) you would need this to come from your pension pot. This means you will need £635,000 on current calculations.The figure of £793,000, therefore, looks over the odds, though there may be an assumption (not made explicit) that a quarter is always taken in tax-free cash. The person using AI needs to understand what assumption has been made around tax-free cash to clarify what is going on.It is good the AI explains that in the first years of retirement you are relying solely on your private pension pot, a kind of basic “cashflow modelling” many advisers would do as standard.The rules of thumb are a decent starting point, although the one about saving at a percentage which is half your age is for people who only start saving at that age.One omission is that there is no reference to the possibility of an additional employer match. Some firms will pay more if you pay more, and that would make additional workplace saving much more attractive than the suggested alternative of an Isa. Another omission is that if you buy an annuity at 60, you may want to think about things such as inflation protection, and these would increase the size of pot you needed to target.I don’t think it’s a bad reply aside from the error on state pension age. But you would want to go deeper in terms of understanding the assumptions made.MortgagesWe asked:We have 20 years left on our mortgage and our current rate is due to run out in a few months. The loan to value is about 50%. What are the best rates on the market? Should we go for a two-year or five-year fix? Or should we stay put and hope that that rates come down?ChatGPTsaid:The very cheapest two‑year fixes are about 3.7% to 3.8% and five‑year fixes are about 3.8% to 3.9% for borrowers with large deposits. With 50% equity you should qualify for the lowest-rate tier.For example, Lloyds Bank has a two‑year fix at 3.72%. These often have arrangement fees (typically £999) so factor them into any calculation. For five‑year fixes, Lloyds offers 3.78%.If you did nothing, your mortgage would revert to the lender’s standard variable rate, which are typically much higher – about 7-8%. An SVR can jump if rates rise, and lenders are not required to pass on cuts in full.If you expect further rate cuts, a two‑year deal lets you refinance again sooner at (hopefully) lower rates. The downside is more frequent remortgaging: after two years, you’ll need another deal.Five-year deals are likely to be a few tenths higher but give peace of mind for longer and protect you if market rates jump or stay elevated. If stability of repayments is your priority, a five‑year fix is often recommended.Most analysts expect further modest cuts – economists at Barclays predicted the bank rate could fall to 3.5% by early 2026. That could push mortgage offers down further, but likely not to the ultra-low levels seen pre-2020.Many experts lean toward taking a fixed rate now (especially to avoid the very high SVR) and revisiting options after a year or two.Read ChatGPT’s full answer hereView image in fullscreenChatGPT can be helpful as the starting point of broader research into mortgages.Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PADavid Hollingworthof the broker L&C Mortgagessays:This response is not even close to the level of advice that a qualified adviser would provide. What it does provide is a quick spin around some of the things that have been going on in the market, along with a general overview of elements the borrower may want to think about.The AI response is a bit of a mishmash and veers from quite specific information, such as specifying the Lloyds rate, to more general observations. Aside from the fact that this deal is now defunct, it also required the borrower to be a current account customer. Criteria will be as much a factor for many borrowers as the deal itself.It does highlight that there’s an arrangement fee to factor in, but borrowers need to understand there are options that can reduce or remove those costs, which could work much better for someone with a smaller mortgage.It feels a bit mixed about what may or may not happen with rates – the bottom line is that none of us know and, as far as I know, that includes AI.Because it was asked about two- and five-year rates, it fails to consider whether another option could fit better. An adviser would take a borrower through that, which could open up something like a three-year deal, fixing for 10-plus years and the existence and pros and cons of variable rate deals, too.The response may give some food for thought to borrowers and help them consider the questions they want to cover with a human adviser. Most borrowers will have had a browse online of “best buy” deals and coverage of what’s happening in the market before seeking individual advice. ChatGPT may offer another way to drag a very general summary together quickly as part of that research.Funding universityWe asked:I have two children (12 and 15), both of whom are in secondary school. Both want to go to university when they finish school. What is the best way for me to start saving and how much will I need to put together? They will be going to university in the UK. Can they get student loans? How much will accommodation cost us?ChatGPTstarted with details of the government loans for tuition and living costs and when they need to be repaid. It says these children would qualify for the minimum maintenance loan of between £3,907 and £6,853 depending on where they work and study.It then said:It’s wise to start saving now with dedicated education savings. JuniorIsasallow up to £9,000 a year for each child in tax-free savings or investments. Any growth is tax-free, and funds are released when the child turns 18.Even small regular deposits (eg £50-£100/month) into a Jisa, or a high-interest children’s savings account, can add up. Other options include premium bonds, a stocks and shares Isa (higher risk, higher potential return), or simply a regular savings account in the parents’ name. Consider investments for long-term growth: index funds or diversified portfolios can beat savings rates, though with risk of loss.It added that you should encourage children to save and to check for bursaries and scholarships.Read ChatGPT’s full answer hereView image in fullscreenThe AI chatbot did a ‘decent job of spelling out’ how much going to university could cost, says one expert.Photograph: aberCPC/AlamyCharlene Young, a senior pensions and savings expert at AJ Bell, says:It did a decent job of spelling out the facts of how much uni could cost, and the probable level of loan that could be applied for.It falls short on explaining the differences that would help someone make the right decision for their circumstances. A discussion with a real person would involve questions asking for extra information to give a more comprehensive answer.When saving or investing for children, we often talk about putting on your own oxygen mask first, such as checking you have a cash buffer or emergency fund for those unexpected costs. I’d want to double check that you don’t have any unsecured, high-interest borrowing outstanding – the AI answer doesn’t really explain that, starting from an assumption your own finances are in good shape.A pot such as a junior Isa makes sense for a specific goal such as university costs, but that money is locked away until the child turns 18 – and after that, it switches to an account in their own name that they can spend as they wish.It was good to see the AI suggest involving the child in all financial discussions to help them become a bit self-sufficient and mitigate some of those risks, but the answer did not spell out the important access at age 18 point.We know that investing gives the best chance of growing money over the long term – above cash and rises in the cost of living. But the short investment window between now and the time the eldest child would go to university was not mentioned at all as a risk.A specific fund recommendation from AI would be a bit of a red flag, but it’s helpful to give people an idea of what could be considered or where to find more information. For example, what is an index fund, or a diversified portfolio and what are the likely costs.Here, a real adviser could make a formal recommendation, or an expert could point out how to research different types of funds.InsuranceWe asked:I have just bought my first home and am expecting a child with my partner. What types of insurance do we need and how much should we spend? We travel on holidays every year and both work full time.ChatGPTgave a list of insurances and explained what each does, including what policies typically provide and exclude. For example, it said “life insurance pays a tax-free lump sum or regular payout if a policyholder dies during the term… A Which? comparison found a 30-year-old could insure £300,000 (25-year term) for about £113 per year.”It said the key policies to get in this case were life insurance, income protection, critical illness cover, buildings insurance, contents insurance, and travel insurance.It said:“To save on premiums, you can bundle cover as insurers often discount multi-policy customers. A joint life policy (pays on first death) is cheaper than two single life policies, but note it ends on first claim. Sometimes buying separate dual life (first-death) and second-death life insurance can be optimal. Rates vary widely so get multiple quotes.”Read ChatGPT’s full answer hereView image in fullscreenChatGPT’s response on travel insurance was described as ‘very simplistic’.Photograph: Sina Ettmer/AlamyGraeme Trudgill, chief executive of the BritishInsuranceBrokers’ Association saysthe response is “very generic” and does not take into account the complexities of insurance. Brokers, he says, are able to negotiate with providers on behalf of the consumer and know what the best policies are on the market.Kathryn Knowles from brokers Cura Insurancesays some of the advice on critical illness cover was confused and did not properly distinguish it from income protection, which advisors have to do.AndGarry Nelson from AllClear Travel Insurancesays the AI’s response on travel insurance is “very simplistic” and fails to help people in what they need, be it a single trip or annual policy. “This is as far as ChatGPT can go in my opinion for travel insurance enquiries – ie offering a general description as it is not regulated to offer anything more detailed or complex,” he says.The verdictThe responses from ChatGPT were largely limited to general summaries about the various topics – and sometimes even contained inaccuracies. They may be a useful introduction and guide, but lack the level of detail needed to make serious decisions that could cost thousands of pounds. It’s a good place to start if you want an idea of some of the things you need to think about before making decisions – but if you want advice, you should be better off with a human.* The responses from ChatGPT have been edited for this articleWhat to ask and howYou will get better detail in an answer if you provide a lot of information, such as your age, your salary and what debts you have, rather than just asking a general question.Check your privacy settings to ensure you are comfortable with how ChatGPT processes your data. You may well want to ensure your chats are not being used for training.Don’t rely on the AI to tell you about the most up-to-date products. Instead do your own research or go to an adviser. The AI is better placed to give plans or broad strategies.Use it as a jumping-off tool, not for a final plan. While you might get some good general details, don’t make any decisions without doing your own research as well or consulting an expert.If you don’t understand a term, ask the AI to break it down for you – for example, you might want to know what the difference is between types of loan available when you go to university.On the free version of ChatGPT, click “Run Deep Research” in the tools section of the query box to get a more extensive report on your query, as we did in collating this article.

Once they start [using AI], it turns to exhilaration, because it is a lot more straightforward than people realise, and it is far more rewarding than people expect.”Kyle spoke after meeting tech company bosses to discuss a new government-industry drive to train 7.5 million UK workers – a fifth of the overall workforce – in AI by 2030, with the help of firms such as Google, Amazon and BT.He said: “There’s no one in employment at the moment that is incapable of gaining the skills that will be needed in the economy in the next five years.“That is the optimistic way of saying, act now, and you will thrive into the future. Don’t, and I think that some people will be left behind. And that’s what worries me the most.”Kyle said there appeared to be a generational gap in AI, with over-55s using AI half as much as over-35s. Closing this gap would take two and a half hours of training, he said.“People don’t need to get trained in quantum physics,” Kyle said. “They need to get trained in the basics of how AI works, how to interact with it, and to explore all of the potential it has for you as an individual in the workplace.”Keir Starmeracknowledged this weekthat people were “sceptical” about AI and worry about it taking their job. Speaking at London Tech Week, the prime minister said the government would attempt to prove that technology can “create wealth in your community … create good jobs [and] vastly improve our public services”.People inEnglish-speaking countries including the UK, US, Australia and Canadaare more nervous about the rise of AI than those in the largest EU economies, according to polling data shared with the Guardian last week.Forecasts about the impact of AI on jobs vary, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warning the technology could trigger job losses in skilled professions such as law, medicine and finance. The International Monetary Fund has calculated 60% of jobs in advanced economies such as the US and UK are exposed to AI and half of these jobs may be negatively affected.However, the Tony Blair Institute, which has called for widespread adoption of AI in the public and private sectors, has said potential UK jobs losses in the private sphere will be mitigated by the technology creating new roles.Kyle said he was ready for a reset in the debate over AI and copyright after opposition to the government’s proposed overhaul of copyright law in the House of Lords ended. The data bill, a vehicle for peers’ opposition toproposals to let AI firms use copyright-protected work without permissionin order to develop their products, finally passed this week after lords did not submit further copyright-related amendments.“I’m acting with humility and self-reflection about the things I could have done better in that process,” he said. “And I’ve made promises to move forward with a reset and a refocus on what will deliver the rights remuneration and opportunities for creatives in the digital age that they have enjoyed for generations in the analogue age – whilst travelling on that journey with the AI industry alongside.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Job lossesPeter KyleWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

Today’s protagonist is Sabrina Carpenter, a pop star whose music videos have got a Brooklyn priestdemotedand might have played asmall rolein getting the mayor of New York, Eric Adams,indicted.On Wednesday, Carpenterrevealed the cover artfor her forthcoming album Man’s Best Friend in a social media post, which featured two photos side by side. One was a closeup of what appears to be a fluffy dog with a collar bearing the words “man’s best friend”. The other is a photo of Carpenter on her hands and knees in front of a man who is pulling her by the hair.The imagery has caused controversy and drawn mixed reactions. On the one hand, you’ve got people who think Carpenter is being clever. On the other hand, you’ve got people who think she is being crass and catering to the male gaze in a way that is extremely unhelpful to women.In the latter camp isGlasgow Women’s Aid, a Scottish group that helps victims of domestic violence. They have called the imagery “regressive” and “a throwback to tired tropes that reduce women to pets, props, and possessions and promote an element of violence and control”.Women of West Virginia: inform on yourself to the miscarriage police! | Arwa MahdawiRead moreSome people on social media vehemently disagree. “i am a little concerned about peoples inability to immediately clock that the cover is obviously a commentary on the way women are treated, especially with the context of manchild [the lead single from the album] and the album being called man’s best friend like guys omfg think,” someone in the “Sabrina’s doing satire!” camp posted. That gotover 53,000 likes.(I, myself, am a little concerned about people’s inability to use apostrophes.)Meanwhile, Diet Prada (an influential Instagram account with more than 3.4 million followers)posted a pictureof the video with the line “let women be h*rny on main” and a caption that essentially called Carpenter’s critics stupid prudes.I’m all for letting “women be h*rny on main” but I’m having a hard time seeing Carpenter’s cover art as either satire or sex-positive feminism. Sure, some of the best satire is extremely subtle. But this isn’t subtle or sex-positive – it’s just soft porn pandering to the male gaze.At a different point in time I suppose you might be able to make the case that this sort of imagery was edgy and subversive. Madonna, for example, used her sexuality to challenge social norms. But at the current moment, when sexualized imagery is everywhere, women’s rights are being aggressively rolled back in the US, and there isbacklash to women’s rightsaround the world, Carpenter’s cover art isn’t subverting anything.The hair-grabbing visual is in particularly poor tasteconsidering recent court testimonythat Sean “Diddy” Combs grabbed his then girlfriend Cassie Ventura by the hair and dragged her into another room where he assaulted her. There is also verydisturbing videosurveillance of Combs assaulting Ventura. If Carpenter’s fans can’t see all the problems with this imagery, then it’s because internalized misogyny is everywhere – and it’s a real bitch. (Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution.)None of this, to be clear, is an attack on Carpenter. In my best middle-aged woman voice I’d like to say thatI’m not angry, I’m just disappointed.I think Carpenter is very talented and particularly appreciate her track record on taking down awful men. Please, Sabrina, you’ve helped take down one mayor. Why not train your creative energy on trying to stop Andrew Cuomo, the disgraced former governor of New York, who has spentmillions of dollars in taxpayer moneyon an aggressive legal battle against the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, from becoming mayor of New York?

Some, nostalgic for the world that was, reject “unfreedom” as an exaggerated description of our situation. Others, seeing reality clearly, nevertheless hide from the unnerving implications.Some people, a minority, experience the changes that have come to America in 2025 as liberation. They are free to say and do what they want with impunity and without shame. On the other side of the spectrum, many who are not free now also were not before, and they suffered no illusion that they were. Now, they might raise an eyebrow to the rest of us, asking if we now see what this country has long been for some people, much of the time.But for most in this country, unfreedom is a novel experience. What makes this condition confounding is that our unfreedom doesn’t yet look like it does in Russia or China – it is still partial. Most in this country can still enjoy a dinner out with friends, loudly deploring the current state of affairs. For most, authoritarianism has not snuffed out the pleasures, private or communal, of a spring morning in the park. In fact, most of us can still read about horrors while lying on the grass, soaking up the sun.The newly unfree live with cognitive dissonance. You hear of people like doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk and labor leader David Huerta innocently walking down the street or protesting outside an immigration detention center, or even presiding in their courtroom – being arrested, detained or abducted. Institutions founded on principles of free expression or the rule of law have quickly abandoned them to avoid financial losses. People hesitate to travel abroad for fear of what will happen when they try to return to the country they’ve called home. And now, we have 2,000 national guard troops and 700 marines sent to a city to repress protest against the wishes of the governor and mayor. After Los Angeles, more Americans are conscious of our growing unfreedom.When – if – you wake up to our shared condition of unfreedom, you face an existential choice. Do you act on what you know to be true, or do you hide? Too many corporate titans, university presidents and heads of major law firms are behaving as though they are powerless. Members of Congress admit that they are afraid to speak up. Judges talk openly about the threats they face to their safety.Those leading powerful institutions still have leverage. They still have power. We must call on them to unite and exercise it. Silence and hiding will offer no lasting reprieve.But regular people, everyday people, face a different challenge. In order to act, they must first discover their power – and learn how to use it.What should using that power look like? A dilemma for those awake to our growing unfreedom is that the tools we know how to use to change things no longer seem to work. Protests are crucial in raising awareness, but often don’t compel those in power to change course. Representatives are less responsive to our advocacy. The rules have changed. Reason, evidence and expertise don’t carry the day. Norms we once took for granted are gone.There are ways we can oppose authoritarianism, using techniques that haven’t been used at a scale for decades. These tools are our inheritance. They have been passed down for centuries, by abolitionist campaigners, labor organizers and anti-colonial leaders. Gandhi famously revived them in the early 20th century, inspiring many leaders in the US civil rights movement. The Black freedom struggle, this country’s leading democracy movement, has in turn inspired nearly every peaceful, people-powered movement around the world since. This is the lineage of strategic nonviolence to which we must now return. These are the tools we must rediscover.View image in fullscreenSue. Protest. Vote. Then, rinse and repeat. In recent years, pro-democracy advocates have faithfully followed that formula. These strategies have prevented many abuses. But they did not prevent an authoritarian movement from gaining strength. And they won’t be enough to prevent what we now face: the prospect of years of authoritarian rule, or something far worse.So what is to be done?Much depends on how quickly civil society can remake itself for this new era. We can learn from previous generations of change-makers in the US, and from contemporaries around the world today, who have won by deploying a booster formula for times such as these. It is simple:Disrupt. De-legitimize. And draw defectors.To be clear, the formula of sue, protest and vote remains absolutely necessary – but is not sufficient.Lawsuits curbed the worst excesses of Trump’s first term and have been among the few speed bumps slowing the current administration’s much more aggressive rampage against civil liberties and the rule of law. But we are already seeing open defiance of court orders.When Trump was asked whether he was obligated as president to uphold the constitution in the case of Kilmar Ábrego García, who had been wrongly deported from the US, he replied: “I don’t know.” While Ábrego García is now back on US soil, preventing this particular collision course, other contempt trials continue to play out and legal experts fear many more opportunities for Trump to even more brazenly defy the courts.History also suggests reasons to avoid placing too much hope in the courts, because they cannot always be counted on to save us. Consider Dred Scott v Sandford in 1857, when the supreme court ruled that Black Americans were not citizens; Plessy v Ferguson in 1896, upholding racial segregation; Korematsu v United States in 1944, allowing Japanese citizens to be interned in camps; or Trump v United States just last year, in which the court needlessly expanded the doctrine of presidential immunity. Lawsuits buy us essential time, but by themselves are not a sufficient safeguard of our freedoms.In fact, history further suggests that the courts move in concert with public opinion – and are often pushed by people who take bold action. The supreme court only affirmed same-sex marriage rights, for instance, afterpublic support had increasedfollowing years of organizing and advocacy.Protests also play a vital role in building the confidence of those opposed to an authoritarian government’s policies. They help people see they are not alone. And they help embolden those in power who may be sympathetic to the opposition.But while protest remains an effective means of focusing pressure and raising awareness, protest alone can’t force authoritarian coalitions to change. Authoritarians revel in their power to defy dissidents – and can become violent in doing so, as we have seen in Los Angeles this week. Authoritarians have also learned to disregard many types of dissent. Erica Chenoweth, a leading scholar of protest, found thatprotest movements have recently become less effectivein unseating despots around the world, due in part to authoritarians’ growing savvy in repressing them or waiting them out.Meanwhile, sociologistZeynep Tufekciand journalistVincent Bevinshave reported that mass protests facilitated by social media lack the power of protests of a previous era because they are not undergirded by organizations that can negotiate and adapt tactics as circumstances change. Mass protest is essential, but it is not a panacea.Voting is crucial. But rulings on everything from redistricting to campaign finance to voter suppression bills make clear that elements of the federal judiciary are all too happy to disenfranchise voters across the nation. And we cannot wait for communities to make their voices heard at the polls. What happens now will determine whether this country even has free and fair midterm elections.The situation is dire. But as we look to the other movements that have successfully defeated authoritarianism and achieved democratic breakthroughs, it’s useful to maintain perspective. Movements in places like South Africa, Brazil and the Jim Crow south succeeded under conditions far worse than those we face today – when the right to vote and to protest did not exist, when courts were uniformly hostile, when the media and other major institutions were captured. How can it be possible to prevail under such conditions?View image in fullscreenRev James Lawson came into the Los Angeles community center and greeted everyone personally. Some two decades later, I still remember how intently he listened to the two dozen immigrant-rights organizers who had come seeking advice on how we might achieve a federal path to citizenship for undocumented people living in the US. We described a strategy focused on mass mobilization, skillful advocacy with policymakers, and expert communications to frame the problem and solution.His response was kind but firm. Our strategy wouldn’t work, he said. We were playing by the rules of someone else’s game. This Black American leader had seen the full truth of this country – the horrors as well as the heroism – and from that experience learned some hard truths. He wanted to share them with this group of mostly first-generation immigrants, many of whom still believed what we read in textbooks about how change happens. If we wanted to succeed, he said, we would have to engage in nonviolent disruption at a scale big enough to force a moral and economic crisis that would bring about change.We weren’t ready or able to take Rev Lawson’s advice then. We pursued a strategy that achieved some important gains in policy, but were unsuccessful in our efforts to pass federal immigration reform.Maybe we are ready to listen to him now.Rev Lawson knew more about disruption than perhaps any living American. He was, as Dr Martin Luther King Jr called him, the “leading nonviolence theorist in the world”. In the 1950s and 60s, he trained thousands of civil rights leaders and marchers, including John Lewis, to meet violence with love and dignity. He worked closely with the Little Rock Nine, who led the desegregation of an Arkansas high school, helping them muster the courage to remain composed as they walked into school amid a barrage of violent hate. He prepared the brave participants in Nashville’s sit-ins to desegregate lunch counters. He was instrumental in organizing the freedom rides in protest of the defiance of the ruling ordering the desegregation of buses.I’d first met Rev Lawson over a decade before that meeting, as part of a small training on principles of nonviolence that he held for organizers in Los Angeles. I had studied Gandhi and the ideas he’d developed during the Indian independence struggle. I was part of the Aids movement, and I’d witnessed a lot of death and government-sponsored cruelty. I thought I knew the material, but what Rev Lawson taught me in our first meeting shook me to the core.I had expected a master class in tactics. How do you plan a sit-in? How do you get press attention? What police tactics can you anticipate? Where do you have lawyers waiting? Instead, Rev Lawson devoted the first few hours of the training inviting us into deep introspection. He opened a dialogue about love, and asked if we loved our opponents. My attitude was well-captured by Tina Turner: “what’s love got to do with it?”While I had viewed nonviolence as a strategy, Rev Lawson understood nonviolence as a way of life. He believed the principles and techniques he taught couldn’t work without this depth of commitment. You couldn’t win defectors to your side without taking the moral high ground, and you couldn’t convincingly fake love for any length of time.We spent the next few hours of the training on building discipline. How do you conduct yourself facing unimaginable pressure and violence? I remember him inches from my face, calling me names and threatening me, trying to provoke a reaction. At the end, he assessed our performance. Did we manifest love, even to our opponents? Did we maintain the composure under fire that he demanded? With a glance, he let me know that I had done much better with discipline than with love. I’d been resolutely nonviolent, but was obviously smoldering inside.Rev Lawson was teaching us the art and science of nonviolent disruption. This is the hidden electric current that has powered the great episodes of American progress. WEB Du Boisexplainedthat it was enslaved people themselves, and not white northerners, who broke the back of the plantation economy and won their own freedom by engaging in a loosely coordinated “general strike” that fatally damaged the southern cause. In more recent decades, the United Farm Workers’grape boycottof 1965 andstrikes by teachersin 2018 andautoworkersin 2024 are iconic examples of nonviolent disruption that delivered results.Disruption differs from protest in a key sense. Where protests are designed to capture attention, Rev Lawson constantly reminded us that disruption is not always loud and noisy. Sometimes it involves sitting where you’re not supposed to, not buying what you usually do, or not showing up for work. The point is that disruption must exact real economic or political costs on authoritarians and their collaborators.During the early days of the administration, we have already seen such methods yield results. Take the ongoingboycott of Targetover its diversity, equity and inclusion policy rollback, which has depressed the chain’s foot traffic and stock price, or the widespreaddisavowal of Tesla, resulting in a worldwide sales crisis for Elon Musk’s once-trendy automaker. Or look at the Los Angeles unified school district’s refusal to give federal immigration authorities access to the city’s schools.These acts of non-cooperation create friction, and friction slows the consolidation of authoritarianism. Each act of non-cooperation, of disruption, inspires others to use the power they have to throw sand in the gears.It’s an encouraging start. But there is more that must be done to revive the tools Rev Lawson, who died in 2024, left us for times such as these. I am inspired by an organization called Free DC, which is leading the way in revitalizing the lineage of nonviolence for this generation by training and organizing thousands of people across our nation’s capital to stand up for the capital city’s right to home rule, defend workers at federal agencies and protect immigrants. It is a fitting place to begin; Washington DC is still a colony and it is reeling from the firings of thousands of its residents, government workers, without cause.To meet the moment, it will be crucial to scale the work of organizations like FreeDC across the nation and train tens of thousands more in the proud nonviolent tradition that Rev Lawson and his fellow civil rights pioneers left us.View image in fullscreenThousands of people have descended on town hall meetings around the country opposing cuts to Medicaid, which provides essential healthcare and elder care to nearly 80 million people. Some of those showing up are members of unions, community groups and disability groups. Others are people who have never taken action before for whom Congress’s decision is a matter of life and death. Camilla Hudson came to Washington DC to defend Medicaid because she has an autoimmune disease that requires expensive treatments.She explainedthat without prescription drug coverage, “it’s terrifying … I would have to leave the US because I will die here.”These people may have voted for Trump, for Harris or not at all in 2024. Medicaid is even more important to people in red states than blue states. Most of them would not show up to a rally to defend the rule of law, but they are highly motivated by an issue that hits close to home. The activism is having a huge impact assome unlikely voicesin Congress – who have been otherwise loath to break from the administration – openly declare their opposition to cuts.Meanwhile, thousands of people around the country have mobilized to protect their immigrant co-workers, co-parishioners and neighbors. The upswelling of support in Los Angeles, for example, includes union members,people of faithand relatives of immigrants who were not active before the recent raids.This is what it means to de-legitimize – and it goes hand in hand with disruption. De-legitimization, the process of driving down public support for authoritarian policies, recognizes that an administration with policies polling in the 20s or low 30s will be less able to execute its agenda or prevail in the courts than a government whose policies are supported broadly by the public.The goal is to win over everyday people through organizing, helping them understand the connections between the challenges they’re facing and the harmful actions of the administration. This process will ideally help people identify authoritarian strategies, allowing them to better resist propaganda. If done well, organizing can also serve to strengthen citizens’ commitment to democratic principles by offering them an experience of democracy in practice each day, rather than as a quadrennial abstraction.To this end, the administration’s “flood the zone” attacks on so many cornerstones of American life offer not only the biggest organizing imperative, but also the biggest organizing opportunity of our lifetimes. We must harness the power of the many millions of Americans who now feel under threat, including older Americans, veterans, the US-citizen children and spouses of immigrants, the parents of disabled and trans kids, and the large number of people who would be affected by cuts to Medicaid, including patients and medical workers. To name a few.Unexpected constituencies are raising their voices. Take scientists, who have long sought to protect their research by staying away from politics. Recognizing that the administration’s actions are not only undermining their own work but destroying the scientific enterprise for a generation, they are speaking out and even organizing marches of their own.Perhaps the greatest organizing challenge facing the pro-democracy coalition in the US will be bridging between the largely middle-class constituency that is fired up about attacks on the rule of law and the largely working-class base that is focused on kitchen table issues – not on a system that hasn’t been working for them. Without the latter group, the coalition will not be big enough to succeed.We must not be seen to be working to restore a broken system, but rather to transform it through a new vision, with accompanying policy goals. That may include, for example, campaigns for workers’ rights to help dissolve the unnatural bond between billionaires and some blue-collar voters that fuels the authoritarian coalition.We must develop and demonstrate alternatives that people will believe in.View image in fullscreenDisruption and de-legitimization lead to the third key objective: drawing defectors. These efforts must be targeted across the ideological spectrum and they must be achieved at two levels: that of institutions and individuals. Authoritarians rely on support, whether passive or active, from key pillars of society: corporations, churches, police and media outlets, among others. Under pressure, institutions like law firms and Columbia University shamefully moved from neutrality to active collaboration with authoritarianism.It does not have to be this way. Harvard’s recent decision to challenge the administration in court is an example of institutional defection, moving from the sidelines to active opposition. It did not happen by accident. Harvard’s action was the culmination of a massive behind-the-scenes organizing campaign of faculty, students, donors and alumni. Similar efforts are taking place across law firms, foundations and other universities.Employees have considerable leverage when it comes to winning defections at scale among businesses, faith institutions, tech companies, the military and law enforcement. They can push their institutions to not “obey in advance” and instead openly resist authoritarianism. Many individuals across the country who are concerned about the advance of authoritarianism forget the power they can wield over the institutions they are a part of. Now is the time to use it.It is also necessary to win defections at the level of everyday people. Consider the example of Women of Welcome, a group of evangelicals who educate and engage other Christians on issues related to immigrants and refugees. This group recently led a delegation of evangelical women to the southern US border to provide aid to asylum seekers and listen to their stories. They are not progressives – but they are taking a strong public stand for immigrants and recruiting their neighbors in communities that have been broadly receptive to the Trump administration’s xenophobic appeals.In seeking to build a pro-democracy coalition, members of the opposition must resist the impulse to write off, shame or expel those with whom they have disagreed in the past and may still disagree on many important issues. The imperative of defeating authoritarianism must supersede internecine fights or purity tests. It is essential to talk to everyone.Embodying the moral character taught by civil rights leaders like Rev Lawson – acting nonviolently and showing love to those on the other side – will be vital in creating the kind of attractive, welcoming gateway for defectors to join the movement. Doing so will help to create a pro-democracy majority that extends beyond our traditional allies in the progressive movement.I may finally grasp what Rev Lawson meant when he said that love is our secret weapon. When a mom and her three school-aged children were detained by Ice in the small upstate New York town of Sackets Harbor (ironically, the home of Tom Homan, the administration’s immigration enforcement “czar”), public school teachers and administrators swung into action, engaging in aggressive advocacy. These educators may or may not have been politically engaged before, but their care for their students moved them to take a stand, speak up and choose opposition over collaboration. They won – the mom and kids are free as a result of their courage.View image in fullscreenWe face considerable obstacles in trying to prevent the consolidation of authoritarianism in the United States. But the truth is that they are smaller than those encountered by prior generations. The freedom rides, orchestrated in part by Rev Lawson, are now iconic, but we forget the violence that riders encountered in the process. Following the successful Birmingham campaign to win desegregation in 1963, four little Black girls were killed in the 16th Street Baptist church bombing. The next year, civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were the victims of a deadly KKK conspiracy in Mississippi.Yes, the physical threats to judges, politicians, election officials and citizens in the United States are real. Yes, immigrants have been taken off the streets and held without due process. Fortunately, as worrying as this week’s troop deployment to California should be to all of us, we still have a precious window of time to organize and dissent openly. We can take hope from cases around the world when everyday people have made that choice in large numbers.U-turns happen. Scholarshave foundthat 73% of episodes of authoritarian breakthrough around the world in the last 30 years have been followed by democratic revivals. Sometimes, those revivals bring about an even stronger democracy than what came before. But U-turns aren’t self-executing. And the time to act is limited – comparable cases like India and Hungary suggest that if authoritarianism is not effectively challenged in the first couple of years, it can deepen and become the new normal for a decade or more.Our aspiration cannot be to return to the before times. The rotten fruit of authoritarianism grew in the soil of obscene inequality and insufficiently democratic institutions. We must therefore not only oppose autocracy, but propose something better – democratic alternatives that are ready to go if we can awaken from this nightmare.Rev Lawson and his contemporaries did not promise an easy path. Millions of us will have to reckon honestly with our current reality. We will need to make the choice to act. We will need to contribute our time, talent and money strategically. We will have to tap deep reservoirs of courage and love we didn’t know we had. Rev Lawson’s key teaching was hopeful: if we do those things, we can get free.Deepak Bhargava has been an organizer and campaigner for 30 years and is the co-author of Practical Radicals: Seven Strategies to Change the World.

This week, across the US, people have been coming together.We may disagree onimmigrationpolicy, but we don’t want a president deploying federal troops in our cities when governors and mayors say they’re not needed.We may disagree on how laws should be enforced, but we don’t want federal agents to arbitrarily abduct people off our streets or at places of business or in courthouses and detain them without any process to determine if such detention is justified.Or target hardworking members of our community. Or arrest judges. Or ship people off to brutal prisons in foreign lands.We may disagree on questions of freedom of speech, but we don’t think people should be penalized for peacefully expressing their views.Why is the media ignoring growing resistance to Trump? | Margaret SullivanRead moreWe may disagree on the federal budget, butwe don’t believea president should spend tens of millions of taxpayer dollars on a giant military parade designed in part to celebrate himself.As we resistDonald Trump’s tyranny, America gains in solidarity. As we gain solidarity, we feel more courageous. As we feel courageous and stand up to the president, we weaken him and his regime. As we weaken Trump and his regime, we have less to fear.In downtown Kansas City, Missouri, this week, protesters holding signs reading “solidarity” marched peacefully. “I felt it was my right and my duty to come here – as what I had to go through to come here, and yell, and say I went through the system,” one of themtoldthe local channel KSHB.In Denver, a crowdgatheredoutside the Colorado state capitol peacefully marched in solidarity with Los Angeles protesters, carrying flags and signs with slogans such as “Abolish ICE,” “No human is illegal” and “Keep the immigrants. Deport the fascists!”In downtown Tucson, people gathered at the Garcés Footbridge to show theirsolidarity. Reminders of the protest were written in chalk on sidewalks: “No one is illegal on stolen land,” “Love over Hate” and “Free Our Families.”In Boston, they gathered outside of the Massachusetts state house to express solidarity, citing two local students who they said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) abducted and detained for no reason,Rümeysa ÖztürkandMarcelo Gomes da Silva.In Sioux City, Iowa,they marchedalong Singing Hills Boulevard, outside the Ice office, to peacefully protest. One of them, Zayden Reffitt, said: “We’re showing people that we’re not going to be silent and we’re not just going to let all this go through without us saying something about it.”In Chicago, thousands marched through the Loop, creating a standstill on DuSable Lake Shore Drive near Grant Park. As one explained: “I’m a first-generation citizen – my parents were born in Mexico. It’s something I’m super passionate about. My family is safe, but there are many who aren’t. This is impacting our community, and we need to stand up for those who can’t speak up for themselves.”In Des Moines, they rallied peacefully at Cowles Commons in solidarity with others. “We’re here to stand up for members of our community. For immigrants. For migrants. For refugees. For people with disabilities. For people on Medicaid. For seniors. For all the working class, because we are all under attack right now,”saidone. “And Trump is trying to scapegoat immigrants and make them the enemy, calling them criminals.”In Austin, Texas, they gathered in front of the Texas capitol, holding flags and signs while chanting: “Whose streets? Our streets.” Authoritiesused pepper spray and teargasagainst the protesters and arrested more than a dozen of them, the governor, Greg Abbott, said.In San Antonio, hundreds gathered outside city hall, chanting, “People united will never be divided!” and holding signs that read, “No human is illegal” and “I’m speaking for those who can’t.”It was much the same in Sacramento; Raleigh, North Carolina; St Louis and in hundreds of other cities.Troops are now patrolling Los Angeles. This is a disaster waiting to happen  | Kenneth RothRead moreAll across the US, people who have never before participated in a demonstration are feeling compelled to show their solidarity – with immigrants who are being targeted by Trump, with people who are determined to preserve due process and the rule of law, with Americans who don’t want to live in a dictatorship.Peaceful protests don’t get covered by the national media. Most of the people who come together in places such as Des Moines and Kansas City to express their outrage at what Trump is doing aren’t heard or seen by the rest of us.Yet such solidarity is the foundation of the common good. And although the number of people expressing it is still relatively small, it is growing across the land.This is the silver lining on the dark Trumpian cloud.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Now the US risks being mired in another warMohamad BazziIf Trump wants to be the peacemaker he claims to be, he must negotiate a new deal with TehranSat 14 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 05.02 EDTShareBefore dawn on Friday, Israel unleashed a wave of air strikes against more than100 targets in Iran, including nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and air defense systems. The surprise Israeli attack also killed some of Iran’s most senior military commanders and nuclear scientists. The Iranian regime called it a “declaration of war” – and western powers raced to prevent a wider regional conflict that could draw in the US along with other countries in the Middle East.While the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, claims that he’s trying to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, the attack is as much intended to blow up ongoing negotiations between Tehran and Donald Trump’s administration. While Trump’s overall foreign policy has been a disaster, for months he hadresisted Netanyahu’s pleasto give Israel a green light to attack Iran, with US assistance. Trump insisted he wanted a chance to negotiate a deal with Iran’s leaders that would compel Tehran to give up its nuclear program in exchange for relief from US and other international sanctions.Benjamin Netanyahu must be stopped | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreAfter Friday’s attacks, Trump suggested the Iranian regime could still be convinced to negotiate,saying Tehran“must make a deal, before there is nothing left”. He added that Israel could carry out further attacks that would be “even more brutal”. Before Trump’s aggressive comments, his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had gone out of his way to explain that Israel had taken“unilateral action”and warned Tehran against targeting US military bases or embassies in the Middle East. “We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio said.It’s hard to imagine that Netanyahu would have launched such a brazen attack against Iran without at least some tacit support from Trump. Like all modern US presidents, Trump has lavished Israel withbillions of dollars in weaponsand has undermined international law and institutions like the UN security council to shield Israel from criticism. But Trump also prizes his reputation as a dealmaker, and he had invested significant political capital in negotiating an agreement with Iran. In a call this week, the president reportedlytold the prime ministerhe preferred diplomacy.By attacking Iran and torpedoing the negotiations, Netanyahu outplayed Trump – and the Israeli leader may well ensnare the US in a new Middle East conflict that Trump insists he does not want. Since Netanyahu unleashed multiple wars in the region after the Hamas attack on southernIsraelin October 2023, he’s confident that the US will always bail him out. Even after Israel launched a war on Gaza, a two-month ground invasion of Lebanon and frequent attacks on Syria, it continues to receive virtually unlimited US weapons and political support from Washington.Is it any surprise that Netanyahu has been emboldened to take greater risks that undermine several of Israel’s neighbors and now threaten to engulf the wider Middle East in a regional war? Starting with steadfast support from Joe Biden’s administration and continuing with Trump, Netanyahu knows that the US will always protect Israel from the costs of its escalation and adventurism. And US taxpayers are footing the bill: from October 2023 through September 2024, theUS provided Israelwith nearly $18bn in weapons, while the Pentagon spent another $4.9bn on its own military activities in the Middle East. That’s $22.7bn in US funding that enabled Netanyahu to prolong Israel’s brutal war on Gaza, an offensive in which Israel hascommitted war crimesand sparked accusations of genocide.For its part, the Trump administration announced in February that it would send more than $8bn innew weapons to Israel– continuing Biden’s failed policy of unrestrained arms shipments and unwavering political support for Netanyahu. Trump, the supposedly grand dealmaker, has so far failed to use the most effective leverage he has over the Israeli premier: the provision of US weapons and political cover.Despite Trump’spersistent claimthat he wants to be a peacemaker who ends America’s legacy of forever wars, he now risks becoming yet another US president who is mired in a disastrous conflict in the Middle East – thanks to his refusal to restrain Netanyahu, a US ally who has not yet paid any price for his warmongering.In his inaugural address in January, Trump reinforced his desire to establish himself as a mediator who will end global conflicts, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and avoid new wars entirely. “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier,”he said. Trump had also stewed for years over the fact that his predecessor, Barack Obama, won the Nobel peace prize during his first year in office in 2009, while Trump was passed over for the honor, even though he had brokered a series of diplomatic deals in 2020, known as the Abraham Accords, between Israel and several Arab states.If Trump has any hope of winning a Nobel prize – or even salvaging a minor legacy as a peacemaker – he will need to fix theIranagreement he tore up seven years ago.In 2018, during his first term, Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from a deal that was signed by Obama, and had taken years for Iran to negotiate with six world powers, under which Tehran limited its nuclear enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief. The 2015 agreement, which Trump had called a “disaster”, allowed Iran to continue producing nuclear fuel at low levels, enough to operate nuclear power plants but not to produce weapons. After Trump abandoned the original deal, Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon than ever before. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as of early this year, Tehran hadenriched enough uraniumto produce six nuclear weapons, although Iran would still need up to a year of additional work to develop an actual nuclear warhead and deploy it on a missile.In the early weeks of his second term, Trump seemed eager to negotiate a new deal with Iran:he sent a letterto Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying the US wanted to restart negotiations that had been abandoned by the Biden administration. As he often does in negotiations with foes and enemies alike, Trump then issued a threat, warning Iran’s leaders that if diplomacy failed, they would be subjected to “bombing the likes of which they have never seen before”.In March, Trump dispatched his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to lead a team of US negotiators to meet with top Iranian officials in mostly indirect talks mediated by Oman. Since then, Iran and the US have held five rounds of talks. The next round of negotiations was supposed to be held on Sunday, with Witkoff heading to Oman.During its attacks on Friday,Israel killed Ali Shamkhani, one of the top Iranian officials responsible for nuclear negotiations with the US. A top aide to Iran’s supreme leader, Shamkhani was not officially part of the Iranian delegation in the current round of US talks, but he played a pivotal role in overseeing nuclear policy.Iran haspulled outof the latest round of talks scheduled for this weekend. Netanyahu might have destroyed Trump’s chance at making a deal with Iran – and the prime minister has increased the likelihood of yet another disastrous war.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpIsraelUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

He’d do well to remember that pride must be rooted in honestyDavid Reynolds is the author of Mirrors of Greatness: Churchill and the leaders who shaped himSat 14 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 10.31 EDTShareToday the US army will parade in style along the National Mall in Washington DC to celebrate its 250th anniversary. This also just happens to be the 79th birthday of President Donald J Trump. As commander-in-chief, he will take the salute from a viewing platform on Constitution Avenue.But this is not a mere vanity project, as some critics have claimed. History really matters to the US’s 47th president. One of Trump’s last acts before reluctantly leaving the White House in January 2021 was topublish a reportby his “1776 Commission”, created to “restore understanding of the greatness of the American Founding”. Deliberately, the commissioners included few university historians because universities were described as often being “hotbeds of anti-Americanism, libel, and censorship that combine to generate in students and in the broader culture at the very least disdain and at worst outright hatred for this country”.The 1776 Commission demanded a return to truly “patriotic education”, declaring: “We must resolve to teach future generations of Americans an accurate history of our country so that we all learn and cherish our founding principles once again. We must renew the pride and gratitude we have for this incredible nation that we are blessed to call home.”In this spirit, on 2 May this year,the president postedthat he was renaming 8 May and 11 November respectively as “Victory Day for World War II and Victory Day for World War I” because “we won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance”, and it was time for the US to “start celebrating our victories again!”The parade on 14 June is also intended to raise the curtain on a spectacular nationwide celebration of the 250th anniversary of US independence, extending right across the country and culminating on 4 July 2026. According tothe White House website, one feature will be a video history series that “tells the remarkable story of American Independence. It will highlight the stories of the crucial characters and events that resulted in a small rag-tag army defeating the mightiest empire in the world and establishing the greatest republic ever to exist.”History on parade, indeed. As is often the case, Trump does start with a valid point. After he witnessed the extravaganzaof Bastille Day in 2017, where French and American troops marched down the Champs-Élysées to celebrate the centenary of the US’s entry into the first world war, he was determined to stage a parade of his own. So what’s wrong with that? Shouldn’t countries be proud of their past?OK (if you don’t mind the cost). But pride should be rooted in honesty, especially when Nato in Europe is engaged in a proxy war in Ukraine against Vladimir Putin, a systematic falsifier of history. And if we’re trying to be honest, world wars aren’t like the World Series with one country trumping all the others and winning almost single-handedly.Take the second world war. On 3 May this year, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedevdismissed Trump’s claimsas “pretentious nonsense”, asserting that “Victory Day is ours and it is 9 May. So it was, so it is, so it will always be!” Medvedev is now an obedient Putinist, but he and other Russians rightly point to their huge losses in 1941-45 – roughly 27 million people. Stated differently, in the three years from June 1941 to June 1944, between Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union and the D-day landings in Normandy, more than 90% of the German army’s battle casualties (killed, wounded, missing and prisoners) were inflicted by the Red Army. That puts Alamein and Tunis, Anzio and the liberation of Rome into a different perspective.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump at the annual Bastille Day military parade in Paris, 14 July 2017.Photograph: Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty ImagesYet Americans can rightly say that they were in a league of their own as a “superpower” – a word coined in 1944 to signify “great power and great mobility of power”. Their huge C-47 transport planes and the B-17 and B-24 bombers allowed the US to wage war right across the world. Their modern fleets of aircraft carriers, built to avenge Pearl Harbor, island-hopped across the Pacific to Japan itself. The Pacific war ended with the firebombing of Tokyo and the nuclear obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Or consider the speed of the remarkable breakout from Normandy that enabled allied armies to liberate Brussels on 3 September 1944, occupying positions they had not expected to reach until May 1945. When an astonished Winston Churchill asked how the GIs were being fed and supplied, US general Omar Bradley said he was running trucks up to the front “bumper to bumper, 24 hours a day”. Ford delivered the goods.But Britain also played a crucial part in victory. Had our embattled island gone the same way as Scandinavia, France and the Low Countries in the summer of 1940, Hitler would have thrown all his resources against the Soviet Union, while Roosevelt’s US would probably have turned in on itself and concentrated on defending the western hemisphere. Instead, a combination of Churchillian leadership, modern fighters linked to the new Chain Home system of radar and the courage of the RAF pilots managed to keep Hitler at bay. Eventually, Britain became the essential supply base and launchpad for the liberation of Hitler’s Fortress Europe.And so in 1944-45, the allied armies converged on Germany from east, west and south. Of course, it was an unholy alliance, animated by divergent aims and values. But the extermination of nazism was a goal all the allies shared.Trump is waging war against his own citizens in Los Angeles | Judith LevineRead moreWith this in mind, let’s glance back to the US’s most important victory: independence. Yes, this was in large measure a David v Goliath story of “a small rag-tag army defeating the mightiest empire in the world”. The US’s independence was indeed testimony to George Washington’s leadership and his troops’ courage and resilience (reinforced by his insistence on inoculation against the smallpox epidemic). But this wasalso a world waras the British empire battled against its global foes. Crucially, by the 1780s Britain lost naval supremacy because (unusually) three rival seapowers had combined against it: France, Spain and the Dutch. It was blockade by the French fleet that forced Lord Cornwallis’s historic surrender at Yorktown in 1781 and British acceptance of American independence.The purpose of historical research is to set events in context, not to boost national pride. The story of the US’s founding, like that of Hitler’s defeat, reminds us that allies matter – in the past, the present and the future. That should not be forgotten when history goes on parade.David Reynolds’s most recent book is Mirrors of Greatness: Churchill and the leaders who shaped him.

This is not the open-hearted Britain I rememberJack NichollsI used to be proud of my birthplace for its cosmopolitan tolerance. Visiting now, it feels like stepping back decadesSat 14 Jun 2025 16.00 EDTShareIwas visiting family in London when the British supreme court handed down itsunexpected ruling: under the Equality Act, sex was now considered “binary” in law, which meant transgender people could be banned from single-sex spaces of their gender identity. The Labour government, which had come into office promising us “dignity”, capitulated. But, not to worry, soothed a minister, Pat McFadden, “There isn’t going to be toilet police.”A few days later the toilet police got me.It was my last night in London before returning to Australia. I was in full makeup and a dress when my female friends took me out dancing at an alternative hub that has always prided itself on being an accepting space. And for an hour everything was great. We danced and drank and shouted incoherent enthusiasms to each other. But as the gin and tonics settled in my bladder, I felt my anxiety building. In 15 years of visiting Britain I have been presenting feminine in public without any problem, including using women’s bathrooms.But now I needed to piss, and I was afraid.‘British feminism needs reshaping’: Kate Nash on her new single about trans rightsRead moreSensing my discomfort my friends loyally announced their own need to pee. So we filed through a maze of corridors until we got to the pair of doors that have bifurcated so much of my life.And there she was. The literal toilet police. She was a stocky woman marking each visitor as they approached the door and, as we passed, she raised a finger of doom and pointed it at me. “NO,” she commanded, then rotated the finger towards the masculine pictogram. “Yougo there.”We froze. I didn’t want to speak, ashamed of further betraying myself by my voice. Drunk and anxious as I was, the idea of going to that male bathroom, alone, was just impossible.It was as a young adult in London that I first felt fully able to embrace my genderMy friends came to the rescue, telling the guard to back off and escorting me into the women’s, which was crowded with people. Gaze fixed downwards to hide my humiliation, I pushed into a cubicle and peed. My head was ringing, there were raised voices outside, then the rap at the door.“OUT!”There was commotion, complete strangers were clamouring, I think, in my defence. The toilet policewoman ignored it all. I was obviously leaving anyway; there was nothing to be gained now but my humiliation.I can’t remember if I was given a chance to wash my hands.For a minute afterwards I stood crying against the wall. Then the toilet policewoman returned and took up position in front of me. She looked a little ashamed, and she touched a now-gentler hand to my arm.“It’s not me,” she said. “It’s just the way things are now.”“Just the way things are” means Britain has become a country where trans people can be yanked from their sports teams; where cash-strapped businesses can be forced to ghettoise their customers or potentially face legal action; and where cisgender women deemed insufficiently feminine fear abuse by self-appointed bathroom vigilantes.Because that’s the thing about oppression: it widens. It affects us all.I was born in the United Kingdom and consider it my second home. For years I have recognised its cultural pessimism and economic stagnation but I still loved it for its humour, its history and particularly for its cosmopolitan tolerance. It was as a young adult in London that I first felt fully able to embrace my gender. And while on this trip my Australian partner and I had been discussing immigrating to Britain, trying to picture what it would be like to make a life there.Disabled campaigners watching ‘in horror’ as trans people face toilet segregationRead moreWell, my experience made one thing clear. It would feel like stepping back 20 years in time, to a world that prickles against your skin in a hundred ways and where every outing is consumed by the need to “pass” as a survival strategy. Where it’s easier to be silent than to speak.It’s not just Britain. In Trump’s America, transgender soldiersare being purged from the militaryand trans visitorsare cancelling travel to the USout of fear of discrimination. In April the Hungarian governmentpassed a constitutional amendmentbanning any assembling of queer people. Across the world it’s not just bathroom doors that are slamming shut for transgender people.In this moment of global reaction, Australia has never felt so much like an island refuge. And I am deeply grateful for that. But I mourn the open-hearted country that I remember Britain being.When a traveller lands at Heathrow airport, they are met by posters of beaming Britons, arms outstretched, above the words WELCOME! In the wake of this court ruling, the sentiment rings hollow.I may not have been allowed to wash my hands. But the British state has made it clear that it has washed its hands of me.Jack Nicholls is a British-Australian essayist and speculative-fiction writer based in MelbourneExplore more on these topicsTransgenderOpinionLGBTQ+ rightsGendercommentShareReuse this content"

Blaming migrants is a useful way to distract from thatSat 14 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 04.48 EDTShareIn 1972, loyalist paramilitaries fired bullets into the home of aCatholic woman, Sarah McClenaghan. That night she was at home with her lodger, a Protestant, and her disabled teenage son, David. After forcing her son to get his mother’s rosary beads, proving that she was Catholic, a loyalist paramilitary raped Sarah. David was tortured. The gang then shot them both, David dying of his wounds.I thought about David and Sarah as I watched rolling news of thepogroms in Ballymena. I thought about them in light of the lie that violence against women and girls has been imported to Northern Ireland via migrants or asylum seekers. It’s always been here.The rioters say they are acting to drive out foreigners who pose a threat to women and girls. The irony isn’t lost on anybody with knowledge of the local area. Modern-day loyalist paramilitaries are reportedly involved with the violence. In the Belfast Telegraph this week, journalist Allison Morris reported that members of theSouth East Antrim Ulster Defence Association are among the rioters. “The organisation,” she writes, “has been regularly named by our sister paper, the Sunday Life, as protecting sex offenders.” Morris regularly faces death threats for her brave reporting.The riots in Ballymena are about racism and nothing more. Hatred smothers every brick and petrol bomb thrown. Nobody causing trouble cares about women or children. There are no legitimate concerns at the heart of this. Local Facebook groups with links to the far right are asking for addresses to hit – Roma people are the main target of their ire. Flyers posted around towns and cities call for people to take a stand to protect “our women” and “our Christian values”.‘In 14 years, never anything like this’: Ballymena’s foreigners describe fear after riotingRead moreThe trigger for the violence in Ballymena was the trauma and pain of a local family. Earlier in the week, two 14-year-old boyswere arrested and chargedwith the attempted rape of a young girl. Romanian interpreters were required at court.After the arrests, the alleged victim’s family asked for support and solidarity from their local community. Hundreds did so, peacefully protesting to show the family that they weren’t alone. Then came the violence. The chief constable of the Police Service ofNorthern Ireland(PSNI) said the victim of the alleged assault has been “further traumatised” by the rioting. Her family have publicly called for the violence to stop.Women have never been safe in Northern Ireland. Generations bore the weight of the Troubles, running households and raising children with absent husbands. Hundreds were murdered in the conflict. During the peace talks that led to the Good Friday agreement, theWomen’s Coalition, a political party, described the 30-year conflict as an “armed patriarchy”.Northern Ireland isn’t a place where women and girls are cherished. The PSNI recorded4,090 sexual offences in Northern Irelandin 2023-24.Twenty-five women have been killedin five years, mostly by white men from Northern Ireland.I knew one of them: Natalie McNally. We used to be mates. She last contacted me to ask about the home-buying process (I used to be a conveyancing solicitor). Natalie was buying her first house and the process was dragging on. She was killed in that same house in December 2022, her 15-week-old son in her belly. I was holding my own four-week-old son when I learned that she was dead. The trial isdue to take place in November, with the accused previously indicating that he is pleading not guilty.View image in fullscreenPeople gather at Queens University Belfast to protest against the rise in femicide in Northern Ireland, 16 October 2024.Photograph: HeadlineX_/AlamyWell, some say, if we have lots of homegrown criminals, we don’t need more. This is, again, another racist argument, an age-old trope that non-white men are sexual deviants. The problem is men, full stop. In every country in the world, in every community and every faith, people hate women. Misogyny doesn’t respect borders. Fascists want to talk about foreign men to distract from their own disgusting behaviour.Immigration concerns have featured heavily in the news. Because of the Troubles, Northern Ireland always had low levels of migration. That has changed in recent years. Net migrationreached its highest levels in 15 yearsin 2024. No doubt this has changed certain areas and proved alienating for local people and migrants alike. However, according to a Northern Ireland assembly report, Northern Ireland is still theleast diverse region of the UK. Only 3.4% of people are from a minority ethnic group, compared to 18.3% in England.Before migrant numbers rose, Northern Ireland’s public services were on their knees. The health service has all but collapsed. The housing system is under considerable strain, we don’t have enough housing to meet demand and rents have risen to unaffordable levels.People have migrated into this mess. It would be churlish to deny that higher numbers have put pressure on the system. But it’s a flat-out lie to blame migrants and refugees for this country’s ills. Migrants didn’t decimate the NHS. Refugees didn’t underfund social housing and homeless services. Local and nationalpoliticians did that. They are doing very little to fix the systems that broke under their watch. It’s easier to blame people working as Deliveroo drivers.Northern Ireland needs to tackle its fondness for racism and xenophobia. Racially motivated hate crime is at its highest level since records began. It affects every community, Catholic and Protestant. You can’t “legitimate concern” your way through a pogrom and doing so only validates hatred.If women in Northern Ireland rioted every time one of us was attacked, the country would lie in ashes.Sarah Creighton is a lawyer, writer and political commentator from Northern IrelandDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why does it feel as inauthentic as ever?Eugene HealeyThe glossy perfection of millennial content gave way to something that felt more ‘real’. But that was a mirage – and brands quickly caught onEugene Healey is a brand strategy consultant, educator and creatorSat 14 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 13.34 EDTShareAuthenticity is the great mirage of the modern age. Its promise – to live unmediated, in full accordance with our values and beliefs – feels like the ideal we’re always reaching for before it vanishes beyond the horizon. And ironically, the more we try to prove we’re authentic online, the more we seem to accelerate its disappearance.As Generations Z and Alpha joined social media, they responded to the cultural demand for perfection with chaos – raw, unfiltered, deliberately messy content. The curated feed of flatlays gave way to the sloppy photo dump; the finstas; the bedrotting. Finally, our real lives represented on screen. Finally, something real.Except that this quickly became another role to be performed, a generation-defining content genre that has itself become subject to more and more extreme performances – filming oneself balling into the camera, extreme overshares, breakdowns in public. Vulnerability-as-aesthetic, where what began as a rejection of perfection has become its own form of perfectionism – the flawless execution of being flawed.To understand why authenticity is impossible, first we need to understand what social media has done to us. It’s turned personal identity into performance art – and in doing so, has transformed us all into brands (I should know, I’m a brand consultant).The modern experience is one of constantly being perceived.We view ourselves in the third person, as an entity to be managed. How will this action make me look? How can my lived experience be something I can capture?This isn’t limited to chronic social media users. Panoptic surveillance, whether state or private, makes us intensely conscious that every public action is potentially recorded, screenshotted and data-harvested. All the world’s a stage – and we’re all method actors who never break character.Why am I filled with nostalgia for a pre-internet age I never knew? | Isabel BrooksRead moreAuthenticity simply can’t survive this environment of constant performance – we become alienated from our own actions when every moment is filtered through the question of how it will be received.Social mediaaccelerates this process of negation.Ever-attuned to the unmet desires of our society, the marketing world has itself been through several iterations of packaging and selling authenticity over the past 15 years. Post the great financial crisis, our efforts to be “real and relatable” saw us shrugging off polished corporate messaging to ape the awkward-earnest tone of millennial-era entertainment such as Garden State or Girls. Brands such as Airbnb championed a Simon Sinek-personified approach – driven by a deeper purpose and appealing to a common underlying humanity.Like many aspects of millennial culture, this authenticityhas now been sufficiently roasted for its naive and cloying self-importance,but replaced by something arguably worse.Today’s brand “authenticity” means co-opting the gen Z performance of being “raw and unfiltered”. Go into any viralTikTokvideo and observe this peculiar modern dystopia: a legion of brands colonising the comment section, all speaking to one another in the same sardonic, self-aware, fourth-wall breaking, chronically online tone. The irony is, of course, that there is nothing less authentic than multinationals with billions of dollars in market capitalisation pretending to be jaded teenagers, yet here we are.If we want authenticity, we’ll need to unwind our culture of surveillance – to create spaces where actions aren’t immediately documented, dissected and distributed. But that feels like trying to uninvent the printing press. The infrastructure of observation has become so fundamental to how we live and work that opting out more or less means retreating from modern society altogether.So what we actually need, especially for our youth, is an unmaking of expectation – the suffocating demand that they ruthlessly optimise and curate every element of their lives for public presentation just to access a fraction of the economic prosperity their parents enjoyed. Because we’ve created a world where turning yourself into a brand isn’t a lifestyle choice but a survival strategy, particularly as AI puts a blowtorch to the remaining areas of knowledge work that once promised middle-class security.The internet has fundamentally altered the conditions under which genuine self-expression can exist. The solution isn’t to perform authenticity harder, but to recognise and jealously guard the remaining places where real authenticity might still be possible: in unrecorded conversations, in private moments, in closed networks that haven’t yet been colonised by the attention economy.Ironically, admitting we can’t be authentic online might be the closest thing to honesty we have left.Eugene Healey is a brand strategy consultant, educator and creatorExplore more on these topicsSocial mediaOpinionDigital mediaInternetInstagramTikTokcommentShareReuse this content"

Either that or racking up massive winter energy bills powering inefficient appliances in uninsulated homes.But according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), the first step to reducing massive bills and increasing winter comfort is to switch away from gas. Their mostrecent modelling showsthat a typical home in Melbourne could save over $1,300 annually by switching its gas appliances to efficient electric alternatives.With that in mind, what are the most carbon (and wallet) friendly ways to stay warm this winter?Reverse cycle air-con is your friendTim Forcey, author ofMy Efficient Electric Home Handbook,says that after working and writing about home efficiency for over a decade – the verdict is in and the most sustainable and cheapest way to heat your home over winter is with reverse-cycle air conditioners.Parenting in the climate crisis: how to raise kids who care about the environmentRead moreThe main hurdle preventing their widespread use comes down to branding. “We’ve demonised the use of air conditioners – some people still think they should only be used in emergencies,” he says. “But the reality is that heating with an air-con can cost a third of the cost of heating with gas.”Jay Gordon from IEEFA says he has calculated that a reverse-cycle air conditioner uses about afifth of the energyof a ducted heater. “Heat pump hot water systems are also several times more efficient than gas hot water systems, and homes that fully replace their gas appliances can save over $300 in fixed annual charges by disconnecting from the gas network,” he says.So switching away from gas is the first step towards a more efficient and less costly warm home in winter – and it is worth looking into any government rebates available in your area to take the sting out of upgrading your home.Don’t ditch the oil heater just yetElectric and oil heaters can of course still serve a purpose if used in small spaces such as under your desk at home, says Forcey, as they work like a toaster and can take the edge off. Many may also have the advantage of including timers to regulate their use, but it’s worth keeping track of how much energy they use to make sure you don’t get a nasty surprise at the end of winter.It’s worth noting that several Australian states are now offering significantrebates for installing electric appliances. InVictoria, if gas appliances break down, it is now often cheaper to replace them with more efficient electric appliances.Small improvements go a long wayWe all know that most older Australian homes and apartments can feel like glorified tents in winter so DIY, low-cost improvements such as draught stoppers, gap sealings, and even installing heavy curtains and keeping them closed during the day, can help your home retain heat and remove drafts.A guide to greener banking: I divested my personal finances and you can too – here’s howRead moreOn top of renewable energy upgrades, it’s also vital that you prepare your home with back-to-basics thermal efficiency improvements. The most practical home renovations you could make includedouble-glazing your windowsand upgrading ceiling insulation. These investments can make a big impact in terms of reducing energy consumption and cost.It’s also worth considering having asmart meterinstalled in your home to help understand and regulate your overall energy consumption patterns. These will allow you to monitor your electricity consumption in real time (even remotely) and eliminate the need for manual meter readings or estimated bills.Take advantage of the sunFor those renting or without the budget to upgrade your home’s energy system or undertake costly renovations – other practical measures include something as simple as taking advantage of the sun’s rays during the day by spending more time in those rooms that attract the most direct sunlight.And if double-glazing is outside your budget, using bubble-wrap over the windows in winter is a poor-man’s solution that will help regulate your home’s thermal envelope. Another age-old trick I’ve found myself doing is wearing my mother’s warm hand-knitted socks both around the home and in bed to increase personal comfort levels as the mercury drops.Of course, perhaps the most practical way to stay warm this winter might be to find yourself a warm pet or human to cuddle. But that’s something no government rebate can help you with.Explore more on these topicsHousingChange by degreesEnergyexplainersShareReuse this content"

Are there any left?In pop, which equates genius with innovation, recent artists have not pioneered new forms like those from the 60s. Has the digital age sidelined invention and promoted the derivative for ever?Rachel AroestiSat 14 Jun 2025 05.17 EDTFirst published on Sat 14 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTShareView image in fullscreenBrian Wilson was a genius: are there any left?Composite: AP Bettmann Archive / WireImage / Alicia Canter / Getty Images / Don Hunstein / ReutersBy all accounts, Brian Wilson was a genius. His fellow greats Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney both used the word in their tributes to the creative force behind the Beach Boys, whodied this weekaged 82. So did John Cale, Mick Fleetwood and Elton John. And so did Wilson’s bandmates, who wrote in a joint statement: “The world mourns a genius today.”You may imagine Wilson gradually accrued such a vaunted standing. Artistic legacy is largely dependent on the longevity of mass appeal, and the fact that the Beach Boys’ opusPet Soundsremains one of the most celebrated and beloved records of all time almost 60 years since its release is proof enough of his incredible talent.Wilson’s claim to genius status began with a 1966 PR campaign masterminded by the ex-Beatles publicist Derek Taylor. Fortunately, Wilson’s output justified it, and after spreading like wildfire through the British music press the “Brian Wilson is a genius” rhetoric quickly caught on, “especially with the UK public”, says Wilson’s biographer, David Leaf. It has been the consensus ever since.Do we just imagine musical geniuses are anointed in retrospect because we no longer have any? It is extremely difficult to argue that any artist of the last 30 years has reached the trailblazing standard of Wilson, Dylan, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Joni Mitchell and David Bowie. The remaining members of those acts are all over 80 (with the sole exception of Ronnie Wood at 78); Stevie Wonder is 75, Brian Eno is 77, Ralf Hütter, the surviving founder of Kraftwerk, is 78.View image in fullscreenThe Beach Boys in London in November 1964.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyThe most recent claimants to the musical genius title are generally considered to have been Michael Jackson andPrince, both of whom died relatively young. Soon, the very idea of a living legend will be a thing of the past.In pop music, which reveres the new, genius is synonymous with innovation. Obviously, it is no coincidence that all of our unique and innovative musical minds were of a similar generation, starting work in the 1970s – at the very latest – when all the new drum, guitar and keyboard sounds and most resonant, memorable melodies were there for the taking. Such was the virgin territory before them, theBeach Boyseven had the opportunity to sonically codify California, one of the most culturally significant places on the planet.“I guess I just wasn’t made for these times,” Wilson once sang. But if he hadn’t been operating in those lonely years, would he have been considered a genius at all?What is also quite clear is that musical progress didn’t abruptly end half a century ago. There is still as-yet-unheard music to be made – and made it is, all the time. Generic fusions, formal variations and experimental production techniques are not infinite but they are definitely not exhausted, and some have even coalesced into era-defining movements, as 21st-century genres such as grime, trap and hyperpop prove.View image in fullscreenPrince in 2007. He is one of the most recent claimants to the musical genius title.Photograph: Chris O’Meara/APAdele, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift – inoffensively palatableSome genres – including grime, which can be convincingly traced back to the British producer Wiley and his turn-of-the-millennium experiments; and hyperpop, the brainchild of the London producer AG Cook and his PC Music collective – even have specific originators. Yet they still haven’t produced any bona fide musical geniuses.First, the entirely explicable part. The demise of the monoculture – due to technology’s fracturing of the media and cultural landscape – means only the most aggressively mainstream and inoffensively palatable acts (Adele, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift) are able to command the same level of fame and musical familiarity as their 1960s counterparts.Meanwhile, invention has remained staunchly at the cultural fringes – and if it does get anywhere near the zeitgeist, the journey is leisurely. Grime took off a full decade after its creation, thanks to Skepta and Stormzy; so did hyperpop, which reached the masses last summer in the guise of Charli xcx’s Brat.View image in fullscreenWiley, a pioneer of grime in the early 2000s, did not see the genre take off until a decade later, with his fame eclipsed by other performers.Photograph: Ollie Millington/RedfernsThis is another reason why musical genius is so thin on the ground: the people who do the actual innovating rarely end up in the spotlight themselves. This seems especially so in comparison with the 1960s; it is impossible to separate personal achievement from the decade’s goldrush – a manic crusade to push pop and rock to its absolute limits.The famous rivalry between Wilson and the Beatles – healthy competition for the latter, says Leaf, if not so much for the former – accelerated progress and incentivised change. The pressure is also thought to have contributed to the decline in Wilson’s mental health later in the decade.But then comes the more mysterious part. What is so astonishing about Wilson is how many different groundbreaking things he did simultaneously. In the studio, “he was inventing a new way of making popular music,” Leaf says. “What he called modular recording – recording bits and pieces of a song and then piecing it together.” He also pioneered the idea of one person helming all elements of a recorded song: composition, arrangement, performance, mixing, production.On top of that, he did something lyrically radical. He transformed pop into an “emotional autobiography,” says Leaf. “He was determined to put his feelings on to the recording tape and share it with the world,” which at that time was very much not the norm. Many of pop’s canonical artists were similar: Dylan didn’t just single-handedly make popular music a vessel for poetry, he also infused it with an all-new attitude and emotional palette (cynicism, disgust, rebellion), while conflating his previous folk fare with rock to create an entirely new sound.Dylan’s decision to go electric has become emblematic of the musical genius’s requirement to shock. Even Pet Sounds, an onslaught of loveliness, disturbed the band’s record label with its leaps of progress, says Leaf.View image in fullscreenBob Dylan in 1974. His decision to go electric has become emblematic of the musical genius’s requirement to shock.Photograph: Jeff Robbins/APPop, sex and violenceNowadays, pop music is only really controversial where it overlaps with sex and violence; it is practically impossible to sonically surprise the listening public.The prospect of the end of musical innovation is something students and lovers of guitar music have already had to make peace with – at this point, nostalgia is inherent to the genre. “I’m aware it’s impossible to make genuinely new, novel guitar music, and so I tend to lean into anachronism,” was how Owen Williams, frontman of my new favourite old-sounding band, the Tubs, once put it.Just as selling out became a respected career move, explicit derivation is now an artform in itself; in recent yearsBeyoncéhas stayed at the forefront of pop by essentially becoming a kind of musical historian.View image in fullscreenBeyoncé on stage in London on her Cowboy Carter tour.Photograph: Parkwood Entertainment/PAThere is one thing that does feel jarring about the slowed pace of musical progress. Technological advancement has always been woven into sonic novelty – the advent of synths (which Wilson also anticipated), for example, or sampling. Considering technology has accelerated in unimaginable, terrifying ways over the past 20 years, you’d think that might be reflected in the pop zeitgeist.Instead, we have a chart stuffed with tracks that essentially could have been made at any point in the past 50 years. Perhaps the late 20th century – and particularly the 1960s – created a sort of natural selection of music: we found the combinations of notes and rhythms that appealed most to the western human ear and that is what we have continued to rehash.AI to the rescue?Surely, then, this is a problem artificial intelligence may be able to solve. This is technology determined to get to know us more intimately than we know ourselves. What better way to continue the quest for novel pop perfection that Wilson embarked on 60 years ago?In theory, it could supplant human creativity. In actuality, AI is unlikely to wrest control of pop’s soul from humans. That’s because musical innovation, and even catchy melodies, have ceded importance to the branding of people. If Swift’s gargantuan success is anything to go by – which it probably is – pop’s future depends on the carefully honed appeal of an individual human personalities, not what they can do on a keyboard (the musical kind).View image in fullscreenTaylor Swift’s approach to her public image and the music business are groundbreaking, even if her music isn’t.Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAPSwift’s approach to her public image and the music business in general is groundbreaking in its own way, even if her music isn’t. We will be mourning her as a cultural figure at some point, but a musical genius? That would take some real cognitive dissonance.It seems unlikely we will do so with anyone by the end of this century; we have no currently minted visionaries, although time will tell if anyone retroactively earns the title. What is certain is that as the pop canon continues to splinter into thousands of smaller, personal rosters, we will be losing musicians who mean everything to some people, but not – like Wilson – something to almost everyone."

If part of this was due to a storming set taking in their new hit Common People, debuts for their future hits Mis-Shapes and Disco 2000, and the star power of singerJarvis Cocker, it was also down to their look.There was Steve Mackay, bass guitarist, in a fitted shirt and kipper tie, Russell Senior on violin in a blue safari shirt, keyboardist Candida Doyle in sequins and – of course – Cocker, in his now signature secondhand 70s tailoring.Fast forward to 2025 and Pulp have their first album in 24 years,More, and a tour taking in the UK, Europe and the US. It is a moment that will put their music and their style back in the public eye.While the bucket hats, parkas and round specs of Oasis, the otherBritpopband on tour this summer, are likely to dominate what young men are wearing, Pulp’s look is an alternative one that celebrates the secondhand.View image in fullscreen‘The influence of Pulp’s look in the 90s was partly about the sugar high of its eclectic, graphic take on nostalgia but also its accessibility.’ Pulp in 1998.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty ImagesAs Cocker writes in his book Good Pop, Bad Pop, his first jumble-sale buy, a garish 70s shirt, was “the real beginning of the Pulp aesthetic”. Its pomp can be seen in videos such as for1993’s Babies– with Cocker topless in a flared suit, Mackay in another garish print and Doyle in mod-ish stripes.The influence of Pulp’s look in the 90s was partly about the sugar high of its eclectic, graphic take on nostalgia but also its accessibility.“[Other bands] had a secondhand look, but Pulp made it a little bit more colourful, not quite kitsch, but on the edge of kitsch,” says Miranda Sawyer, the author of the Britpop history Uncommon People.Doyle says: “They obviously looked stylish but you did think, ‘OK I can get that stuff’. We were skint for a lot of the first 10 years being in Pulp. I used to find some amazing things [in charity shops].”Three decades later, and secondhand shopping once again dominates the way young people dress. Peter Bevan, 30, a stylist and contributing editor of the Rakish Gent, says: “Everyone I know who’s my age or younger shops in charity shops, in vintage shops, Depop, Vinted. I don’t know many people that buy loads of new things any more.” Asurvey in 2023found that 64% of gen Z will look for an item secondhand before buying it new.While part of this is likely down to cost and environmental concerns, the haphazard nature of secondhand shopping is championed as a way to express yourself through clothing. “Everyone who looks cool [now] is doing them rather than trying to do something else,” adds Bevan, who says this is why Pulp appeal. “Although obviously [Pulp] all made very considered choices that work together you can tell that they’re [each] dressing for them[selves] as well.”View image in fullscreen‘You can tell they’re each dressing for themselves’. Pulp in 1995.Photograph: Mick Hutson/RedfernsJames Millar, a 22-year-old guitarist in the band the Sukis, regularly shares videos of his Cocker-like looks to the band’s103.4k TikTok followers, and watched Pulp perform in Dublin this week. “[Cocker] is heavily influenced by 70s fashion … but he’s not doing 70s cosplay. When I see pictures of him, and what he wears, it just looks like him,” he says.While Doyle bristles at being classed as a Britpop band – “we don’t associate with [it] because of the union jack,” she says – they will inevitably becompared with Oasis, with both bands touring this summer. Style-wise, Bevan says Pulp come out on top. “I like the Oasis look but [they were originally about a] counter-culture fashion moment. Now it feels like they’re meant to look like they’re not trying hard in a fashion way but in reality they are trying really hard to look cool. Pulp all have their own personal sense of style that goes way beyond throwing on a Stone Island windbreaker and a pair of jeans.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s good with tassels, because when you move, it comes with you.”She says clothes were even part of what helped form Pulp in the first place. “We all grew up in Sheffield, and if you dressed a bit strangely, you stood out. So we’d all congregate at the same venues,” she says, adding insight that sounds like a lost lyric from revenge of the nerds anthem, Mis-Shapes: “There’d be townies and weirdos, squares and students.”Perhaps the enduring appeal of Pulp’s style is once again about the triumph of Mis-Shapes, with its lyrics of “misshapes, mistakes, misfits”, and how expressing your personality through the lucky dip of secondhand clothing is a win. “Jarvis understands his appeal,” says Sawyer. “He’s accentuating all the things that people have picked on him for. He’s saying, ‘I’m a tall weed or whatever you wanted to call me. This is who I am and, actually, I look great’.”Explore more on these topicsPulpBritpopJarvis CockerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One which has seen Emmanuel Macron confronted over whether it was right to marry his former teacher and Danny Dyer probed about whether he has ajoint bank account with his wife. Celebrities have been caught off guard, or left sobbing and laughing in equal measure.The Assembly, in which an audience of autistic, neurodivergent and learning disabled people ask unpredictable, probing and often remarkably direct questions of a celebrity, has won plaudits and rave reviews since launching in 2022. It has now become an international phenomenon.The show, which originated in France, had more international commissions than the all-conquering reality hit The Traitors last year. The format has already been commissioned across 19 countries, according to an industry report by K7 Media. Ten new versions have already been confirmed.Unusually for a new European format, The Assembly is already making its mark in Asia: it will launch in Singapore in January. It is heading into its fourth series in France and has been a hit in Norway, Australia and Denmark – succeeding on public and private broadcasters.Michael Sheen on The Assembly.Its producers say the authenticity of the show has created its universal appeal – while the clippable content is perfect for a social media age in which broadcasters are desperate to reach younger audiences glued to their feeds.Stu Richards, creative director of the programme’s UK producers Rockerdale Studios, said it was crucial the show was billed as having broad appeal, rather than as a programme highlighting neurodiversity. “It’s not just representation for the sake of it – it’s not tokenistic,” he said. “We see this as mainstream entertainment.”The stripped-back look of the show – shot over three hours in natural light with the camera crew in full view – adds to the sense that viewers are getting an unfiltered experience. “There’s an honesty that you just don’t get in other TV shows,” said Richards.“It has non-culturally specific values like honesty and by extension, empathy. In shows with disabled people, you as a viewer are almost always asked to be sympathetic towards the people you’re seeing. You’re rarely asked to empathise. In this show, our cast have the authorship, they have the agency.”Richards said he was sold on the idea immediately after seeing Macron asked bluntly about the propriety of his marital relationship. “When I saw that question, I thought: this is something unlike any interview format I’ve seen,” he said. “We’ve had interview formats in the past, like Ali G, where people have tried to ask comedically funny questions. But the president of France asked about the age gap with his older wife? Boom, yes. I’m completely in.”For broadcasters desperate to reach new audiences to be found on social media, the format also lends itself to short clips, as an unsuspecting celebrity responds to a left-field question. Several of such clips, featuring Macron,Michael Sheenand the Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in the Danish edition, have gone viral.“That’s the mother load for so many commissioners and broadcasters at the moment,” said Michelle Singer, Rockerdale’s director of production.Coster-Waldau broke down when talking about the death of his alcoholic father. In the Australian edition, the Jurassic Park actor Sam Neill was similarly floored when asked about the best lesson he had learned from his parents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They said the dynamic between the cast and the interviewee meant it was unlike other chatshows or political programmes. “It’s the authenticity,” said Arnaud Renard, co-founder of Can’t Stop Media, the programme’s distributor. “Everybody gets it. Everybody understands it’s a show where we have people that are going to ask unexpected questions – but without bad feelings. We’re not trying to trick people.”Despite the show’s international success, it has had an unusual journey in the UK. A pilot featuring Sheen was made for the BBC, but the corporation is said to have concluded it did not have the funds to make a series. It has since found success on ITV, where the first series featured David Tennant, Jade Thirlwall, Gary Lineker and Dyer – who, among other things, was asked how much he was paid for presenting the Saturday night gameshow The Wall (about £100,000).Bigger names have been booked for follow-up series overseas, though producers are sworn to secrecy. To take it to the next level in the UK, fans are hoping a British politician might be brave enough to enter The Assembly should a second series materialise.“It’s interesting that the idea for this programme grew from the grilling ofEmmanuel Macron.” said Tim Nicholls, assistant director of policy, research and strategy at the National Autistic Society. “Wouldn’t it be great if we could see British politicians subjected to the same scrutiny by autistic interviewers?”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAutismEmmanuel MacronDanny DyerMichael SheennewsShareReuse this content"

The results are stunning – and chillingDiane SmythSat 14 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 06.49 EDTShareIn September the Pompidou Centre in Pariscloses for five yearsfor renovation. The building is nearly 50 years old and needs to be cleared of asbestos, and to reconnect with Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers’ original design after years of architectural accumulations. Many of the departments are already moving into temporary new homes, including the huge Bibliothèque publique d’information, the public library usually based on the second floor. Nearly all of its contents have been emptied out, but before it’s stripped back altogether, Wolfgang Tillmans has been invited to deconstruct it another way. His show,Rien ne nous y préparait – Tout nous y préparait(Nothing could have prepared us – Everything could have prepared us) covers all 6,000 sq metres of the space.It’s an inspired setting because Tillmans’ work circles around questions of information. He makes documentary photographs but questions the parameters of photographic vision. In his ongoing Truth Study Center he collates newspaper cuttings, photographs, photocopies, drawings and objects on trestle tables, encouraging viewers to consider these elements and their claims to veracity; his installations are always site-specific, and take a nuanced approach to display. Situated in the Bpi, Rien ne nous y préparait – Tout nous y préparait is a meditation on knowledge, how it is organised, and where its limitations lie. “I do trust my eyes, I want to trust observation, study, but for that it is very important that I sharpen my eyes to how I see, how we record, what we capture,” says Tillmans.View image in fullscreenMaking it look easy … Moon in Earthlight by Wolfgang Tillmans.Photograph: Courtesy Galerie Buchholz, Galerie Chantal Crousel, Paris, Maureen Paley, London, David Zwirner, New YorkThe artist had been invited to show work from throughout his 40-year career, but this isn’t a retrospective and it isn’t arranged chronologically. Instead it’s a response to the space, and it’s a space with a big personality. The Pompidou’s distinctive blue pipes snake across the ceiling and a bold carpet covers the floor, mostly grey, with some lime green stripes and squares, and the occasional stain. The carpet also features purple patches in seemingly abstract designs; this is an even older carpet, already there when the grey one was added in 2000. The fitters cut around bookshelves and partitions to lay the grey and so, when those fixtures were removed, a ghostly imprint of the library was revealed. For Tillmans the resulting palimpsest suggests a photographic negative, and it’s something he was keen to keep; elsewhere he’s retained shelving, library books, magazines, the photocopying room, tables, individual study booths and signage.The vacated BPI requires an exceptionally talented – and prolific artist – but Tillmans makes it look easy. Celebrated images such as Moon in Earthlight (2015) share wall space with the fire extinguishers; a long, thin corridor suggesting a rat run is home to a mid-1990s series on a street rodent. Some of the images are displayed at very large size, such as The State We’re In, A (2015), a documentary shot of a paradoxically ever-changing sea, or Panorama, right (2006), and Panorama, left (2024), which each measure six metres long. These huge works are cheek-by-jowl with much smaller images, even postcard dimensions, creating a physical experience worlds away from same-size online viewing. Some prints are framed, some clipped up, some stuck to the wall, each suggesting questions about how photography isolates what it shows.Not that Tillmans is sniffy about mass-reproduction. Vinyl-printed versions of the Panorama images are also installed in Berlin’s Berghain nightclub, the exhibition booklet informs, while tables towards the end of the space gather his work with magazines, including Arena Homme+ and Butt. There are also tables devoted to his photobooks, one displaying every spread of 1997 publication Concorde, a testament to 1960s techno-utopianism and cross-channel co-operation. At the end of the exhibition there’s a BPI reading table, complete with reading lights, and his monographs free to flip through. In the Autoformation [“Self-education”] booths there are videos on demand, allowing visitors to explore as they choose. Elsewhere are reproductions of image and text pieces Tillmans circulated online and as posters, exhorting readers to vote Remain, or against Marine Le Pen or Donald Trump. Some of these images and texts made it on to T-shirts, and there are photographs of people wearing them. “What is lost is lost forever,” reads a rallying cry about Brexit, a message the march of time has made forlorn. Nothing could have prepared us, though on the other hand Tillmans did try.View image in fullscreenParadoxical … The State We’re In, A, by Wolfgang Tillmans.Photograph: Courtesy Galerie Buchholz, Galerie Chantal Crousel, Paris, Maureen Paley, London, David Zwirner, New YorkTillmans isn’t anti-technology at all, speaking excitedly at the press view of the new possibilities afforded in the 2000s by ever-faster digital cameras. One of the intriguing aspects of this show is seeing how consistent his interest in technology has been, with very early works such as distorted black-and-white photocopies from 1988 sitting happily alongside contemporary prints.A final room is a sound installation, 2018’s I want to make a film, in which Tillmans narrates a potential project looking at digital technologies, while another installation, Travelling Camera (2025), hovers across the back of a digital 4k screen, a usually hidden infrastructure he has dotted with found fragments such as seashells and postage stamps. It’s not kit for the geeky sake of it, as evidenced by a large photograph of Russian troops in Moscow, shot in 2005. Tillmans is asking what we know, and how; what we notice, or are shown, and what remains obscure.At the Pompidou Centre, Paris, until 22 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsPhotographyreviewsShareReuse this content"

What to read at a modern ceremony? Plus, leading poets pick their favouritesTell us: what poem would you choose to read at a wedding?Caroline BirdSat 14 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTShareImarried my wife in October 2022 and, in the lead-up, it was obviously my job to source the wedding poems. I have published seven poetry collections, I read poetry every day, I own more than a thousand poetry books. I should have read through my favourites till I found the perfect fit. But that’s not what I did.Instead, for some bizarre reason, I sat down at my laptop and furtively Googled the words “wedding poem”. Why do we all do this, poets included? Well, I think, even though we want to express something deeply personal, the word “wedding” makes us all panic and reach for stock texts. Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s How Do I Love Thee? or The Passionate Shepherd to His Love by Christopher Marlowe (“Come live with me and be my love”) or Ecclesiastes 4 (“Two are better than one”).View image in fullscreenCaroline Bird and her wife on their wedding day.Photograph: Kerri Bough/KB photographyUp until very recently, a wedding was no place for reinvention. Now, gay marriage is legal in Britain; heterosexual couples can have civil partnerships; you can get married in a yurt or a cave or on a rollercoaster. But the old traditions die hard, and despite these new freedoms, the word “wedding” still influences our imaginations in ways that can feel alienating or limiting. When it comes to the “wedding poem”, even a Star Trek-themed do will find us translating the same old Shakespeare sonnet into Klingon.My friend and fellow poet Rachel Long and I decided the time was right for a brand-new wedding anthology, “alternative poems for alternative weddings”, shaking up the genre. When a publisher picked up our idea we felt smug that we would be getting paid to spend months reading love poetry – now all we had to do was pull together 100 wedding poems that fitted our brief of “something new”. We arrived at thePoetryLibrary in London, the largest public collection of modern poetry in the world, armed with a list of our favourite contemporary poets. The hard part, we agreed, would be whittling them down.In order to sift for suitable poems, we’d given ourselves these criteria:1) Does not necessarily need to mention weddings, but must believe in the concept of lasting love.2) The hope must outweigh the sadness.3) No profoundly grim last lines.Simple, right? As we quickly discovered, these criteria ruled out nearly every contemporary love poem ever written. Our Poetry Library days looked something like this: two women hunched in silence over poetry books, speed-reading and frowning. Our dialogue consisted mainly of “No”. Occasionally one of us would say, “Maybe?” – and the other would sit up like a meerkat, briefly hopeful – then we’d read on and say: “Oh no, sorry, the last line is about the inevitability of death.” Charles Simic’s Listen begins “Everything about you, my life, is both make-believe and real” – promising, I thought – then ends with “a small child leaping out of a window with its nightclothes on fire”. Fantastic ending, not a wedding poem.Sometimes one of us was sure, then the other would take a closer look and ask, ‘Isn’t this about an affair?’Sometimes one of us was sure – “Yes! This is a beautiful wedding poem!” – then the other would take a closer look and ask “Isn’t this about an affair?”, or “But doesn’t this leave the reader with a deep, pervading loneliness?” or, and this became a frequent question, “Is it a bit too sexy?” Could a wedding poem really proclaim, “I place your ring on my cock where it belongs”? (American Wedding by Essex Hemphill.) As the piles of books dwindled, our list barely grew. Days went by, then weeks, then months. Reading love poems became a slog.As summer turned to autumn, Rachel and I spent the evenings manically texting each other vast threads of poems from our personal bookshelves. What the hell did we actually mean by a wedding poem, anyway? What were we looking for? Love poems, of course. But what kind? As our reading attested, a huge majority of contemporary love poems are tinged with doom; and this is expected, after all, as often the emotional key to effective poetry is contradiction, an alloy of joy and sadness, anxiety and hope, clashing together to spark the unparaphrasable world of a poem.View image in fullscreenRachel Long.Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty ImagesHowever, if a celebrant stood up and said, “Statistically 42% of marriages end in divorce,” they’d be breaking the rules of the day and perhaps get a glass of prosecco thrown in their face. The point of a wedding is to provide you with enough optimism, support, encouragement and affirmation to sustain you through the hard times ahead; therefore, to be a wedding poem, a love poem mustn’t let in too much hard reality, or predict the end of love, or contain so much emotional ambiguity that it pours a gravy boat of sorrow over the vol-au-vents. But what about tone? What tone should a wedding poem have?We realised this was the wrong question. Every wedding, every couple is different. The dream of the “perfect wedding poem” is something that speaks directly, seemingly specifically, to a particular love. We can all picture that guy standing up to the microphone to awkwardly read a poem, using words (and a wooden poetry voice) that sound nothing like him. Well, I’m a firm believer that if a poem speaks to you, it will speak like you when you read it aloud. So, we didn’t want a “one-size-fits-all” anthology. We needed to be braver. Maybe a wedding poem could be a bit sexy? Or reflect real love in a difficult world? Unrequited, probably not, but funny and irreverent? Yes. These were alternative poems for alternative weddings, after all, be they small, huge, camp as Christmas, hilarious, glamorous, shotgun, a third wedding held in a nursing home, or the low-key but profound culmination of a 40-year love.I’m a firm believer that if a poem speaks to you, it will speak like you when you read it aloudWho says a wedding poem should feature stars, skies and rivers? Who limited our imaginations in that way? What about vacuum cleaners, the Tapton Bridge, black Chevrolets, cheese and onion rolls, brass bands, scaffolding and kittiwakes? What about “the ethereal gleam of wet tarmac”? (Michael Pederson.) Or laughter that “fills up the corners of the room with a thousand upside down cartoon bats”? (Hera Lindsay Bird.)After all, weddings need poems because poetry can express the inexpressible, translate longing into language, throw a can of paint over an abstract feeling. We reach for poems on these days because “love” is too small a syllable to elaborate on the endless uniqueness of the heart. So, rather than creating a safe generic tone across the whole anthology, we decided to include all tones, so that at least one poem would speak to a reader’s wedding specifically. Perhaps the couple are two lighthouses joined by a “beam of alignment” (Two Lighthouses by Julia Darling)? A Mr and Mrs “unveiling each other” (Measuring Light by Theresa Lola)? Masons, building a wall of “sure and solid stone” (Scaffolding by Seamus Heaney)? “Pure flame and song” (Serenade by Terrance Hayes)? “Two fat cats in love” (Cat Worship by Golnoosh Nour)? “Less silk and lace, more heather and thistle” (A Boy Gets Married by Lewis Buxton)? Or flying to the moon “by the speed of queer zest” ( i love you to the moon & by Chen Chen)?Finally, we had an anthology of one hundred (and one) newly selected poems for the big day, of all sizes, flavours and styles. Some are cheeky, some are weird, some sexy, subtle, domestic, ecstatic and sweet.

Delivery charges may apply.Alternative readings for the big dayTwo LighthousesbyJulia DarlingI would like us to live like two lighthousesat the mouth of a river, each with her own lamp.We could see each other across the water,which would be dangerous, and uncrossable.I could watch your shape, your warm shadow,moving in the upper rooms. We would have jokes.Jokes that were only ours, signs and secrets,flares on birthdays, a rocket at Christmas.Clouds would be cities, we would look for omens,and learn the impossible language of birds.We would meet, of course, in cinemas, cafes,but then, we would return to our towers,knowing the other was the light on the water,a beam of alignment. It would never be broken.The KissbyStephen DunnShe pressed her lips to mind.– a typoHow many years I must have yearnedfor someone’s lips against mind.Pheromones, newly born, were floatingbetween us. There was hardly any air.She kissed me again, reaching that placethat sends messages to toes and fingertips,then all the way to something like home.Some music was playing on its own.Nothing like a woman who knowsto kiss the right thing at the right time,then kisses the things she’s missed.How had I ever settled for less?I was thinking this is intelligence,this is the wisest tonguesince the Oracle got into a Greek’s ear,speaking sense. It’s the Good,defining itself. I was out of my mind.She was in. We married as soon as we could.Excerpted from Everything Else in the World: Poems. Copyright (c) 2006 by Stephen Dunn.

All rights reserved.Poets pick their favourite wedding poemsAndrew McMillanThe joy of a wedding is the singular love celebrated within a community; and the party afterwards, of course. The Wickedest, by Caleb Femi, is a collection that captures that vibe perfectly, and a great one to read aloud would be Max Meets Shelley on the Balcony. It begins: “like a planet flung I danced / unroped”. A perfect start or end to any ceremony.Joelle TaylorLawless and adventurous, XIII from Adrienne Rich’s Twenty-One Love Poems in The Dream of a Common Language is a poem to launch a lesbian marriage.The rules break like a thermometer,quicksilver spills across the charted systems,we’re out in a country that has no languageno laws, we’re chasing the raven and the wrenthrough gorges unexplored since dawnwhatever we do together is pure inventionthe maps they gave us were out of dateby years …It is a sonnet to another way of life, another kind of love, its unmapped territory being the thrill of it. It ends with a moving sense of ancestry, of wrong-walking women connected across time.Wendy CopeAt our wedding a friend read the Apache Wedding Blessing. My favourite lines are “Now there is no more loneliness / For each of you will be companion to the other”. It ends: “May your days be good and long upon the earth.” I later learned that it is “fake folklore”, written in 1947. I’m glad I didn’t know that at the time. I still like it.Michael RosenWhen I got married we read pieces about things we liked that were personal to us, so they don’t really translate – but here’s a new poem:When you get marriedthey ask you to write an inscriptionThink of it as beinglike taking out a subscription.You should sign itwith a feeling of elationand hope it won’t endwith a cancellation.Mary Jean Chan“At twenty, yes: we thought we’d live forever. /At forty-five, I want to know even our limits.” I love Adrienne Rich’sTwenty-One Love Poems, which speaks about love as a political act, one that arrives like a revelation and endures against all odds in a patriarchal and violent world. Elsewhere, Rich writes, “I choose to love this time for once / with all my intelligence”.Len PennieWe tend to think of love as a completed action, a noun trapped in amber, a red rose. I wrote a poem called The Vow, which will be published in my new collection, Poyums Annaw, to acknowledge love as a verb, a choice, an action and commitment that’s continually taken every single day. It’s a visceral, embodied action unique to every person and relationship. It celebrates what it is “To be loved through each compromise, question or qualm / To be sheltered from storm and enshrined in the calm / To be held, not like glass, but the end of a deal”. And ends: “I am yours for as long as you’d like to be mine / If you ask me, I’m certain, forever is fine.”Harry Josephine GilesLove is overburdened with old images, so we need poems to help us see it clearly again. In Gràdh (Love) Aonghas Pàdraig Caimbeul compares it to a bird hanging upside down, eating nuts from a feeder:Cho daingeann’s a tha gràdh,a’ crochadh an sinsna speuran.(How solid / love is / hanging there / in the air.)Marriage is one of those heavy stories that wants lightening up if it’s to sing: this simple lyric, in ordinary Gaelic worn smooth by good use, could bring breath into the ceremony so that people can see love hanging there in the air above them.Rishi DastidarA friend once commissioned a poem from me for his wedding. I wrote something I thought was plangently romantic. I was summoned to a crisis meeting, where the bride-to-be said: “Can you make it funny?” Now if asked for a wedding poem I’d suggest Victoria Kennefick’sDeposition, with its ardent evocation of the marriage between waves and cliffs: “silt and foam, my wedding dress; spray and salt, my veil”.Explore more on these topicsPoetryRomance booksWeddingsLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It begins, of course, with Margaret ThatcherLucy ManganSat 14 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTShareHello and welcome to the latest addition to Adam Curtis’s growing compendium of documentaries I have unofficially entitled How Did Things Get So Shit? Let Me Explain in a Weirdly Uplifting Manner. Previous volumes include The Century of the Self, The Power of Nightmares, The Trap: What Happened to Our Dream of Freedom, All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace, HyperNormalisation, Can’t Get You Out of My Head and Russia 1985-1999: TraumaZone.Even if you have not had the challenging pleasure of watching, the titles alone should be enough to evoke most of the concerns found therein – the rise of individualism, the fragmentation of old systems, the political vacuums new people and powers have rushed to fill, the death rattle of formerly dependable entities on which western civilisation has traditionally rested and once allowed us to sleep peacefully at night, the creeping destabilisation of all things, and so very much on.The new entrant is a five-part series called Shifty. It is a rare purely UK-focused dissection of recent history, built around the idea that the growing atomisation of society has ushered in an age in which the concept of a shared reality on which we can all depend has dissolved – and with it any hope of a functioning democracy. Come on in, guys, the water’s lovely! Though we can’t even agree that it’s wet any more.In Curtis’s trademark telling – a vast, kaleidoscopic assemblage of archive clips from news reports, TV shows, vox pops, pop videos, home videos, celebrity and political profiles and whatever else he has found that serves his purpose, cleverly curated, wittily juxtapositioned and bouncily soundtracked – the decline began, as so many seem to have done, with Margaret Thatcher. The series begins with her opening her study door to a group of children escorted in by her favourite man-of-the-people Jimmy Savile because – well, how could it not? Once that clip had been found, it was going in.From there, we follow Britain through the 1980s – the Falklands, the Troubles, the miners’ strike, Kelvin MacKenzie, Wham!’s first tour, the advent of CCTV, the transformation of houses from homes into assets, art and fashion into diffusion lines, all of them uncoupling the old ways from the new powers, truth from reality or Britain from its moorings in some way. On we go through the next decade as old imperial ways, people and myths struggle to survive under the onslaught of new media, new tech, new economic experiments and a new privileging of individual independence, self-interest and the profit motive that was absolutely never going to end badly for anyone.New Labour arrives in the fifth and final episode, however, and the idea of society arranged around working for the common good is restored. I’m kidding! “They couldn’t escape the world they had inherited and its pessimism about human motives.” Not simply regarding the electorate – the venality and sleaze that had enshrouded the Tory party over the preceding years (and may I say that there really should be a public health warning any time clips of David Mellor are to be shown, whether or not you lived throughthe Antonia de Sancha scandal) had also eroded all remaining trust in politicians and Blairites “just accepted the belief that politicians were always self-interested”. If you watch party conference clips closely, you can see the light in Gordon Brown’s eyes gradually going out. The last noble mien.We stop before Brexit and Donald Trump, but it is clear how Curtis believes the seeds have been sown for all our current sorrows. Is the viewer persuaded? It depends where you start from, of course – I can’t speak for anyone who wasn’t already halfway there before kick-off as I was – and it will depend perhaps even more on how you feel about this most Marmite of film-makers. Now that I have learned to let his films wash over me, to pay attention but not drill down as they go, then wait and see how they work on my consciousness afterwards, I manage much better and admire much more. But perhaps that is partly a function of context too. It is an increasing rarity to stand in the presence of anyone with an idea, a thesis, that they have thoroughly worked out to their own satisfaction and then present stylishly, exuberantly and still intelligently. The hell and the handcart feel that bit more bearable now.Shifty is on BBC iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAdam CurtisreviewsShareReuse this content"

When her body fell short, her protection disappearedAlexandra Diamond-RivlinSat 14 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 01.03 EDTShareI have never been excited about fancy dress, but when I received the invitation to a Sopranos-themed party a couple of months ago, I knew immediately who I wanted to go as: Adriana La Cerva. As a transgender woman, I empathised deeply with Adriana. I loved her wit, naivety, garish glamour and scandalous moments – the same reason I admire so many of the women in my trans community. Just look to Hunter Schafer or Alex Consani if you want a masterclass in all the above.View image in fullscreenAdriana La Cerva (Dreade Matteo) in The Sopranos.Composite: Guardian Design; Photo 12/AlamySome of Adriana’s one-liners – “If you think I’m gonna blow this guy for your sick purposes, you are sadly mistaken” – contain the sort of lewd, campy bravado of a ballroom queen. This is not the aspiration of gender transition, of course. But it does approximate to some of the ways trans women respond to their exclusion by a culture that expects women to be respectable, polite and discreet about their sexualities.But there is a more devastating side of Adriana that speaks to the trans experience: her quest for belonging. She longed for approval not only as a source of validation, but as a means of securing safety and stability. Her greatest struggle was that she craved acceptance from men and the family, even though she could never quite fit into their world.Adriana’s death in The Sopranosis devastating. After betraying the Soprano crime family by choosing to cooperate with the FBI rather than face prison, she confesses to her abusive fiance, Christopher. He turns her in and she is then lured into a car and taken to a quiet forest to be killed.As a trans woman, I identified with Adriana, and not just because of that iconic wit, naivety, glamour, and scandalousness. Adriana never belonged. She was beautiful, but in the end, it wasn’t enough.View image in fullscreenBetrayed … Adriana (Drea de Matteo) with her on-screen husband, Christopher (Michael Imperioli).Photograph: Getty ImagesFor much of the series Adriana was viewed by the men around her as a classic trophy wife: young, hot, highly desirable. This doesn’t last. Adriana’s deterioration is slow and drawn out. First, she is diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, which the mafiosos find sexless and amusing. Then, she reveals to Christopher that a previous abortion may have left her infertile. His cruel retort – “You knew you were damaged goods and didn’t tell me” – laid bare his true feelings for Adriana, steeped in ownership and manipulation. Her infertility is also the first real moment we see Adriana begin to lose her power and feminine status. By the end, she dealt with the same predicament many trans woman face too, fighting for recognition, social acceptance and protection.The Sopranos cast reunites in New York City: ‘Everyone up here, that’s a family’Read moreWhen I think about what it’s like to live by the sharpest edge of patriarchal violence, my own life feels stranger than fiction. Adriana resonated with me because she navigated a world where the stakes were highest for women whose biologies didn’t align with extremely narrow standards of femininity, where falling short meant not just humiliation, abandonment and alienation, but life-threatening risk. It’s no exaggeration to say that my survival is inextricably tied to my appearance – to my body’s ability to “pass” and conform to misogynistic ideals of femininity, just to exist safely in public.The writers of The Sopranos spared us from having to watch our beloved Adriana die: we hear the gunshot, but the camera pans away. It’s tempting to interpret this as an invitation to picture some other universe in which she survives. When I walked into the party wearing her tiger-print bodysuit, the one that wentTikTok virallast year, I wondered if I was in some way trying to live out the fantasy that the character gets to live an alternative future, one without the constant threat of patriarchy. Dreaming that it could happen feels personal, somehow.Whatever I hope for Adriana’s future, I hope for mine, too."

For proof, see this schadenfreude-fuelled documentary aboutRob Ford, the bellicose former conservative mayor of Toronto. Ford’s rolling scandals in office include public drunkenness, smoking crack with gun-runners, and lying about everything. Talking heads in the documentary, sensitively titled Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem (Netflix, from Tuesday 17 June), remember him as “an everyman … without a shred of credibility … who turned city hall into a circus”. That seems unfair. Circuses aren’t that bad, and I refuse to believeevery mansmokes crack cocaine.Most documentaries wring every ounce of lurid detail from their subjects. This guy has more chaos than fits inside 49 minutes. We do get thrillingly grainy footage of him twirling his crack pipe, slurring first-degree murder threats with Mortal Kombat-levels of specificity, and making bizarre rants in Jamaican patois, against what or whom I’m not sure. First-hand sources are film-maker’s gold, and Ford is happy enough to spend his lowest points around people who video everything. These people never have good phones though, do they?There isn’t space to do more than mention Ford’s extensive legal and domestic troubles, nor critique his executive choices, which included voting against grant money for HIV programmes, removing bike lanes and declaring transit workers an emergency service so they couldn’t strike. In one council meeting, Ford reportedly stated: “Those oriental people work like dogs.” He later apologised for the remark, which he had intended as a compliment.Shamelessness and emotional dysregulation are fantastic traits for reality TV; at some point they became necessary for public office too. Trainwreck feels like a rear-view mirror on that turning point. Ford swings between joking around, puce-faced outrage and meek apology. He resembles a baby, which makes strange sense. If it’s unfair to attack appearance, let’s just say he was a voluptuous blond, and voters in the western world have a type. It is impossible to imagine a woman or an ethnic minority candidate getting away with one of the bad decisions Ford compulsively makes. Those folks can’t even wear tan.View image in fullscreenSpeechless … Ford outside City Hall in Toronto, 2013.Photograph: Mark Blinch/ReutersThe story – and our glee in watching it – is complicated by the fact that Ford is a casualty of addiction issues. The question of who, how and when we forgive is a live one. Does it make a difference if the wrongdoer demands we move on, as Ford does? His popularity remained high. He would have been re-elected but in 2014, was diagnosed with an aggressive abdominal tumour anddied in 2016. That same year Trump was elected president. There’s a sick familiarity to the way controversies bounce off the Canadian mayor. The way he demonises the media as liars when he knows another scandal is about to break. The way he is able to position himself as a victim, and voters eat it up.There is an attempt at balance. “I’m proud to show this side of the story, and … why I stood by him through thick and thin,” says his former head of security. The Rob-Ford-was-a-good-man argument here hinges upon a story we’re told about a time the mayor was buying himself a Subway sandwich. Upon learning there was another order waiting but no driver, Ford delivered the stranger’s sub himself. Doesn’t make him Nelson Mandela, does it? By his own reckoning he made $35 plus three bucks as tip. Why does he have that much time in the day?Trainwreck shows Ford going door to door, asking people if their fridge freezers are working correctly, and taking a water-jet to graffiti. That’s not governing; that’s being a handyman. We all need to be more serious about public office. While politics will always be about public perception, it shouldn’t be reduced to entertainment, and ideally should be distinguishable from true crime. Otherwise the only winner is social media clips and documentaries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was gripped by this grainy footage, of a mayor fighting the public, or ploughing into an elderly female councillor, while barrelling across the chamber floor in a state of agitation.

How did the capital’s cultural landmarks end up under the thumb of the super-rich elite?Will ColdwellSat 14 Jun 2025 06.45 EDTShareWhen London’s Prince Charles Cinema has something to say, it declares it with large black lettering across its marquee. Once, during a summer heatwave, it beckoned punters with a blunt: SOD THE SUNSHINE COME SIT IN THE DARK. When its doors were boarded up during the first Covid lockdown it went for a rousing: WE’LL BE BACK. And after the coronation of King Charles: NO, WE ARE NOT CHANGING OUR NAME.As is clear from the repertory of films on show – David Lynch classics in 35mm, all-night Japanese horror marathons, Sing-a-long-a-Sound of Music and screenings ofThe Room(frequently with a live Q&A from director Tommy Wiseau) – the cult Leicester Square spot (Quentin Tarantino’s favourite UK cinema) has a unique place in London’s West End. When the cinema found itself facing an existential crisis following a prolonged period of fraught negotiations with its new landlord, passersby only needed to look up to learn that the venue had a fight on its hands. Just three words were pinned to the board: SAVE THE PCC.It was 28 January when the sign went up. The same day, the cinema launched a petition. It decried Zedwell LSQ, a subsidiary of Criterion Capital (one of the biggest property players in Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus), for using its “significant financial resources to intimidate us”. Zedwell, the Prince Charles said, was demanding new terms that would make its future unsustainable: higher  rent, a shorter lease and, crucially, a break clause that meant the cinema – which has been on the site since the 60s and operated under its current ownership since 1991 – could be forced to vacate with just six months’ notice.Within 24 hours, the petition had collected more than 100,000 signatories and triggered a slew of coverage.GQ magazine gathered commentsfrom Hollywood heroes including Paul Mescal, Robert Eggers and Christopher Nolan, the latter of whom simply said: “Film culture in Great Britain is unthinkable without the Prince Charles.” Danny Boyle told the magazine: “If this ‘ninth wonder of the world’ ever closes its doors, life will continue but London will die a little death.”View image in fullscreenThe Prince Charles Cinema before the coronation of King Charles.Photograph: James Veysey/ShutterstockAs the furore grew, attention shifted to the man behind Criterion Capital, a businessman named Asif Aziz. This wealthy property magnate – nicknamed “Mr West End” by newspapers after he bought the Trocadero in 2005 – was now thrust into the ring. In 2020, the Times asked if he was “Britain’s meanest landlord” in a story reporting on Criterion’s decision to take commercial tenants to court over unpaid rent during the pandemic. At the same time it was clashing with the Prince Charles, Criterion was ruffling feathers over its plans to buy the Central YMCA, a historic community gym and health club, which now seemed set to be developed into a Zedwell hotel.But to many, what was happening to the Prince Charles Cinema and the YMCA was about something bigger than a negotiation over rent, or the financial viability of a health club. It was about the persistent threat of closure that so many cultural and community spaces in London face, the impact of rampant commercialism on the city’s cultural diversity, and the seemingly unchecked power that developers such as Aziz wield. It was a familiar fable, one that has played out many times before, albeit with different venues and different landlords. As Kate Mossman wrote in a piece for theNew Statesmanlamenting the “death of the West End”: “No city in the UK has developers with the same flagrant disregard for its own culture as London.”Throughout all this, Aziz remained silent – until now. I wanted to find out: who was this publicity-shy property magnate with the power to shape the heart of the capital? What was Mr West End’s vision for, well, the West End? Was he a uniquely hard-nosed operator? Or was focusing on one man a distraction from deeper, systemic issues relating to how urban space is negotiated in the UK? “Asif is very personable,” John Walker, a former director of planning at Westminster council, tells me. “But is often misunderstood.”The first time Ben Freedman, the 64-year-old managing director of the Prince Charles, met Aziz, it was January 2023. Zedwell had just bought the freehold on the building from its previous owners, Soho Estates, and Aziz invited him to his office for a cup of tea. Freedman made the short walk to Babmaes Street, on the other side of Piccadilly Circus, where Criterion’s headquarters is tucked into the ground floor of a glassy modern office building. Inside, he was greeted by Aziz, 58, who is, in many ways, much like Freedman: charming, bespectacled, softly spoken, casually dressed. It was, as Freedman recalls, all very pleasant.Freedman, who knew the cinema’s current lease was due to end in September 2025, was interested in Aziz’s plans for the building. “He said: ‘I don’t really know,’” says Freedman. Aziz asked Freedman if they’d like to stay, to which Freedman said yes. “Then he asked me to do a presentation for his board as to why they should keep us.”Freedman put together a pitch deck, conscious that he was already on the back foot. “You’re a single operator dealing with a company that owns a big chunk of the West End,” he tells me, when we meet in the dimly lit foyer of the cinema in March. “You know … you’re a flea dealing with an elephant.” Still, he had some legal protection. The Prince Charles is covered by the Landlord and Tenant Act (1954), which entitles a tenant to a new lease at market rate unless the landlord intends to redevelop the entire building, or take it back for its own use. As long as Criterion wasn’t planning anything major, and they could agree to the terms of a new lease, everything should have been fine.View image in fullscreenThe London Pavilion building.Photograph: Mark Kerrison/In Pictures/Getty Images“We went back and forth,” says Freedman. “And he and I had a number of conversations about what rent we would be interested in paying.” At first, Aziz asked Freedman to make a proposal, then, “he said: ‘No, I need a figure beginning with this.’” Freedman made another proposal. “And he said: ‘No, I need more.’” Freedman became exasperated. “It was a conversation where you were bidding against yourself,” he says. By the end, the figure was nearly double the rent the Prince Charles was paying. The pair agreed it would be helpful to have an independent perspective, at which point Freedman commissioned two surveyor’s reports, which both independently stated that the existing rent was reasonable.In October 2023, Freedman – who by now was aware that Criterion was pursuing planning permission to convert the office space above the cinema into a hotel – again met a representative of the company (and its surveyor). Freedman shared what he had been advised would be a fair rent, and Criterion responded that it still believed it was worth double. “They said: ‘We’re going to search the market,’” says Freedman.A week later, Freedman had another meeting, this time with Aziz’s son, Omar, a director at Criterion. This encounter included some suggestions that Freedman found “bizarre”. The strangest was that they should sacrifice portions of the cinema. “‘Could you give up the circle, because we need it for access? Could you take away the front of the building so we can get wheelchair access to the hotel? Can you take a chunk of the auditorium so we can put a shop round the corner in Lisle Street, which we could rent out to somebody and that would mean that we would be able to afford your lower rent?’ It’s, you know, bonkers.” After that, things went cold.Under the 1954 act, when there is a year left on a lease, a tenant formally requests a new contract and the landlord has two months to respond. So in September 2024, Freedman put forward a proposal for a 15-year lease at the rent they believed was fair and they “waited, waited, waited”. In January this year, Criterion came back demanding a higher rent, a five-year lease and a break clause that would entitle it to – as Freedman puts it – “kick them out” with six months’ notice should it gain planning permission for a redevelopment.For Freedman, who had already been bracing himself for a legal battle, it was time for the nuclear option: going public. It was vital, he believed, to make it clear to Aziz that the Prince Charles was not simply your typical cinema.A couple of days later, a local councillor offered to broker a new meeting between landlord and tenant. So Freedman returned to Criterion’s office to speak with Aziz. This time, the atmosphere was tense.“He expressed disappointment that I hadn’t picked up the phone to him and had chosen to go public with the issue. I said: ‘We hadn’t been able to talk to anybody for 18 months …’”Yet progress, of sorts, was made. Aziz – informally, at least – agreed to drop the break clause, and said he’d be happy to agree to a 15-year lease. But he still wanted the rent increase, with an annual rent review. “And that’s in a market where rents are falling,” says Freedman. Criterion, Freedman says, has refused to provide any evidence that the higher rent it is proposing reflects the reality of the market.Freedman is still awaiting a response from Criterion to their counter-offer. And with every month that passes, the possibility of the dispute going to court – in which a judge will determine what is a fair lease – draws closer.London has always been under the thumb of powerful landlords, and they prefer to operate under the radar. Much of the city’s prime property is carved up between a handful of “Great Estates” that have held land there since Norman times: the Grosvenor Estate, the Cadogan Estate, the Gascoyne Estate. “Almost a thousand acres of central London remains in the hands of the aristocracy, church commissioners and crown estate,” writes Guy Shrubsole inWho Owns England?. “They own most of what is worth owning in central London.”Other players are also family firms, including Soho Estates, which was founded in 1949 by the pornographer Paul Raymond and has a £1bn portfolio. Relatively speaking, Criterion is the new kid on the block. Its portfolio in central London is small when compared with the Great Estates and the crown, but if you stand in the centre of Leicester Square or Piccadilly Circus and look in almost any direction then you will see a building that it owns.The aggregation of property into the hands of a small group has driven enormous change in the area. London’s major landlords are adept at driving up the value of their portfolio, rents included, often at the expense of the businesses that give a city its life. “More and more things are thought about simply through their financial value and less about their use value,”Mike Raco, a professor of urban governance at UCL, tells me. The consequence of this, in the simplest terms, is that the West End is being “hollowed out”.At the end of the day, property ownership rules the worldJonathan Glanz, a West End resident, former lord mayor of Westminster, and director of 45 West Group, a property management company, has seen the impact of this commercial homogenisation play out over 20 years. “It’s why, say, a chandelier repairer can no longer afford to be in Soho, why a startup business can’t be anywhere really in the West End,” he tells me. “Long-established family businesses have taken the view that their property is worth more than the businesses and have moved on.”How to slow this process is an enduring conundrum. “It’s all very well to say we need a local bakery or local shops,” says Dr Patricia Canelas, a lecturer in sustainable urban development at the University of Oxford, “but how do we make that happen?”A strong planning system is part of it, she tells me, and it is vital that communities shout when they are unhappy, “but at the end of the day, property ownership rules the world”.Fables about London and its developers are easily shoehorned into a David v Goliath narrative. Asif Aziz’s own story (I’m not the first to point out) more closely resembles that of Dick Whittington. Like Whittington, Aziz – who was born in Malawi in 1967 – arrived in the capital as a young boy with little to his name. While he has not risen to the rank of mayor of London, he is certainly close to the position; Aziz and Sadiq Khan can often be found rubbing shoulders at events in the capital. Today, Criterion Capital has a portfolio of prime real estate across London and the south-east worth about £6bn. Aziz now spends most of his time living in Abu Dhabi.View image in fullscreenThe Trocadero.Photograph: Anna Hristova/AlamyAziz, so the story goes, was 16 when he grasped the first rung of the property ladder. He bought two shops in Deptford, converting the top-floor storage rooms into flats. London’s streets may have been paved with gold, but much of Aziz’s early wealth was accumulated doing business in Angola, where he ran a food and consumer goods distribution firm called Golfrate. After selling it for $20m in 2005, he returned to London to embark on a shopping spree for the capital’s biggest jewels. Among them were the Criterion Building (from which Criterion takes its name), the London Pavilion and the Trocadero, three grand buildings that surround Piccadilly Circus, the beating heart of London’s West End.As Aziz’s property portfolio grew, so did his profile. Coverage of his business and personal affairs has not always been flattering. In 2011, the MP for Mitcham and Morden, Siobhain McDonagh, joined her constituentsfor a demonstrationat Criterion’s office in Piccadilly. They were upset that Azizhad sat on a tower blockin Colliers Wood for years, letting it fall into disrepair while the property accrued value. Speaking in parliament, she complained that the Trocadero had also been left collecting dust. “All we really want from Mr Aziz is for him to be a good neighbour,” she said. “Although if we are relying on people like him to behave decently of their own accord, we might have a very long wait.”Aziz is “charming, well-dressed and very courteous”, one property adviser told the Times, “but he doesn’t give anyone a chance – he squeezes for the last penny.” Elsewhere, Criterion has been accused of buying and closing local pubs, and presiding over a poorly maintained andcockroach-infested housing blockin Croydon. How much property Aziz really owns is hard to gauge. AsPrivate Eye has reported,he can be linked to numerous Isle of Man companies that hold titles to UK properties.But it hasn’t knocked him, or Criterion. “Asif’s glass is always more than half full; he is an eternal optimist,” Walker tells me. “I know some people have criticised Criterion Capital for buying and sitting on property, but that is not my perception … The reality is he has transformed some very difficult and challenging sites such as the Trocadero, which many others looked at and failed over many years. When he does things, he does them well.”At the heart of Aziz’s portfolio is the Zedwell hotel brand, spearheaded by his daughter Halima,which opened its flagship branch in the Trocadero in 2020, bringing back into use a floundering building that was once a brash video-game arcade but had spent much of the past decade decomposing. Entirely windowless, the hotel pitches itself as a sanctuary for sleep in the heart of the city. Whether it is a masterclass in branding or a vision of dystopia, it is a hit. A constant stream of guests flow in and out of the large minimalist lobby, where they can check themselves in on tablets before taking a lift to their rooms. The basic doubles are about the same size as small rooms in most budget hotels, but the walls are blank and the bed cocooned within a floor-to-ceiling wooden frame – like a box within a box. And when you turn out the light, there’s nothing but darkness. In 2023, Criterion pushed the Zedwell concept one step further, opening the first underground hotel at Tottenham Court Road, next door to the Central YMCA (in the face of strong opposition from the local community). It plans to scale up to 8,500 rooms by 2028 – a number of them above the Prince Charles.View image in fullscreenThe Veeraswamy – London’s oldest Indian restaurant.Photograph: Jeff Blackler/ShutterstockMr West End may be the main character of this story, but he is by no means the only antagonist in the area. In March, it was reported that Veeraswamy, London’s oldest Indian restaurant,might have to closeowing to a lease dispute with the crown estate – pitching a century-old Michelin-starred institution against King Charles himself. A petition has collected 14,000 signatures and the restaurant has applied to the courts to have its lease extended. It was also recently announced that Covent Garden’s Jubilee Gym is also going on the market due to financial challenges, contributing to the sense that only the most lucrative businesses and services can survive in this part of town. In a similar scenario to the Central YMCA, plans to sell it took place behind closed doors and without community involvement.The property companies – which in recent decades have begun to work increasingly closely with local authorities to maintain and add value to the area – use a particular language to describe the changes they have brought about – one of “uplifting communities”, “maintaining vibrancy”, or “preserving architectural integrity”. It’s a language in which Criterion is fluent. “Community impact and social value guide every aspect of our portfolio,” it stateson its website.In a statement, it blamed the decline in the West End on a regulatory environment that has “grown less supportive of imaginative proposals aimed at revitalising the area” and pointed to its “long-term view” in the stewardship of its assets.When Criterion talks about its socially minded endeavours, it cites the “revitalisation” of the Criterion restaurant (now home to a branch of the London chain Masala Zone), and its renovation of the Horses of Helios statue in Piccadilly Circus – a partnership with Westminster council and the crown estate that “not only preserves a significant piece of public art but also enhances the vibrancy of the West End”. It is also building a mosque and community space in the Trocadero.Aziz has invested heavily in supporting Britain’s Muslim community and tackling Islamophobia. Much of this work is done by the Aziz Foundation, of which his daughter Rahima is a trustee. It also supports initiatives and events that celebrate Muslim culture in the heart of London, such as the Ramadan Lights, again close to Piccadilly Circus, which wereswitched on by Sadiq Khanin February.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Then, one day, out of the blue, I received an email from Criterion’s head of communications. “I understand you have been inquiring about Mr Aziz,” she wrote. “We would like to invite you to one of his events, he will be attending and welcomes the opportunity to meet you.”So I find myself at an open iftar sponsored by the Aziz Foundation and held in Trafalgar Square. It turns out to be an unostentatious affair – and free to attend, which gives it a gentle, unhurried air in an area in which it’s hard to blink without spending a tenner. Musicians play on a small stage, families wander around; a collective calm encircled by red buses, taxis and hordes of tourists.I loiter in wait for Aziz; then, between phone calls, handshakes and waves to his familiars, Mr West End appears, slim and smiley in a simple blue jacket, jeans and trainers. He comes across as relaxed, unflappable. The Prince Charles situation, he assures me, with a shrug, is a lot of misinformation. Before, they were “paying nothing”, he says, and now have to pay market rent, so “it’s human nature to feel upset”. Anyway, in his view he’s always been a soft target for the media. “Is it Islamophobia …?” He leaves the question hanging in the air.It’s a fleeting encounter, but one question seems to catch him off guard. I remind him of his various nicknames: “Mr West End … the Meanest Landlord. How would you like to be known?”He smiles, purses his lips slightly and rocks on his heels. “No one has ever asked me that before,” he admits. I’m invited to drop by his office in a few days’ time.Before I sit down with Aziz, I visit the home of Patrick Joy, 75, a former postman who was a long-term user of the Central YMCA. Like most of its 10,000 plus regulars, he only learned the fate of the club when an email was sent out informing him that it was no longer financially viable, and that it had been sold. As part of a wider campaign to save the centre, Joy volunteered to put his name down for a high court challenge, calling for an injunction to pause the sale to Criterion.The case was dismissed and the centre was closed on 7 February.The YMCA was more than just a gym, it was a community centre. Especially for older people – a place where you can sit in the canteen and have a good chinwagJoy lives in a rented flat off Gray’s Inn Road, the front room decorated by colourful ornaments and artwork, including an eye-catching Technicolor picture of a tiger. He sits in a wide leather armchair in a brown cardigan and slippers, and tells me how he used to deliver letters all over the West End at dawn and go dancing at the Hippodrome at night. “I’m a West End man,” he tells me.As you’d expect from a postie, Joy has always been a morning person, and those were the sessions he attended at the YMCA. “It was more than just a gym … it was a community centre,” he says. “Especially for older people – a place where you can sit in the canteen and have a good chinwag.” He’s been embedded in the neighbourhood his whole life, but has watched it change in ways that don’t make sense to him. “It’s a case of big, big business taking over,” he says. “Big business just killing communities with no heart.”After leaving his house, I wander into Soho, past the shuttered frontage of the YMCA on the ground floor of the brutalist St Giles building, to meet David Beida, a sage-like community organiser, part of the Save the Central YMCA campaign, and a member of the Soho Society, who lives on Dean Street. There, in a room full of cigarette smoke and De Chirico prints, he conveys his cynicism for Criterion; what he views as its disinterest in the equilibrium of the area. “If it had been any other major West End property company,” he says, “they probably would have sat down and talked to us when they started buying it.”Camden council agreed to support the campaign (though admitted it had no power to stop the closure), and a meeting with representatives from Criterion was finally arranged. Andrew Shields, another campaigner who attended, says they hoped for a conversation about philanthropy, community and the role developers could play in preserving the West End. Instead, it resembled a business meeting in which the rent needed to occupy the building was floated, along with the possibility that the community could continue operating a portion of it.The campaigners, however, are determined to retain the entire building for community use. They are now developing a feasibility plan, and waiting to hear whether the building will be listed. “Our anger is not necessarily with Criterion, they’re a business. They buy buildings,” says Shields. “Our anger is with the directors of Central YMCA, who took that decision to sell. But with Criterion, it requires dialogue, and [since that meeting] we’ve not had any.”Shields tells me that all they want is to be listened to, for Criterion to “genuinely understand” that what’s been lost is more than just a building. The campaign continues to call on Criterion to live up to the community values it likes to boast of, but when it applied (successfully) to have theYMCA designated as an asset of community value, Criterion opposed it. In a recent social media post, the Save the YMCA campaign dubbed this the “duality of developers”.View image in fullscreenSoho parish primary school – the last of its kind in the area; after it came under threat of closure, the Aziz Foundation held a fundraiser in a bid to help save it.Photograph: Future Publishing/Getty ImagesThis duality can result in some surreal community events. In December, Criterion held an occasion to raise money for theSoho parish school– the last of its kind in the area. Parents, children and “stakeholders” gathered at St Anne’s Church on Dean Street. There were drinks and speeches, and a group of school pupils sang Little Donkey and We Saw Three Ships. “It felt a little … strange,” one parent who attended tells me. “Very corporate … there wasn’t much integrating between the community and the corporate people.” She felt as though it was designed to let the public know that Criterion was doing something for the community, “but hearing about the YMCA and the Prince Charles, it kind of did feel a bit like you’re not doing as much as you actually could do”.Later, I learn that one of Aziz’s daughters used to attend the school.Afew days after the iftar, two days after Eid al-Fitr, I arrive at Criterion’s headquarters. It’s an open plan space with a lively buzz. In the centre of the room, a number of architectural models are on show in glass boxes. Aziz greets me and I take a seat in his office, which is separated from the main room by a wall of glass. Inside hang contemporary oil paintings of Piccadilly Circus and family photographs. He hands me a copy ofMuslims Don’t Matterby Sayeeda Warsi from a pile of about a dozen books on a coffee table and insists I read it.“Property,” he says, leaning back in his chair, “is something tangible, something everyone sees.” From Aziz’s perspective, Criterion doesn’t behave any differently from the other estates in central London, “but here, it’s individually owned … there’s a person you can target. But I’m also targeted because I’m a champion of British Muslim issues. I’m very passionate about that. Very, very passionate.”Aziz has always felt something of an outsider – ever since he arrived in London aged six, living in a flat in Balham with a coin-operated meter – and, like many immigrants, has been shaped by those struggles. “I come from a family which has lost wealth because of” – he takes a long, careful pause – “political or other events. So financial survival is very important.” The rags-to-riches narrative is enticing, but feels a bit simplistic. I am curious how a 16-year-old goes about buying a house. “At auction,” he tells me, dodging the question.We talk about the Aziz Foundation, and I put it to Aziz that some people see a paradox in investing in a community with one hand, while seemingly disrupting local life with the other. “Our business interests are not at odds with our charitable interests,” he counters. He brings up the Soho parish school. “Twice it’s been through those threats of closing it down and we had a fundraising in December for that. Because it’s our community here.”We’ve not bought Prince Charles to close it down. Having it there adds value and panache to our building, to our hospitality offeringBut the thing is, I say, the school used the YMCA swimming pool, and I know a number of parents there are upset that it’s closed. He seems frustrated by the suggestion.“I repeat for the fifth or sixth time, we did not acquire YMCA to close it down. Same with Prince Charles. We’ve not bought Prince Charles to close it down. We have a planning application to convert the upper parts into a hotel. Having the Prince Charles Cinema there adds value and panache to our building, to our hospitality offering.”Aziz feels as if the Prince Charles row has become personal. His daughter Halima, who has dropped into the office and taken a seat beside us, points out that when the petition was kicking off, the words on the marquee were updated to read “Damn the Man”. “See,” he says, “they always have to individualise it.”There’s an awkward silence. I’m unsure whether to mention that a billionaire property developer is as much “the man” as you could imagine, or point out that it’s a nod to the famous line from the 1995 film Empire Records, “Damn the Man, Save the Empire”, in which the staff of an indie record store fight to stop it being sold to a chain. Besides, a negotiation with a landlordispersonal – it comes down to two people sitting down to cut a deal.I suggest to Aziz that one of the frustrations felt in London is that “market rents” have been pushing out certain businesses, often resulting in independent businesses being replaced by chains – the homogenising, “hollowing out” that UCL’s Mike Raco raised, and that people such as YMCA regular Patrick Joy feel. Besides, according to Freedman, the “market rent” proposed by Criterion is being plucked out of thin air – it’s simply a rate Aziz believes he can demand. I guess, I say, many people feel that people like you have the power to make a choice …“Of course we had a choice,” says Aziz.“We had a choice that we could have put in a planning application to demolish, put in a new cinema or a theatre and a far better building.”Some weeks later, I check in with Freedman. The cinema has been ticking along; it is currently screening Joe Wright’s adaptation of Pride & Prejudice for its 20th anniversary and, in keeping with its idiosyncratic way of operating, they’ve had to call in a ghost hunter to investigate the source of a mystery flood that has been blighting the building. It turns out that the cinema is home to numerous ghosts, but none are responsible for water damage.Repairs always need doing, but it’s difficult to know how to proceed while in limbo. Freedman is still waiting on a response from Criterion, and is upset to hear that Aziz continues to claim that this is a dispute about what the Prince Charles could pay, rather than what is fair. “We do not feel as though we are being treated as partners,” he says. “We feel as though we are being bullied.”In a statement, Criterion said the claim it has used “significant financial resources to intimidate the Prince Charles” is “completely unfounded” and “reflects the Cinema’s negotiating approach to date”. It is, it says, seeking “market terms” and details such as a break clause are a matter for negotiation. “Both parties have engaged professional surveyors and representatives to advise them,” it added. “Should commercial terms not be agreed upon, the statutory process enables either party to apply to the courts to resolve the matter.”There’s some good news, though. On 1 May, Westminster council approved the Prince Charles Cinema as an asset of community value, formally recognising what Freedman and thousands of others know to be true. “It raises the bar as far as planning permission is concerned,” says Freedman. “It is also recognition of the impact of the people who signed the petition and all the work we’ve done over the years. When you’re in a fight with someone who’s a lot bigger than you, then the more affirmation you can get the better.”The Prince Charles Cinema has always been a defiant venue, and that’s the attribute it’s displaying now. In his battle against London property’s Goliath, Freedman refuses to be ground down, but it is not a fight he particularly wants to be having. “It’s a huge waste of resources,” he says. “We would rather be running a  cinema.”Explore more on these topicsLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How did this revolutionary portrayal of midlife desire come to inspire a generation of women?Sat 14 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 14 Jun 2025 03.04 EDTShareWhen Miranda July’sAll Fourswas published in May last year, it triggered what felt like both a spontaneous resistance movement and the sort of mania last experienced when the final Twilight book dropped, except this time for women in midlife rather than teenage girls. Two friends separately brought it to my house, like contraband dropped out of a biplane. Book groups hastily convened, strategically timed for when the men were out of the picture.The story opens with a 45-year-old woman about to take a road trip, a break from her husband and child and general domestic noise. She’s intending to drive from LA to New York, but is derailed in the first half hour by a young guy, Davey, in a car hire place, to whom she is passionately attracted. The next several weeks pass in a lust so intense, so overpowering, so lusciously drawn, it’s like a cross between ayahuasca and encephalitis. The narrator is subsumed by her obsession, and disappears her normal life. The road trip is a bust from the start, but the effort of breaking the spell and going home looks, for a long time, like way too much for the narrator, and when she finally does, to borrow from Leonard Cohen (perhaps describing a similar situation), she’s somebody’s mother but nobody’s wife.The New York Times called it “the first great perimenopause novel”, which is incorrect – not because you could easily name 10 others, rather because what it ignited was not an honest heart-to-heart about hormones, but something far more radical. What if a woman just told the truth, about sex, monogamy, marriage, mortality, domesticity, friendship, the life of the mind? The disruption of norms would be so immense that you wouldn’t, as a reader, necessarily need your circumstances or feelings to correspond to the author’s for that to upend your life. One woman who nearly divorced her husband after reading it said: “I think what I felt, which I think is what a lot of us feel, is permission to be undone.”All Fourswas an immediate success. It spent nearly a year on the Indie Bestseller list. It was afinalist in the National Book Awardsin the US, as well as being named on the best books lists, 2024, by the New York Times, the New Yorker, Time, the Washington Post, PBS, Oprah, Vogue and Vulture.I was building on an internal world that I believed existed, not just in meNow, a year on, the paperback is coming out, and I’m talking to July as she waits to find out whether she has won the Women’s prize . Our conversation, which would normally be part-retrospective – there’s a funny bit in All Fours when she talks about the female artist’s lifecycle: first “hot young thing”, then wilderness years, and a final spurt of attention before you die – is instead all about the reaction to this book. “I wrote it as if it was OK – as if everyone knew what I was talking about,” July says, looking bluestockingy in round glasses, from her home in Echo Park, Los Angeles. “As if you could make a joke about something shameful, as if we had all already talked about that thing. Even though we hadn’t. So it was skipping a few steps, even to have humour about it. I was building on an internal world that I believed existed, not just in me.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Chantal Anderson/The GuardianMiranda July is 51, was born in Vermont to two writer parents, and has the ultimate boho CV – she said once that her last shitty job was at the age of 23, as a car-door-unlocker at Pop-A-Lock, a US chain of locksmiths, which makes her ability to make a living as, variously, a performance artist, a film-maker, a writer, almost mythical. She came to indie prominence withMe and You and Everyone We Know,her first full-length film, in 2005 – it won the best first feature at Cannes that year. It has the most endearing, infuriating sequence: someone buys a goldfish and ­accidentally drives off, having left it on top of his car. July, starring in the film because, realistically, she was the only person who could have, decides from inside her own car that the fish will certainly perish, and delivers an ode: “I didn’t know you, but I want you to know that you were loved.” Her voice was incredibly distinctive – she nailed all those universal feelings such as awkwardness, futility, delight, yet was as far as you could imagine from being an everywoman. There followed an exquisite book of short stories –No One Belongs Here More Than You– in 2007, and her first full-length novel,The First Bad Man, in 2015.View image in fullscreenMiranda July and John Hawkes in her 2005 film Me and You and Everyone We Know.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyCertainly, she always blurred the lines between herself and her protagonists. But When All Fours was published, it couldn’t escape anyone’s notice that July herself has a child, roughly the same age as the narrator’s, and separated from her husband two years before the book’s publication. Of course, it’s always assumed that authors borrow from life, but this seemed like a different order of autobiographical fiction. Being honest about feelings, even destructive, primitive, contradictory, overwhelming ones, is daring enough, but marrying them to real-life events felt cataclysmic, which almost created a feedback loop. Readers felt the story was so audacious it had to be true.They were invested in the truth of it, to the extent that, during a Q&A after a reading, “someone asked about Davey being a dancer, why was he?” says July. “And I went through the whole thing of my process, why I came up with that, and I could just feel the room kind of deflate. They wanted him to be a real dancer.”“My actual friends,” July says, her voice rising in mock outrage, “they know that so much of this didn’t happen. It definitely didn’t happen the way it’s written in the book. But even as I was talking to a writer friend, she said, ‘I keep forgetting that you didn’t just do what you did in the book. You had years of couples therapy and this long conversation with your husband, it’s totally different.’ And I was, like, ‘Are you kidding me?’ You have to hold that in your head. How is anyone else going to believe this isn’t real, if my friends can’t even remember?”What about her ex, though – Mike Mills, also a film-maker, Oscar-nominated in 2017 for his movie20th Century Women? Did he mind, or was he fine with it? July looks at me sardonically. “I don’t think those are the only two conceivable feelings.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotographs: Chantal Anderson/The GuardianI remember my ex saying to me, ‘I think you’re at your best when you’re closest to the bone as a writer.’ That was helpful to hearThe pair met at Sundance film festival in 2005, both there with their first movies. “So we met as artists, and we always talked about how there’s this bubble that’s sacred for each of us, you keep the bubbles separate. You know, you each get your own world, and you have your freedom within that. And so it’s not like it’s always easy, and for sure, there were parts of this that were hard. There’s a part of it that was very personal for him – this is the mother of my child, we’ll know each other for ever. And then there’s the part that’s a fellow artist. I remember him saying to me, ‘I think you’re at your best when you’re closest to the bone as a writer.’ So it’s not great, it’s not safe, but that was helpful to me to hear. I felt like the risk was worth it. The reward for not risking it seemed too modest.”A couple of months in from the publication of All Fours, everyone had a story about a woman who’d read it and blown her life up. But if you took a stroll through Goodreads, which is a kind of all-comers citizen book review site, something else stuck out: the people who one-starred it (about 5% of almost 140,000) didn’t just hate it, there were actively angry with it. The rage was fascinating. It was as if they’d been slapped. Many were angry at how graphic it was (there’s a famous, sexy scene with a tampon that would probably be a spoiler to describe). Commenters took umbrage. “It would be great if I could read a book by a well-known female author who wasn’t under the impression that descriptions of cutting matted hair from a dog’s ass or running her hands under her lover’s pee was ‘original’, ‘sharp’, or ‘illuminating’ writing,” wrote one. Many prefaced their scorn with the belief that women’s bodies were brilliant territory for a writer – uncharted, tumultuous, mysterious – just not like this. This gave them the ick.More than that, though, they were angry with the narrator, and nowhere was the conflation of fiction and fact more complete; if she was narcissistic, self-involved, “immature” then so was July. “Yeah, I need to talk about that with someone,” July says, “probably not you.” (I wish it could be me, but it sounds like she means a therapist.)Sometimes, it’s just that they weren’t expecting it – “They thought it was going to be a beach read.” But more importantly, “They’re very sympathetic to the husband.” Of course, it’s that – no question, he is betrayed by the narrator, not just with this brain fever emotional infidelity, but on an even more basic level; it’s that he’s so nice, so personable, so thoughtful, so empathetic, and yet … he’s not enough. “And I’m thinking, ‘I created the husband, too! So he’s also me!’” she says, laughing. This is possibly the most radical act of the book: not a woman getting divorced, but a woman leaving a Good Guy.The husband gets annoyed just once: when the narrator posts a photo of herself on Instagram, dancing suggestively. This section, which follows a period where the narrator works out in the gym and strives for a perfect physique, surprised me – it’s such a mainstream thing to do. It’s not a thousand miles from real life, either, as July also likes to uploads videos of herself shaking her insanely perfect, pretty much unshakeable ass (though fair play, the dances themselves are anything but mainstream). Today, July bristles a bit at the suggestion her character is in thrall to a beauty ideal when admiring her ass. “No, she’s been taking nude selfies, and then she’s surprised to see, ‘Hold on, it does look a little different down there.’ I think that’s what I was trying to capture.” Then she elaborates: “If ever I have something to do with fashion, or frankly, even if I just get quite dressed up and I’m photographed because I enjoy that, I do have conversations with other prominent women writers that are like, ‘I make sure that no one sees me having too good a time.’ I think, for women, the measurement of what seriousness looks like is still masculine.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It became a muster point for people who relished talking about the book, but an unusual number had also made a great change in their lives after reading it. What was interesting, when Iinterviewed some of them, was the sheer range of situations. There were readers who didn’t need an LA literary novelist and performance artist to tell them they were allowed their own feelings – readers who were already queer or polyamorous or non-binary, who nevertheless found a new permission to just get out of whatever situation they were in, forgo the security of a relationship for something more authentic and exploratory. There were readers who were from incredibly conservative backgrounds. There were women who didn’t leave their relationship, who simply left a job in which they felt no appreciation. There were women who changed the way they had sex. There were women who changed the way they related to their children, changed the time or attention they gave to friendships. We weren’t looking at a divorce manual, in other words, but “permission to be undone”. No wonder some people were angry. That is an incredibly dangerous licence, socially. A lot of things really rely on women who’ll hold it together for others, regardless of their own feelings.July says that the scale of readers’ responses has felt like more than an unusual wave of appreciation for a previously respected but niche artist and writer. “I had this movie [Me and You and Everyone We Know], that was the big change for me,” she says. “That experience was really about me, a new voice. All Fours is really about women. Reading and hearing about other people’s stories – the sense of isolation, the shame that I had while I was writing the book, it’s all been completely inverted.”This is one of the reasons “perimenopause novel” irks, as a thumbnail – situating these explosive feelings hormonally is just another way to say these feelings will pass, so don’t matter. But July is relaxed about that. “There have been different phases of shame and fear while I’m writing – there was more shame when I was younger. Then I got to the perimenopause and that was the last thing I wanted to be associated with. All the time I was writing, I was just thinking, ‘Why am I doing this? I can’t stop myself.’” The menopause conversation is much more developed in the UK than the US, she says, where nobody talks about it. “You could have a whole relationship with your gynaecologist and really not have it come up. Or you could say, ‘I have these symptoms,’ and they’d say, ‘If you’re suicidal, you can take hormones, but otherwise just ride it out.’ And that’s in LA!” It makes me think of all the other ways in which women in the US are peculiarly under-emancipated – not the recent, terrifying anti-abortion legislation, but the bread-and-butter stuff, such as the lack of significant maternity leave; does that feel connected? “I think it’s very intertwined with the healthcare system. We just don’t have reliable healthcare, period. So menopause is a luxury problem.”She notes, wryly, that “we don’t actually have a problem with rich, aspirational women” as protagonists, they just can’t be dissatisfied. It’s funny: on a Zoom she looks younger than her age, but not artificially so, or massively groomed; but in public, I’ve always found her stunning appearance incongruous, like, how can this woman feel out of place?Sometimes I pick up a book at the top of the bestseller lists, just to understand what’s going on. I’m reading a romcom. I was shocked by how graphic it isJuly’s The First Bad Man is 10 years old now, and even though it is mainly powered by sexual fantasies, they are so extravagantly weird that, when I read it, I didn’t even realise it was meant to be erotic. (That was partly context – literary erotic fiction wasn’t really a thing, then. You were either a Fifty Shades reader or you read grown-up stuff.) It wasn’t until July spoke at a book festival and described how she was masturbating so much while working on the book that her writer-friend said she had to sublimate, the way athletes do, or she was never going to finish it. Which was news to the audience just because, you know, who’s ever heard “I was masturbating … ” at a book festival?Technically, All Fours is a work of erotic fiction, which has a definition: that the sex doesn’t just happen, the characters are advanced by it. At the same time, it’s not a sex-beach-read, because that’s not July’s style. “Sometimes I pick up a book at the top of the bestseller lists, just to understand what’s going on,” she says. “I’m reading a romcom called Funny Story. I was shocked by how graphic it is … I don’t think I’m prudish, I was a sex worker at times in my life.”All Fours aims to do something different. “The joy of it, for me, was writing a thing I hadn’t seen written about sex, either because what constituted sex was new, or because nobody had ever described, like, a woman who takes a long time to come; the thoughts of the other person: is this a fool’s errand? Will I be able to do this? It was just really funny to me: ‘Tell me if you need a vibrator, tell me if I’m just gonna keep going at this. You know, if it’s humanly possible.’”View image in fullscreenHair and makeup: Phoebe Seligman using Leonor Greyl and Charlotte Tilbury.Photograph: Chantal Anderson/The GuardianYet this definitely isn’t slapstick sex; it’s meant, and felt. The narrator and her friend make a rigid distinction between mind-rooted fuckers and body-rooted fuckers – mind-fuckers are imagining a scene as they have sex (in one memorable description between the narrator and her husband, she says it’s like she stuck a giant TV to his head); body-fuckers are absolutely engrossed in the sensations of the body, their mind is nowhere – and there’s a memorable scene for that, too.What was the reason, creatively, that the narrator and Davey never have sex? “The point was to build it to this place where you felt like those were the only two options: she’s either going to have sex or she’s going to go home. I wanted to use all that built-up energy, that obsessive loop, so another way of thinking would present itself. That playing field, while it’s completely addictive to read about – and to live, frankly – is ultimately quite small. But it can be transformative, it can push you into the next area of your life. If the end result is that you fuck Davey, you might not get that birth of complexity.” Then she says the most surprisingly romantic thing. “When someone sees you, in a particular way, and that part of your soul that hasn’t really been seen is seen, it won’t go back into the box. And that’s a big problem, because your life isn’t built for it to come out of the box.”We speak before July travels to the UK for the Women’s prize. “Sometimes people will tip you off that you’re not gonna win. I’ve been looking for that email, and haven’t had it yet. But the important thing about this book is what it’s done to the conversation, for the culture. I don’t know if that’s the thing literary prizes are for.” ( In the end,she lost out toDutch debut novelist Yael van der Wouden.)It must feel strange and vulnerable, at this moment, to be an author who stands for – maybe not everything, but a huge amount of things that the US government absolutely cannot tolerate, whether that’s female emancipation or sexual and gender fluidity. “I tend to think the people who are most vulnerable to this are not so visible. What’s the deal with my neighbours? I’ve known them for 20 years, but I don’t know who’s here legally, why would I know their business? Who’s gonna notice if two of the people in that house are gone?” But it does touch her personally, and not just as a neighbour. “It’s really hard to get a grip on,” she says sadly. “Whether the most extreme takes are actually the most clear-eyed. Whether the people who are moving [abroad] have it right. I’m trying to figure that out right now.”Unlike her narrator, July did make it to New York, last week, where she entertained her friends in her hotel room (which will, if you’ve read it, remind you a lot of All Fours). This is how she described the experience on her Substack: “Two of my visiting friends were my age and both of them, in different ways, spoke about looking older, the hardness of that … One friend and I showed each other our thighs in the light to make sure the other one really saw our cellulite. I told her the truth: I had assumed hers was much more extreme because of how she had spoken about it over the years. For years, I had placed her in a different category from myself, cellulite-wise.” And that’s July – the political, the personal, the public, the intimate, the things you’re not supposed to think about if you want to be taken seriously or thought of as truthful, all with a voice that’s entirely relatable yet completely idiosyncratic.All Fours is out now in paperback (Canongate Books).

She writes or co-writes all of her songs with a signature imprint – saucy, clever, unabashedly horny and in on the joke of being both attracted to and disappointed by men. (“Did you say you’re finished? Didn’t know we started,” she teases in new single Manchild.) A recentRolling Stone cover profileespoused her intelligence, craftiness and deadpan humor. (Asked which famous ex Manchild is about, she answered, “It’s about your dad.”) She’s taking the now-unusual step of releasing a new album only a year after her breakout for no more reason than she has ideas, feels creative, and wants to – “my brain is sharp, let’s write”, she told Rolling Stone.‘I’m a tyrant!’ Pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter on freakish fame, fighting Disney and writing the song of the summerRead moreBut though Carpenter is evidently in the driver’s seat, the music video for Manchild finds her as a passenger, eye-rolling at a series of incompetent men on a surreal hitchhiking jaunt through the desert. Besides humorously imagining the manchild’s shortcomings as vehicles, poking fun at some traditional movie pinups and relishing enjoyably strange images, the video continues Carpenter’s star-making playfulness with the idea of being a sexy, submissive vixen, Betty Boop for gen Z. The single came accompanied by cover art for her upcoming album, Man’s Best Friend, in which the pint-sized Carpenter, clad in a black minidress, appears on her knees, pawing for the attention of an anonymous man in a suit, his hand loosely gripping her blonde bombshell hair.Unsurprisingly, the internet hasn’t reacted well. Carpenter, a sharp student of pop music, is clearly working in the Madonna tradition of sexual provocation for provocation’s sake, poking fun at tropes and people’s prudishness with an alluring frankness. But online, one would have you believe that she’s set back the cause of feminism by a good 10 years. On Reddit, on her Instagram, on the dregs of the rightwing rage-bait website formerly known as Twitter, users – overwhelmingly women – have accused Carpenter of caving to the male gaze, promoting regressive attitudes, not understanding satire and eventhreatening women’s safety at large. “Insanely misogynistic imagery”,wroteone Instagram user, echoing the sentiments of the entire r/popculture subreddit. “Sabrina this is not the slay you think it is …” wrote another.On TikTok, the image has folded easily into one-woman explainers on how the cover is actually the opposite of empowering, or how the furore encapsulates the context-less, ahistorical, flattened discourse that is everything wrong with modern society, etc. (For what it’s worth, there’s also a semi-convincing theory that Carpenter will eventually reveal a larger image in which she also plays the man in the suit.) A women’s aid group for victims of domestic abuse in Glasgow went as far ascalling it, absurdly, “a throwback to tired tropes that reduce women to pets, props, and possessions and promote an element of violence and control”.In short, the discomfort is palpable, if predictable. Though female sexuality is de rigueur in pop music, we are still not used to seeing pop stars in control of their own sexuality, let alone framing themselves as the submissive. Carpenter on all fours rubs against the prevailing rhetoric of female sexual empowerment – “be on top”, “have sex like a man”, “call the shots”. Fuck, not be fucked. Dominance as the only acceptable mode, submission for sexual pleasure as inherent weakness. To be submissive and strong at once is to break some brains, the idiosyncrasies and confidence of one woman’s sexual performance inflaming the chronic poster’s allergy to fun, as well as the internet’s incentive for black-and-white thinking.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueCarpenter, unapologetically girly and often bedecked in lace lingerie, knows exactly what she’s doing. With only an album cover and one song to go by, it’s still too soon to see the full scope of her tongue-in-cheek satire, but the outline of riffing and reclaiming male fantasies is clear. The Rolling Stone shoot – floral, pastoral, fairy-esque – invokes the imagery of tradwives, the third rail of female empowerment discourse online. Such women sell a fantasy of chicken eggs, meals from scratch, barefoot and pregnant and always in service of the man. They also sell sex, albeit quietly, as baby-making machines for the head of the family. Carpenter in gingham lingerie, posing with a deer in the woods surrounded by flowers, makes the subtext literal: this is a male fantasy for men who do not like women’s independence, and she is owning it.The thing missing from all this commentary is a sense of fun, which Carpenter appears to be having in spades. Like Addison Rae, a fellowrecent breakoutwho frequentlyperforms in a bra and underwear, Carpenter’s pop performance relishes the messiness, sexual exploration and growth of one’s mid-20s via refreshingly catchy tunes. Rae’s brown-eyed, Louisiana girl-next-door perkiness, athletic dancing and pure pop instincts recall a young Britney Spears – except, crucially, she is 24, and has been pursuing mega-fame on her own terms for years on TikTok. Both she and Carpenter exist at the young adult nexus of self-awareness and youthful abandon, their frank sexuality both cheeky and serious.It’s worth noting that how Carpenter and Rae’s look influences the conversation. Both are conventionally gorgeous, styled as pinups but not busty, obviously Hollywood but still seemingly natural. The Man’s Best Friend image would read differently if Carpenter adhered more to the prevailing trends of body modification. If, in other words, she looked like a Kardashian, transforming her body and looks into a male-brained ideal of a female cyborg. With each passing day, I am personally less and less interested in perceived artistic “authenticity” – supposedly confessional lyrics, lore, celebrities pandering that they’re just like you – and more and more drawn in by authenticity of form, real or perceived. In a sea of snatched faces, plumped lips and freakishly hourglass bodies, it feels refreshing to see pop stars who are still idealized but within normal human proportions. When it comes to the amorphous cause of women, I’m much more concerned with the paradigm shift toward celebrities flaunting their plastic surgery – human bodies metamorphosed through procedures and substances at exorbitant cost, like thePygmalion myth in reverse– than Carpenter on her knees.But she’d probably say I’m overthinking it. This is pop music, after all – sex sells, and whether people are buying her shtick or not, we’re still talking about her album.Explore more on these topicsSabrina CarpenterPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

Turning my gaze north, there is the entire Llyn peninsula leading east to the peak of Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon), no doubt weighed down by thousands of visitors. Up here there are just two of us in an utterly peaceful landscape. No clouds on the horizon. No surprises.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Summer has come early to these mountains and I wouldn’t be anywhere else, drinking in that particular kind of tranquillity to be found on a peak under a blue sky.Mountains were not always seen as appropriate places to relax on a summer’s day. Those lofty, mist-wreathed realms held surprises, most of them nasty, such as trolls and demons. Maybe a few ancient folk knew perfectly well that mountains in summer were wonderful, but they weren’t the sort to publicise the fact: the solitary shepherd, gold prospectors not yet consumed by gold fever, and the workers who put up drystone walls – they all must have known the joy of lazing on a summit, perhaps seeing shapes in clouds.Changing culture and taste took a revolution led by artists and poets, men such asNicolas Poussin, who in the 17th century tried to win people over with paintings of mysterious peaks and epic landscapes. Unfortunately, he couldn’t resist adding a fallen Grecian column and a nymph draped in wispy stuff. It took another 150 years before the German artistCaspar David Friedrichrelocated the wispy bits to the mountain tops, evicted the nymphs, and added one rugged poetic type, gazing out over the towering tors with a vaguely proprietorial air. His Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog(1818, now in Hamburg at the Kunsthalle) remains the most evocative depiction of the romantic ideal.View image in fullscreenA close-up of Caspar David Friedrich’s painting Wanderer above the Sea of Fog (1818).Photograph: AlamyAfter that painting, summer in the mountains wasde rigueur,but it turned out that Friedrich’s sturdy 19th-century mountaineer was actually looking for a place to build a man-shed. All over the continent, wealthy romantics started funding simple dormitory accommodation, often precariously balanced on vertiginous crags. These mountain refuges were vital in allowing people to access the peaks, and became a huge part of my own enjoyment of the mountains.The first to be built wasRefuge des Grands Muletson Mont Blanc in 1853. There is still a hut there, rebuilt a couple of times, perched at 3,051 metres (10,009ft), overlooking the Bossons glacier. My own favourite,Rifugio Nuvolau, is a period classic in the Dolomites, built in 1883 and a haven of stout carpentry, hearty food and astonishing sunsets. Not all are antiques:Monte Rosanear Zermatt is an aluminium solar-powered box that sits above the Gorner glacier and requires ropes and crampons in order to reach it.Some huts are very high indeed: theMargheritaon the Italian Monte Rosa is, at 4,554 metres, the highest building in Europe. Sweden’sLåktatjåkko(1,228 metres) is both high in altitude and latitude: it’s 155 miles (250km) inside the Arctic Circle and often buried in snow, even in summer. Digging to the front door is worth the effort: they serve fantastic waffles with cloudberry jam.The staff in these huts are usually charming and helpful. Not all guests, however, are so wonderful. “There was one British visitor who, during the course of the night, pushed all the other sleepers along the dormitory bench,” complained one French guest after staying inRefuge de Ciottulu di i Moriin Corsica. “He left a huge empty space behind him and we were all squashed up in one corner.” (I’ve no idea why I rolled like that. I was fast asleep.)View image in fullscreenA 19th-century photo of Refuge des Grands Mulets on Mont Blanc, Europe’s first mountain refuge.Photograph: Heritage Image Partnership/AlamyMaking a reservation in one of these treasures can require persistence. The famous ones are often booked out, but many of the huts I’ve mentioned have alternatives nearby.Where there are no mountain huts available, a tent is not always needed. In Romania’s Carpathians, I’ve slept in hay ricks after jolly evenings drinking plum brandy with farmers. Sadly, the hay rick is disappearing as agriculture modernises, but the Carpathians remain a fine mountain destination.Oncea local hunter persuaded me to go on a bear hunt(no guns involved). We climbed through shady pine forest and golden flower-sprinkled meadows to warm rock and vast vistas. The hunter described a recent incident when he was chased up a tree by a bear. He proved it by showing his rucksack, complete with claw marks. On our descent, we stumbled on a fresh bear track and, for a second, the idyllic evening was shot through by lightning bolts of adrenaline.An undeniable fact of mountain life is that moments of arcadian bliss can be abruptly ended. You go up in sun, and descend in a wild storm. The unpredictable must be expected. Helm Crag in the Lake District was a favourite of Romantic poet William Wordsworth and for that reason many go to commune with nature.My favourite refuge is a period classic in the Dolomites, built in 1883 and a haven of stout carpentry, hearty food and astonishing sunsetsOne blustery lunchtime, I was sitting a little below the craggy summit about to enjoy a picnic when a group on the top suddenly flung their grandmother into the air. Caught by the wind, the old lady was whipped sideways and down, straight into the sandwich that was about to go in my mouth. Ash-scattering ceremonies really should be more careful. The ancestor went to her final resting place tainted with Branston pickle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To climb the Rhinogydd (often anglicised to Rhinogs), I based myself at the off-grid retreat of Garth Gell farm, all lovely hand-worn woodwork, flagstone floors and dusty books.The Rhinogydd are often touted as the most rugged mountain chain south of Hadrian’s Wall, which is a bit hard on the North Pennines and Cheviots, but the paths are certainly steep and challenging, deterring many visitors. The chain stretches for about 13 miles, with the highest point at Y Llethr (756 metres) where the 360-degree panorama is really special. The view is, of course, a big part of the attraction. We go up because we can see further.View image in fullscreenRhinog Fach and Llyn Hywel from Y Llethr in the Rhinogydd, Wales.Photograph: Shoults/AlamyMy snooze on Rhinog Fach is interrupted by my companion. “Look!” he says. The best summer mountain experiences always have that unexpected moment: the bear jumps out and claws your rucksack, human remains land in your picnic … that kind of thing. I sit up, suddenly alert.“On the wall. Down there.”There’s a bird, its pale chest striped with grey, its tail fanned out in annoyance as a horde of smaller birds are mobbing it. And then it calls.I have never considered the cuckoo to be a mountain bird, but there it is at 600 metres on a Welsh hill. And at the same time, away to the west, the haze lifts a little and the blue horizon puckers behind the last bit of Wales. The Blackstairs Mountains of Ireland have appeared. A summer’s day in the mountains is complete.Accommodation was provided byGarth Gell, aKip hideaway, which sleeps six from £240 a nightExplore more on these topicsWalking holidaysEurope holidaysWales holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysWalkingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I am, however, writing a column forNational Beer Dayon 15 June (the same as Father’s Day – yawn). Why am I doing this? Well, today is the night before, AKA New Beers’ Eve, and isn’t a pun as glorious as that worth celebrating?If you’re taking the time to observe the occasion, it’s worth enjoying your beer properly, so the ideal is to enjoy a pint in a pub, where the nectar is poured fresh, the lines are clean, the glassware is bespoke (ideally), and the server doesn’t care whether you live or die (unideally). But if you’d rather pay £3 instead ofthe new national average of £5for a single beer, you’re probably better off staying home, so I asked some industry folk, each of them no stranger to replicating the best drinking experiences in a domestic setting, how to achieve the perfect serve without leaving the house.For Matthew Curtis, drinks writer and founder of drinks magazinePellicle, it all starts with the cleanliness of the glass, which is, naturally, a little more tricky to achieve at home than at a bar, where specialist kit is involved. “Clean it thoroughly with hot, soapy water and using a dedicated brush. If you use a dishwasher, you’re going to get oil and residue on the glass, which will cause nucleation of bubbles on the insides and your beer won’t keep a head. Also, before use, always rinse the glass with cold water to make sure there’s no dirt on it.”Elizabeth Townsend, meanwhile, may ownKerroo Brewing Co, but at home she uses anEdel stemmed glassto get the most from her beer: “It keeps your drink nice and cold, because you’re not holding on to it like a pint glass, plus the rim allows more aromas to get to your nose.”Karen Edith Millar, who runsAll Good Beer’s bottle shop in east London, has another, more unexpected, tip: “You can make any rubbish lager from the back of the fridge instantly drinkable by chucking a dash of Campari into it, because the bitterness of the Campari takes away that sweet flavour you can get in more cheaply made beers. If you’re a fan of a west coast IPA’s hoppy bitterness, for instance, it will really scratch that itch.”That said, if you’re anything like me and a beer has a maximum life expectancy of about two hours once it gets through your front door, there may not be any rubbish lagers in your fridge to begin with, so this week’s pick features a selection of brilliant beers that require no additions.Celebrate new beers’ eve with a bangKirin Ichiban Premium Beer First Press£3.80 (500ml) Starry Mart, 5%.

The best bit is neither the tomato flesh nor the bread, it’s the salted tomato water that runs down the back of my hands and threatens to meet my elbows. It’s liquid electricity and one of my favourite earthly flavours. It could make a great stock, or a delicious martini, perhaps even a marinade for ceviche, but here it’s thrown in at the end to refresh a dish of gently cooked tomatoes, beans and dill. Perfect for dunking anything but elbows into.Grated tomato and butter beans with olive pangrattatoIdeally, you’ll need a food processor or blender for the pangrattato; if you don’t have one, tear the bread into small chunks, then toss with the olives, spread out on a chopping board and chop through a few times until you have a fine-ish crumb.Prep10 minCook30 minServes46-8 largeripe tomatoes(750g)Fine sea salt85g sourdough(ie 1 big slice), chopped, plus extra to serve30g pitted kalamata olives(about 8)Extra-virgin olive oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 tsp ancho or aleppo chilli flakes2400g tins butter beans, drained and rinsed – I likeCirio25g dill, leaves picked to get 18g, roughly choppedGrate the tomatoes into a bowl and discard the skins. Add half a teaspoon of salt, mix, then tip into a sieve and set over the empty bowl to catch the juice – don’t discard the juice.Put the sourdough and pitted olives in a food processor and pulse to fine breadcrumbs. Put two tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil in a pan on a medium heat and, when hot, add the bread and olive crumbs and cook, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until dry and crumbly.Put three tablespoons of olive oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat and, when hot, add the crushed garlic and the chilli flakes, and cook, stirring, for two minutes, until fragrant and light brown. Tip in the drained beans, the tomato pulp from the sieve and a half-teaspoon of salt, turn up the heat to high and cook, stirring every now and then, for 10 minutes.Tip in the reserved tomato juice from the bowl and half the dill, and stir to combine. Tip everything out on to a lipped platter, scatter the breadcrumb mix on top and finish with the remaining dill. Drizzle liberally with more extra-virgin olive oil and serve with toasted sourdough to ladle the beans on top of.Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodVegetarian food and drinkBeans, pulses and legumesTomatoesMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"
