Yet the treachery of the turret appears to have dragged them back to the TV.The overnight ratings for The Celebrity Traitors – which measures the number of people watching live or later that evening on iPlayer reveal that more than half of the people aged between 16 and 24 viewing the show within that time slot watched every episode of The Celebrity Traitors as it was broadcast.The show’s finale broke records. Its overnight average audience was more than 11 million, the biggest of the year and the biggest since the Gavin & Stacey special on Christmas Day. It was watched by 81% of the viewers aged 16-24 who were watching linear TV in that time slot, according to Digital i.The Celebrity Traitors viewing figures for 16- to 24-year-olds watching linear TV in that time slot“At a time when younger audiences are increasingly turning away from live linear TV,The Traitorshas grown into appointment viewing for 16- to 24-year-olds in the UK,” said Matt Ross, Digital i’s chief analytics officer. “The most recent iteration has been a major draw for younger viewers.”The race is now on to dissect that success and see what lessons can be taken from the show – or whether its mass appeal and ability to reach younger viewers is simply an increasingly rare anomaly.Katy Fox, executive producer at Studio Lambert, which makes the show for theBBC, said: “The idea of the whole family stopping what they’re doing and sitting round the telly to share in a hugely positive, joyous show is exactly what you hope for as producers.“The best thing about the 16- to 24-year-olds taking to Traitors so faithfully is just the sheer amount of energy and creativity they bring to fandom – from memes to videos to Halloween costumes and everything in between – it’s fantastic.”View image in fullscreenCat Burns, Claudia Winkleman, Alan Carr, Nick Mohammed, David Olusoga and Joe Marler during The Celebrity Traitors final, which broke records.Photograph: Paul Chappells/BBC/Studio LambertThe show’s success is timely for the BBC after concerns were raised about its long-term appeal to gen Z. Just this week, Jordan Schwarzenberger, the manager of the hugely successful YouTube collective theSidemen, said the corporation risked becomingculturally irrelevant to young audiences.Industry insiders say there are plenty of lessons to be learned from The Celebrity Traitors. They point to its “always on” appeal, with the live show acting almost like a live sports event, with an official podcast, numerous clipped moments and an embrace of fan-made memes and content meaning there is always Traitors-related material to consume during the week.Kate Phillips, the BBC’s chief content officer who first commissioned the programme, said her initial interest in the show was born out of the pandemic, when she felt the need to find shows that brought people together. Since then, she says the show, which began as a Dutch format, grew rapidly by word of mouth across the generations – a key measure for the BBC, tasked with providing content with mass appeal.“What I want is shows that have the 3Gs at their heart,” she said. “By that, I mean shows that have three generations of people all watching together. One thing I’ve taken away is that, actually, young people really love to watch with their parents, with their grandparents. People really appreciate it.”View image in fullscreenAlan Carr was the eventual winner of The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertAs for why the show had reached younger viewers, she pointed to partnerships with TikTok, linking the platform directly with iPlayer. She also says the show’s social strategy was “built with the under-35s, and particularly the under-24s, firmly in mind”. The show has been endlessly clipped, while the BBC has also been relaxed about fans jumping in and making their own viral content.Phillips said for all the talk of linear TV’s declining importance, The Celebrity Traitors also demonstrated how the medium could still play a critical role as a “shop window” for the best content.“Celebrity Traitors can be on linear TV, but it evolves into a cross-platform, shared experience that feels very current, very fun and very unfiltered,” she said. “The memes and the comments – it’s like a kind of second entertainment show running alongside the main show.”Jon Willers, a media consultant who has been thinking about how to reach gen Z, said the show’s success pointed to the industry’s need to reinvent and reskill itself for the social media age. “It’s one of those few shows that bridges two different worlds,” he said. “There’s a digital world, which skews younger and it’s more about socials and less about watching traditional telly. Then you’ve got the traditional world, which is about seeing what’s on at 9pm.“There are very few instances at the moment where a show can kind of penetrate both of those places. There needs to be more shows that have that vision and that ambition. It shows that people aren’t necessarily leaving TV. They’re leaving TV that doesn’t really speak to them.“We’ve all been very siloed up to this point. TV producers make TV programmes. Social creators make content on socials. Broadcasters are essentially the publishers and help with marketing. TV producers are now trying to be much more multi-platform.”View image in fullscreenThe Celebrity Traitors presenter Claudia Winkleman. The makers of the show say casting is crucial.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertIn fact, The Celebrity Traitors is not the only big hit to find an audience with gen Z, as traditional broadcasters attempt to adapt to the different ways in which they find and dissect their chosen shows.The prime example is Dancing With the Stars, the US version of Strictly Come Dancing. It was once on a par with other reality formats, but has now found itself as the dominant title in the genre. It did so by embracing online culture by using viral songs, bringing in dancers with a big social media presence and broadening the cast.“Dancing With the Stars leaned heavily into the creator ecosystem – casting creators as contestants,” said Evan Shapiro, a Hollywood producer turned leading analyst on the creator economy. “It obviously paid off,” he added.“Celebrity Traitors collected a truly fascinating cross-section of entertainment culture in the UK and then leaned heavily into creator ethos – clipping the show ad nauseam, encouraging user-generated content.”He said it was proof that big broadcasters and titles could adapt to changing consumption. “The mindset of successful crossover IP [from TV to social media] is ‘the show is the clip and the clip is the show – and together they are the show’. It’s all proof that when big publishers act like creators, they can be dominant creators themselves.”For The Celebrity Traitors, its makers say casting was crucial and included the likes of Niko Omilana, who has more than 8 million subscribers on YouTube, though he left the game early on.View image in fullscreenNick Mohammed during the final roundtable.Photograph: BBC“We’ve always believed that The Traitors is a format that can appeal to every generation, and have always tried to reflect that in our casting,” said Fox. “Having a celebrity cast with a broad range of ages and personalities meant we were confident younger viewers would identify with cast members they already know … and maybe even get to know national treasures they didn’t! We’re delighted with the results.”For others in the industry, the discussion about how to keep younger audiences tuned in is complicating a simple equation. In show business, the golden rule still stands – it is all about hits.Peter Fincham, co-CEO of the production company Expectation and co-hosts the podcast Insiders TV, said: “The most powerful form of marketing is always going to be word of mouth. It’s in the conversation at home, at work, at school.“When that happens, you get young people watching. What is maybe a little bit more unusual in the modern age is what you would call an old-fashioned, mainstream hit that gets everybody talking.“I’m quite wary of the trend analysis. This is the simplest thing in the world. Have a great big hit and you will get a lot of people viewing it of all ages. That was true 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago.”"

He worked in construction and the sprawling transient accommodation for the hundreds of families who’d relocated to build an aluminium plant became our home. I was going on 16 and sulking about having to change schools, again. Then I met Paul.Back in those days people made their own fun. We often had huge parties at the caravan park, and Paul, an apprentice electrician, would volunteer to rig up the lighting.View image in fullscreenPaul and Lynne in Queensland in 1967Despite the age difference (he’d just turned 21), we became friendly. My parents and I were sharing a 15ft caravan, and while they adored Paul, he was never allowed inside.For two years we’d spend hours under the awning chatting away. He’d pick me up from my ballet classes, and on Friday night we’d get fish and chips with my parents and sit on a little hill overlooking the beach drinking cheap white wine.In the most innocent way I considered him my boyfriend, and he sort of became part of the family. My mother was mildly horrified when he gave me a friendship ring but I wore it so proudly and still have it today. I was incredibly naive, but Paul was always so respectful.Then my family packed up again and I spent months sending Paul lovelorn letters from Darwin, on pastel purple paper drowned in Imprevu perfume.Eventually the letters stopped and life moved on.I finished school and set off on a big American road trip on the way to Central America: LA, New Orleans, Florida and then spent about seven months staying with a family friend on an oil rig encampment in Venezuela, surrounded by barbed wire and guards.Meanwhile, little did I know that Paul had washed up in Darwin looking for me. For reasons we’ve never really been able to work out, my mother took him in and encouraged him to save money to meet me in the United States.Communicating via snail mail, we arranged to meet in Miami. He booked two hotel rooms, but we only used one. We didn’t leave the hotel for days – I guess we were making up for lost time. As he says, “We lived on room service and love, at last.”We started Greyhound hopping, travelling where the wind blew us. We were in Orlando for the opening weekend of Disney World in 1971 and stayed in the resort there. They had some wandering musicians who took requests, and we had them perform Moon River for us. I knew then the relationship had really taken off and I never heard that song again without thinking of him.View image in fullscreenLynne and Paul on their travels in Rangoon, Myanmar, circa 1971We travelled to the UK and finally found our way home to Darwin by Christmas. There, Paul asked my father for my hand in marriage. He was OK with it, but once again my mother baffled us all by totally disapproving, despite the fact she’d been the one who encouraged him to come and meet me overseas. I don’t know what she thought was going to happen on that trip, but I guess us getting married at the end wasn’t part of her plan.Things between me and Paul fell apart after that, yet he remained firm friends with my family and all our friends, so I always knew what was going on in his life.The moment I knew: the second I heard her voice again, the planets realignedRead morePaul married, had a family and built his own boat, taking eight years to sail it from Australia to the Mediterranean. Despite all his adventures and happy marriage, he says he always held a flame for me.By 2011 I had two adult children, had been divorced for over a decade and was living in Perth. Paul tracked me down and what was supposed to be a friendly catch-up at a cafe while he was visiting for work eventually spiralled into much more.My friends thought I was crazy for getting caught up with my still-married childhood sweetheart, but in the 40 years we’d been apart I’d never felt anything like the feelings I still had for Paul.We handled things as respectfully as possible but that doesn’t mean people weren’t hurt. It has taken time to rebuild some relationships that were damaged.In 2015 we walked to our beachfront altar to Moon River.Every time Paul has come into my life there have been moments I knew he was the one for me. But when you are young you can be blind to how rare they are in life. It was only with the benefit of hindsight that we could both fully grasp how profound our connection was.While there were a few lighting bolts along the way, ours was a slow burn. When we reunited in our 60s it felt, quite simply, like coming home.Tell us the moment you knewShare your experienceShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

She wasn’t allowed to see her family for more than a few hours a week. How did the system we trusted – and I worked for as a GP – fail us so tragically?Kate SzymankiewiczSat 8 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTShareIremember so clearly the moment it dawned on me that the mental health ward where my teenage daughter was being treated felt like little more than a prison. Ruth had been so trusting. So had we. That all changed the day she was moved from our local hospital to Thames Ward at Huntercombe hospital in Berkshire. When we left, she walked so easily down to the hospital transport with me and the play therapist – who hugged her tight and waved goodbye. When the van door opened at the other end, the stark building loomed over us. We were met and escorted up a flight of stairs and through the double, air-locked, doors, one slamming closed behind us, the person with the keys waiting for the first lock to click before opening the next. This was a sealed unit, devoid of natural light, my eyes aching already from the harsh glare overhead. We were taken to an inner room, lined with windows. The goldfish bowl, they called it.Ruth’s hand slipped into mine, head down as they told me it was time for me to go. “But I haven’t settled her into her room or met any of the staff yet,” was met with: “Parents aren’t allowed on the ward.” I asked again, and they conceded I could see her room, just once, but then I had to leave immediately. It was hospital policy.I still wake at night, heart pounding as I relive those steps through the communal area, to Ruth’s allocated room. A single bed, a plastic side table. Windows that did not open. The voices became distant as they explained there would be a new person every hour through the day and night who would “observe Ruth”. I placed her bag on the floor. Ruth sat, terrified, on the bed and then I was ushered out. Suddenly, I found myself locked on the other side of those double doors, clutching a piece of paper that told me I could visit my daughter for one hour, twice a week.What have I let them do?Our daughter, Ruth Szymankiewicz, died on 14 February 2022 at 18.29 on the paediatric intensive care unit at John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford. She was rushed there from Huntercombe hospital, an NHS commissioned but privately run child and adolescent mental health unit, where she had been left to fatally self-harm two days earlier. She had been in the unit for treatment of an eating disorder for almost five months, sent there just 10 days after her 14th birthday.That question, “What have I let them do?”, reverberates constantly around my head even now, nearly four years later. Those doors closed, severing our child from her family. Not in my worst nightmares did I imagine that it was also a precursor to all the horrors that followed, and to her being shut out from our lives for ever.Ruth was a vibrant, loving child who danced through life confident in her knack of making friends and throwing herself into the activities she loved. We were sent a card after she died, describing her as the kind of friend you wish for your child to find, like a favourite Enid Blyton character – bold, inquisitive, fun, loyal and a little bit cheeky. She was truly herself out in the wild, at one with nature; mud on her cheeks, bramble scratches on her legs, high up a tree or wading out in a river. Yet she also found stillness and a perseverance and determination to finish what she set out to do. We would find her curled up with a story on the shed roof, or stretched out on a rainy day with her head in the dog’s lap, lost in magical worlds in the pages of books. At the age of 10, the school librarian asked her to help write reading quizzes for other pupils as she had read the entire collection. At the age of 11, on hearing that her dad was considering climbing Kilimanjaro, Ruth firmly announced that she would be going too, and duly did. She was focused and immensely persuasive. She spent her time filling in forms for us to foster children and adopt animals, writing to supermarkets about their use of single-use plastics. She was driven from an early age to make the world a better place.Any child put into the circumstances that she was would be destroyed, yet I feel it is all the more cruel for a girl who loved to be outdoors and was so freeI still cannot fathom how that bright, happy child ended up where she did, nor how we ended up so lost in a system we had trusted. I know that any child put into the circumstances that she was would be destroyed, yet I feel it is all the more cruel for a girl who loved to be outdoors and was so free.Ruth had developed an eating disorder rapidly over what felt like a few weeks when she was 13 but, in retrospect, there had been warning signs over the preceding years. When her stress response was high, she needed things to be much more ordered. Controlling her eating and exercise was often part of that. For Ruth, it was also tied in with a deep concern for the climate crisis and planetary health. She couldn’t bring herself to eat foods wrapped in plastic or not ethically sourced. She had neurodivergent traits and, like many girls on the high end of the autistic spectrum, masked and functioned so effectively through primary school. The sudden “overwhelm” seemed to come from nowhere once she reached adolescence and with the transition to secondary school.Ruth was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome at the end of 2020, when she had an acute onset of severe vocal and motor tics. At the time, and even as a doctor, I knew little about the syndrome and rapidly discovered that there was no local support whatsoever.However, with true resilience, Ruth navigated her way through the tics, embraced the therapeutic input that we could only access privately, and found her way back into her vision of life. By the summer of 2021, we were heaving a sigh of relief as things seemed to be back on track for us as a family – only then to be completely blind-sided by a rapid escalation of Ruth not being able to eat at all.View image in fullscreenKate Szymankiewicz: ‘Why did I not just take her home?’Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The GuardianIt got worse while we were waiting for an assessment from the eating disorder team and, after six days of Ruth not eating anything, our GP sent us to the local general children’s ward at Salisbury hospital for a review. And there we stayed.I have a vivid recollection of our second night in hospital.I had raided the shop for any food I could think to tempt Ruth with – hospital canteen dinners  were never going to do it. We had figured out the TV screen on its giant arm. Ruth had climbed out of her bed on to the oversized armchair with me. We had half  pulled it out, not fully in bed form, so that we could watch the film together with our legs stretched out in front. Ruth had made a huge effort and eaten half a tub of couscous and was nibbling on bits of popcorn while I shovelled in chocolate. If I close my eyes I can still feel the pressure of her body squeezed in next to mine. I cannot recall what we watched. It didn’t matter. I was just soaking her in. Thinking we had hope.Why did I not just take her home then? She ate some cereal the following morning, but by that point the creaking wheels of the eating disorder service were being activated and a stern dietician began laying down the rules: hospital until Ruth ate her entire meal plan. Tube feeding if she didn’t. And, like a good little rule follower, I listened and trusted their advice. I was grateful even, for someone to tell me how to navigate this. Yet, all the while, a little voice inside me knew that Ruth needed something different.The Mental Health Act is supposed to be a protective mechanism for people, yet without specific provision for children, it stripped Ruth of her rights and of all our protectionIt all seems a blur now, and at the time even more so, trying to juggle two younger children on school holidays, telling work that I couldn’t be there for a few weeks. The day they decided to start nasogastric (NG) feeding was the first of many sliding door moments. The clinicians said that Ruth would need to be under section of the MentalHealthAct rather than doing it with our parental consent. An NG feed is when a small tube is passed up through the nostril and down the throat to administer a liquid feed directly into the stomach. It isn’t a pleasant process and although Ruth was initially compliant, they felt she wouldn’t want a tube forced down her nose and into her stomach, given the choice. And so it began, without us really having any comprehension of what that “section” would mean in reality.The Mental Health Act is supposed to be a protective mechanism for people, yet, in its current state, without specific provision for children, it stripped Ruth of her rights and of all our protection. The decisions about every aspect of Ruth’s care were taken over by the clinical team looking after her. As her parents, we were suddenly powerless.Ruth’s trust in the eating disorder team diminished – stretched beyond capacity, they barely ventured to the ward to help us. In contrast, the paediatric ward team tried so hard to support us – they helped us to access the garden of a nearby hospice so we could spend hours outside, and busy nursing staff made time to braid Ruth’s hair, play games and bond over shared interests. But our requests to take her home and to visit family to try to “reset” were denied. Ruth’s mood plummeted and when her initial section expired after 28 days, we took the opportunity to bring her home.She got so close to eating again back at home, but not close enough, and after four days ended up back in hospital the week before her 14th birthday. Within days of readmission, disaster struck and the nasogastric feeding tube was inadvertently inserted into her lungs – something called a “never” event, a technical term used in the NHS for one that should never happen. Ruth’s lung filled up with the liquid feed and she rapidly became unable to breathe. The doctors had to carry out an emergency intubation, putting a tube into her lungs to keep breathing for her. With no paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in Salisbury, she was transferred immediately to Southampton hospitaland remained there for three days.If I close my eyes, I can transport myself back to that time in Southampton. I recall my energy drained away, my eyes bleary after the nights of hoping and waiting for Ruth to have recovered enough for them to take out the breathing tubes. I remember holding her hand as the sedation was lifted, my muscles finally relaxing as she breathed on her own again. I was innocent to the fact that this scene would repeat in just a few months, in another intensive care unit, yet that time when they removed the tubes would be for Ruth’s last breaths.The relief of returning to the familiar Salisbury ward was short-lived. We were informed that Ruth was to be transferred to a psychiatric intensive care unit, confusingly also called a PICU. Panicked, we asked for meetings with the eating disorder team but there was no discussion. The reasons kept changing and didn’t add up. One minute we were told she was at high risk of absconding and self-harm, the next, that there were no other units available that could provide NG feeding. We frantically researched Thames ward at Huntercombe hospital. It was a ward for children who were making serious attempts to self-harm or were severely psychotic. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) had only just taken it out of special measures. There were serious concerns about the running and safety of the hospital and the ward. A child had died there only a few years earlier.We were exhausted and vulnerable. We felt people were not being transparent. Only at Ruth’s inquest did we learn that our feelings had been correct. There were discussions and meetings being held at that time without our knowledge and input, by people who had never spoken to us or Ruth; making decisions for our child, without our consent.She stopped calling after a while, resigning herself to the fact that, even as her mother, there was nothing I could doRuth hadn’t met any of the criteria laid out in the national guidelines for admission to a psychiatric ICU. She was terrified of the NG feeds, but she was resisting less. She was happily engaged with the play therapist at Salisbury, spending hours putting up wall displays in the ward corridors and sorting out the toy cupboards. She was even joining lessons at school via Zoom. Yet she was still physically so weak, and a severe chest infection she had developed on the ICU was still rattling her breath and exhausting her.Her 14th birthday was on 24 September. They told us not to tell her she was being moved to Huntercombe until the transfer, only days later.At Huntercombe, Ruth was locked into a bleak, scary place away from the people she trusted and loved. She received just two sessions with the hospital psychologist in the four-and-a-half months she was there. We pleaded continuously to be allowed to visit her every day; to help her feel comfortable with the staff and the environment. But the hospital policy of one hour-long visit, twice weekly, was only ever extended to two hours, after we argued it took two hours for us to drive there, each way.I can too clearly recall the muffled silence of Ruth’s voice at the end of a phone – that sound when someone can’t talk because they are crying. To start with, she would call, late at night, distraught that she just wanted to go to sleep, and yet staff were only just arriving to take her for her evening NG feed, or that the screaming and alarms were overwhelming her. Every part of me cried out to drive two hours and bang on the doors until they let me in. She stopped calling after a while, slowly resigning herself to the fact that, even as her mother, there was nothing I could do.View image in fullscreenPictures of Ruth and some of her belongings at her home.We looked at borrowing money so I could rent somewhere close by. In Salisbury, we had stayed with Ruth most nights and she always had us nearby throughout the day. The central tenet to treating an eating disorder is family therapy and meal support. We had been there every meal time, eating alongside her, encouraging her. Yet after Ruth had been at Huntercombe hospital for seven weeks, she told me she hadn’t even seen food since she had arrived there. There was no therapy to help her eat, no therapy to help her with trauma from the “never” event in Salisbury. I was constantly pushing, questioning, challenging. I spent hours every day on the phone, and writing emails, simply trying to have the most basic of communication with the team looking after Ruth.Is it any surprise that in Huntercombe, Ruth shut down? How could she open up to strangers and, as they put it, “engage”? She withdrew into herself. She resisted and “fought” the people who marched into her room three times a day to drag her into the feeding room and stick a tube down into her stomach, fearing they might get it wrong and put it in her lung. She wanted to escape, but there was no way out – until she found the ultimate exit.Try to imagine what your reaction would be if your child went into hospital with, for example, abdominal pain. Imagine the emergency department doctors think they have appendicitis. You’re allowed to follow your child as they’re wheeled up to the children’s ward, but then told you have to leave: it’s hospital policy. Imagine every time you are allowed to visit, your child is more unwell, but no one can tell you why they’re not having any treatment. Imagine your child – sick, scared and alone – and you’re not allowed to be there.The reality is, you can’t imagine it. It just wouldn’t happen on a regular children’s ward. Yet this is the experience for countless families with children on mental health wards across this country.The levels of staffing were so low, the training so poor, the system so chaotic, it was just waiting to happenRuth was given less time outside each day than a prison inmate. Three weeks before her death, a manager from Oxford Health, the NHS trust overseeing her care, told her that she would only be leaving if she started eating or didn’t resist the process of NG feeding – as if she waschoosingto be there. He walked away without giving her any suggestions as to how she was to achieve that. Essentially, she was in a catch-22 – she was there because she couldn’t eat, yet to leave she would have to start eating. Is it any wonder she felt trapped?Ruth’s inquest took place almost four years to the day that she was first admitted to hospital, in August 2025. She died in the care of the state, under section by the Mental Health Act, and because of this there was the requirement to hold an inquest with a jury to examine the cause and contributory factors of her death. You may have seen her smiling face on the news over the summer with the headline “Girl unlawfully killed in mental health unit”.The news stories about Ruth’s death focused on the role of one support worker, who was allocated to “observing” Ruth for the last hour of the day shift, from 7-8pm. It was his first shift in the hospital, and indeed his first shift ever as a mental health support worker. He had been employed by Platinum agency, which was owned by one of the Huntercombe employees. He was signed up to the agency under a false name and with false references. He undertook the mandatory training to be employed as a support worker – less than four hours online, none of which was specific to work in a mental health unit or with children. He was allocated to start the shift on a different ward, but was transferred to Thames Ward as it was significantly short-staffed that day, and he received no induction as they were too busy.At the end of his observation time with Ruth, he asked if his shift had finished and if he could go home. But he was then called to assist with another patient and left Ruth alone. Ruth was seen to have walked past four other members of staff, all of whom knew she was meant to be under constant supervision, and into her room. Three members of ward staff were sitting in the hallway outside her room when she closed the door and took her own life. No one thought to look in her room until it was too late.View image in fullscreenHuntercombe hospital.Photograph: Maureen McLean/AlamyYet we believe the failings in Ruth’s care extend beyond one day and one incident. For us it has never been about the support worker’s actions. The levels of staffing were so low, the training so poor, the system so chaotic, that it was just waiting to happen. Ruth’s death reflects the whole system, and a hospital that was causing harm. A hospital that was privately run by the company Active Care Group. A hospital that is not unique and was one of many units failing our young people across the country.There is no mandatory requirement for agency support workers in paediatric mental health care to receive any training in looking after children, or indeed in mental health care. There is a high reliance on agency staff across Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) units, reflecting the difficulties of training and recruiting permanent staff, but the proportion in privately run units is significantly higher. The night shift at Huntercombe consisted of 80% agency staff. It raises serious questions around private providers putting profits over patient safety. Active Care Group stated publicly in 2024 that they were in severe financial crisis and warned they may not be able to fund the cost of patients’ food, medications or agency staff. Yet the company directors wereset to receive six-figure bonusesthat year.Ruth’s inquest concluded by listing the failings and inadequacies contributing to her death: Ruth was provided with insufficient therapy. Our visits were limited despite family interaction being identified as an integral part of improving her mental wellbeing. We – her parents – were not given adequate information about care options, the appeal process and refusal rights. Ruth’s care pathway was insufficient to allow her to improve towards discharge. Ruth was not prevented from accessing harmful material on the internet. The list went on …Iam a GP as well as a mother. Ruth’s story echoes around my surgery room as I try to support the children, young people and their families who come to me, day after day. How can I send them away knowing how little the Camhs system has to offer, and how far they could fall? One in five children in the UK now has a diagnosed mental health problem. That’s almost 2.5 million children and doesn’t account for those who are struggling but haven’t got an official diagnosis.We strongly believe that if Ruth had been allowed unrestricted access to us, her family, she would still be hereFor eating disorders, early and appropriate intervention is vital. They have the highest rates of mortality of any mental disorder, yet are fully treatable. The Royal College of Psychiatry (RCPsych) is clear that “every child with an eating disorder can be treated effectively if seen early enough”.Eating disorders are increasing at a terrifying rate in England: 8,034 children started treatment in 2019/2020, 11,809 in 2022/2023, and in just the last three months of 2024, 7,933 were referred for treatment. Many eating disorder services in this country can only take on children who are severely unwell as they do not have the staff or resources to treat them. There are thousands more children who are not yet at crisis point, so they have to wait. Without intervention they will only get worse. But in March this year, the RCPsych identified plans that would cut funding for children and young people’s eating disorder services in more than half the areas across England.It is easy to get lost in where the system got it so wrong, so I’d like to suggest how we might get it right. We need, as a bare minimum, the Mental Health Act to uphold the rights of all children and to protect them at their most vulnerable. Children need unrestricted access to their parents or guardians (unless it is not in their best interests). Visiting policies used on general paediatric wards across the UK typically allow open and unrestricted visiting, 24/7, for parents and primary carers. It is crucial that children should have the same access to their families, irrespective of whether they are on a children’s ward in a general hospital, or a children’s ward in a mental health hospital. We strongly believe that if Ruth had been allowed unrestricted access to us, her family, she would still be here. Children should not be admitted to adult mental health units (approximately 120 were sent to adult units last year), and children should not be sent far from home, or out of area.We need to extend Camhs to continue to support young people until the age of 21. The transition from children’s to adult services is at such a crucial stage, while the brain is still developing, and my young patients who are already under Camhs are essentially abandoned on the day they turn 18.There are wonderful examples in other countries, such as Sweden and Australia, where family-focused community support means hospital admissions are far fewer. When children are admitted, the core principle is family-centred care. Children are allowed to have their parent or carer stay alongside them, day and night. It strikes me that if families are together with their children, a culture of neglect and abuse can no longer grow up behind closed doors. The numbers tell a stark story – the average admission to a mental health unit for a child in Sweden is less than 11 days. In Australia, it is less than nine days. For a child, in the UK it is 74 days.Ruth’s funeral was held under a ceiling of clouds and vibrant leaves. We couldn’t bear to trap her indoors any longer, and her wicker coffin rested beneath the branches of a large oak tree. So many of those who loved her gathered in the weak spring sunshine. A butterfly joined us to rest on the daffodils. We listened to, among other music,Fight Songby Rachel Platten. The words seem apt to finish with: “Like a small boat on the ocean, sending big waves into motion, like how a single word can make a heart open, I might only have one match but I can make an explosion.”Ruth’s heart was so strong; full of love, life and joy. Her death has completely flattened our family and all those who knew her. With her love of sailing, I can imagine her small boat heading off into the distance for the final time. Perhaps for all the pain, the ripples that her story has left behind can become waves that grow into a storm of positive and powerful change.In a statement, a spokesperson for the Active Care Group expressed their deep regret over the events leading to Ruth’s death, and said they had not engaged the Platinum agency since the incident. They added: “In recent years, we have made significant improvements to the quality and safety in all of our services. We are dedicated to learning any further lessons with the aim of preventing any future tragic incidents.” They pointed out that 96% of their services are rated Good or Outstanding by the CQC.

Income tax is a “big hitter” that makes up more than a quarter of all tax that is collected, says Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown.In current financial year income tax will rake in £330.7bn, according to the Treasury’s independent forecaster, theOffice for Budget Responsibility(OBR). This is about 27% of all receipts and equivalent to about£11,500 for each household.An income tax rise “would be incredibly difficult politically” and “hit taxpayers hard, adding hundreds of pounds to their tax bill every year”, adds Coles.The impact of any change, of course, depends on how much the taxpayer earns. They don’t pay tax on the first £12,570 they earn with the 20% basic rate applied on the portion of their income that falls between £12,571 and £50,270.The higher 40% rate kicks in at £50,271 before ratcheting up to 45% above £125,140. (Note, Scotland’s income tax rates and thresholds are set by the Scottish parliament.)Income tax rise scenarios chart“If government wanted to change income tax, the most straightforward option would be to add 1p to the basic rate of tax, increasing it from 20% to 21%,” says Laura Suter, the director of personal finance at AJ Bell. “That would cost taxpayers up to £377 a year in extra tax, with anyone earning £50,270 or more facing the maximum hit.”Each year HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)models the impact of upping income taxand its sums show adding 1p to the basic rate would raise an extra £6.9bn in 2026/7 and a total £23.4bn over the next three years.For someone earning £35,000 a year, roughly the average income of a UK adult, an extra 1p on income tax would make their annual bill rise from £4,486 to £4,710 – an increase of £224.1p on higher and additional rate taxReeves has made much of the government’s desire to getthose with the “broadest shoulders”to pay more. But targeting taxpayers in these groups brings in a lot less cash.Adding 1p on higher-rate income tax would generate an extra £1.6bn in 2026/7 and a total of £5.8bn over the next three years, according to the same HMRC data.View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves has said the government wants to get those with the “broadest shoulders” to pay more.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAPutting 1p on the additional rate that kicks in at £125,140 raises even less – at £145m in 2026-27 and £640m over three years.However, by targeting only higher earners the government could argue that the average earner has been shielded. “If you earned £35,000 a year, an extra 1p on higher-rate tax wouldn’t cost you anything,” says Coles. “The more you earn, the harder this hits, so if you earned £55,000, it would cost you an extra £47 a year and if you earned £75,000, it would cost you an extra £247.”Arise across the boardThis option is easy to understand and could be positioned as a straightforward change affecting everyone – “we all need to do our bit,” as Reeves put it – and hitting higher earners harder.If an extra 1p was added at every level, someone earning £35,000 a year would see the same change as just a basic rate rise – at £224. Meanwhile if they earned £55,000, it would cost them an extra £424 and if they earn £75,000, it adds up to £624 more.Increasing all rates of income tax by one percentage point would yield almost £11bn a year by 2029–30 with the bulk of that figure coming from basic rate taxpayers, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.‘Two up two down’A plan to increase income tax rates and lower national insurance rates by two percentage pointsis thought to be one of the frontrunners. It might sounds like robbing Peter to pay Paul but the switcheroo raises £6bn while protecting workers’ pay packets, according to theResolution Foundation.Doing it this way cancels out the income tax hit for employees but would push up the tax bills of pensioners, landlords and savers.On Friday the Times reported that Reeves was considering limiting the national insurance cut to basic rate taxpayers (earning up to £50,270) to ensure that those with the “broadest shoulders” bore the biggest burden.View image in fullscreenIncreasing income tax rates and lowering national insurance rates by two percentage points would push up the tax bills of landlords.Photograph: Paul Maguire/AlamyFor the average worker earning £35,000 this policy would not change how much tax they pay, but a retiree with the same level of income would see their annual tax bill rise by £449 to £4,935.Tom Selby, the director of public policy at AJ Bell, says doing it this way means Reeves could still “claim to be protecting the pay packets of ‘working people’”. However, he says: “This would not be the case for retirees. Someone with a taxable retirement income of £35,000 would face a tax hike of almost £450, while a pensioner with an income of £65,000 would be stung with a tax increase of more than £1,000.”“While hitting pensioners in the pocket will clearly be unpopular – particularly in the wake of the winter fuel payment fiasco - it may be viewed as the least bad option,” adds Selby.Extend the freeze on tax thresholds by another two yearsTraditionallypersonal tax thresholdsare adjusted to keep pace with inflation; however, they have been frozen in cash terms since 2022.The policy results in what economists call“fiscal drag”, a term that describes the stealthy process of dragging more Britons into paying income tax and pushing others into a higher tax band when they get a pay rise.The freeze, introduced by Rishi Sunak as chancellor, is supposed toend in 2028but some experts think Reeves will extend it until 2030.“It’s taxation by stealth: the rates stay the same, but a bigger slice of your pay disappears into the taxman’s coffers,” says Ade Babatunde, the senior financial planning director at the wealth manager Rathbones.If the freeze runs on until 2030, someone earning £35,000 in 2022 could pay £926 more tax over the eight yearsthan if the thresholds had kept pace with inflation. For a £50,000 salary the figure is £4,632 and, at £80,000, its £5,635. On £100,000 the effect is just over £7,000. (The Rathbones calculations assume wage growth in line with OBR data and forecasts until 2029, and 2% inflation in 2030.)Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025TaxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Delivery companies charge restaurants obscenely high rates, destroying profit margins, and add even more charges and cost to the consumer. Yes, they’re convenient (itself part of the problem), but I’d rather cook dinner myself and save my cash to eat out once in a while.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.One way I stopped ordering so many takeaways – post-pandemic, during which I orderedfartoo many – was to tell myself that it’s quicker and cheaper to cook something simple, rather than order in. Sometimes, however, we all want something we haven’t cooked ourselves, right? And that’s where curry kits come in. They’re very quick to make up with the simple addition of a few veggies, a can of beans and/or some prawns or chicken from the freezer. OK, there’s still a little washing-up, but that’s a small price to pay.I set out to test tikka masala curry kits, but there weren’t enough on the market, so I ended up working my way through a range of kits instead, including balti and butter chicken. I tried to keep things consistent by making only chicken curries, though of course all these kits can be adapted to be vegetarian or to include seafood or other meat, and I made each one strictly according to the manufacturer’s instructions, without adding any of my own optional extras. Yes, part of the fun of a curry kit is that you can bung in a few ingredients of your own choosing, but some of these kits called for the inclusion of more than two additional ingredients (often expensive ones such as cream), or for odd quantities such as half a pepper (why not just add the whole pepper?). I marked products down a point when these requirements felt excessive.None of the products list any details about the quality or origin of the ingredients, and few brands share sustainability credentials; also, I could not find any organic products in this range. But the overall quality was exceptional, minimally processed and great value – just about every product was restaurant quality, from takeaway to the best on the high street.The best curry kitsBestoverall:The Spice Tailor balti curry kitView image in fullscreen£3.75 for 300g at Morrisons (£1.25/100g)£3.85 for 300g at Tesco (£1.28/100g)★★★★★Three packets (dried spices, including whole dried chilli; curry base; and balti sauce) combine to produce a thick, glossy, brown curry with notable depth and flavour, with cumin, fenugreek and bay standing out.

If you didn’t step in and fund my legal fight I’d probably be in jail,” Robinson said. “Thank you, Elon.”In the period immediately after Musk’s messy departure from the White House, theTeslaCEO repeatedly suggested that he was done with politics. Investors who had pushed him to refocus on his businesses were delighted. Tesla’s stock rose. The months since, however, have proved that Musk has failed to abandon his political preoccupations. He has done the opposite, veering further into election conspiracies and extreme anti-immigration views.Musk’s political endeavors since leaving the Trump administration have included leveraging his social media platform as a pulpit to influence New York City’s mayoral race and creating an AI-generated, rightwing knockoff of Wikipedia. In interviews, he has said there is a “homeless industrial complex” of nonprofits ruining California and complained that “it should be okay to have white pride”. On X, he proclaimed that the UK would fall into civil war and western civilization would collapse.The same day that Robinson extended his gratitude, Musk posted claims that “illegals” were committing voting fraud in the US, retweeted complaints about video games becoming “woke” and called established media outlets leftist propaganda.The political fixations of the world’s richest man have taken a toll on his businesses. AYale studypublished last month found that his divisive rhetoric and far-right political affiliations cost Tesla about a million vehicle sales between his acquisition of Twitter in 2022 and April of this year. Consumer polling found that Tesla’s brand loyaltyplummetedover the course of 2025 as Musk’s “department of government efficiency” dismantled government agencies, which included cuts to foreign aid that experts project couldresult in around 14 milliondeaths globally.Musk’s personal approval rating has also sunk to record lows this year, according tomultiplesurveys. Heheld the lowest favorabilityout of 14 major political newsmakers, according to a Gallup poll from August, ranking five percentage points below Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facingcharges of war crimesfrom the international criminal court. A separateQuinnipiac poll in Junefound that only around 2 in 10 women in the US held a favorable view of Musk.Yet the social and financial backlash to Musk’s politics has not quelled his public embrace of the far-right, and in characteristically stubborn fashion, he has begun flaunting his affiliations more openly while suggesting that being labeled racist or extremist is now meaningless to him. Tesla’s shareholders have also continued to endorse him. On Thursday, theyvoted by a huge margin in favor of a $1tn compensation packagefor him, slated to be the biggest in corporate history.Insulated from major financial consequences and existing in an online bubble of his own making, Musk has positioned himself as a fixture of the international far-right even after his influence within the Trump administration has waned.Backing the international far-rightMusk has long maintained friendly relationships with some of the world’s most prominent far-right leaders, ringing in the year with an appearance at a campaign rally for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party. His speech, which came days after he was accused of giving fascist salutes on stage following Trump’s inauguration, drewcriticism from Jewish leadersafter he told the crowd that Germany has “too much of a focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that”.In recent months, Musk’s affiliations with pro-nativist political movements have gone beyond established parties to direct engagement with far-right activists and influencers via X. Robinson, a longtime anti-Islam campaigner who has previously been jailed for contempt of court after libeling a teenage Syrian refugee, has received special attention.“It is time for the English to ally with the hard men, like Tommy Robinson, and fight for their survival or they shall surely all perish,” Musk wrote on X in response to a video of a man being stabbed to death. He claimed the same “will happen to all of England if the tide of illegal immigration is not turned.”In September, Musk appeared via livestream at one of Robinson’s rallies in London to call for the UK government to be dissolved and claim that immigration was causing “the destruction of Britain”.“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die,” Musk told the crowd. Downing Streetlater condemnedMusk’s remarks, saying they threatened to incite violence and intimidation.Musk’s acquisition of Twitter in 2022 has overall been a boon to the UK’s far right. The company’s previous ownership had banned many of the movement’s leaders for violating policies around hateful conduct. Musk reinstated activists from Britain’smost prominent neo-Nazi groupand restored Robinson’s account, which had been removed after he posted calls to mass deport Muslim refugees.Musk has also become the most prominent backer of the fringe UK political movement Restore Britain, with the Texas-based billionaire posting positive messages about its leader Rupert Lowe. Restore Britain published a 113-page policy document earlier this year outlining a plan for the mass deportation of all undocumented immigrants, which suggested using military aircraft to put thousands of people on deportation flights to Rwanda regardless of their country of origin.Musk’s increasing meddling into UK politics has drawn criticism from the country’s Labour government, as well as anti-hate groups and other establishment politicians.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The idea that artificial intelligence would become too “politically correct” and “woke” in its outputs has haunted Musk for years, and he has frequently indulged in futuristic thought experiments to voice his fears.“If it says everyone must be diverse it means there can be no straight white men, then you and I will be executed by AI,” Musk said on Joe Rogan’s podcast last week, tweaking the famous “paper clip problem”, which theorizes that an AI would decimate humanity to make paper clips if instructed that manufacturing them was its sole purpose.Musk’s answer to his version of AI’s alignment problem has been to use his xAI artificial intelligence company, which hastaken up much of his attentionsince leaving government, to create products that more closely align with his views. In theory, he’s creating right-wing copies of popular sites and products that function the same way as their originals. In practice, they have malfunctioned. Musk’s attempt to create a more conservative-leaning AI model has led to incidents in recent months like xAI’s Grok chatbot spouting conspiracies about “white genocide” and calling itself “MechaHitler”.As well as speaking to online allies aligned with him, Musk has also used his social media platform to attack non-profits and politicians he opposes.Musk was at the center of a campaign last month against the Anti-Defamation League, the US’ most prominent Jewish advocacy organization, which faced rightwing backlash for an article that documented connections between slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s group Turning Point USA and extremists. Musk claimed that the ADL “hates Christians” and encouraged murder and shared rightwing influencers’ posts attacking the group. The campaign led tothe ADL removing its entire glossary of extremism, which it had previously touted as the most comprehensive resource on extremist organizations and movements.Musk once again used his platform in the lead up to New York City’s mayoral election, using a paid promotion feature to boost the reach of his post attacking Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani, crowbaring his tweet into more users’ feeds. On election day, he reposted a series of tweets that misinterpreted the election system and suggested a voting conspiracy was at play.As an extension of Musk’s pursuit of an alternative information ecosystem, xAI also launched a Wikipedia imitation called “Grokipedia” last month that Musk has touted as superior and free of bias. Researchershave foundthat it contained a large amount of false information on public figures and events, had copied some entries almost verbatim from Wikipedia and emphasized rightwing narratives about slavery, immigration and trans rights.An entry on Britain First, described by Wikipedia as a “neo-Fascist party,” referred to the organization as a “patriotic political party”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Its name is Uniserve.Uniserve was a big winner of contracts as it became key to the government’s buying of vast quantities of PPE from China. An established logistics company based in the suburban town of Upminster, near the border between Greater London and Essex, it is owned by its founder and managing director, Iain Liddell.The DHSC commissioned Uniserve early in the pandemic to transport ventilators to the UK, which developed into a“freight contract”for bringing PPE from China, and ultimately ran from 31 March 2020 through to December 2021, paying the company £573m.View image in fullscreenUniserve is a well-established logistics company based in Upminster.Photograph: MediaWorldImages/AlamyLiddell moved quickly into offering to supply PPE directly and Uniserve was awarded seven contracts worth £304m, processed through the VIP lane. Altogether, for an array of Covid contracts, the DHSC paid Uniserve a total of £1.4bn.The freight contract involved Uniserve shipping the gowns supplied by PPE Medpro, the company owned by Mone’s husband, the Isle of Man-based businessman Doug Barrowman. This brought Uniserve into the scope of Cockerill’s deliberations.In her judgment, Cockerill concluded that the contract required Uniserve to inspect the PPE Medpro gowns in China, before they were shipped. She said there was a “degree of doubt” about whether Uniserve ever did conduct inspections. Whatever process was followed, it failed to spot the glaring fault with the gowns’ technical labelling, which indicated they were not certified to be sterile.Crucially, the DHSC had to pay for the gowns when they were approved for shipping, so the government paid the full £122m to PPE Medpro with no effective inspection having been carried out.It was only after the gowns arrived in England that a vigilant public health official, Zarah Naeem, inspected and saw the invalid labelling, and the gowns were rejected. Despite winning the court battle, the DHSCfaces difficulties recovering the millions it paid, because no funds were left in PPE Medpro, which is now in administration.If the gowns had been inspected in China by Uniserve as the judge considered they should have been, the shipment may never have set sail, and the taxpayer may not have paid to PPE Medpro the money ministers are now scrambling to recover.The Guardian asked Liddell about Uniserve’s alleged failure of inspection in the judgment and he replied through lawyers, claiming that the judge was mistaken. Liddell said the DHSC had not required Uniserve to carry out quality control inspections at the relevant time and only added this to the freight contract in late August 2020. The DHSC’s barrister, Paul Stanley KC, appeared to support that position in court, saying Uniserve had subcontracted factory collections in China and depicting the operation as a “Chinese truck driver” not versed in European PPE safety regulations.If that is correct – and thepublished freight contractappears to support Liddell’s position – it points to a much bigger procurement issue: massive government spending without basic checks for quality.Chris Smith, a procurement consultant who works with Transparency International in the UK Anti-Corruption Coalition (UKACC), has calculated that the DHSC paid £9.35bn for PPE during those first four months before inspections began. The DHSC subsequently reported it had paid £3.3bn for PPEthat was unusable in the NHS.A question of accessUniserve’s remarkable accumulation of government contracts did attract public scrutiny at the time, includingreporting by the Guardian. A central question was how the company came to the attention of ministers, who would sign off on contracts of such enormous value.The DHSC said laterthat the Conservative peer Theodore Agnew was the politician whointroduced Uniserve to the VIP lane. Agnew, a former City finance executive, was one of several new ministers, headed by Michael Gove, appointed to the Cabinet Office inJohnson’s reshuffle of February 2020.Agnew did not respond to the Guardian’s invitations to comment for this article, but he was asked about Uniserve at the Covid public inquiry in March. He described himself as the“godparent” of the VIP lanesaying, as other former ministers have, that fast-tracking companies referred by politicians and officials was a way to prioritise credible offers. Remarkably, considering the huge public money paid to Uniserve and the company’s key role in the government’s pandemic response, Agnew appeared to know very little about it.“Was Iain Liddell somebody that you knew personally, or through political connections or otherwise?” Anna Morris KC asked. “No, I mean, I don’t even know what Uniserve is,” Agnew replied. “What is it? What is it?”1:10'I don't even know what Uniserve is' Theodore Agnew tells Covid inquiry – videoOne politician who does know the company better is Julia Lopez, the Conservative MP for Upminster. Lopez is close to Uniserve – literally: her constituency office was on the company’s site, in effect, Liddell is the MP’s landlord.In June 2018, Lopezposted about the company enthusiasticallyon social media, pictured with Liddell in hi-vis jackets, describing Uniserve as “the UK’s number one independent logistics and global trade management provider”.The question has always been asked as to whether she was involved in Uniserve being awarded PPE contracts. Lopez was alsonewly appointed to the Cabinet Officein February 2020, although she was on maternity leave until June.Map showing Julia Lopez’s constituency office next to Uniserve’s head office on their siteIn 2020, Liddell and the Cabinet Office denied that the connection with Lopez played a role in Uniserve being awarded contracts. The Guardian asked Liddell then if he was “ever in contact with Julia Lopez MP regarding bidding for these [government Covid] contracts”.“No,” Liddell replied, “Uniserve or Mr Liddell were never in contact with Julia Lopez regarding bidding for these contracts.”The Cabinet Office said at the time: “Minister Julia Lopez [was] not involved in the procurement of these contracts.”The Guardian also asked Liddell if he or Uniserve were ever in contact with any other member of the government or officials, in relation to securing the Covid contracts.Liddell replied: “No. Uniserve and Mr Liddell were contacted by the [DHSC’s] emergency PPE team and Uniserve had to go through … the process all suppliers of PPE and services had to go through.”View image in fullscreenJulia Lopez MP, left, touring one of Uniserve’s warehouses in a clip from her website.Photograph: julialopez.co.ukIn May 2021, Liddell replied to a letter from Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee (PAC), which was conducting an inquiry into PPE procurement and the VIP lane. She asked if he had submitted his offer to supply PPE through the DHSC’s “normal process”, or “through other routes (for examples through a minister, MP or senior official)?”.Liddell replied inwritten evidencethat the DHSC had approached Uniserve first, then it awarded the company more contracts because Uniserve “demonstrated our expertise” and delivered on it.“For the avoidance of doubt,” Liddell wrote, “Uniserve has not sought to market its services to government via ministers, MPs or senior officials.”Into the VIP laneDuring the years since, campaigning by theCovid Bereaved Families for Justice (CBFFJ), which represents 7,000 families whose relatives died of the virus, was instrumental inpressuring Johnson to set up a public inquiryinto his government’s handling of the pandemic.The inquiry allocated time to procurement and, while it did not examine the Uniserve contracts in detail, the CBFFJ and UKACC raised questions, which prompted some evidence to be provided for the first time.A civil servant who worked closely with Uniserve, Jonathan Arrowsmith, madea written statement, which has given some insights into how the company was steered into the VIP lane.Liddell’s lawyers said the DHSC’s first request came on 22 March 2020 and the company was asked owing to a personal connection, as a senior DHSC official had previously worked with a Uniserve director, in 2009. Arrowsmith’s evidence shows that after this first commission, Liddell pushed to provide more services, including supplying PPE directly, and contacted many ministers and officials.On 26 March 2020, a civil servant in Johnson’s office introduced Liddell toSteve Oldfield, the DHSC’s commercial director-general, saying: “Uniserve have been working with DHSC so far on PPE supplies, but there’s definitely a lot more nationally and internationally that they could do to help.”Liddell then told Oldfield that Uniserve had “great resources and capabilities across air, road and sea freight,” adding: “I am sure we can contribute an enormous amount to the supply chain effort getting PPE and any goods to where you need them.”Arrowsmith referred in his statement to an email chain within the Cabinet Office that referred to Uniserve, “commencing with an email from Iain Liddell” of 2 April 2020. The email chain contained “a reference to Iain Liddell’s constituency member of parliament”, asked if there had been an “escalation” of Uniserve, and proposed checking with “Lord Agnew’s private office”. The emails themselves have not been made public.Two days later, in another email chain, Max Cairnduff, a senior civil servant, was apparently responding to concerns that Uniserve was a “VIP opportunity” not being processed quickly enough. Uniserve was said to have contacted “multiple ministers”.Agnew was then named the “VIP link” for Uniserve in Cabinet Office spreadsheets on 13 and 14 April 2020. Uniserve was awarded the first three PPE contracts, worth a total £87m, on 14 April.Last week, the Guardian asked Lopez if she was the constituency MP referred to in the April 2020 email chain.She replied that perhaps it referred not to her but the MP for where Liddell lived, and she said: “I played no role in the personal recommendation, referral or award of any contract to Uniserve … Any suggestion that I was personally involved in the commercial preferment or advancement of Uniserve would be false.”However, two days later, Liddell revealed for the first time that he did contact Lopez in the run-up to the PPE contracts being awarded. His lawyers said he emailed her on 2 April 2020 – an admission that appears to suggest a link between Uniserve, its tenant Conservative MP and its VIP lane referral.Liddell sent the email “to complain about difficulties in relation to [PPE] supply proposals … and delays which Mr Liddell felt may cost lives”.Lopez then declined to explain whether she acted on Liddell’s email, or why she had never mentioned it. A Conservative party spokesperson replied on her behalf, saying: “Mrs Lopez had no involvement in any procurement decision by the government. Mrs Lopez was on maternity leave at the time and government ministers were not involved in operational decisions.”In May 2020, Arrowsmith referred Uniserve to the VIP, “high priority” lane, although the company was already on it by then. Liddell had become “increasingly vocal and critical about the process”, Arrowsmith said, and “frustrated that his offers were not being processed quickly enough”.Liddell requested his offer to supply face masks be “put through the fast track and high volume approval process”. His lawyers said he was not aware at the time that there was a designated VIP lane. Arrowsmith said Uniserve was referred to the high-priority lane “in part, to placate the increasing frustrations of Iain Liddell”. But also, he said, “Uniserve had established themselves as a very credible partner who were making credible offers.”‘Do not supply’In 2022, it emerged that PPE worth £178.5m provided by Uniserve was in alist deemed “do not supply”. The DHSC, even under Labour, still claims commercial confidentiality over such PPE contract questions and declined to provide information about Uniserve. Liddell indicated thatthe £178.5mof PPE was never used,but insisted that it passed quality standards.The government Covid contracts spectacularly boosted Uniserve financially; its accounts for the 15 months to 30 June 2020 show revenues almost tripled to £562m, pre-tax profits increased sevenfold to £46m. In the next 18 months to 31 December 2021, turnover doubled again to £1.4bn, profits grew to £144m.In a statement, Liddell said: “Our engagement with the DHSC was based on our longstanding expertise in international logistics … Contracts were awarded on the basis of proven performance and capability to deliver, not on the basis of political connection.“Uniserve helped deliver over 44bn units of PPE and vital equipment to the UK. I am proud of the role Uniserve played in delivering vital PPE when and wherever the nation needed it most during the unprecedented and uncertain Covid-19 pandemic.”Liddell’s lawyers said he stood by his original answers to the Guardian and the PAC, and that Uniserve submitted its bids for contracts “through the proper channels”.VIP contract introduced by Tory peer left government owed £24mRead moreOn 18 March this year, Gove and Agnew gave their evidence to the Covid inquiry. Gove described Agnew as a “hero” for the work he did. Agnew said the government did its best in the circumstances andsaid it was “bollocks”to suggest the VIP lane was a “heinous plan to enrich a few of our mates … This was not some kind of plan, rightwing people trying to enrich themselves”.Morris, the CBFFJ’s barrister, asked Agnew why he introduced Uniserve into the VIP lane.“Were you aware that they had no track record in the supply of PPE?”“No,” Agnew replied, “but we used a lot of people who didn’t, because we had to go wherever we could. But I had no relationship with them.”“OK, so if that’s correct,” Morris asked, “on what basis did you consider their offers merited urgent or priority consideration within the VIP lane?”“I can’t remember,” Agnew replied.Quick GuideHow to contact our investigations teamShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact our investigations team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We used to see people with adrenal problems and diabetes, and it’s really affectingNHScare. We are all asking how to deal with this.”Advertising prescription drugs in the UK is illegal, but the Guardian has found that a number of TikTok influencers are collaborating with private medical clinics to advertise blood tests, which are legal to promote, as a route to testosterone therapy.View image in fullscreenAdvocates for testosterone replacement therapy with thousands of followers are being paid or offered incentives by private clinics to promote discount codes and giveaways.Photograph: TikTokAdvocates for testosterone replacement therapy who have thousands of followers are being paid or offered incentives by private clinics to promote discount codes and giveaways, encouraging men to get their testosterone levels checked and potentially access treatment.In one of the posts, a man does bicep curls, saying: “Get your testosterone tested … shoot me a DM for a £20 discount.” In another video, a free blood test is offered as part of a giveaway, telling men it will help them “take control” of their performance.The Guardian flagged these posts to the Advertising Standards Authority for potential breaches in regulation, due to them promoting prescription drugs, prompting an investigation by the watchdog.Jayasena said: “I have just come back from a national teaching course for next-generation endocrinology consultants, and most people raised concerns about reproduction and this issue: a flurry of men being pushed to up-tick their testosterone.”He added: “Putting the influencers aside, this is a huge problem. Hospital specialists are seeing patients coming in after having private blood tests, often arranged through influencers, perhaps, and then being told by inexperienced doctors or a wide range of healthcare professionals that they should start testosterone. The advice they are giving is wrong.”Private clinics charge about £1,800 to £2,200 for the first year of TRT. Packages include medication, monitoring and consultations.Once a niche medical treatment for a small number of men with clinically diagnosed hormone deficiency, TRT has increasingly been reframed as a lifestyle or “performance optimisation” tool. Online clinics offer at-home blood tests and subscription packages, making it easy to access outside traditional healthcare systems.View image in fullscreenPrivate clinics charge about £1,800 to £2,200 for the first year of full testosterone replacement therapy.Photograph: Ian Dewar/AlamyThe social media posts often suggest that low motivation, tiredness or ageing are signs of “low T”, driving more men to seek tests and treatment, even though medical guidelines restrict TRT to those with proven hormonal deficiency.Jayasena said: “There are specific clinical guidelines on who should and should not be started on testosterone. Certain symptoms, such as erectile dysfunction, are clearly associated with low testosterone. Other symptoms, like not having enough muscle or feeling depressed, are not associated with low testosterone. A man might say: ‘I’m not very muscly,’ and be told to get tested, but there’s no evidence he needs one.“The most worrying thing is these clinics are starting testosterone for men with normal testosterone levels. There is no evidence that testosterone levels greater than 12 nmol/L are beneficial, and I have heard of clinics starting men below 18, which includes much of the population.”He added that taking it when not needed can cause infertility. “It suppresses the testicular and hormonal signals from the brain needed for the testicles to work, so clinics give a concoction of other drugs to stop that happening, the same approach used by anabolic steroid users.”TikTok has been approached for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He is expected to join an anti-Islamic State US-led coalition.The US state department and Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The US envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, said this month that Sharaa would “hopefully” sign an agreement to join the international US-led alliance against Islamic State.The state department’s decision on Friday to remove Sharaa from the blacklist was widely expected.A spokesperson said Sharaa’s government had been meeting US demands, including on working to find missing Americans and on eliminating any remaining chemical weapons.On Thursday, Washington led a vote by the Security Council to remove UN sanctions against him.Formerly affiliated with al-Qaida, Sharaa’s group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, was delisted as a terrorist group by Washington in July.Washington is preparing to establish a military presence at an airbase in Damascus to help enable a security pact the US is brokering between Syria and Israel, six sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters.A US administration official also previously said Washington was constantly evaluating its necessary posture in Syria to effectively combat Islamic State.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIslamic StateMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

It is contaminated plastic. Marine animals will ingest small plastic items once they are in the sea, they will attract algae, they will smell like food, effectively.“Once they’ve eaten it, that’s it: they can’t get it out. They will float on the surface. It will create a slick which attracts plunging seabirds.”He said the clean-up efforts have been exhausting. “Yesterday I was out there cleaning it up. We are trying to really piece together the timeline and the story for this horrendous event. It’s terrible.View image in fullscreenCamber residents joined the giant hoovering machine, Rother district council, Rother coastal officers and Strandliners for the cleanup effort.Photograph: Strandliners“They are so small that, from a very long way off, the beach looks normal. But as soon as you get close up you see there are millions of black pellets, nestled under seaweed. It’s an impossible task – volunteers have been raking for days, and they will continue to rake, but we won’t be able to get rid of them all. It is the worst I have ever seen of a polluted beach.”Dollimore, the Labour and Cooperative MP who joined the clean-up efforts, said: “The huge number of plastic beads that have washed up here risks an environmental catastrophe. These biobeads are deadly to marine life and wildlife, and we are already seeing more dead seals, fish and porpoises on the beach.“Local residents are working tirelessly to remove as many beads as possible, but it’s a race against time. Southern Water must urgently establish if their local wastewater plants could be the source of these biobeads, and I’ve asked them to dedicate all available resources to supporting the clean-up operation in the meantime.”The beads are also dangerous to dogs as they contain a high number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are known to have carcinogenic properties, and they often contain toxins including lead, antimony and bromine.A Southern Water spokesperson said: “We are working closely with the Environment Agency and Rother district council to investigate the source of plastic beads which have washed up on Camber Beach. This investigation work is ongoing.“Rother district council is leading the clean-up of the beach, using specialists with a vehicle with suction equipment to remove the beads. We are also supporting with the clean-up.“We’ve conducted water-quality sampling on the beach, which has shown no impact to environmental water quality. This data has been shared with Rother district council and the Environment Agency.”An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “We are aware that a large number of plastic nurdles have washed up along a stretch of coastline in East Sussex which includes Camber Sands.“We are providing advice and guidance to Rother district council, which has employed contractors to carry out a clean-up operation. This work is currently under way.“We are working with other responders to identify the source of the pollution.”Explore more on these topicsEast SussexBirdsWaterWater industryAnimalsWildlifeEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He was 68.The television presenter and motoring journalist died “peacefully surrounded by his family”, a statement said.Willson was one of the first hosts on the BBC motoring show, alongside Jeremy Clarkson, before he went on to front the Channel 5 programme Fifth Gear.He hosted Top Gear from 1991 until 2001 and went on to create and present shows including Britain’s Worst Drivers and BBC Two’s The Car’s the Star.The statement said: “A true national treasure, Quentin brought the joy of motoring, from combustion to electric, into our living rooms.”The broadcaster was an avid consumer champion, advocating for a number of campaigns including helping to freeze fuel duty with his FairFuel campaign and recently worked to make electric vehicles affordable through hisFairCharge campaign.In April, he criticised the government forchanging EV rulesto allow more sales of cars with petrol and diesel engines until 2035, describing it as a “grave misstep”.The family statement added: “Long before it was fashionable, he championed the GM EV1 and the promise of electric cars, proving he was always ahead of the curve.“Much-loved husband to Michaela, devoted father to Mercedes, Max and Mini, and cherished grandfather to Saskia, Xander and Roxana. Quentin will be deeply missed by his family, friends, and all who knew him personally and professionally.“The void he has left can never be filled. His knowledge was not just learned but lived; a library of experience now beyond our reach.”Clarkson paid tribute with a post on X. He said: “I’m far away so I’ve only just heard that Quentin Willson has died. We had some laughs over the years. Properly funny man.”Fellow former Top Gear presenter James May, who appeared alongside Willson on the programme, described him as a “great bloke”. He added: “Quentin Willson gave me proper advice and encouragement during my earliest attempts at TV, back in the late 90s. I’ve never forgotten it.”Tiff Needell, a former presenter on Top Gear and Fifth Gear, said: “Oh Quentin how can you leave us so soon. So many memories of the @BBC_TopGear we built in the nineties that I wanted to remember with you again.“Please upload the film of me with him and Jeremy in the Ford Puma that so wonderfully displays the times we had together … RIP Q.”Willson, who was born in Leicester, wrote weekly columns for the Mirror and Sunday Mirror for 15 years and contributed to Classic Cars magazine.

I was lucky to get to know him in recent years through his excellent work with FairCharge, where his passion for making electric vehicles accessible to all really shone through.“He was warm, generous with his knowledge and unfailingly kind. He brought the joy of motoring – from petrol to plug – into our homes and hearts, and will be greatly missed.”Lawrence Whittaker, owner of the racing car manufacturer Lister Cars, also paid tribute and wrote on X: “He was the architect of the Warrantywise plan and revolutionised not just the car warranty market but, through his campaigning and journalism, made the entire UK motor trade a better place.“He was the most knowledgeable [sic] person I ever met when it came to cars and was such a pro in front of and behind the camera. We worked closely together for over 10 years and my thoughts go out to his wife and family at this difficult time. He will be sorely missed by all.“God speed Q!

Denmark’s tighter rules on family reunions and restricting some refugees to a temporary stay are among the policies being looked at.Mahmood will announce the changes later this month, according to the BBC, which firstreportedthe plans.Why does UK government want to copy Denmark’s immigration system?Read moreThe proposals have drawn scorn from someLabourMPs, particularly from those on the left of the party, who said it was a “dangerous path” to take, although others want the government to go further.In Denmark, refugees who have been personally targeted by a foreign regime are more likely to be given protection, while those fleeing conflicts are usually only allowed to remain in the country on a temporary basis. Denmark itself decides what is a safe country.In 2022, the Danish governmentnotifiedabout 1,200 refugees from Damascus in Syria that their residency permits would not be renewed because, breaking with the UN and EU, it judged the region to be safe for refugees to return.UKHome Officeofficials have also been drawn to Denmark’s tighter rules for family reunions. When a refugee granted residency rights wants their partner to join them, there are numerous thresholds that must be met. Both people must be age 24 and above, the partner in Denmark must not have claimed benefits for three years and also has to put up a financial guarantee. Both partners must also pass a Danish language test.Denmark has also barred those who live in housing estates designatedas “parallel societies” by the government – where more than 50% of residents are from what it considers to be “non-western” backgrounds – from being granted family reunion.In 2021, Denmarkpasseda law enabling it to process asylum seekers outside Europe, which drew anger from human rights advocates, the UN and theEuropean Commission.The Labour MPClive Lewiswas deeply critical of the British government’s plans to adopt the Danish system in an effort to outflank Reform UK.“Denmark’s Social Democrats have gone down what I would call a hardcore approach to immigration,” he said. “They’ve adopted many of the talking points of what we would call the far right.“Labour does need to win back some Reform-leaning voters but you can’t do that at the cost of losing progressive votes.”Nadia Whittome, the Labour MP for Nottingham East and a member of Labour’s Socialist Campaign Group, said it would be a “dangerous path” to take and that some of the Danish policies, especially those around “parallel societies”, are “undeniably racist”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it omitted a section of the speech where Trump urged the crowd “to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard”.In an interview with the Telegraph, Leavitt said: “This purposefully dishonest, selectively edited clip by the BBC is further evidence that they are total, 100% fake news that should no longer be worth the time on the television screens of the great people of the United Kingdom.“Every time I travel to the United Kingdom with President Trump and am forced to watch the BBC in our hotel rooms, it ruins my day listening to their blatant propaganda and lies about the president of the United States and all that he’s doing to make America better and the world a safer place.”The newspaper said its reporting was based on a memo written by Michael Prescott, a former adviser to the BBC’s editorial guidelines and standards committee. Prescott left his role earlier this year and has not commented on the document, understood to have been leaked by a whistleblower.It published an extract that read: “It was completely misleading toedit the clipin the way Panorama aired it. The fact that he did not explicitly exhort supporters to go down and fight at Capitol Hill was one of the reasons there were no federal charges for incitement to riot.”The memo reportedly added that Prescott, a communications consultant and former political journalist, had raised concerns about the way BBC Arabic covered the war in Gaza.BBC accused of selectively editing Trump clip from day of Capitol attackRead moreThe Telegraph said Prescott alleged there were “systemic problems”, which had not been addressed by senior management, claiming there were “stark differences” between the coverage of the war on BBC Arabic and on the main BBC website. One issue Prescott is said to have highlighted is the repeated use of commentators who were antisemitic or pro-Hamas.The 19-page dossier is also reported to have criticised the BBC’s coverage of transgender issues, saying the broadcaster had been “captured by a small group of [staff] promoting the Stonewall view” of gender identity issues and that its LGBT desk would “decline to cover any stories raising difficult questions”.It is said to have alleged that stories raising complex questions about trans issues were suppressed, with a “constant drip-feed of one-sided stories celebrating the trans experience without adequate balance or objectivity”.In response, the BBC said: “While we don’t comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback it takes it seriously and considers it carefully.“Michael Prescott is a former adviser to a board committee where differing views and opinions of our coverage are routinely discussed and debated.”Explore more on these topicsBBCDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Ultimately, the driver lost control of the car and hit more than a dozen people outside the bar, police said.Three victims died at the scene and a fourth victim died at a hospital. As of Saturday morning, a fifth victim was hospitalized in critical condition, and eight additional victims were being treated at local hospitals but were listed as stable, police said. Two other victims experienced minor injuries and declined treatment at the scene. All 15 victims are adults.“What happened this morning was a senseless tragedy, our hearts are with the loved ones of the victims and all those who were impacted,” the Tampa police chief, Lee Bercaw, said in a statement.Officers identified the suspect as 22-year-old Silas Sampson, who was booked on Saturday and is being held at the Hillsborough county jail.Court documents showed Sampson has been charged with four counts of vehicular homicide and four counts of aggravated fleeing or eluding with serious bodily injury or death. All are first-degree felonies. No attorney was listed for Sampson.“Our entire city feels this loss,” said Tampa’s mayor, Jane Castor, who also served as Tampa’s first female police chief, in a post on social media.“My thoughts are with everyone affected. The investigation into this crash is ongoing, and we are working to get answers,” she wrote.In recent years, some states and local agencies have pushed to restrict the use of high-speed car chases to protect both civilians and officers. After a rise in fatalities, a 2023studyfunded by the US justice department called for police chases to be rarely used, noting that the danger to suspects, officers and bystanders often outweighs the immediate need to take someone into custody.Still, Florida has doubled down on the tactics, with the state’s highway patrol amending its policies to loosen limitations on the use of car chases and pit maneuvers. The justice department-backed report described those tactics as “high-risk” and “controversial”.Explore more on these topicsTampaUS crimeUS policingFloridanewsShareReuse this content"

John Ashby, 32, has been charged in connection with a religiously aggravated rape in relation to the alleged Walsall attack.Those incidents, as well as a violent attack on two elderly Sikh taxi drivers in Wolverhampton, prompted a meeting in parliament at the end of October about anti-Sikh hate crimes in the region.Sukhvinder Kaur, the chair of Sikh Women’s Aid, a domestic abuse charity in the West Midlands, said women were changing their daily routines to protect themselves.“The fear, the now complete changing of your day-to-day living, that is real. I have not seen that before,” she said. “This is the first time since I’ve set up Sikh Women’s Aid where women have said to us: ‘We are no longer doing the things that we enjoy because we might get harmed doing them.’”Women were “not comfortable” going to the gym, or going for walks or runs now, she said. “They are doing this in groups. They are sharing their location with their friends or a family member.“An attack in Walsall is going to make women in Coventry feel scared because it’s the Midlands,” she said. “There has definitely been a shift in the way women think about their own safety.”Earlier this week, police confirmed a woman in her 50s was the victim of a racially aggravated assault in Wolverhampton in which an electrical stun device was used. The Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill wrote on X that the victim was Sikh. When approached, West Midlands police declined to confirm this information.Sikh places of worship across the Midlands have begun distributing rape and security alarms to women in an effort to keep them safe.At the Nanaksar gurdwara, in Walsall, Kam Kaur, a regular attender, said the incidents had “changed everything” for Sikhs living in the area.In particular, she said she did not feel safe going to the gurdwara on her own, and she had told her elderly mother to be careful when opening her front door. “We’re all targets,” Kaur, 55, said. “Anyone can be attacked day or night.”View image in fullscreenInderjeet Kaur (left) and Kam Kaur.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianAnother attender, Inderjeet Kaur, 32, said she was taking extra precautions when going to work. “I try and find parking nearer to the bus station,” she said. “I putpaath[prayer] in my headphones but it’s on a very low volume, to the point where I can still hear cars go past, I can still hear surroundings around me.”Surinder Kaur, 57, who has three daughters, said: “We go for walks, the girls and I, and it just feels very unsafe at the moment with all these crimes.“We’ve never thought about taking these precautions before,” she said. “I’m looking over my shoulder constantly.”For Surinder Bajwa, 55, who grew up in Walsall, the atmosphere is reminiscent of the racism older generations faced in the 1970s and 80s.“We’ve experienced all this in the 1980s when our mums used to go past where the community hall is,” she said. “We used to have the National Front and all the people sat there and they used to spit at them, call them names or set dogs on them. For some reason, I’m going back to that. In my head, I think those times are almost back.”A Labour councillor, Simran Cheema, echoed this, saying people felt “we’ve gone back in time … where there was a lot of open racism”.View image in fullscreenSimran Cheema.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian“People are scared to go out in the community,” she said. “People are scared to wear the artefacts of their religion; turbans or head coverings.”Cheema said Walsall council had provided extra CCTV around gurdwaras to reassure the community.West Midlands police said they were holding meetings with local politicians, women’s groups and community leaders, as well as visiting faith establishments, to discuss women’s safety.“It’s been a very difficult week for the community,” Ch Supt Phil Dolby told the Walsall gurdwaras committee on Sunday. “No one deserves to live in a community feeling afraid.”Walsall council said it had been “actively working alongside the police with the Sikh community and our communities more widely to provide support and reassurance”.The leader of Sandwell council, Kerrie Carmichael, said: “We were all shocked by the awful incident in Oldbury.” She added that the council worked with the police as part of the Safer Sandwell Partnership to tackle violence against women and girls and hate crime.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Forest clearance in the Brazilian Amazon hasfallen by 50%over the full three years of Lula’s third term in office. The latest annual government figures show the smallest area of clearance in 11 years. This is largely thanks to Lula’s environment minister, Marina Silva, who has applied robust measures to counter land invasions, illegal logging and wildcat mining.As a result, the Climate Observatory estimates Brazil’s emissions – which are mainly determined by the health of its forests – havefallen by 16.7%, likely to be the steepest fall of any of the G20 economies.These gains were front and centre as Lula pitched for more nations to sign up to Brazil’s flagship initiative at Cop30:the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which aims to raise $125bn (£95bn) for the protection of standing forests. So far, the initiative has raised about $5.5bn, with investments of $3bn from Norway, $1bn each from Brazil and Indonesia, and smaller sums from Portugal, the Netherlands and other countries.How could Tropical Forest Forever fund proposed at Cop30 tackle deforestation?Read moreThe money is desperately needed to stave off the rapidly growing danger that the world’s biggest tropical forest will decline beyond apoint of no return, after which it will be condemned to desiccate into a savannah and lose much of its globally important functions of climate stabilisation, water transport and habitat provision.Senior scientists have warned that this is already happening in wide areas of the Amazon, particularly in the states of Matto Grosso, where there has been a rapid expansion of soy plantations, and Pará, where the primary cause of destruction is the beef industry. The weakening of the forest has also been accelerated by fire (widely used for land clearance) and the contamination of rivers with mercury (which is used in gold mining).Antonio Donato Nobre, an Earth system scientist who worked in the Amazon for 20 years, said the forest is already showing signs of breakdown. He said droughts are increasingly severe, temperatures in some cleared areas have increased by up to 7C and degradation is accelerating even as deforestation slows. This poses a global threat, he said, not only because of a reduced carbon sequestration capacity, but because a weaker rainforest means less cloud cover to reflect the sun’s heat back into space, which is potentially a greater warming threat than greenhouse gases.View image in fullscreenDrone footage shows deforestation in Brazilian Amazon, which is at risk of declining beyond a point of no return.Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/ReutersNobre said the first climate summit in the Amazon was an opportunity to put nature at the heart of climate solutions but could also be a disaster if leaders paid only lip service to the importance of the forest, while pushing ahead with destructive projects. “My main message is get serious,” he said. “The most successful enterprise on the planet is called life. We have in our hands a technology that is 4bn years old and has gone through multiple cycles of destruction and rebirth and refixing.”Lula, however, relies on support from the agribusiness and mining sectors to maintain power. “Ruralista” politicians dominate Congress, control several ministries, and are pushing an aggressive extractivist agenda that runs counter to forest conservation. This lobby is now the driving force in Brazilian politics.While Lula has vetoed some of its most radical plans to eradicate swathes of environmental licensing requirements, he has also appeared more than willing to support other elements of its agenda to carve up the Amazon and other biomes for the production of fossil fuels and monoculture crops.Three weeks ago, his government approved drilling licences for oil and gas exploration at the Foz do Amazonas off the coast of the rainforest, a move that adds to the contamination risks facing the forest, increases the likelihood of vegetation destruction by related industries and runs contrary to advice from the International Energy Agency that it will be impossible to achievethe Paris agreement goalsof limiting global heating unless countries completely halt new fossil fuel development.Then there are the government’s plans toupgrade the BR-319 highwaybetween Manaus and Porto Velho, which will put unprecedented pressure on the western regions of the Brazilian Amazon, which have – until now – been one of the last healthy regions of the forest.Another large intact area is close to the north-west border with Venezuela, but this too is menaced byplans to permit industrial miningin the Yanomami Indigenous territory.“We’re very worried,” said one of those in the region, Ehuana Yaira Yanomami, who has come to Belém to relay the fears of the women of her community. “We don’t want our people to suffer, we are very worried and that’s why we are speaking out, because illegal mining only brings suffering to our communities. We want to see our children healthy, without mud and without the fish being contaminated.”Farther south, the government announced in late August it would “de-statise” the federal waterways of three major rivers – the Tapajós, Madeira and Tocantins – whichis seen asa first step towards their privatisation and transformation into a “hydrovia” water transport route for soy shipped from Mato Grosso.View image in fullscreenLula and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, meet Yanomami and other Indigenous spokespeople in Combu Island, Belém, Brazil.Photograph: Witt Jacques/Abaca/Rex/ShutterstockLula, who cut his political teeth as a union negotiator, has tended to focus more on the social benefits that can come from increased investment in the Amazon, while skirting the far greater risks that the climate crisis poses to its human and non-human residents.That was evident last week at a pre-Cop30 publicity tour of forest communities along the Tapajós river. At the Vista Alegre do Capixauã village of the Kumaruara people, the president said he was ready to stand up for those who protect the forests, and promised to improve local healthcare, education and housing. This was very much in keeping with one of Brazil’sdeclared objectivesin the summit: to make social protection a foundation of resilience.But during the parts of his visit open to the press, Lula did not make a single mention of the climate, even though this is a growing concern for local people – and ahuge majority of the world’s population.The head of a neighbouring village, Luis Antonio Bentes de Sousa, told the Guardian that much of the river dried up during last year’s record drought, leaving the communities here stranded and struggling to feed themselves. He said his vegetable garden shrivelled up, most of his fruit trees died and for the first time in his 70-year-life he was unable to grow manioc, the primary staple of the Amazon diet.“It is getting hotter and drier,” he said. “I worry for my children and grandchildren.”The Guardian view on worsening extreme weather: the injustice of the climate crisis grows ever clearer | EditorialRead moreOthers spoke of mass fish deaths due to the heat, contamination and low water levels, and expressed fears that this will become worse when the river they depend on is privatised and turned into a canal for soy barges.These uncomfortable topics – and their politically difficult solutions – were not raised during the speeches until the very end of Lula’s visit when the environment minister, Marina Silva, asked for the microphone and reminded the president why they were in the Amazon this month. “Cop30 is a place for us to say that Brazil will do its part, eliminating deforestation. And the world needs to do its part, reducing emissions of coal, oil and gas. That is why I like it when, sir, you say it’s necessary to stop depending on fossil fuels.”This was a reminder that in Belém, Lula – like many world leaders – will have a good forest angel on one shoulder and a fossil fuel demon on the other. The question is which will hold sway.Explore more on these topicsCop30BrazilLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaAmericasClimate crisisIndigenous peoplesDeforestationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He says it’s possible to ‘disrupt the script’ for future violenceWalter MarshSat 8 Nov 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Nov 2025 14.02 ESTShareDr Paul E Mullen and his family were living near Dunedin, New Zealand when, one evening in November 1990, they heard gunfire. The shots continued into the night, followed by the distant sound of police and ambulances. At 9pm, a hospital colleague told him that a few kilometres away, in Aramoana, someone with a gun had started shooting.As it turned out, Mullen had heard of the perpetrator before; one of his long-term patients was the man’s nextdoor neighbour, and soon Mullen would learn that many other people he knew had been injured or killed.“I’d never really thought about these things,” Mullen tells the Guardian. “They had never been on my radar.”The Bristol-born Mullen had always dabbled in forensic work, but the events at Aramoana piqued his curiosity. He would soon pivot to become a full-time forensic psychiatrist, specialising in some of the gravest acts known to society, from stalking and child sexual abuse to mass killings.Speaking over the phone from his home in Melbourne, the 81-year-old has the spry, genial air of any ordinary semi-retired professional – but his career trajectory has brought him face-to-face with men whose violent crimes once brought them international notoriety.Perhaps the most striking encounter came just a few years after Aramoana, when in April 1996 news broke of an even deadlierattack in Port Arthur, Tasmania. By then Mullen was in Australia, working as professor of forensic psychiatry at Monash University. He received a call summoning him to Royal Hobart hospital where this latest perpetrator – whose name Mullen refuses to use – had been taken alive hours earlier after shooting 55 people, killing 35.“That was my first experience of actually spending time with one of these killers and beginning to find out something about them,” Mullen recalls.The 28-year-old was being treated for burns, having set fire to a guesthouse in a final confrontation with police. At the hospital, cautious authorities had cleared the floor and strapped him to the bed.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsAt first, Mullen thought the blond-haired young man seemed frightened, and he saw no reason to be afraid for his own safety. While the television crews and journalists swarming outside were describing him in terms like “evil”, “unholy”, and “monster”, Mullen approached the young man not as a “killer”, but a “person who has killed”. He sought to build a rapport with his subject, even seeking to have his restraints removed.“I thought it was going very well, until suddenly,blam, he says: ‘I’ve got the record, haven’t I?’”Mullen was taken aback. “But you’ve just got to carry on,” he recalls, pausing for a moment to gather his thoughts. “You’ve got a job to do.”While the Port Arthur killer angrily rejected Mullen’s suggestion his actions might have been inspired by another high-profile attack a month earlier in Dunblane, Scotland, Mullen says he soon started to talk about other massacres.“So hedidknow quite a lot about these previous killers,” Mullen reflects. “And this is typical.”View image in fullscreen‘I mean, they’re people. My job is to understand why they’ve done something extraordinary’: Dr Paul E Mullen.Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianThe following decades would see Mullen interview many men in a similar position to the perpetrators of Aramoana and Port Arthur, as he became a leading authority in what are often referred to as “lone-actor mass killers”. But despite the implication of solitude, the man in that Hobart hospital ward revealed what would become a common thread in all of Mullen’s dealings with lone mass killers: they are rarely acting in isolation.Today, Mullen reflects on the complex factors that have fed an alarming rise in such events over the past half-century – Texas university in 1966, Port Arthur, Norway’s Utøya island in 2011, Las Vegas in 2017, and Christchurch in 2019 to name just a few – at a scale and regularity that seemed unimaginable not long ago. One of the strongest, he says, is the emergence of a “cultural script”, a conclusion shaped not only by his own first-hand experience, but the history books.“The first time it’s ever happened in the western world was in Germany, 1913.”In September 1913, a schoolteacher killed his wife and four children before travelling to Mühlhausen armed with several guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. He began indiscriminately shooting, killing nine people before he was apprehended – but it’s what happened next that Mullen finds telling. “He had no influence – between 1913 and 1966 there were three incidents, one was actually in Melbourne. But there was nocultural scriptcreated.”Things changed, Mullen says, after a shooting in Austin, Texas in August 1966, when a 25-year-old male student climbed to the 28th-floor observation deck of a University of Texas building and opened fire, killing 15 and injuring another 30.“He was in every major newspaper in America, on the front page the next day with his photograph and his name, and he was covered worldwide over the next few days – they later made a film,” he says, referring to 1975’s The Deadly Tower,starring Kurt Russell as the red bandana-clad gunman.“It was the Texas university tower massacre that created the script, which has now grown and grown and grown,” Mullen reflects. “And the first imitator of the Texas killer was only five weeks [later].”Like the Port Arthur killer, these are often friendless men fuelled by a mix of resentment and a sense of weakness, drawn to the promise of infamy, publicity, and a noteworthy death enjoyed by previous mass killers. Some even dress like their predecessors, from Russell’s red bandana to the all-black attire of the teenage Columbine school shooters.“They gather grievances, grievances, grievances,” Mullen says, echoing the common complaints he has heard across his career. “‘People mistreated me’; ‘I was cheated’; ‘they’re not fair’; ‘no one likes me’. All these things, but they also feel that they should have fought back.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

But it’s much worse, because you neverdidanything. And this, in a sense, is your final reply.”In his new book, Running Amok: Inside the Mind of the Lone Mass Killer, Mullen unpacks these cases alongside other similar stories.“What emerges is thebigstory, what this isabout, how it developed, how we candosomething – not to stop it completely, but to reduce it,” he says. Along the way Mullen studiously avoids naming any modern perpetrators, instead centring the names and lives of their victims and says refusing to name killers is the “quickest, cheapest and easiest way we can cut down this escalating rate of killings”. He also warns against using terms like “lone wolf”.“This is exactly what they want to be seen as – the lone wolf, the predator going around the edges,” Mullen says. “They’re not wolves. I mean, they’resheep.”Similarly, police and media can thwart their ambitions by trying to capture perpetrators alive, avoiding reporting details of their lives and manifestos, and not allowing them to use a courtroom as a platform.He acknowledges that public safety needs to be carefully balanced with due process, transparency, and a free press. Today, authorities must also contend with an attention-driven media landscape and the vast, unregulated internet increasingly hooked on sensationalised true crime.Ironically, Mullen says he initially struggled to find a publisher for his more nuanced approach to the subject. Some agents and publishers said he lacked a “profile”, for which he had a good reason: his proximity to so many mass killers over the years – from Aramoana, to Port Arthur, to Hoddle Street in Melbourne – has drawn suspicion from the conspiracy-minded. One conspiracy theory website dubbed him “Mysterious Mullen from Monash”.“How did I discover it? Death threats,” he says. “My personal assistant at the time had a little drawer for death threats, filled up. [So] being a little anonymous helped.”As for his own personal feelings about a career spent coming face to face with those who have committed unthinkable acts?“I mean, they’re people,” Mullen reflects. “My job is to understand why they’ve done something extraordinary. Understanding doesn’t mean forgiving. Understanding doesn’t mean it’s OK – ‘I understand, now you can toddle off’.”Mullen’s encounters reveal that, rather than embodying a “shameful, utterly wicked criminality”, these crimes are often the convergence of predictable patterns and cultural scripts that can be interrupted before ending in tragedy.“These people are uncertain whether they’re going to do it up to the last moments,” he says. “One tossed a coin. The Tasmanian killer stopped at a cafe because his biggest grievance was that no one would ever talk to him. And there were two girls there, and he thought, ‘Well, if, if I go over there and talk to them, if they talk to me back, I won’t do it.’“I’m curious,” Mullen reflects. “They’re human beings. I want to know the answers to why they did things, and those answers hopefully will be helpful in preventing it in other people – and hopefully, maybe of some use in saving them.”Running Amok: Inside the Mind of the Lone Mass Killer by Paul E Mullen is out now through Extraordinary BooksExplore more on these topicsAustralian booksPsychiatryCrime - AustraliaPort Arthur massacreGun crimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She used to fret over sugar. She used to dwell on what cartoon character might be the right one to put on her son’s next birthday cake.“I thought being a mother meant sleepless nights, picky eaters, school runs, messy rooms and too much laundry,” writes the author Diana Shams. “I used to think motherhood was hard.”That was before the start of the conflict that destroyed Gaza. More than 68,000 people have been killed, mostly civilians, and entire cities reduced to rubble by Israel’s offensive, which aUN inquiryfound to be a genocide.During a truce in early 2025, Shams and her family returned to their home and began cleaning away rubble and repairing it. One of her friends abroad suggested she write a book about her experience as a mother. Her laptop was lost under the debris of her family home, so she wrote it on her phone.In her bookA Different Kind of Motherhood, Shams, 27, tells the story of her life as a mother in the face of violence and near constant danger.“No one prepares you to raise children through sirens, smoke and screams. No one teaches you how to keep a child calm while the sky is falling. No one explains how to carry your baby through fire, hunger and fear – and still sing to her at bedtime,” she writes.The children playing at homeKarim and Rose in Gaza before the war.Shams’ book does not provide responses to these unanswerable questions but instead offers her family’s experience, as well as that of other Palestinian mothers she knew, who were killed or lost their children.“I wrote this book not just for myself,” she writes, “but for every mother inGazawho has rocked her baby while the ceiling shook. For the women who gave birth in shelters, in the dark, with no medicine. For the mothers who lost a child and kept living – because they had no choice. Because there were others to protect.”Life before the war was by no means normal for Shams and her small family. The besieged strip was widely known as the world’s biggest open-air prison.Despite the siege, she lived a life that, in many small details, was striving for normality. Shams and her husband lived with in-laws when her firstborn, Karim, arrived, but saved and borrowed their way to owning a home. They painted their new home in time for their second child, Rose, who was born in early 2023.Seven months later, one day into the latest war, they were forced to flee after a neighbour’s house was bombed. They moved repeatedly before finally making the journey south, sleeping in their car until a tent became available. They have been living in and out of tents ever since.Rose in a damaged room, and with Karim standing outside on a mound of rubbleKarim and Rose in Gaza during the war.“Sometimes, when I couldn’t sleep, I thought about mothers in other countries – mothers abroad who raise their children in comfortable homes, who open a fridge full of cold water, who press a button and a fan or an air conditioner cools the room,” she writes. “Mothers who tuck their children into soft beds with clean sheets and watch them drift to sleep without fear”.Speaking by phone from Gaza, Shams says even the news reports people see cannot fully reflect what people in Gaza actually live through, especially mothers. “Who can understand what it means for my daughter Rose to take her first steps in mud and dirt?” she said.Shams did not intend to write a book, but had been collecting her thoughts by writing notes on her phone. “This book is not written in comfort. It is written in stolen moments between survival and grief, in the quiet hours when my children finally sleep, and I can let the weight of everything crash into me,” she writes in her book.Her father was a journalist and Shams found some comfort in documenting her daily life on TikTok as well – cooking over firewood, searching for baby milk and nappies, and showing her children playing in the sand.View image in fullscreenRose, three, and Karim, six, in their tent in Gaza.Photograph: Diana Shams“One rainy night – I used to love the rain before the war – I nearly lost my mind when our tent flooded,” she said. “Everything was soaked and I was terrified my children would get sick. I found myself grabbing my phone and recording a video.”She was surprised when the video went viral and received great sympathy and supportive comments from western audiences. “I was touched by every word people wrote in support of me. That’s when I felt I had to be a voice for all the mothers in Gaza who have none,” she said.Social media has provided an outlet for some in Gaza but it was also a reminder of a cruel imbalance, as those facing death and destruction are able to see in real time people’s simpler lives nearby. “In other countries, mothers are worrying about homework, grades, screen time. They visit schools, choose tutors, plan university paths,” she writes in her book. “They post photos of ‘first day of school’ and decorate lunchboxes. Here, we are just hoping our children survive long enough to have a first day again.”A Different Kind of Motherhood by Diana Shamsis available as an ebook.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warWomenParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She fell into depression. “I had a slight addiction to painkillers,” she recalled. “I would shower every three or four days, and wear the same barbecue-stained T-shirt for two or three days in a row.”Her recovery began the day her husband walked in holding a box she assumed was filled with Dunkin’ Munchkins. Instead, it chirped. “He’s like, ‘I got you some baby chicks – you’re probably gonna want to get up.’”Besides adopting baby birds, Kothe credits spending time outdoors for pulling her out of despair.The compact 53-year-old Army veteran in a gray T-shirt that reads: “If you think I’m short, you should see my patience,” lives on a farm where she hauls hay and exercises her mobility dog, Opal. She also participates in adaptive sports, including rock climbing and bobsledding.And on a recent overcast morning, she tried a more tranquil activity: leaf peeping.View image in fullscreenLeft to right: a bird house along the path; Steven Fray uses a Trackchair for the first time and sits for a portrait midway through a hike on 14 October 2025; Trackchairs are rugged battery-powered machines.She joined a motorized guided tour of the Mohonk preserve – a 8,000-acre (3,237-hectare) stretch of forest, wetlands and cliffs nested in the Catskills, about 90 miles north of New York City – riding in a Trackchair, a cross between a wheelchair and a tank.The all-terrain vehicles are slow, set at a top speed of 3mph (5km/h), but steady. They can easily roll over rocks, tree roots, gravel, sand or mud.‘Soul-warming’: the mystery man who chops wood to keep his neighbors from freezingRead moreThe free outing was organized bySoar Experiences, a small non-profit tour operator serving people with limited mobility. (Soar stands for “Specialized Outdoor Adaptive Recreation”). That morning, six guests gathered in Mohonk’s parking lot for a 10-minute primer on operating the joystick-controlled Trackchairs. Guests signed an obligatory liability waiver and listened to a brief safety talk before starting a test course, weaving in and out of orange traffic cones.Experienced Trackchair user John Vacca, who lost his left leg below the knee because of cancer and now volunteers mentoring fellow veterans and others with amputations, issued a gentle warning about tailgating. “Know your speed,” he cautioned.While an increasing number of green spaces are investing in improving accessibility, hiking in nature poses natural challenges. “The wood doesn’t care about ADA compliance,” said Peter Gagliardo, adaptive sports coordinator for Helen Hayes hospital, a rehab center in West Haverstraw, New York.View image in fullscreenThe Testimonial trail at Mohonk in New Paltz, New York, provides hikers with rural views.Gagliardo was paralyzed from the waist down when a car struck his motorcycle in 2006. About seven years ago, he and a colleague convinced Scott Trager – who runs an off-road drivingschool– to install hand controls into one of its Jeeps. The experiment was a hit: off-road enthusiasts with disabilities raved about navigating the school’s 75-acre obstacle course. Soon after, Trackchairs joined the fleet and Trager later launched Soar with his wife and two sons.A self-described “solutionist”, Trager, 63, once devoted his days to shaving milliseconds off stock trades on Wall Street. His new career as a social entrepreneur, he said with a chuckle, “beats my cubicle” and pays unexpected dividends. “It makes me better understand that life can change in the blink of an eye.”A diptych of a woman in a Trackchair on the trail with her dog, and a man getting transferred from a Trackchair to a wheelchair with assistance from a womanLeft: Gina Kothe and her service dog, Opal, going off road.

Because Amthor has very limited hand function, she operates the Trackchair controls.Now that Soar has secured its non-profit status, Trager hopes to attract more philanthropic support to expand its programmes. In recent months, SOAR held 15 free public hikes primarily at parks in New York and Connecticut; many had waiting lists. “The more we started working with this particular demographic,” said Trager, “the more we realize they are drastically underserved.”Trager generally avoids asking clients about their disabilities, but many open up anyway. At an event at Green Lakes state park, he met a woman born with stunted limbs who asked if he could take her to the beach in a Trackchair. Once there, she asked him to scoop some sand into her hand.View image in fullscreenTrackchairs help people with ambulatory disabilities get out into nature.“She starts crying,” Trager recalled. “I’m like, ‘What’s the matter?’”She told him she had never felt sand before.“She got very emotional,” said Trager. “And this is why we’re doing this.”At Mohonk, the mood among guests was palpably cheerful. The sun burst through, and the oaks and maples exploded in red, orange and yellow. The three-mile loop on the gravel carriage roads wound past babbling streams and verdant fields. Sheer cliffs glistened in the distance.“I could get used to this,” exclaimed Stephen Fray, 61, who has ALS. The highly reactive battery-powered Trackchairs with motorized tilting seats impressed the former civil engineer (and Boy Scout). But his disease has forced him to prematurely retire and tap his savings so he was skittish about the cost of one: between $13,000 and $27,000.David Daw, who attended an afternoon session, also seemed ebullient: “I feel free. I don’t feel sick when I’m out here.”A former stage manager who retired because of muscular dystrophy, Daw now serves as something of a disability rights influencer with a popular Instagram account,Things My Wheelchair Saw. He admitted sometimes struggling with isolation, because “most times you need somebody to drive you somewhere, you need somebody to help you get your chair together”.View image in fullscreenDavid Daw sits for a portrait towards the end of the hike.“If I had to stay indoors, I’d probably be gone,” said Eddie Slick, 73, who drove two-and-a-half hours to get to Mohonk. The avid hunter and fisher looked the part with his camouflage jacket and a white horseshoe-shaped moustache. The fear of being cooped up pushed him to heavily invest in mobility equipment: he customized his ATV to enable him to continue hunting and installed a crane into his van to lift his motorized wheelchair. But he allowed that if someone facing a significant health struggle lacks resources, “that guy’s really screwed.”Despite research showing that adaptive sports bolsters mental health – data from the Centers for Disease Control found that people with disabilities experience frequent mental health distress 4.6 times more often than people without disabilities – most insurers refuse to cover adaptive sports equipment.View image in fullscreenOpal, the service dog, sits on a rock as the adaptive hikers take a break.Insurance companies will not “pay to modify your bathroom”, seethed Gagliardo. “So that means when you’re being discharged from the hospital, you need to put a ramp in yourself. Your bathroom doors aren’t wide enough? That’s your problem. Your $75 grab bar, your shower bench, will not be covered. So, when it comes to sporting equipment, forget about it.”Complaints about the health insurance industry often come up on the trail. Daw recently battled his insurance company for 16 months to receive reimbursement for his motorized chair. He had a prescription from his doctor, but his insurance company forced him to see various specialists to confirm the diagnosis, which often meant long waits for appointments and hours on the phone.“You have to play all those games,” said Daw, who called for legislation to stop insurers from procrastination. He argues 90 days should be long enough for insurers to approve or deny medical equipment for customers with disabilities.“They’re hoping you give up,” Daw fretted. “Because most people give up. Some of them commit suicide. I almost did.”Kothe, the former firefighter, recently fell at home and reopened the residual limb scar wound below her right knee. Despite the significant bleeding, she refused to go to the nearest emergency room. She assumed doctors at a hospital would close the wound with stitches, which would probably alter the fit of her $23,000 prosthesis. Kothe doubted that her insurance would cover the expense. Instead, she relied on DIY medicine: Dermabond skin glue, a Maxipad with antibiotic cream wrapped by an Ace elastic bandage. Fortunately, her repair worked.View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Trackchairs easily traverse a wide variety of terrain, including the packed gravel trails at Mohonk preserve; Johnny Vacca, an experienced Trackchair user, sits for a portrait; berries sprout along the trail.Arguably, insurers have a penny-wise mentality. For instance, lightweight carbon fiber or titanium wheelchairs are routinely deemed not medically necessary. But hi-tech chairs, explained Dr Brooke A Slavens, director of the mobility laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, “reduce wear-and-tear on the shoulder and may lessen the risk or severity of injury over time”. She estimated that 90% of adult manual wheelchair users ultimately deal with shoulder injuries, such as tendinitis and rotator cuff tears. Shoulder surgeries, however, are typically covered expenses.Research supports the commonsense premise that time in nature is time well spent. A metanalysis in the journal Healthcare found that “engagement in adaptive sports showed a positive impact on the mental quality of life among adults with physical disabilities”.An articlepublishedby the American Psychiatric Association cited a Japanese study that monitored a group of people walking in a city and a forest. Subjects on country jaunts had “12% lower stress hormone levels, as well as decreased blood pressure and heart rate and boosted immune function”.View image in fullscreenAmthor transfers into a transport vehicle after the hike with the help of his attendant, Hathaway.Gagliardo does not need to see brain imaging scans to know that the outdoors improves the lives of people coping with profound trauma.“When you do get into an off-road Jeep or an off-road wheelchair, everybody’s face just absolutely lights up,” he said at Soar’s headquarters. “They’re tackling something that everybody told them was impossible. That they told themselves was impossible. Until they come out here and realize – it’s all possible.”"

Until now, the estimated 800 tonnes of nets scrapped every year have been a problem.Now, the horsehair netting, once used to trawl monkfish from the sea bed, is being used for another catch: Russian drones.The Breton charity Kernic Solidarités has sent two consignments of nets measuring a total of 280km toUkraineto be used to protect soldiers and civilians along the frontline where fighting is fiercest.Russia employs small cheap drones and fits them with explosives, directing them by remote control for distances of up to 25km. The Ukrainians use the nets to create tunnels in which drone propellers become entangled. It has been compared to spiders catching flies in a web.“Over the last two years the war has mutated. Before we didn’t even think about drones, but now it’s a drone war,” Christian Abaziou, 70, who is responsible for logistics with Kernic Solidarités, said.“The Ukrainians have told us they don’t need any old nets. They have been sent quite a few that are of no use. The nets we are sending are made of horse hair and used for deep-sea fishing to catch monkfish which are quite powerful and hit the nets with a strength similar to that of a drone.”View image in fullscreenFishing nets have been sent to Ukraine from France, Sweden and Denmark.Photograph: Sonia Bonet/AlamyHe added: “At first they were used by doctors protecting medical camps near the frontline but now they are being used on roads, bridges, the entrances to hospitals … it’s astonishing that something so simple works so well.”Gérard Le Duff, the president of Kernic Solidarités and the grandson of a Breton fisher, added: “The Ukrainian ambassador came to Brittany and he thanked us for what we are doing.“We don’t have a lack of fishing nets in this region. It’s a problem to know what to do with them as a couple of the companies that recycle them have closed. If they need them to create anti-drone walls and save lives in Ukraine, they can have them.”Kernic Solidarités was set up after Le Duff and Abaziou were approached by local Ukrainians asking for help with clothing, food and medical supplies for communities back home. The charity’s 20 volunteers have driven two lorry consignments of aid 2,300km to Ukraine’s border with Poland.“When we learned that Ukraine needed nets, the fishing community reacted rapidly,” Le Duff said.Russia is using first-person view drones, similar to those on the commercial market, that can be piloted by remote radio control that are then packed with explosives. Russian pilots with real-time video feeds direct them to their targets. In some areas, Ukrainian forces say nothing can move without attracting the attention of swarms of “killer” kamikaze drones.The fishing nets are stretched between poles to create netting tunnels or used to cover trenches and vehicles. Ukrainian drones are also equipped with pieces of netting to drop on enemy drones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She added that enemy drone pilots were increasingly finding ways to breach the netting.“Nets are not a panacea. They are just one element of protection against drones,” she said.Abaziou, a retired market garden trader, said the Ukrainians he had met were moved by the support of Brittany’s coastal communities: “The fact that those in the fishing industry the other side of Europe are sending nets to help them defend themselves has brought a few tears to their eyes.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineDrones (military)FranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it is Anderson as a sour, ragey alcoholic who truly mesmerisesRhik SamadderSat 8 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTShareIt’s cliché to compare a love story to Romeo and Juliet. It’s like saying a detective reminds you of Sherlock Holmes. Yet it’s hard to avoid, watching Channel 4’s drama set in 1970s Northern Ireland. Trespasses follows Cushla Laverty, a 24-year-old Catholic teacher who falls for a swashbuckling Protestant, Michael Agnew. They begin seeing each other secretly, around Michael’s high profile establishment job: he’s an outspoken barrister, who campaigns for justice on behalf of young Catholic boys caught up in police bullying. This puts him, and those close to him, at risk of violent reprisal from both sides. Puts your commute into perspective, eh?There’s much to admire. The show’s vintage palette for one, dripping with melancholy browns and orange. Was it perpetually autumn in the 70s? Michael and Cushla, played by Tom Cullen and Lola Petticrew from Say Nothing, have chemistry. And then there’s Gillian Anderson, who plays Cushla’s widowed mother, Gina. She steals so many scenes I wonder if she’s been hanging around the Louvre.Sometimes, when actors ‘do’ accents it’s like someone wearing a fur coat in the supermarket: you can’t pay attention to anything else. And make no mistake, Norn Irish is a fearsomely challenging accent, second only to Newcastle. (When I was learning it at drama school, I had to repeat certain phrases over and over, to key into its particular music. ‘Sloppy Giuseppe’ being the one that sticks in my head.)Anderson inhabits the role, the diametrical opposite of her candid, adventurous Jean Milburn in Sex Education. It’s also pretty far away from her role as Gillian Anderson, doula to women’s fantasies, following her brilliant book Want. Every woman I know is obsessed with Gillian Anderson. They have tattoos. They lose their minds when a new picture shows up of her in a suit. To them, she represents a flawless combination of intelligence, classic grace and liberated sexuality. Also, Scully from the X Files was an OG.View image in fullscreenSteamy windows … Michael Agnew (Tom Cullen) and Cushla Lavery (Lola Petticrew) in Trespasses.Photograph: Peter Marley/Channel 4By contrast, Gina is a sour, curtain-twitching black hole, destroying herself through alcoholism. Anderson uses the supporting part to lethally exude repression, shame and judgment: qualities of despair atmospheric to that time and place. She orders her children to observe the status quo and appease the British. When she learns that her son Eamonn’s wife is five months pregnant, she leaves the dinner table in jealous rage. “Her ma was probably told the second Eamonn pulled out of her,” she spits.Miraculously, she also brings humour to it. “Are you a love addict?” she scornfully demands of her daughter, after reading a quiz in a magazine. The show has an unexpected dryness, notably in the Father Ted-esque figure of Father Slattery – an intense priest at Cushla’s school, who terrifies the children with inappropriate stories of sectarian violence. It leavens a story that could become heavy.Trespasses takes on a heartbreaking moral force as it travels. It’s an illustration of how political dogma creeps and hardens, infecting communities. It condemns the fact that in our world, love – and even simple acts of kindness – can be met with violence. It’s not sentimental about romance, either. The crusading, handsome Michael is older and married. He likes female company, a lot. Does that change how we feel? It would be hard to argue that he’s not still a good man.There is a subtle idea submerged in Trespasses: that obstacles supply oxygen to the wildfire of young love. Obstacles make lovers a team against the world. It’s uncomfortable to admit that sometimes we need unfairness, bad timing, intrusive pasts. If our view is unobstructed, we see more clearly how our beloveds are far from heroic, maybe even not good, a lot of the time. Romeo and Juliet has a similar wisdom, deep inside it.This is a handsome drama, full of painful beauty. We can’t help but root for Michael and Cushla, who can’t give up their furtive passion. They’re seeking private, humanising joy at a time when acts of betrayal between neighbours were as commonplace as slices of soda bread. It hurts to remember the real context is our recent history. If you liked The Celebrity Traitors, they ain’t got nothing on this lot.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There simply isn’t enough of it. Thecalendar is too packed, the demands on players too great and, just because there is something almost hypocritical about managers moaning about the number of games they have to play when the fixture list is a direct result of the greed of the clubs they work for, that doesn’t mean their fundamental point is not a valid one.Transition is always difficult, particularly when it involves not only a change of players but of style. Arsenal may have brought in more players thanLiverpoolthis summer, but it would require a particular obtuseness to think that bolstering and finessing a system that already fundamentally works is a source of greater disruption than implementing an almost entirely new style.Silence over Sudan: why do Manchester City’s owners get away with so much?Read moreBut transition has been made harder by the fact that time available on the training pitch has been so diminished: little wonder an increasing number of managers are preferring to focus on set plays as a way of maximising the limited opportunity they have to work with their teams.Arsenal went into the weekend six points clear ofManchester Cityand seven of Liverpool. They look settled in their style, fluent and confident, with a squad deep enough to ride out all but the severest of injury crises. Their two obvious rivals, meanwhile, are trying to implement a new way of playing.An interviewPep Guardiolagave to TNT in January seems increasingly important in outlining how he saw the future of football. “Today,” he said, “modern football is not positional, you have to ride the rhythm. It is unbelievable, and we could not, simply we could not [play in a positional way] because we did not have the players.“The teams that are playing once a week, it is another story and that doesn’t count. It counts when you are playing every three or four days. Injuries happen, but not this amount in certain positions and this amount of important players, it has never happened before.”Squads have to be bigger. Managers have to rotate more. Without time to devise and implement tactical schemes for every fixture, football has to be simplified. The game’s administrators, in expanding competitions, producing ever more content, increasing the demands on elite players, have actively changed how the game is played; it’s fairly evident Guardiola would see that change as being for the worse.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola has tweaked his tactics to get the best out of Erling Haaland.Photograph: Matt West/ShutterstockNever before, not even in the four years when he had Lionel Messi in his side at Barcelona, has Guardiola focused his play so much on one player. After overhauling his squad since January, everything is geared tocreating chances for Erling Haaland, who has scored a preposterous 27 goals in 17 games for club and country this season.City’s leading scorer in the league this season after Haaland is Maxime Estève, who scored two own goals in City’s5-1 win over Burnleyin September. Once Guardiola would demand his side played 15 or 20 passes to deal with a potential counter before launching an attack; now everything is about trying to play Haaland in quickly behind the opposing defensive line.There’s something almost passive-aggressive about the switch: “Look at what you’re making me do,” Guardiola seems to be saying, the great overthinker casting aside his complex diagrams and schema for a radical simplification of football, refining the game to its most basic form: goalscorer scores goals.But this is Guardiola, so nothing is ever quite that simple. Although the shape tends to be a 4-3-3, Phil Foden is habitually the most advanced midfielder, whether operating centrally or drifting in from the right. Rayan Cherki fulfilled a similar roleagainst Bournemouth last week. Opposing defences, terrified of Haaland hitting space behind them, often drop off, and that creates an area in which intelligent creators can prosper – often by feeding Haaland.Foden scored twice against Borussia Dortmundon Wednesday but he had quietly been having an excellent season even before that, returning to something like his best after a frustrating 2024-25.Arne Slot has been through a similar process. Having brought in only Federico Chiesa for last season, Liverpool’s squad required a refresh for this one. But Slot has acknowledged that he felt other sides had worked his team out by the end of the title-winning campaign and so has attempted something more ambitious than simple rejuvenation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The sense was of Slot going back to basics, slowly evolving rather than attempting wholesale revolution. When time is limited, all that is possible is incremental change.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah (centre) celebrates scoring the first goal against Manchester City in February 2025.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesNeither Villa nor Madrid took the approach that has so unsettled Liverpool this season, going long and trying to exploit the space behind the full-backs. When they meet at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, the directness of City’s approach will be a gauge of how committed Guardiola is to his new pragmatism and, if they do try to exploit a vulnerability about which Slot has been open, that will be an indication of whether Liverpool really have stabilised or if these last two wins have been the result of playing sides whose strengths could not disguise their weaknesses.The likelihood is of a Liverpool closely resembling the side of last season, overhaul temporarily paused, versus a Guardiola side playing against type (or at least type as it was in every season up till this one) and trying to exploit the power and pace of their centre-forward,as they did at Arsenal. It’s an unexpected turn of events, one caused largely by the fixture list.Mikel Arteta has already overseen his transition. As Liverpool and City go through theirs, as they face each other knowing defeat would be a grievous blow to their title hopes, time has rarely felt so squeezed.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityInside footballLiverpoolPep GuardiolaArne SlotFootball tacticscommentShareReuse this content"

The statistics will give you a hint of it – England have won nine Tests in a row and haven’t lost at home all year – but the sight of the way they played here in the second half against Fiji says more about what’s going on than the numbers do.England, whisper it, turned in a brilliantly entertaining40 minutes of freewheeling rugbyagainst a Fiji team who are a hell of a lot better than their ninth-placed standing in the world rankings suggests. The Fijians invited England to a dance, and, glory be, Steve Borthwick’s team were delighted to take them up on it. You can only wonder what Borthwick made of it from his spot up in the coaches’ row.Henry Arundell scorches away to help England finish off battling FijiRead moreThirty minutes in, this was going to be a very different article. It had a smart alec intro all about how there’s a big red button in a case on the back wall of the ground announcer’s box at Twickenham, with the words “Only to be used in emergencies” written across the top. Break the glass, and Sweet Caroline starts pumping out around the ground. “Where it began, I can’t begin to know when …” It’s true that the Rugby Football Union is desperate to move on from this sort of thing. These days the Twickenham playlist is tailored to the kids of the people who pay for the tickets.This game was preceded by an interactive light show, laser display, flamethrowers, a few thousand pounds worth of fireworks, and 15 minutes of hip-hop. But desperate times call for Diamond measures, and half-hour into this match the atmosphere inside the ground was so flat it might have just been run over by Josua Tuisova. Which it had, in a way: England were six points down and seemed to be running out of inspiration already.Last time these two teams played each other, in theWorld Cup quarter-finals, England killed Fiji with their rolling maul. They tried to do it again in the opening minutes of this game but Fiji had prepared themselves, and repelled it. England did score soon after but, and this wasn’t in the script, Fiji responded by going downfield and scoring off a lineout maul themselves. That made it 7-5. And in the following moments, you could feel something coming: Fiji were stirring. They broke down the right, twice, the phases rolling on from one to the other through a series of mad offloads.And all of sudden Caleb Muntz fired the ball out wide to Selestino Ravutaumada on the left wing and he was barrelling ahead, 10, 20 metres into England’s territory, and the ball was flying around the field like a stray bullet ricocheting around a saloon bar. Ping, it was inside with Kitione Salawa, and pyow, Simione Kuruvoli had it, then whiz, it had been chipped up and over Marcus Smith, and then there’s Muntz again, a last-minute reappearance, arriving just in time to gather the ball in and dive for the line. He had Ben Earl hauling on his leg to drag him back away from it, but Muntz’s arm was reaching out and over the line for the score.View image in fullscreenCaleb Muntz and Fiji gave England a scare after scoring one of the great Twickenham tries.Photograph: Matt Impey/ShutterstockIt was one of the great Twickenham tries. And it killed the atmosphere inside the ground stone dead. That was when it happened, in a silent moment soon after the score, while everyone was waiting for a scrum to start over again, “Hands, touching hands, reaching out …” as familiar and predictable as another English box kick. This was, you see, all supposed to be about how English rugby had reverted to type.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Time was when they would have doubled down on what they had already been doing. Not any more. Their new attack coach, Lee Blackett, must be having a bad influence on them. In the second half they decided to take on Fiji at their own game. They played some wild rugby and, 10 minutes in, scored a fine try of their own after Tommy Freeman got his hands on the ball in midfield. It was one of those tries where you need to see the replay. Somewhere in among it, Earl threw a brilliant inside pass and Fin Smith stood a couple of tackles up with a pair of sidesteps. And there was Ollie Lawrence, closing on the Fijian tryline like a grizzly bear charging a picnic after six hungry months in hibernation.There was more.

A 94th-minute strike from the substitute Brian Brobbey claimed a point for the home side, who are fourth in the table.“It’s not a nice feeling,” said Arteta. “It’s disappointment and frustration, because we wanted the three points. We had to navigate through a tough game. We knew that. [They were] very disruptive. We had to deal with situations that were obviously difficult to deal with.”Sunderland fight back with late Brobbey equaliser to hold leaders ArsenalRead moreThe formerArsenalacademy player Dan Ballard had opened the scoring during a first half that had seemingly unsettled the visitors; asked how he felt when Arsenal’s club-record run of eight clean sheets was ended, Arteta said: “A pain in my tummy, because I don’t want to concede any goals.” His side improved after the break and took the lead through goals from Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard.Arteta said of Sunderland’s opener: “We conceded a goal that was not in our standards, but after that, the team reacted really well, showed a lot of personality and courage. Scored the first goal, scored the second goal, and we totally dominated the game.“You have to rely on defending the box when they start to commit six, seven players there. It can be from a direct play, it can be from a throw, or it can be from any situation. We can defend the action better. And today we haven’t done it, we have conceded a goal.”Even after Brobbey’s equaliser, Ballard had to block a Mikel Merino shot. Arteta said: “In the last minute, we had another massive chance to win, which I think we deserved.”Régis Le Bris praised the “character” of his Sunderland team, whose motto in last season’s successful run in the Championship playoffs was: “Till the end”.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta reacts to a missed opportunity for his league leaders.Photograph: Richard Lee/Shutterstock“It shows that the team has a really strong character,” said Le Bris. “It’s still tough against a team like Arsenal, one of the best teams in Europe, so you have to do a masterclass, otherwise it’s impossible to win something.“I think the first half was well balanced, we tried to defend high when possible, organised a deep block, really compact, narrow, aggressive, and we had the opportunity to manage the ball sometimes.“The second half was a bit tougher, because you defend for long periods, and then you have to stay composed with the ball, and we still have a really young squad, really young players without great experience in the Premier League, so it’s a good lesson.“I think we were just on the edge after the 2-1, and Arsenal were dominant, and they were able to keep the ball. But with the energy of the stadium, I think the characteristics of our players, and the background we have now, I think it’s really positive for this faith, and this belief, that we can change the dynamic.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetaSunderlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Never underestimate the haplessness of this Tottenham Hotspur. Never underestimate the capacity of the Premier League to uncover drama in the least plausible situation. The embers of a game of little quality seemed cold and dead but somehow burst into glorious flame in the final six minutes plus stoppage time.What it means is anybody’s guess, other than that these are two sides who remain deeply flawed. The shadow of Bilbao andlast May’s Europa League finalwas unavoidable; in purely technical terms, that game was just as bad as the first 84 minutes of this one, but it at least had a sense of edge. Nervousness is permissible if there is something to be nervous about. Such scrappiness in a routine league meeting is far less explicable.De Ligt snatches last-gasp draw for Manchester United in chaotic finale at SpursRead moreFor the second week running, United took the lead, seemed comfortable, conceded twice and were left talking about their resilience and character after getting away with a 2-2 draw. But the truth is that this was a game they should have had wrapped up long before the Spurs fightback belatedly began. Not for the first time this season, their intensity dropped in the second half as Casemiro tired.Spurs had offered nothing in the first half, not a shot on target, not the glimmer of a threat. Their xG at the break was 0.07, a 40% improvement on what they managed in the entirety of last Saturday’sdrab defeat by Chelsea, but still the sort of figure you can generate if your centre-forward looks hard enough at the opposition goal. The game drifted. Worst of all was the sense that neither side was actually trying to kill the game, that, like Lennie with the rabbits in Of Mice and Men, they’d done so by mistake, as a result of their own clumsiness. There was a rumbling sense of frustration. The stadium gearing up for a symphony of booing. And then suddenly three goals happened in 11 minutes and nobody knew quite what to think.The blunt fact is that Spurs haven’t won any of their last five Premier League home games. Six games at theTottenham HotspurStadium have yielded five points. They might have begun the day sixth in the table but poor home form is far less forgivable than poor away form, particularly for fans who regularly protest against rising ticket prices. The smallish contingent who felt they were above appointing a manager from Brentford now find themselves joined in scepticism by those bewildered at just how unadventurous some of Thomas Frank’s football has seemed.Frank did not win any of his first eight games as manager of Brøndby and lost eight of his first ten games at Brentford. The circumstances were slightly different, admittedly, but still the precedent is there: he has a track record of overcoming poor starts. It may even be that the slow start is part of the process of him instilling his way of doing things.But there are also specific circumstances: Tottenham have been without Dominic Solanke, James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski for most of the season, and they lost Lucas Bergvall and Mohammed Kudus last weekend.View image in fullscreenXavi Simons has struggled to adapt to the Premier League.Photograph: Ian Walton/APThat is a significant creative deficit to make up, particularly given Xavi Simons appears to be finding acclimatisation to the Premier League so testing. In the end, although it was Mathys Tel and Richarlison who got the Spurs goals, the key figure in coaxing the game’s ashes into life was Wilson Odobert, who had come on at half-time for Randal Kolo Muani.The 20-year-old’s beginning to life at Tottenham has been hampered by hamstring problems but there is a reason why he has been capped 14 times by France’s under-21 side. He carries the ball well and, afterscoring against Copenhagenin the Champions League on Tuesday, played three key passes here as part of a 100% pass completion rate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Frank may work for Spurs or he may not but the pattern of his previous jobs, limited evidence though that may be, is that it takes a while for him to get his teams playing his way. The Europa League success obscures just how awful Spurs were at times last season; that will take time to rectify, and the injuries in forward areas will only extend that process. The fix was never going to be quick.With United enduring a similar rebuild, perhaps a game of mixed quality, a mishmash of the dismal and the excellent, was only to be expected.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurManchester UnitedanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Briton is looking increasingly like the man who would be king as his championship ambitions were backed with a statement of intent, having already secured victory in the sprint race.His success was given added impetus as both his title rivals, Oscar Piastri andMax Verstappen, suffered disappointment in Brazil. Piastri’s championship hopes took yet another blow as he crashed out of the sprint and qualified only in fourth, while Verstappen could manage only 16th on the grid.São Paulo Grand Prix: Lando Norris claims pole position after flying lap – liveRead moreVerstappen had already dropped points to Norris after he was fourth in the sprint for Red Bull and the British driver now has the chance to put genuine daylight on both his rivals. At this race last yearVerstappen came back from 17th to winbut that was in the wet and when he was not suffering from a compromised setup. The world champion now needs an immense drive on Sunday to keep his chances alive.With the sprint victory Norris has extended his lead over Piastri to nine points, while Verstappen is 39 points behind the British driver, with 108 on the table from the remaining four meetings, including one more sprint race.Norris, who notably does not really believe in momentum, acknowledged that perhaps he was on something of a roll. “I was under a bit of pressure because I messed up on my first lap, so more stressful than I would’ve liked. But stayed calm when it mattered and put it all together,” he said. “I think when I’m in a good rhythm, when I can stay calm, put it all together I’ll be on top.”Quick GuideSão Paulo GP qualifying timesShow1Lando Norris(GB) McLaren1min 09.511sec2Kimi Antonelli(Ita) Mercedes1:09.6853Charles Leclerc(Mon) Ferrari1:09.8054Oscar Piastri(Aus) McLaren1:09.8865Isack Hadjar(Fr) RB1:09.9316George Russell(GB) Mercedes1:09.9427Liam Lawson(NZ) RB1:09.9628Oliver Bearman(GB) Haas F11:09.9779Pierre Gasly(Fra) Alpine1:10.00210Nico Hülkenberg(Ger) Sauber1:10.039Eliminated in Q211Fernando Alonso(Spa) Aston Martin1:10.00112Alexander Albon(Tha) Williams1:10.05313Lewis Hamilton(Gbr) Ferrari1:10.10014Lance Stroll(Can) Aston Martin1:10.16115Carlos Sainz Jr(Sp) Williams1:10.472Eliminated in Q116Max Verstappen(Neth) Red Bull1:10.40317Esteban Ocon(Fr) Haas1:10.43818Franco Colapinto(Arg) Alpine1:10.63219Yuki Tsunoda(Jpn) Red Bull1:10.71120Gabriel Bortoleto(Br) Kick Sauberno timeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The woes of his competitors stand in stark contrast to the Briton, for whom the victory comes on the back of his dominant pole-to-flagwin in Mexicoas he continues what has been an enormously strong and consistent run of form. His pole lap, a one-off shot he had to make after a mistake on his first run, was immense and flawless as he looks to take the title by the scruff of the neck.Piastri had been in better form in qualifying but the damage had already been done in the morning’s sprint race. Norris led from pole to the flag at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in a race that opened in damp conditions after earlier rain that made the track tricky and which caught Piastri out as he crashed after losing grip when he put a wheel on to a kerb. It was an enormously costly error and not the first in recent races for the Australian.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen said his car was ‘completely broken’ in Brazil.Photograph: DPPI/ShutterstockVerstappen had been unhappy with his car all weekend and described it as “completely broken” on Friday. He simply could not hook up a lap in qualifying, adrift in the car with no explanation as to quite what was wrong. He was knocked out in Q1 for the first time since the Russian Grand Prix in 2021.“I have zero grip,” he said with no little frustration. The team had adapted their setup post-sprint in an effort to find better pace but it appears they had simply gone in the wrong direction in an attempt to fix the car’s instability over the bumps of Interlagos. The team principal, Laurent Mekies, admitted they had taken a risk with their setup, looking for performance that had not paid off.Verstappen said: “I don’t understand how it can be this bad.”Piastri will be most concerned that his touch increasingly appears to have deserted him. He has endured a run of difficult races, including crashing out in Baku and being off the pace in the US and Mexico, and he too needs to come back strongly on Sunday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fearsomely quick, he went top as Piastri followed him out. The Australian could not improve however and while Kimi Antonelli delivered an immense run for second place, Norris had pole with a 1:9.511 lap.Charles Leclerc was in third for Ferrari but his teammate Lewis Hamilton could manage only a disappointing 13th. Isack Hadjar was an impressive fifth for Racing Bulls.A dramatic sprint race was also marked by an horrific accident for the São Paulo boy Gabriel Bortoleto. On the final lap the Brazilian lost the rear looking to go up the inside heading into turn one and speared into the barriers on the inside which catapulted him airborne into the barriers on the opposite side of the circuit with an enormously heavy impact.Bortoleto emerged from the car and was taken to the medical centre and pronounced unhurt but his car was too damaged to be repaired in time for qualifying.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Lando NorrisOscar PiastriMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullFormula OnenewsShareReuse this content"

The victory marks the 26-year-old’s fourth big title after wins at Wimbledon in 2022, and Indian Wells and the Italian Open a year later. This is her third title of the season and her 11th title on the WTA Tour overall.WTA Finals tennis: Elena Rybakina rocks Aryna Sabalenka to claim title – as it happenedRead moreUntil a few weeks ago, 2025 had been a disappointing year for the Russian-born Kazakhstani, whose presence in Riyadh was far from certain. She qualified for the tournament with a brilliant late run of form and has followed it up with some of the best performances of her career, winning her last 11 matches in the process.Over the past few years, Sabalenka has built her reputation and immense success behind her enormous ground strokes and ceaseless aggression but here she found herself against the one opponent who has proven on numerous occasions that she is capable of outhitting the Belarusian.A day after striking 15 aces in her semi-final win over Jessica Pegula, Rybakina reaffirmed her status as the best server in the world by making her service games impenetrable and putting so much pressure on Sabalenka to hold her own. The Kazakhstani took the first strike in many of the baseline exchanges, forcing herself inside the baseline and absolutely eviscerating the ball off both wings. As she tried to counter Rybakina’s relentless pace and depth, so often Sabalenka had no time to set up her strokes.View image in fullscreenElena Rybakina only qualified for the WTA Finals with a late burst but then won every match at the season-ending event.Photograph: Fatima Shbair/APAfter snatching the decisive break of the opening set by laying waste the Sabalenka second serve, Rybakina piled pressure on her opponent throughout the second set, breezing through her own service games while forcing the No 1 into long games on her own serve.As usual, Sabalenka fought desperately until the end, holding firm in generating two set points on Rybakina’s serve at 5-4 in the second set, but the Kazakhstani pulled herself together and ended the match serving and striking the ball at an astonishing level. She struck 36 winners with 13 aces, while limiting Sabalenka to 12 winners.Since her surprise run to theWimbledon title in 2022,Rybakina’s past few seasons have been fascinating. She is so highly regarded that she has often been discussed alongside Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff even when her results have not matched theirs. Too often Rybakina has not been able to find her best tennis in the important moments during the biggest tournaments. She has also been unsettled by numerous off-court problems, particularly the suspension of her coach, Stefano Vukov, who had beenaccused of being verbally and emotionally abusivetowards Rybakina before hisban was lifted in August.However, there has never been any doubt about the quality of her serve and ball striking. She has now placed herself back among the best in the world and positioned herself for even greater success in 2026.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But France, now on a four-match losing streak, cracked under pressure as their discipline disintegrated despite the Springboks being reduced to 14 men on the stroke of half-time.Fabien Galthié’s side looked irresistible early on as the winger Damian Penaud scored twice to become his country’s all-time leading try-scorer with 40, surpassing Serge Blanco’s longstanding record.A succession of reckless infringements and a costly yellow card, however, handed the initiative to the Springboks who punished every mistake in ruthless fashion.South Africa fought back with tries from Cobus Reinach, André Esterhuizen, Grant Williams and Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu, who also slotted two penalties and three conversions.It had all started brightly for France. The full-back Thomas Ramos sent a perfectly weighted chip over the defence after four minutes which Penaud gathered to score. The winger struck again soon after, diving into the corner to double the lead, and when De Jager was sent off for a dangerous tackle on Ramos, France seemed in full control despite being only one point ahead.View image in fullscreenSouth Africa celebrate at the final whistle after three second-half tries secured victory in Paris.Photograph: Nathan Barange/DPPI/ShutterstockThen came South Africa’s spectacular revival through a mixture of clinical attacking and iron discipline.

They’re getting wiser, calmer.”Galthié rued his team’s missed opportunities. “Around the 60th minute we had three clear chances where we should have scored, then we conceded a series of penalties, and we were forced to defend our line until the yellow card and the try,” he said.South Africa have now beaten France in nine of their past 10 meetings.

And so the search will go on. Let us not resort to that familiar lament, if Scotland could not win it here, will they ever. It is true, they had as gilt-edged a chance as they ever had, New Zealand forced to play a total of half an hour a man down, having been shown three yellow cards. It is true, Scotland showed remarkable spirit to recover from 17-0 down at the break to level on the hour. But the All Blacks remain deadly, deadlier than Scotland.This Scotland team is deadly too, but it is a question of deadliness when it matters. That is where they continue to come up short. New Zealand wrote the manual – and did that a long time ago.Scotland v New Zealand: Autumn Nations Series rugby union – liveRead moreThis time it was Damian McKenzie who proved the difference. His stunning 50-22 with 10 minutes remaining and the scores still locked at 17-17 set up pretty much New Zealand’s first attacking position of the half. His brilliant finish in the corner a couple of minutes and a couple of attacking lineouts later gave the All Blacks the lead just when it matters. Then, with a minute to go, he landed a penalty from an angled 45 metres or so to put them more than a score ahead. Crushing. Or, more accurately, piercing, agonisingly, fatally piercing.“That game felt different to the one three years ago, when we were up after 60,” said Scotland’s captain, Sione Tuipulotu. “That momentum shift around 45 minutes was probably one of the biggest I’ve played in, some of the best rugby I’ve been involved in with Scotland. It’s tough to talk about now.”Quick GuideScotland v New Zealand teams and scorersShowScotland:Kinghorn; Graham, Hutchinson, S Tuipulotu, Steyn; Russell (Jordan 75), White (Dobie 55); Schoeman (Sutherland 55), Ashman (Turner 55), Rae (Millar-Mills 55), Cummings, Gilchrist (Sykes 64), Brown, M Fagerson (Darge 61), Dempsey (Bayliss 66)Tries:Ashman, SteynCons:Russell 2Pen:RussellNew Zealand:Jordan; Carter (Proctor 66), Fainga’anuku, Tupaea, Clarke (MacKenzie 45); B Barrett, Roigard; De Groot (Williams 52), Taylor (Taukei’aho 57), Newell (Tosi 55), Lord (Darry 61), Holland, Sititi (Kirifi 72), A Savea, LakaiSin-bin:Carter 33, Savea 46, Taukei’aho 61, Sititi 61Tries:Roigard, Jordan, McKenzieCons:Barrett 2Pens:Barrett, McKenzieWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Scotland were indeed brave as always and cutting too. Gregor Brown had a sterling match in the back row, as did Jack Dempsey. But, opposite them, Wallace Sititi, yellow card notwithstanding, was remarkable too.Times may come, times may go, the All Blacks fluctuating between the convincing and the less so, but that thing they have nailed more than anyone, the ability to score at a game’s most vulnerable points, still seems to apply. As if to encourage Scotland, the fates saw to it that they enjoyed a nice juicy 10 minutes either side of half-time a man up, when Leroy Carter was shown yellow for a cynical trip on the fast-escaping Darcy Graham.Sure enough, Scotland, 10-0 down at that point, came at them from all angles, which is quite a few when this quick-witted side are in the mood. Graham had already been held up over the line when he and Blair Kinghorn wove some magic down the right, and this time Scotland’s attack culminated with Rory Hutchinson going for it. He was comfortably held up as well by a phalanx of All Blacks in white.View image in fullscreenKyle Steyn scores Scotland’s second try of the match against the All Blacks.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PANew Zealand compensated for their missing winger cleverly by maintaining their width in defence, forcing Scotland to turn inside time and again. Then they struck, you guessed it, just before the break. Sititi galloped and dummied down the left and turned the ball inside to Will Jordan to canter to the posts. That was 17-0, and Murrayfield sighed.Up till then, the match had not particularly gone to script. Usually, it is the Scots who pummel away, only to be stung on the counter. This time, New Zealand scored early after the quick-thinking and striding Josh Lord sent Cameron Roigard over in the third minute. And still New Zealand came. One extraordinary defensive stand round the 20-minute mark suggested Scotland might just be able to handle their hosts after all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ewan Ashman finished off a lineout and drive five minutes in, with New Zealand back to a full complement. Ardie Savea was sent to the bin then, and Scotland struck again. Another lineout, a big carry from Tuipulotu, another from Dempsey, and Kinghorn put Kyle Steyn away. Finn Russell’s penalty on the hour levelled, but by then Graham had had another chance, just failing to ground the ball in the corner before it slipped from his grasp.Quick GuideIreland 41-10 JapanShowIreland bounced back from defeat by New Zealand by beginning their home autumn internationals with a 41-10 win over Japan in Dublin. After last weekend’s deflating 26-13 loss to the All Blacks in Chicago, tries from Jack Crowley and Nick Timoney (pictured) helped Andy Farrell’s much-changed side overcome a slow start at the Aviva Stadium.Eddie Jones' Brave Blossoms trailed only 17-10 at half-time after Kenji Sato's score and five points from the boot of Lee Seung-sin. But the hosts, who face upcoming appointments against Australia and world champions South Africa, improved significantly in the second period..

Then, when Sititi became the latest to see yellow a minute later for a deliberate knock-on, the momentum seemed irreversible. Alas, as per, that was just about when New Zealand focused that laser of theirs.Close, Scotland. But there remains a dimension of performance when it mattes to which the All Blacks have long held a key.

They were overhauled by strikes from Mathys Tel and Richarlison before the last-gasp salvation act and Amorim expressed concern that they had drifted through spells of the game while ahead.Explosive ending cannot mask flaws of Tottenham and Manchester United | Jonathan WilsonRead more“We have a lot of problems, we are just in the beginning,” he said. “I know sometimes the results show people that we are improving: we are improving but we have a lot to do. We were comfortable in the game but I think we should do better, be more aggressive, feeling the environment in the stadium and that the three points were there, the space was there.“I think we felt too comfortable during the game. We need to expect that in one play anything can happen and change the mood of the stadium, and today was that. We need to do better because the game was there to take.”There was concern over an apparent knee injury to the second-half replacement Benjamin Sesko. “We think he has a problem but let’s see,” Amorim said.Amorim’s counterpart,Thomas Frank, defended his substitutions after a negative response from the home crowd when he withdrew Xavi Simons for Tel in the 79th minute. Tel duly equalised five minutes later and there were also important impacts from the bench by Wilson Odobert and Destiny Ugodie, who both registered assists.View image in fullscreenSpurs manager Thomas Frank directs his players against Manchester United.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters“Sometimes you’re lucky,” he said. “But I would say that every single time I take a decision to sub a player it’s with one aim: try to win the game.

Though he came to it late, he nowaccepts the realities of climate science. But he lives in flat,embarrassing denial about political realities. Hislatest essayon climate, published last week, treats the issue as if it existed in a political vacuum. He writes as if there were no such thing as political power, and no such thing as billionaires.His main contention is that funds are very limited, so the delegates at this month’sclimate summitin Brazil should direct money away from “near-term emissions goals” towards climate “adaptation” and spending on poverty and disease.Yes, the funds available for any good cause are scarce, but that’s not because of some natural law, some implacable truth about human society. It’s because oligarchic power has waged war on benign state spending, leading to thedestruction of USAIDand drastic cuts to the aid budgets of other countries,including the UK. Austerity isa political choice. The decision to impose it is driven by governments bowing to the wishes of the ultra-rich.There are truckloads of money available. Just after Gates published his new missive, Oxfam revealed that the net worth of the 10 richest US billionairesgrew by $698bnin the past year. That money alone, the increment in the wealth of 10 people, is almost 10 times theannual amount required to end extreme povertyworldwide. How have they managed to channel so much of the world’s money into their pockets? And why can’t we get it back through effective taxation? The answer is their translation of economic power into political power. The richer they become, the more they can bend the state and economic system to their will, ensuring that they become richer still. But Bill Gates says nothing in his essay about how and where extra money for both climate action and poverty relief could be found.View image in fullscreen‘His essay reads like nothing so much as a peace offering to Donald Trump.’ Bill Gates, right, with the Trumps at a private dinner for business leaders in Washington DC on 4 September 2025.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersThere’s a direct link between the poverty Gates claims to care so much about and the wealth he fails to mention. In the US,homelessness is breaking records, and so is theshare of assets owned by the top 0.1%. While this might not be Gates’s own business model, by holding down wages, racking up rents, busting trade unions and winning tax and spending cuts, the ultra-rich thrive on impoverishing other people.Aremarkable studyinPerspectives on Politics, among the very few to have penetrated this secretive world, found that the ultra-rich have radically different political views from the great majority. The multimillionaires it interviewed, in stark contrast to mere earthlings, saw budget deficits as the most important of the issues it listed, and climate breakdown as the least. They were far more likely to insist that social security and federal healthcare should be cut, and far less likely to believe that the unemployed should have a “decent standard of living”, or that there should be more regulation of oil companies, banks and health insurers. They were fiercely opposed to redistribution.So whose views prevail? The tiny minority or the great majority? Though the study was conducted in the Obama years, it found that the very rich had far more access to politicians and officials than average citizens. And now?I scarcely think I need to spell it out.That’s another telling absence in Bill Gates’s essay: at no point in its 5,000 words does it mention Donald Trump. Were Gates to do so, he’d have to acknowledge that the second of his major assumptions is shaky: reductions in the cost of new green technologies lead inexorably to environmental progress. Of course it helps that wind, solar and other green technologies are becoming radically cheaper than fossil fuels. But Trump and similar demagogues are doing everything they can toimpede the transition.Partly as a result, fossil fuels remain highly lucrative. This could be why, despite Gates’s claim that his foundation had divested all its “direct holdings in oil and gas companies” in 2019, itsfossil fuel stock and bond holdingshave,in fact, increased.To Gates, overthrowing the power of the ultra-wealthy may be unthinkable. I don’t mean only that it clashes with his worldview. I mean that, judging by his remarkable silences on the issue, he might be literally incapable of thinking about it. Perhaps this is a symptom of “billionaire brain”: a profound incapacity to see the world fromother people’s point of view. While the ultra-rich are notoriously hard to study, extrapolating from research into how gaining wealth and status affects cognition could suggest that acquiring huge amounts of money is like taking a blow to the head. Wealth seems toscramble certain cognitive functions, particularly those related toempathyandperspective.But perhaps there’s also calculation here: his essay reads like nothing so much as a peace offering to Donald Trump. Trump certainlytook it that way: “I (WE!) just won the War on the Climate Change Hoax. Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue. It took courage to do so, and for that we are all grateful. MAGA!!!”Gates has alwaysbeencompletely WRONGonthe issue, though not for the reasons Trump imagines. He has consistently lagged behind the curve, reciting fossil fuel claims (green technologies could reduce global CO2 emissions only at a“beyond astronomical” cost) long after they’ve been discredited. He has spread confusion and misinformation, such as the groundless assertion in his new essay that the purpose ofSri Lanka’s disastrous banon synthetic fertilisers was “to cut emissions”.Gates calls his essay Three Tough Truths About Climate. So here’s another tough truth he studiously ignores. If, as now seems likely,crucial Earth systems cross tipping pointsand suddenly collapse, the effects on human life, let alone the survival of other life forms (a topic he fails, as usual, to mention), would destroy the smooth and steady progress he foresees. Because environmental change is likely to proceed not in gradual and linear ways, but through sudden changes of state, the possible impacts on human wellbeing are extremely hard to predict. His argument that we should align all funding to current “data-based analysis” of improvements in human welfare, while it might sound rational, introduces in the face of systemic change a profound irrationality, prompting us to ignore the greatest threats.I wish we could ignoreBill Gates. Unfortunately his economic and political power makes that impossible. But unlike him, we can recognise that this power exists and, when it speaks, it does so on its own behalf.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBill GatesOpinionClimate crisisGreen economyThe super-richRenewable energyDonald TrumpCop30commentShareReuse this content"

But a New York Times podcast is fretting about excessive wokenessSat 8 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Nov 2025 09.01 ESTShareLean in (to misogyny), ladies!Are you a woman? Do you want to rapidly raise your profile and get booked on the speaking circuit? Are you good at mental gymnastics?If you answered yes to all of the above then gender grifting may be for you! This often-lucrative career path involves explaining to less enlightened women why feminism has gone too far and the world is much better off being run by men. You get extra points if you aren’t white, and canexplain to the masseshow racism is good, actually.You can see this hustle in thetradwifecontent all over social media. As Jameela Jamilrecently noted, all the “tradwives” preaching to young women about how they should be submissive little ladies are massive hypocrites. They’re all making money, building their brands and securing their independence while telling other women they shouldn’t be doing the same.You can also, of course, see gender grifting on the likes of Fox News, where ambitious, albeitidentikit, female anchorstut-tut on TVabout how #MeToo has gone too far.And now, because the right has been so successful in rewriting reality, you can see gender grifting splashed all over the homepage of the New York Times. On Thursday, the Timespublished a transcriptof a recent episode of the conservative columnist Ross Douthat’s podcast Interesting Times. This veryinteresting(in theBritishsense) piece wasoriginallytitled: Did Women Ruin the Workplace? The headline was then changed to the more nuanced: Did Liberal Feminism Ruin the Workplace?Douthat generously invites two women into his own workplace: the podcast features two critics of liberal feminism, Helen Andrews andLeah Libresco Sargeant, in conversation about “what a right-wing politics of gender should look like.” Andrews apparently caught Douthat’s eye because she had just written an essay for Compactcalled The Great Feminization, which argues feminism has failed because it has driven masculine virtues out of our institutions. The word “woke” or “wokeness” was used unironically 11 times in the piece: a failsafe sign you should not takeanything in it seriously.Andrews continued to just mutter wokeness, wokeness, wokeness in her conversation with Douthat (variants of the word were used 25 times in the conversation), explaining that “the pathology in our institutions known as wokeness is distinctively feminine and feminized … in a very literal sense, our institutions have gone woke because there are more women in them than there used to be.”The conversation unfurls exactly as you’d expect. Carefully cherrypicking examples, Andrews explained that #MeToo was woke, college campuses are too woke, and “the law is currently lopsided in favor of punishing male vices and allowing feminized vices totally free rein.” In response to a question about what constitutes “feminine vices”, Andrews explains that women like “gossiping” and have an “inability to deal with conflict directly”.Sargeant, who has some valid critiques of liberal feminism, does her best to push back against some of this nonsense, but Andrews does most of the talking. Hilariously, towards the end of the conversation Douthat asks Andrews: “What do you like about women, Helen?” She seems unable to answer that question.I know that this is just one man’s podcast rather than, say, a piece by the editorial board, but putting a piece like this on the homepage of the New York Times in 2025 is certainly aninterestingdecision. Taking the sort of misogynistic nonsense that you see on Fox News and repackaging it as a pseudointellectual debate in a prestigious publication imbues these arguments with a dangerous validity. (If you want a proper intellectual interrogation of gendered inequality and supposedly traditional values, by the way, I suggest you readAngela Saini’s The Patriarchs.)While the New York Times is busy pondering whether liberal feminism has ruined the workplace, women’s rightsare being rolled backaround the world. In the very same week that this piece came out, Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaumwas gropedby a drunk man as she mingled with citizens on the streets of Mexico City. The leader of a country can’t do her own job without being harassed in public, and the Times wants us to consider whether the workplace has beentoo feminized.Over in the US, the gender pay gap haswidenedfor the second year in a row, and the Times wants us to consider the possibility that wokeness has gone too far. Mike Johnson, the House speaker,recently shrugged offdomestic assault allegations leveled against Republican congressman Cory Mills, and we are expected to ponder, with a straight face, the idea that the workplace is now hostile to men. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, has beenaccused of sexual assault. (Mills and Hegseth have denied the allegations.) Two out of the five men on the US supreme court have been accused ofsexual misconduct. The president of the US is an adjudicatedsexual predator, whoassociated with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile, and we are supposed to think that our institutions have been feminized. Interesting times indeed.Mexican president pressing charges after being groped“This is something I experienced as a woman, but it is something that all women in our country experience,” Sheinbaum said after beinggroped in the street. “If I do not file a complaint, where does that leave all Mexican women? If they do this to the president, what happens to all the other women in the country?”The incidenthas felt like a personal affrontto many women in Mexico, where violence against women and femicide are major problems. But you have to ask yourself, don’t you:has feminism gone too far?Nearly half of LGBTQ+ TV characters cancelledGLAAD’s2025 reporton queer representation on TV shows a small increase from last year’s 468 to 489 LGBTQ+ characters across all platforms.

From their own experiences, the women I met know she didn’t have toSat 8 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Nov 2025 21.16 ESTShare“Machismo in Mexico is so fucked up not even the president is safe,” said Caterina Camastra, a professor and feminist, when I talked to her in Morelia, a city west of the Mexican capital this week. Succinct and to the point, it is a sentiment shared by many women in Mexico after watching the now viral video of a drunk man groping the country’s first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum, as she walked from the National Palace to the education ministry on Monday. Sheinbaum, who has pressed charges against the man,said much the sameat her daily press briefing on Wednesday: “If they do this to the president, what happens to all the other women in the country?”Sheinbaum’s unprecedented position has made this a teaching moment in a country where women have long complained that sexual harassment and assault on streets and public transport were too often normalised and not taken seriously. The leftist Sheinbaum’s political opponents on the right have done just that byclaiming her sexual assault was stagedto distract from the assassination of a local mayor, Carlos Manzo, an outspoken critic of organised crime who had called on the government to do more to protect him and others. Most women here, on the other hand, know that sexual violence does not have to be set up –half of them have experienced itat some point in their lives.Sheinbaum, like her predecessor and mentor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, is known for wading into crowds, shaking hands, chatting with people and posing for selfies. She was doing just that when she was groped. “It’s a fragile balance between being safe and being close to the people,” said Ishtar Cardona, a sociologist who specialises in cultural studies at the National Autonomous University ofMexico, when she and I met at her Mexico City home for tea, both feeling enraged.And for a female president it’s a reminder that you often can’t win.If Sheinbaum abandoned the closeness to people that her party prides itself on, she would be accused of being scared and not fit for office. Maintaining the tradition as a woman who was so brazenly assaulted, she is open to accusations of being reckless. Already, her opponents are saying that she deserved it, both Camastra and Cardona told me. As Cardona explained to me:“For people that are raised in a very traditional way in which a patriarchal structure is normalised, a woman (like Sheinbaum), who is a scientist, a leftist, represents all that macho men, patriarchal status quo men, in Mexico, hate.” She told me of an incident three years ago when a student approached her in the melee of people congratulating her after she gave a keynote speech and tried to grope her. President or professor, neither woman’s position or power protected her from patriarchal men.Sexual assault is not unique to Mexico, of course. Talking to Mexican women about what happened to their president burst open a cupboard of stored memories and a sharing of war stories. When Cardona told me that she urges her women students not to freeze when they’re groped, I told her of how Ifroze at the age of 15when I was sexually assaulted twice during the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, including by a Saudi policeman. (I started using the hashtag#MosqueMeTooin 2018, which went viral at the time,and to which many Muslim women still share their experiences with sexual assault in sacred sites.) And when she told me of punching her fair share of gropers in the street, I told her how at the age of 50Ibeat up a manwho groped me in a dance club in Montreal, Canada. (I started#IBeatMyAssaulter, which also went viral, and encouraged women around the world to share stories.)Perhaps this is the moment when the dam breaks for Mexican women.“We have been breaking the taboo for about 10 years now but it’s very tough,” says Cardona. “Many women are ashamed but now we can talk with more freedom, more freely about this.” She always talks to her students, men and women, about the precautions she takes when she leaves home, she tells me. “I think about how to dress to try not to be grabbed by the ass or have some man tell me something gross. And I ask my male students: ‘Have you ever thought about that?’ Never.” Once they have seen it happen to their president, in broad daylight, in footage beamed across the world, will Mexican men think differently about it now?“I tell my students you have to embrace the anger!” Cardona told me.I told her I know that man who groped me in a club will always remember the woman who beat him up.Mona Eltahawy writes theFeminist Giantnewsletter.

Both can be valuableEmma KavanaghLast weekend’s Cambridgeshire train attack brought up a question that we often ask ourselves. But the answer isn’t simpleEmma Kavanagh is a psychologist who has worked for the police and the militarySat 8 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Nov 2025 05.01 ESTShareThe devastatingattack on train passengersin Cambridgeshire last weekend was shocking. There hasbeen talk of heroeswho risked their lives to help others, and ofthose who hidto save their lives. If you are anything like me, you will be asking yourself: what if that were me? How would I cope? And just who would I turn out to be when the worst happens?Some of us imagine that we would vault to the rescue, fighting off attackers. Others, perhaps the more realistic among us, anticipate flight, extricating ourselves from the situation as quickly and efficiently as possible. Most of us would like to think that we would stay our urge to run, lingering long enough to offer aid to those in need.People tend to think of “fight or flight” as the body’s natural responses to danger. But the reality is a lot more complicated. As humans, we are a social species, which means we also have the “tend and befriend” drive. You see it all the time in emergencies. In fact, my background in police psychology has shown me that one of the biggest challenges in dealing with any disaster, be it a plane crash, or a threat to a school, is managing all of the people who will inevitably converge at the scene: people running towards danger. Not to confront it, but to reach their loved ones. When we are in a life-threatening situation, we have an instinctive urge to draw those we love close to us. We also have an inbuilt urge to protect those who have been harmed.So, what turns someone into a helper? The first thing to remember is that running away does not equate to cowardice. If someone is coming at you with a weapon, fear is sensible, flight is adaptive. Removing yourself from the situation is the rational thing to do. But once you have done that, new opportunities are then presented to you. You may not be the one who will charge down the attacker, but I’m willing to bet that once you have done what evolution programmed you to do and removed yourself from danger, you will then turn to those who are harmed, offering them aid. This is the tend and befriend response in action. Remember that few things create bonds as quickly or as powerfully as danger. Once you have survived the immediate threat, the survival of those around you is likely to become your top priority.It’s important to recognise trauma – but we should not let it become our entire identity |  Gill Straker and Jacqui WinshipRead moreIt also depends on who we see ourselves as being. Have we imagined ourselves as the hero? It may sound silly, but what we imagine for ourselves can create a schema of behaviour, a mental model that provides us with a template for how to respond in a crisis. Schemas are incredibly important in fast-moving situations. When our stress response is high, we lose the capacity to think rationally. The part of the brain that governs rational thought (the prefrontal cortex) receives less blood flow when we are in a highly stressful situation. So, instead we rely on other parts of the brain (notably the limbic system), responsible for things such as instincts, emotions, muscle memory and schemas. Having a pre-existing schema in place thatincludes us helpingwill go a long way towards creating that behaviour.It also matters whether we have had experience of emergencies before. In my experience, emergency services and military personnel are oftenexcellent in a crisis, because they have learned to quell the immediate stress response, calm themselves long enough to assess the situation and see what needs to be done. But anyone who has learned how to manage their own fear reaction can function well in a situation like this. The truth is, having survived previous crises is powerful learning for us. It tells us that we can experience terrible things, and we can survive.Another factor is how closely a person identifies as someone who does good things. Some people spend a lot of time considering the value they add to the world. Other people don’t. If you do, you are more likely towant to helpbecause that’s simply who you are.The truth is that disasters, for the most part, move quickly. Moments may feel like hours, but they will pass in the blink of an eye. And then you are left, a survivor of the worst of times. If that happens, it is OK not to be OK. In the immediate aftermath of a life-threatening event, most of us will fall apart. Even if it is only for a little while. If, in the aftermath of trauma, you have struggled with painful recollections, difficulty sleeping, feeling jumpy and tearful or angry, know that this is the human stress response doing what it does best. Your brain has been presented with the most unlikely and terrible of circumstances. It now has to build a place to store these experiences – a new schema, in which you are a survivor. That can be abumpy process.But what we also know is that, for most people, these feelings will settle over time, as the initial stress response fades and you incorporate this new piece of you into your understanding of who you are. Sometimes, if the stress response clings on, some help may be needed to assist you in processing your experiences. Remember, terrible moments hit each of us differently, weaving their way into our past experiences and our current situations, creating a unique response for each person affected.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People caught up in terrible events such as the one in Cambridgeshire last weekend will probably never forget. But they will adapt. Many people who have lived through the worst of times, who now have the identity of survivor,report experiencinga sense of post-traumatic growth over the longer term. That doesn’t mean they don’t wish it hadn’t happened, that they hadn’t had to live through it. But because they have lived through it, the person they have become is stronger than who they were before.Emma Kavanagh is a psychologist who worked for many years for the police and military.

That is how long it would take to mourn everylife lostin Gaza. By then, your grandchildren’s great10grandchildren would be dust, and still you would be burying Palestinian bodies from a “war” Israel insists was about self-defense. Even then, this number does not tell you about the thousands of ways these bodies wereburned,torn, crushed and made anything but whole.And yet here we are, watching world leaders gather in Egypt for a “peace summit” last month where the only people absent were Palestinians. The banner read “Peace 2025”, while Palestine’s representatives were barred from the room.Like clockwork, this “peace” has already eroded with Israel violating the ceasefire through continued bombardments. Why does the world act surprised when a country that commits genocide violates the “ceasefire” it orchestrated? Israelliedabout 40 beheaded babies to justify a genocide. And now we’re supposed to believe their commitment to peace?In the first month, Israel has broken its own agreement at least 100times: at least 200 murdered, the yellow line breached, food and fuel blocked, reconstruction prevented. In fact, Israel continues to destroy civilians homes in Gaza. Muhammad al-Hallaq, 10, wasexecutedby Israeli forces in occupied Al-Khalil (Hebron) on 17 October 2025. On 19 October, Israel launched20airstrikes in Gaza. They call this “maintaining the ceasefire”.This is the pattern: Israel turns the volume of violence up and down at will, maintaining full dominion over Gaza and the West Bank, then calls each pause a generous “ceasefire”. They violate it immediately, kill Palestinians who dare exist in their own land, then wait for any response, any stone thrown, any rocket fired in defense, to justify their pre-planned retaliation. They did the same thing after theyviolatedthe ceasefire in March 2025 during Ramadan. The genocide never ends; it only modulates between active slaughter and slow strangulation. The fact that Israel’soccupationand colonial expansion hascontinuedunpunished by international authorities since 1967 is proof enough that they will never be held to the fire they started.In 1949, immediately after the UN-brokeredarmistice, Israeli forces began violating demilitarized zones and launching attacks that killed civilians. In 1967, Israellauncheda surprise attack on Egypt and Syria despite knowing Egypt posed no serious threat. Between 1981 and 1982, defense minister Ariel Sharonrepeatedlyviolated a UN ceasefire with the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon with the Sabra and Shatila massacres, trying to provoke a response that would justify his long-planned invasion.In 2001, as Israeli and Palestinian security officials met to shore up a six-week ceasefire, Israelassassinateda senior Hamas member; nine days later came a retaliatory suicide bombing in Jerusalem. In 2008, Israelviolateda months-long truce with Hamas by launching an operation that killed six Hamas members, then used the predictable rocket response to justify Operation Cast Lead, which killed over 1,400 Palestinians, most of them civilians. The method never changes: violate the ceasefire, wait for retaliation, claim victimhood, launch the offensive you’d already planned.Just look at the West Bank, where Palestinians laid down their weapons after the sham that is theOslo Accords. What did demilitarization bring them? More settlements, more checkpoints, more children shot by snipers, more olive groves burned, more homes demolished. Even complete submission doesn’t stop hunger.In fact,nearly half of all Palestinian children killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the occupied West Bank since records began in 2005 werekilled in just the past two years, 224 children since January 2023 out of 468 total. In 2024, Israelstole24,258 dunams of Palestinian land, approximately half of all land declared as “state land” since Oslo was signed over 30 years ago. At least 59 new illegal outposts wereestablishedin 2024, with 215 Palestinian homes demolished in East Jerusalem. This year, Israel approved itslargest settlement expansionsince Oslo, 22 new illegal settlements, some deep within Palestine. The UNsecurity council, in Resolution 2334,saidIsrael’s settlements have “no legal validity and constitutes a fragrant violation under international law”.This is why Israel destroys not just people, but the means of survival itself: the watertreatmentplants, the agriculturalfields, every hospital, every university. Even after the ceasefire, IsraelcontrolsGaza’s agricultural land.Since 1967, more than 800,000 Palestinian olive trees have beenillegallyuprooted. Not because Hamas hides there, but because Palestinian existence itself is the threat. They learned from American history: between 30 million and 60 million buffalo roamed North America until the US military deliberately supported theirslaughterto control Native Americans, reducing the population to fewer than 1,000 by the late 1880s.Within one generation after the buffalo slaughter, the average height of Indigenous peoples dropped by more than an inch, child mortalityincreasedby 16 percentage points, and income remained 25% lower through today. You don’t need to kill every Indigenous person if you destroy their capacity to sustain life. The reservation system taught them that the defeated can be left alive as long as they’re left dependent.Israel won’t be satisfied until Gaza is theirs and the West Bank is gone. Finance minister Bezalel Smotrichsaid: “Palestinians will leave in great numbers to third countries.” Heritage minister Amichai Eliyahudeclared: “All of Gaza will be Jewish.” They broadcast their intentions while the world pretends surprise at each new violation, each broken agreement, each dead child they claim was a mistake.Thus, the “peace process” has become a piece process, Palestinians robbed of their land piece by piece, until nothing remains but the reservations they’re allocated. Just look to Sinjil in the West Bank, nowfencedin; or,JeninandNablushaving been besieged in the last two years.But how can we even speak of “peace” when we carry Gaza in our bones? Peace cannot exist for any Palestinian, or anyone with eyes still capable of witnessing, who has seen Israel’s depravity. I still hear the Palestinian child wiping his mother’s blood from the floor; I hear the father’s wail as he placed the pieces of his child into a plastic bag; I feel the ways Palestine has been carved, dehumanized, and brutalized to carry out an extermination campaign by those who call themselves “chosen”.These images don’t fade with “ceasefires”.Palestinian self-determination cannot end with Palestinians relegated to the same systems of oppression that destroyed Indigenous peoples across the world. It cannot end withapartheidand rebranded as compromise. True peace requires what terrifies Israel most: equal rights forallfrom the river to the sea. As America might say, from sea to shining sea.They want us to celebrate when the bombing pauses, to be grateful for the moments between murders, to thank them for allowing a trickle of food into the concentration camp they’ve built. But we know what “peace” built on graves looks like. A genocide can’t bring peace because the logic that justifies mass murder doesn’t stop at borders drawn by killers. But every Palestinian child born is proof that genocide fails, “existence is resistance” as the phrase goes, and we’ve never stopped existing.Ahmad Ibsais is a first generation Palestinian American, law student and poet who writes the newsletter State of SiegeExplore more on these topicsPalestineOpinionDonald TrumpGazaWest BankIsraelMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

With the World Cup taking place in his city, he should challenge Fifa nextSat 8 Nov 2025 08.14 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Nov 2025 08.39 ESTShareAfterwinning the electionfor mayor of New York City, an exuberant Zohran Mamdani took to the stage at his victory speech andsaid, “If there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.” He was alluding to Donald Trump, but the sentiment also applies to Fifa, the world’s governing body for soccer.In September, Mamdani’s team kicked off a “Game Over Greed”campaigntargeting Fifa’s use of dynamic pricing for 2026 men’s World Cup tickets,callingit an “affront to the game.” His petition demanded that Fifa cease its rapacious dynamic pricing scheme, place a price cap on tickets that are resold on Fifa’s ticketing platform, and reserve a tranche of tickets for local residents. Mamdani, a longtime Arsenal fan, told theGuardian’s Football Weeklypodcast, “I have long been quite troubled by how the supposed stewards of the game have opted for profit time and time again at the expense of the people that love this game.”Trump ally Infantino to award first Fifa peace prize at World Cup draw in DCRead moreNow that he’s been elected mayor, Mamdani has the power and the platform to push further against the hideous “stewards” of the beautiful game. It’s time to target Fifa’s jaw-dropping tax exemptions and the ridiculous contractual demands that soccer’s world governing body places on World Cup host cities. Fifa honchos ooze privilege, making them the perfect political target at a time whenpublic supportfor taxing the rich is widespread. As a genuine fan of the sport and a generational political talent, Mamdani might be able to achieve the unthinkable: force the Fifa behemoth to share its lucre.At times, it seems like Fifa is just a money factory with a bit of football stashed in its annex. Spurred by the 2026 World Cup, Fifaset the goalof securing a whopping $11 billion in revenues through the four-year cycle, up from the$7.5 billionit hoovered up from Qatar 2022. The 2026 World Cup, expanded to include 48 teams, is on pace to become the most lucrative event in the history of sports.Behind the scenes, tax exemptions have become a key element of the Fifa greed machine. After studying the lopsided contracts between Fifa and the South African government for the 2010 men’s World Cup, lawyer Sophie Nakueiradescribedthe world’s governing body as a “floating sovereign.” In other words, Fifa is a parastate that acts like a parasite, treating World Cup hosts like its own private Vegas buffet.In itsBid Evaluation Reportfor the two candidature files for the 2026 World Cup, Fifa makes a special point to rate each country’s willingness to offer massive tax exemptions for both media and marketing. Assessing Morocco’s unsuccessful bid and the “United” bid of Canada, Mexico, and the US, Fifa rated highest Morocco and Mexico (in the pre-Claudia Scheinbaum era) for their willingness to offer a “full tax exemption.” The US assured Fifa of a “full tax exemption” for media and a “close-to-full tax exemption” for marketing revenues, and President Trump supplied a letter of support in 2018 to settle any jitters that Fifa might have been feeling. Meanwhile, Canada played hardball with taxpayer funds and earned a—womp-womp—“limited tax exemption” rating in both areas. Although the tournament ends in mid-July 2026, Fifa somehowrequiresits tax exemptions to last through 31 December 2028.View image in fullscreenZohran Mamdani’s team launched a ‘Game Over Greed’ campaign targeting Fifa’s use of dynamic pricing for 2026 World Cup tickets.Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesNick McGeehan, the director of the human-rights groupFairSquare, told the Guardian,“Tax exemptions allow Fifa to suck vast amounts of money out of its hosts. The majority of the cost of preparing the tournament falls on the hosts, while Fifa pockets all the revenue that is generated from the sale of broadcasting and marketing rights.” McGeehan added, “Fifa demands tax exemptions on all of this money and for the revenue generated by many of its partners too.” This includes some of the wealthiest media and marketing firms in the world.Acquiring specific information about Fifa’s tax breaks is a gumshoe affair involving obscure government and Fifa documents. The task is complicated by the fact that Fifa pennedindividual contractswith all eleven US host cities—unlike the last time the country hosted a men’s World Cup in 1994, when a centralized organizing committee oversaw the contract—thereby splintering liability and gifting Fifa with a chance to put the squeeze on a city-by-city basis. Solidarity be damned. Ironclad secrecy rules.Mamdani should push for full transparency: all Fifa contracts ought to be released to the public, starting withNew York New Jersey. The New York Timesreviewedthe New York New Jersey contract, concluding that it gives enormous power to Fifa and very little power to local hosts, but every single Fifa contract should be available on the City website for all to read. To date, only a few cities have made public their contracts with Fifa, such asSeattle,Vancouver,Toronto, andSanta Clara, some with significant redactions. If host cities are contractually expected to host matches at astronomical prices—including fan festivals, which can cost$1 million per dayper city—everyday people should be able to know the details. Feeling the fiscal pinch, cities like Bellingham, Washington are dramaticallyscaling backplans for public fan zones, depriving soccer enthusiasts one of the only affordable ways to partake. Challenging Fifa privilege chimes with Mamdani’s election-winning demand that working people are confronting a crisis of affordability and the 1 percent is not doing its fair share.Host-city agreements withFifaaren’t engraved in stone tablets delivered from Mt. Sinai; they can be amended, as long as changes are in writing and agreed to by the host city authority, Fifa, and the US Soccer Federation.For its part, Fifa says the money it gains from events like theWorld Cuphelps the sports itself. “The revenue [Fifa] generates is reinvested to fuel the growth of the game - men, women, youth - throughout Fifa’s 211 member associations globally,” the organization told the Guardian in September.Mamdani might look backward to move forward. Back in 2012, a successful activist campaign shamed London 2012 Summer Olympics corporate sponsors intoforgoingtheir tax exemptions. Mamdani’s democratic-socialist supporters could lead a grassroots campaign to reclaim public money from avaricious corporations.View image in fullscreenThe MetLife Stadium in New Jersey will host the World Cup final next July.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersWhen it comes to the World Cup, host cities are taking the fiscal risks, while Fifa scoops up the rewards. In numerous World Cup host cities, residents are bracing for extra costs related to security and logistics. Although theBig Beautiful Bill Act, passed last summer, allocated $625 million for “security and other costs related to the Fifa World Cup,” local leaders are concerned that costs in the neighborhood of “$150 million per city” could fall on the shoulders of local taxpayers. In Massachusetts, Democratic Governor Maura Healey recentlyproposedcreating a $20 million Fifa World Cup reserve fund.Meanwhile, in Canada, the World Cup is skewing public priorities. Amid layoffs in Vancouver’s city government, World Cup planning remains unaffected. “It’s a contractual obligation” with Fifa,explaineda deputy city manager. “We have no wiggle room in terms of delivering what we need to deliver.” It’s no wonder that soccer-mad cities likeMinneapolisandChicagosaid thanks but no thanks to hosting matches due to Fifa’s unwillingness to negotiate in good faith and stiffinsistenceon tax breaks and loading liability on the hosts’ backs.Canadian journalist Bob Mackin – who deserves enormous credit for wrenching documents from the clenched fists of World Cup organizers in Vancouver – told me, “Vancouver’s involvement in Fifa 26 lacks any credible, publicly available business case, only rosy government news releases with a variety of cost ranges, revenue estimates and aspirations of a future tourism legacy.” He added, “There is no effort to mitigate the harms to the people struggling in the community.”Mamdani has a golden opportunity to expose the outrageous burdens that Fifa places on World Cup host cities and to demand that World Cup boosters “mitigate the harms” they inflict on working people. After all, vast sums of money swirl around the World Cup. The leader of Vancouver’s local organizing committee, Jessie Adler,hauled ina whopping $470,000 in 2024, dwarfing the British Columbia Premier David Eby’s salary of around $227,000. Mamdani could use Fifa’s brand of trickle-up economics to his political advantage.Much is possible, and the timing is propitious, with Mamdani riding high and the general public feeling low about corporate poweramassing moreand more while everyday people suffer. For too long, Fifa has been “fully focused on monetizing the sport, no matter the collateral damage,” as Leander Schaerlaeckensput itin these pages.With the 2026 World Cup coming into ever-sharper focus, now is the time to push back. Mamdani, a real-deal soccer aficionado and magnetic political force is the right guy to lead the charge.Explore more on these topicsFifaWorld Cup 2026Football politicsWorld CupZohran MamdanicommentShareReuse this content"

Plus a letter fromVicky DunnSat 8 Nov 2025 11.30 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Nov 2025 11.33 ESTShareIt’s great to see that there are young men who are actively looking for alternatives to the kinds of masculinities displayed online (I’m a teenager who was lured into the manosphere. Here’s how to reach young men like me, 2 November). But to me, Josh Sargent’s article is about more than just the manosphere. It’s about the platforms that facilitate it, and how social media diverts attention away from things like reading and toward things that largely don’t matter. Josh says it himself: “in fairness, short-form content is slightly more engaging than Macbeth quotation flashcards”. That’s truly worrying.It’s true that the education system can and should do better, but I also think we need reminding that young people have always felt alienated from the education system. They have always been disillusioned, with feelings of being ignored and misunderstood, and I think many young men today forget that. It isn’t just them.John Hughesmade an entire career of writing about disillusioned youth and the pressures to conform to expectations around masculinityandfemininity (women have long endured the pressures of not being “feminine” enough, of “failing” as mothers, as women etc). It’s taken a long time for alternatives to emerge, and we’re still not there yet. So what frustrates me most about the idea of toxic masculinity is that (some) men think that their trials are somehow unique, so they lash out at women.To Josh and others, I say: get off TikTok. It may not be the sole cause of the manosphere, but it feeds on it.Social mediaitself is toxic: it prioritises that which is trivial and shallow. Instead, young men (and everybody) should be trying to regain their attention spans. Go and read East of Eden. Go and read The Brothers Karamazov. And while you’re at it, read The Handmaid’s Tale. Ignore the static that is social media and turn that disillusionment into art.Siobhan LyonsMedia and cultural studies scholar, Sydney, AustraliaI was not at all surprised to read Josh Sargent’s recommendations for how to reach young men like him. Having worked with young men in the north-east of England for the past decade, I see the same disillusionment and uncertainty that Josh describes – yet the media insist on reading this only as misogyny and toxicity. Ten years ago I argued that we needed to stop talking about a “crisis in masculinity”. We didn’t stop: we just replaced the word crisis with toxic. Now we call boys “lost”.Josh writes: “I can promise you, we’re not lost. We’re just waiting for you to hear us.” Well said. But the onus should not be on boys to say this louder. It should be on the rest of us to listen better.Talk of crisis, toxicity and being lost is not only unhelpful – it strengthens the very voices it claims to oppose. The manosphere tells young men they will not be seen, heard or valued. So stop doing their work for them. If young men are struggling with money, meaning and manhood, then make these legitimate topics of public conversation – not shameful private ones. The only way to prise anxieties about the size of pecs, penises and pay packets away from the steroid-fuelled manosphere is to make it socially normal for young men to talk about them in the open. Young men do not need to be rescued. They need to be taken seriously.Dr Michael J RichardsonSenior lecturer in human geography, Newcastle UniversityAs the mother of a 17-year-old lad, I was interested to read Josh Sargent’s article on masculinity. I popped upstairs to interrupt the gaming and gather the views of his seven male friends aged 17 to 19. Most are studying practical trades at college or apprenticeships, the rest working in factories. What follows is a summary of what they told me.Yes, they do see “toxic” and “masculinity” are paired together online. They observed that “many girls are tret like shit by men” and that “large muscular blokes who want to fight” are examples of toxic masculinity. No approval of these was voiced.They noted that being masculine is not a bad thing, although it has changed, and some girls can be masculine and some boys they know are quite feminine. They wondered why there needs to be labels for everything, when all kinds of people can be toxic.Identifying male role models fell rather flat, with only action film actors named by one lad. They felt Grimsby/Cleethorpes fairly well supplied with youth activities, with great respect for The Trin (sports and community activities), and interest in the new Horizon centre which is opening soon. They felt schools to be too strict, and that kids with unidentified needs are labelled naughty and put in isolation all day and learn nothing. One observed that schools look like they did 100 years ago and what people need to learn has moved on.They read this letter through and approved it for me to send. I was impressed by the nuance to their thinking and have less to worry about now that I understand more. I’m glad our area has some funding for some youth activities. Josh Sargent was right – open and honest conversation with boys is what is needed.Vicky DunnGrimsby, LincolnshireExplore more on these topicsMen's healthMental healthSocial mediaHealthlettersShareReuse this content"

Three were killed in the south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region, regional officials said.Energy infrastructure in Kyiv, Poltava and Kharkiv regions was damaged by the strikes, according to the Ukrainian prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko.Energy companies were working to restore electricity, water and heating provision, while several cities resorted to generators to keep the power on. Kremenchuk and Horishni Plavni in the central Poltava region, were using generators to maintain water supplies, municipal officials said.Map of frontlineZelenskyy called for more sanctions after the strikes. “For every Moscow strike on energy infrastructure – aimed at harming ordinary people before winter – there must be a sanctions response targeting all Russian energy, with no exceptions,” he said.Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy sector have increased in recent months, with the military attacking gas facilities nine times in the past two months, according to the state energy firm Naftogaz.On Saturday, Ukrainian drones hit an electricity substation in northern Russia and separately wounded two other people in a strike on a residential building in the city of Saratov.Russia claimed its “massive strike” was on Ukrainian weapons production and energy facilities. It also said it had captured a village in eastern Ukraine as its forces there continued to gradually push on the frontline.Despite US pressure for a ceasefire, negotiations for a permanent truce in Ukraine have faltered.

The far-right security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, ordered it back into service after the 7 October attacks in 2023.The cells, a tiny exercise “yard” and a lawyers’ meeting room are all underground, so inmates live without any natural light.The jail was initially designed for a small number of high-security inmates occupying individual cells, holding 15 men when it shut in 1985. In recent months, about 100 detainees have been incarcerated there, official data obtained by PCATI shows.Under the ceasefire agreed in mid-October, Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners who had been convicted in Israeli courts, and 1,700 Palestinian detainees fromGazawho had been held indefinitely without charge or trial. The young trader held at Rakefet was among them.However, the scale of detentions has been so vast that even after that mass release, at least 1,000 others are still held by Israel under the same conditions, including the nurse represented by PCATI.View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers stand by a truck used to transport Palestinian detainees, who have been stripped, bound and blindfolded.Photograph: Moti Milrod/AP“Though the war is officially over, [Palestinians from Gaza] are still imprisoned under legally contested and violent wartime conditions that violate international humanitarian law and amount to torture,” PCATI said.The two men who met PCATI lawyersin September were a 34-year-old nurse detained while at work in a hospital in December 2023 and a young trader seized in October 2024 as he passed through an Israeli checkpoint.“In the cases of the clients we visited, we are speaking about civilians,” said the PCATI lawyer Janan Abdu. “The man I spoke to was an 18-year-old who worked selling food. He was taken from a checkpoint on a road.”Ben-Gvir had told Israeli media and a member of parliament that Rakefet was being rehabilitated to hold Nukhba – meaning “elite” – Hamas fighters who led massacres inside Israel Oct 7th, and Hezbollah special forces fighters captured in Lebanon.Israeli officials said no Palestinians involved in the 2023 attacks were released under the ceasefire deal that resulted in the teenage prisoner being returned to Gaza.end newThe Israeli Prison Service (IPS) did not respond to questions about the status and identity of other prisoners held at Rakefet, which means “cyclamen flower” in Hebrew.‘Cruellest forms of torture’: freed Palestinians describe horrors of Israeli jailRead moreClassified Israeli dataindicatesthe majority of Palestinians taken prisoner in Gaza during the war were civilians. Israel’s supreme courtruled in 2019that it was lawful to hold the bodies of Palestinians as bargaining chips for future negotiations, and rights groups have accused it of doing the same with living detainees from Gaza.Unique abuseConditions for Palestinians were “horrific by intention” at all prisons, said Tal Steiner, the executive director of PCATI. Current and formerdetainees, andwhistleblowersfrom the Israeli military, have all detailedsystemic violationsof international law.However, Rakefet imposes a unique form of abuse. Holding people below ground without daylight for months on end has “extreme implications” for psychological health, Steiner said. “It’s very hard to remain intact when you are held in such oppressive and difficult conditions.”It alsoaffects physical health, impairing basic biological functions from circadian rhythms needed for sleep to vitamin D production.Despite working as a human rights lawyer, and visiting prisons at the complex in Ramla, south-east of Tel Aviv, where Rakefet is located, Steiner had not heard of the underground jail before Ben-Gvir ordered it back into service.View image in fullscreenItamar Ben-Gvir visiting the Rakefet prison wing.Photograph: KoKoIt was closed before PCATI was founded, so the legal team turned to old media archives and the memoir of Rafael Suissa, the head of the IPS in the mid-1980s to find out more about the jail.“[Suissa] wrote that he understood being held below ground 24/7 is just too cruel, too inhumane for any person to endure, regardless of what their actions have been,” Steiner said.This summer, PCATI lawyers were asked to represent two men held in the underground prison, so Abdu and a colleague were able to visit for the first time.They were led underground by masked, heavily armed security guards, down a flight of dirty stairs into a room where the remains of dead insects dotted the floor. The toilet was so dirty it was in effect unusable.View image in fullscreenA newspaper report from May 1985 on the closure of Rakefet prison that also details its original purpose as a high-security facility for members of organised crime groups.Photograph: Akevot Institute for Israeli-Palestinian Conflict ResearchSurveillance cameras on the walls violated the basic legal right to a confidential discussion, and guards warned that the meeting would be cut short if they talked about detainees’ families or the war in Gaza.“I asked myself, if the conditions in the lawyers’ room are so humiliating – not just personally to us but also to the profession – then what is the situation for the prisoners?” Abdu said. “The answer came soon, when we met them.”The clients were brought in bent over, with guards forcing their heads to the ground, and remained shackled at their hands and feet, she said.Saja Misherqi Baransi, the second PCATI lawyer on the trip, said the two detainees had been in Rakefet for nine months, and the nurse began the meeting by asking: “Where am I and why am I here?” The guards had not told him the name of the prison.Israeli judges who authorised the detention of the men at very brief video hearings, during which the detainees had no lawyer and did not hear evidence against them, said only that they would be there “until the war ends”.The men described windowless cells with no ventilation, holding three or four detainees, and reported often feeling breathless and choking.Prisoners told the lawyers they faced regular physical abuse including beatings, assaults by dogs with iron muzzles, and guards stepping on prisoners, in addition to being denied adequate medical care and given starvation-level rations. Israel’s high courtruledthis month that the state was depriving Palestinian prisoners of adequate food.They have very limited time outside the cell in a tiny underground enclosure, sometimes just five minutes every other day. Mattresses are taken away early in the morning, usually at about 4am, and only returned late at night, leaving detainees on iron frames in otherwise empty cells.Their descriptions matched images from a televised visit to the prison made by Ben-Gvir to publicise his decision to reopen the underground jail. “This is terrorists’ natural place, under the ground,” he said.He has repeatedly boasted about mistreatment of Palestinian detainees, rhetoric that former hostages taken during the 7 October attacks saypromptedan escalation of Hamas abuse when they were in captivity.‘Locked up for 24 years’: release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees sparks joy and sorrowRead moreThis included holding hostages in underground tunnels for months, depriving them of food, isolating them from news of relatives and the outside world, and violence and psychological torture, including being ordered to dig a grave on camera.Israel’sintelligence serviceshave warned that the treatment of Palestinian prisoners puts the country’s wider security interests at risk.Misherqi Baransi said the detained nurse last saw daylight on 21 January this year, when he was transferred to Rakefet, after a year passing through other jails including the military’s notorious Sde Teiman centre.The nurse, a father of three, has had no news of his family since his detention. The only fragment of personal information lawyers can share with detainees from Gaza is the name of the relative who authorised them to take on the case.“When I told him: ‘I talked to your mother and she authorised me to meet you,’ then I am giving him this tiny thing, at least telling him that his mother is alive,” Misherqi Baransi said.When the other detainee asked Abdu if his pregnant wife had given birth safely, the guard immediately cut off the conversation to threaten him. As the guards took the men away, she heard the sound of an elevator, suggesting their cells were even deeper underground.The teenager had told her: “You are the first person I have seen since my arrest,” and his last request to her was: “Please come see me again.” His lawyers were later informed he was released to Gaza on 13 October.The IPS said in a statement that it “operates in accordance with the law and under the supervision of official comptrollers” and added that it “is not responsible for the legal process, classification of detainees, arrest policy, or arrests”.The justice ministry referred questions about Rakefet and detainees to the Israeli military.

I found a lump a few weeks ago. It came and went but then I was working on The Masked Singer and Lorraine, the TV show, and Lorraine Kelly had put signs on the backs of all the doors saying ‘check your breasts’ and every time I went for a wee I did that.“It was still there, and then one morning I saw myself in the mirror and thought: ‘I’m going to get that looked at.’“I had a biopsy. I found out it was indeed breast cancer and I had it taken out in a lumpectomy nearly three weeks ago.”McCall added: “It was very, very small, so I got it very, very early, which is incredibly lucky. But I am so relieved to have had it removed and to know that it hasn’t spread.“My lymph nodes were clear, I didn’t have any removed, and all I’m going to do now is have five days of radiotherapy in January as kind of an insurance policy.”In her post, McCall, 58, paid tribute to medical staff, her family and her partner, the hairdresser Michael Douglas.She said: “I just want to say a massive thank you to everybody at the Royal Marsden [hospital] … all the nurses, doctors who have helped me, thank you for your support.“Thanks to my family, to my brilliant kids, and an extra special thanks to Michael. It’s been a lot. I was very angry when I found out, but I let go of that and I feel in a much more positive place now.”She added: “I think my message is, get checked if you’re worried, check yourself regularly. If you are due a mammogram, then get it done. And I have dense breasts, and I had a mammogram in August, and I was postponing the ultrasound. I just couldn’t find time to do it. Don’t do that.”Last November, thepresenter had surgeryfor a “very rare” tumour. The benign brain tumour, known as a colloid cyst, was found after she was offered a health checkup as part of her menopause advocacy work.‘I wasn’t terrified of dying, but I didn’t want to leave my kids’: Davina McCall on addiction, reality TV and the brain tumour that nearly killed herRead moreIn a tearful interview earlier this year, McCall said the craniotomy, which entailed removing a portion of her skull to extract the tumour, was “the hardest thing” she had endured. In April, she said her benign brain tumour was“not coming back”.The former Big Brother host has long advocated on women’s health issues and has presented documentaries on contraception and menopause. Her bestselling bookMenopausing, co-written with Dr Naomi Potter, won the British Book Awards 2023 overall book of the year.Explore more on these topicsDavina McCallBreast cancerCancerHealthTelevisionWomen's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

Dino, 106, and his wife of 85 years – Maria de Sousa Dino, 102 – had been LongeviQuest’s longest-married couple in the world since February.The surviving photo of Eleanor and Lyle Gittens’ wedding in Bradenton, Florida in 1942.Photograph: LongeviQuestThe Gittenses are the world’s oldest ever married couple, too, with a combined age of more than 216, said LongeviQuest’s article, which posited that the pair’s love story is exceptional for having survived war and other hardships.Lyle and Eleanor Gittens first met in 1941 at a college basketball game that he played in for Clark Atlanta University and which she attended as a spectator. Eleanor told LongeviQuest that she couldn’t remember whether Clark Atlanta or the historically Black university’s crosstown rival Morehouse College won. All she remembered, she said, was that it was the first time she met Lyle, who was later inducted into the men’s basketball hall of fame at Clark Atlanta.The two went on to fall in love and plan to marry despite being certain Lyle would be drafted into the military because of the second world war. They wed on 4 June 1942 after Lyle was granted a three-day pass from training at a US army base in Georgia.His wedding day was the first time Lyle met Eleanor’s family. He recalled to LongeviQuest that he had to ride to his bride in a racially segregated train car – a long trip before the dawn of the US civil rights era that Lyle said was well worth it because of Eleanor.View image in fullscreenEleanor and Lyle Gittens, world’s longest-married couple, holding hands.Photograph: LongeviQuestWhen Lyle left to serve in Italy with the US army’s 92nd infantry division, Eleanor couldn’t help but wonder if she would ever see him again alive, she previously told Florida’sWestside Gazette. She was already pregnant with the first of their three children, and she moved to New York City, where she met her husband’s family for the first time.Eleanor supported their family doing payroll for an aircraft parts producer while she and Lyle stayed connected through a series of letters. The military censored the letters so heavily that more of Lyle’s words were redacted than visible, as Eleanor recalled to LongeviQuest.Eleanor and Lyle at last started building their life together after the war, settling in New York. They passed New York’s civil service exam together, pursued careers in government work and traveled, including to Eleanor’s favorite locale: Guadeloupe in the Caribbean.She was 69 when she earned an urban education doctorate from Fordham University in the Bronx. The pair also spent decades as active members of Clark Atlanta’s alumni association before eventually moving toMiamito be close to their daughter, Angela.Lyle said he misses New York, and he acknowledged that he couldn’t quite believe his marriage to Eleanor was record-setting. But he said he is delighted to remain at Eleanor’s side.“I’m happy to be here,” Lyle told LongeviQuest in a video published on the organization’sYouTube page. “We enjoy our time together … [and] we’ve done a lot of things together.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsMiamiOlder peopleAgeingMarriageRelationshipsnewsShareReuse this content"

There was lots of things I could do while I was in prison which I then couldn’t do as soon as I walked out of the gates.“I know we’ve seen massively increasing repression over the last couple of years I’ve been involved in direct action and civil resistance, and especially seeing what’s happening with the Palestine Action prisonersat the moment.“We know they’re using extremism much more broadly, but to have it put on me personally was pretty upsetting. It felt like an extension of the punishment, as opposed to an actual attempt to manage risk or protect the community.”People accused of Palestine Action-related offences, including those awaiting trial for allegedly taking part in an action against an Israeli arms factory near Bristol last year before the group was proscribed under terror legislation,say they have been treated harshly in jailbecause their alleged offences are described by prosecutors as having a “terrorism connection”.Ward said she was told by her probation officer that she could not work at a cafe, or even meet a friend there, because it held political events.She withdrew her judicial review proceedings against the MoJ last month after it agreed to drop the offending conditions, which also included a prohibition on associating with anyone currently or formerly associated with “any protest groups”.She said this left her uncertain about whether she could associate with friends or family members, even though another condition required her to live and sleep at her parents’ home with a tag-monitored curfew.Johanna McDavitt from ITN solicitors, who represented Ward, said: “It is concerning to see that the government is using powers that should be reserved for extremist offenders to control and monitor the actions of those involved in peaceful protest. We hope that the government will now review and reconsider its use of these licence conditions, which place serious restrictions on freedom of speech and freedom of association.”A HMPPS spokesperson did not address the extremism issue when contacted by the Guardian but said non-standard licence conditions were regularly reviewed and could be relaxed if no longer necessary.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Many delegations have slimmed down their presence, while business leaders have decamped to hold their own events in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.But Brazil has held steady to its plan. Cop30 will bear the host country’s stamp to a far greater extent than most of theannual “conference of the parties” meetings, in the first return for Cop to the country where it began in 1992, when theUN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) was signedat the landmark Earth summit in Rio.For a start, heads of state and government, including theUK’s Keir Starmer, Germany’s Friedrich Merz, the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen, came early, a few days before the formal start of the conference. For many, descending over the rainy city of Belém was their first up-close glimpse of the planet’srapidly shrinking green lungs.The series of roundtables they held over two days would, it was hoped, galvanise action from the ministers and high-ranking officials from 195 countries who will meet over the next two weeks.Brazil’s changes to the usual format will extend to the end of the fortnight: the host is resisting calls to end the Cop by gavelling through the usual “cover decision”, a document agreed by all parties that brings together numbered resolutions on many of the disparate strands of the climate crisis. Foregoing the catch-all cover decision – a baggy, sometimes overlong document, but often the main outcome of a Cop – is a high-risk strategy, meaning some key issues may be omitted, as they wereto the rage of many countries at last year’s Cop29.“It’s worrying not to have a cover decision,” one official from a previous Cop host told the Guardian. “We found it was the best way to capture the progress we had made in the negotiations across a range of issues. They may yet change their minds.”From the very beginning, Brazil poured wide-ranging diplomatic effort into using the event to forge connections and foster climate networks, drawing on theBrazilian concept of themutirão. Adapted from Indigenous practice, amutirao“refers to a community coming together to work on a shared task, whether harvesting, building, or supporting one another”, said André Corrêa do Lago, the Cop30 president.“By sharing this invaluable ancestral wisdom and social technology, the incoming Cop30 presidency invites the international community to joinBrazilin a globalmutirãoagainst climate change, a global effort of cooperation among peoples for the progress of humanity.” (Writing to participants, he could not resist mentioning another of Brazil’s passions: “As the nation of football, Brazil believes we can win byvirada. This means fighting back to turn the game around when defeat seems almost certain.”)Dozens of senior diplomats, community leaders and statespeople from around the world were recruited to beCop30envoys and ambassadors; as were a “circle” of previous Cop presidents, including the UK’s Alok Sharma; a circle of finance ministers; a people’s circle for Indigenous communities; and special envoys for energy, agriculture and business.“Brazil have put a lot of preparation into this Cop over two years,” says Nicholas Stern, an economics professor at the London School of Economics. “Whatever comes out will be more considered than a rush job would have been. They have taken very important steps [in bringing experts together].”Some of the circles have already borne fruit; the finance ministers’ meeting facilitated introductions not only among countries, but in some cases between finance and environment ministers within the same government. “Some of them appeared not to have known each other before,” one participant observed.President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva wanted social issues high on the agenda, so his environment minister, Marina Silva, set up an initiative called the global ethical stocktake (GES), which will pursue climate justice. Bringing together Indigenous people – who have been promised a much bigger role in this summit than previous ones – and representatives for poor communities, vulnerable people, workers and marginalised groups, the GES aims to ensure fairness and equity are key considerations in any climate policy.“[The GES] is simply about integrating the ethical dimension, to bolster political decisions and technical measures,” Silva said. “We already possess virtually all the technical solutions for climate change, biodiversity loss, and even pressing social issues. What is needed is the ethical commitment to apply our technical capabilities and accelerate our political decisions, ensuring we fulfil what we’ve already committed to.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But when he started looking at his options the ability to lease a used electric vehicle (EV) caught his eye.A couple of years ago someone looking for their next car would have been hard pushed to find a used EV – let alone lease one – but that is changing fast.View image in fullscreenAnthony Santos with his Mercedes EQA, which he leases for £360 a month instead of the usual £570 via a salary sacrifice scheme.There are now1m EVs on British roads, and the cars bought by early adopters are hitting the secondhand market.Generally speaking EVs have lost value more quickly than petrol or diesel cars, which is a big problem for the owners of leasing companies, rental businesses or corporate fleets. But the flipside for consumers is that it is possible to find a cheap leasing deal.In the second quarter of 2025, the number of used car leases in the UK rose by 166%, compared with the same period a year ago, with electric cars driving the growth, according to the latest data available from the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), a lobby group.“Three years ago used EV leasing was very small because there were very few used EVs on the market,” says Thom Groot, the chief executive of the Electric Car Scheme, a broker. From about 15% of sales in 2024, used EVs now make up nearly half its business.At Octopus EV,which is part of the UK’s largest energy supplier, the number of used EV leases has doubled in the last year.The picture is helped by fact that big players in the leasing market, including Lloyds Banking Group’s Lex Autolease, BNP Paribas’s Arval, and the independent group Zenith, have started now offer leases on used EVs.With the average price tag of a new electric vehicle sitting at £50,000, putting them out of reach of many Britons, in the summer the government launched asubsidy scheme. But buying secondhand makes going electric even more affordable.Santos discovered that he could lease a lightly used Mercedes-Benz EQA without paying anything upfront. His company offered a salary sacrifice option (more on that later) via the Electric Car Scheme, which meant he could pay £360 a month for a car that would usually cost £570.“There was no deposit – the tax benefits really made sense,” Santos says. “That’s what made me move forward with it.”How leasing worksPeople who lease their cars pay a monthly fee, typically for two or three years, avoiding the need to stump up tens of thousands of pounds upfront. As well as the car, costs such as road tax, breakdown assistance, service and maintenance are often included – but typically not things such as insurance.Leasing a used EV is a lot cheaper than buying a new one, even for vehicles in good condition that are only two or three years old. That means more expensive models can be more affordable, making it easier for people on lower incomesto cut their carbon emissions.View image in fullscreenOn a standard lease a new Škoda Enyaq costs about £567 a month, but that falls to £292 for a used model on salary sacrifice.Photograph: Arnd Wiegmann/ReutersThe Electric Car Scheme gives the example of the Škoda Enyaq, an SUV. On a standard lease a new model costs about £567 a month, but that falls to £292 for a used model on salary sacrifice. Volkswagen’s ID.4 SUV similarly falls from £506 to £296 a month, a decrease of 42%.However, not every cost will be picked up by the owner. Lessees will still have to pay damage outside fair wear and tear, and some also add an excess mileage charge. While 10p a mile may not sound like much, high-mileage drivers will have to consider whether they will face a big extra bill when they hand the car back.Salary sacrificeThe best deals will almost certainly be limited to those whoseemployers have signed up for a salary sacrifice scheme. The key thing about salary sacrifice is that the cost is deducted from your pay before tax – lowering your tax bill. How much you save depends on your tax bracket: so lower-rate taxpayers save 20%, higher-rate taxpayers (salaries of £50,271 to £125,140) save 40%, and 45% above that.Ian Hughes, the chief executive of the corporate and consumer business of Zenith Group, says salary sacrifice has been “a major foundation stone of the transition” to electric cars due to the tax advantages.Many employers offer salary sacrifice – ranging from very small companies to household names such as HSBC, BT and Jet2, as well as a number of NHS trusts. There are usually no fees for the employee, but employers pay the scheme provider the equivalent of the tax saved from lower national insurance contributions.Often the companies offering salary sacrifice impose conditions, such as a minimum contract length, or a gross basic salary above a certain threshold. People leasing will also have to go through a mandatory credit check, as well as affordability checks to make sure they can handle the monthly payments.View image in fullscreenAn electric 2022 Mini Cooper S with 17,400 miles on the clock would cost £256 a month via salary sacrifice.Photograph: Malcolm Haines/AlamyThere are still options for someone whose employer does not offer a salary sacrifice scheme. Carwow’s “Leasey” leasing service, for example, offers used EVs. An electric 2022 Mini Cooper S with 17,400 miles on the clock would cost £256 a month. That is still significantly more than the £209 offer for those able to use an employer’s scheme, but well below the £310 a month (on top of a £3,000 upfront payment) for the equivalent new model bought from Mini directly.Gary Comerford, a consultant who runs theEV Musings podcastfor electric car drivers, says his experience of leasing a used EV is “very smooth” but adds that he would not say it is flawless. He could not do a test drive before committing via Car360, although he had the option to return with no questions asked within the week. He paid a deposit of £1,200 and pays £310 a month for a 2021 Polestar 2.“As long as you can work within your budget it’s quite easy to get a lease,” Comerford says – although he adds that limiting tax benefits to salary sacrifice is unfair to self-employed people like him.View image in fullscreenAfter paying a £1,200 deposit, a 2021 Polestar 2 costs £310 a month.Photograph: ZarkePix/AlamySome optional extras can be included with the car (and can benefit from salary sacrifice tax savings), such as car insurance, home chargers, and even electricity.At the end of the term the choice is generally to either extend your lease or hand the car back, although some companies also offer the ability to buy the car outright. Note though: early returners will probably end up paying an early termination fee (although fees for salary sacrificers are usually waived if they leave they employer through resignation, redundancy or dismissal).If it works for you, and you meet the conditions, used leases make it much easier to drive an EV, says Zenith’s Hughes. “The very, very exciting opportunity is it lowers the price of entry from an affordability perspective,” he says. Zenith’s newly launched used EV salary sacrifice scheme has had “a nice balance of 20% and 40% taxpayers”, he says.Beating depreciationLeasing companies are not offering deals out of the goodness of their hearts. Offering used EVs helps them cope with their least favourite word: depreciation. They bought a load of electric cars a couple of years ago, only for secondhand, or “residual” prices, to drop more than expectedamid slower overall demand for EVs.Leasing companies have a large supply of rapidly depreciating vehicles, says Toby Poston, the BVRLA chief executive. They do not want to sell at a steep loss, so leasing helps solve a problem.View image in fullscreenA 2020 MG ZS. The number of EVs leased in the UK in the second quarter of 2025 is up by 166% on the same period last year, taking the total to 40,600.Photograph: ZarkePix/AlamyHolding on to electric cars means leasing companies can continue to make money from them. The industry’s experience with thousands of electric cars is that there are far fewer breakdowns, compared with equivalent petrol or diesel cars, meaning they are less likely to face huge repair bills as the vehicles age.Hughes expects Zenith’s cars to go through two or even three drivers over eight years before they sell it on – potentially meaning no residual loss whatsoever. (Contrary to one persistent anti-EV claim, meaningful battery degradation is “just not a thing” for the average car, he says. And most EVs come with eight-year manufacturer warranties on batteries, which means leased cars would be covered.)Without costly breakdowns to worry about there is “less potential risk” so it easier to offer leases, Poston says. At the same time, there is “overproduction of cars across the world”, he adds. “The deals you can get now are stupendous.”Explore more on these topicsMotoringElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was also subject to a fraud investigation, but has been told he will not face criminal prosecution.He is accused of using sex workers and accessing adult websites while on shift in May 2022, as former civil servant Louise Casey carried out an independent review into behaviour and culture in the force.The Casey inquiry was commissioned by the mayor ofLondon, Sadiq Khan, after Wayne Couzens was sentenced to a whole life term for the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard, a marketing executive.Couzens, now 52, worked in the Met’s parliamentary and diplomatic protection command. He abducted Everard, 33, in south London in March 2021 as she walked home from a friend’s house, showing her his warrant card before pretending to arrest her for breaching Covid regulations.Everard’s murder ignited a national conversation about misogyny within Britain’s police forces.In March 2023, Casey, a crossbench peer, concluded that the Met was “institutionally misogynistic”.She said: “Sarah Everard’s murder and other horrific crimes perpetrated by serving Met officers against women in London have shone a light on the shocking treatment of, and attitudes towards, women in the Met.“Despite improvements in gender representation and increasingly flexible working practices, women are not treated equally in the workforce, with new women recruits resigning at four times the rate of all probationers; and a third of Met women we surveyed reporting personally experiencing sexism at work, with 12% reporting directly experiencing sexual harassment or assault.”An earlier investigation by the police watchdog, theIndependent Office for Police Conduct(IOPC), found that officers at London’s Charing Cross police station had sent “numerous” messages in which they joked about raping colleagues and visiting sex workers.Last month, an undercover investigation by BBC Panorama alleged that sexist attitudes at the station persisted. One sergeant was filmed giving colleagues graphic accounts of his sex life, despite the objections of some female colleagues. The footage showed him describing a woman he met online as “so fat she had two pussies”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They also warned that it was putting thousands of jobs at risk in the £20bn energy efficiency industry and supply chain.“We welcome the news that you are planning to take action to cut households’ energy bills at the upcoming budget, which is crucial to address cost of living challenges and boost the economy,” the letter said.Almost all external insulation fitted under Tory scheme needs repair or replacing, report findsRead more“However, it is vital that this is not at the expense of investment in energy efficiency measures and low-carbon technologies, which permanently lower households’ bills. While direct bill support provides an immediate way to help struggling households, decarbonising homes through cost-effective upgrades is the best way to sustainably address fuel poverty and reduce costs for all billpayers.”Their warning came after Keir Starmer attended the Cop30 climate conference in Brazil where he said the UK was “really stepping up” by showing leadership on tackling climate breakdown and creating green jobs.Others who have signed the letter includeEnergyUK, the industry body representing Britain’s main energy firms, National Energy Action, Disability Rights UK, the Energy Saving Trust and Greenpeace.In an interview with the Guardian, Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the prime minister, said he wanted to reassure people that the government would not be rowing back on its commitment to green issues and tackling the climate crisis.Those consulted on the plans say the chancellor is particularly looking at reducing or eliminating ECO, under which energy firms help pay for home improvement measures such as insulation and new heating schemes. Last year, the National Audit Office warned offraud and poor qualityin some of the work carried out under the scheme.If the programme is reduced or cut entirely, the energy secretary,Ed Miliband, could choose to reallocate money from the £13bn warm homes plan, much of which is earmarked to pay for subsidies for electric heat pumps. The government decidedas recently as Juneto protect the scheme, but the chancellor is thought to be willing to see it reduced to help bring bills down. The government is separately considering removing 5% VAT from electricity bills to reduce costs.View image in fullscreenThe energy secretary could choose to reallocate money from the £13bn warm homes plan, much of which is earmarked to pay for subsidies for electric heat pumps.Photograph: UrbanImages/AlamyJames Dyson, a senior researcher at E3G, a non-profit that helped coordinate the letter, said the last time the ECO scheme was cut, 10,000 people lost their jobs and millions of families were “left in draughty homes paying astronomical energy bills” as a result.“Cutting ECO could collapse the entire insulation industry, putting thousands of working people out of work in areas of the country that need good, skilled jobs and removing one of the best methods of permanently reducing energy bills for low-income families. It would also rob us of a key tool for lowering carbon emissions in this critical decade for climate action,” he added.Dhara Vyas, the chief executive of Energy UK, also criticised the prospect of changes to the funding of home insulation and energy efficiency, saying it would be a “shortsighted and disastrous move”.“We’ve had ample previous experience showing how knee-jerk cuts to investment in warmer homes have resulted in customers paying billions of pounds more on their energy bills, while also damaging supply chains and businesses with knock-on impacts to investment and job losses.”Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s policy director, said: “Slashing this funding would be the most counter-productive thing the chancellor could do in seeking to reduce energy costs.“Government programmes are in desperate need of reform with stricter regulations to stop shoddy work by cowboy installers, but slashing it will leave millions of households in fuel poverty with cold, damp homes. These levies should not be cut, but paid for through tax, so those with the broadest shoulders pay a fairer share.”Mike Childs, the head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: “It would be a serious betrayal of struggling families for the government to cut the mandatory energy company insulation scheme in order to reduce energy bills. We need homes to be made warmer and energy bills to be cut if we’re to ease hardship and shield people from harm. The chancellor mustn’t give with one hand only to take with the other.”A HM Treasury spokesperson said: “We do not comment on speculation around future changes to tax policy outside of fiscal events. The budget later this month will build stronger foundations to secure Britain’s future and focus on the priorities of working people: cutting waiting lists, cutting the national debt and cutting the cost of living.”It was also reported last night that Reeves will announce a raid on tax breaks on pension contributions in a move that could raise up to £2bn a year.There is currently no limit on how much an employee can pay into their pension before they pay national insurance but, according to a report in the Times, Reeves is expected to cap how much someone’s salary can be sacrificed without paying national insurance at £2,000 a year.The change would mean employees pay 8% on any pension contributions above a certain level, prompting concerns that the cost could then be passed on to workers.Explore more on these topicsEnergy efficiencyEnergyTax and spendingConsumer affairsRachel ReevesBudget 2025newsShareReuse this content"

They said if this happened, the water shortfall would mean taking drastic water use curtailment measures “going beyond hosepipe bans”.Droughts are usually multi-year events. While much of England went into drought this summer, with hosepipe bans across large swathes of the country, things were not as bad as they could have been because it had been a rainy autumn and winter the year before. This meant reservoirs were full and that groundwater – storage of water under the soil – was charged up.But months of record dry weather meant a lot of that water was used, and it has not been replaced, despite roughly average September and October rainfall. Average reservoir storage is at 63.3% compared with the average of 76% for this time of year. Ardingly, in West Sussex, and Clatworthy and Wimbleball in Somerset, are below 30%.Groundwater takes significantly longer than reservoirs to recharge, and the situation in England is still fragile despite recent rainfall; South East Water has applied for a local water restriction order, which would ban some businesses from using water for certain things, such as cleaning buildings and equipment or filling hotel pools.Alastair Chisholm, the director of policy and external affairs at the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management, said: “In UK drought management terms, a second dry winter is when things start to get serious. So Met Office warnings of increased risk of dry spells through an important time of year for recharge of our water resources will ring alarm bells. This, coupled with dry weather next spring and summer will mean more drought orders – more abstraction from rivers when they’re at low levels, more hosepipe bans and likely restrictions on some business water use.”England has a lack of water resilience, with a growing population, higher risks of hot, dry summers and the fact no new major reservoir has been built in more than 30 years. This means that the country is reliant on consistent rainfall to keep taps running, and when we do not get it, rivers have to be sucked dry and hosepipe bans imposed.Chisholm said building new reservoirs was not enough, and that water efficiency measures for businesses and homes could be taken very quickly, for example by stopping leaks, more widespread smart metering and ensuring water-efficient appliances were installed in new homes.He said: “Whilst government has been fixated on announcing new reservoirs it’s been far less proactive or ambitious on its water efficiency policies. Reservoirs will take decades to build whilst water users can be supported to reduce their consumption quickly. This is nonsensical. It’s not an either-or question on these. We’re a densely populated nation facing increasingly extreme and variable weather, with growing water demand to support new homes, datacentres, food production and more. Without new reservoirs and leakage reductions alongside ambitious water efficiency and domestic or development-level rainwater harvesting and reuse, droughts are likely to become a growing problem for the UK.”The drought is expected to continue into next year. If that happens, and we have a spring and summer with below-average rainfall, England runs a risk of running out of water.The Met Office’s chief meteorologist, Dr Will Lang, said: “This year has been characterised by notable rainfall deficits across much of England. By 28 October, provisional data shows England had only 61% of its expected annual rainfall, when we’d normally have about 80% at this time of the year (based on 1991–2020 average).“Looking ahead, there is an increased risk of dry spells through late autumn and early winter and regional differences in rainfall continue to be likely. Without sustained and widespread precipitation, a consistent recovery from drought remains uncertain.”Water minister Emma Hardy said: “We are closely monitoring all regions – especially those still experiencing drought – and working with the NationalDroughtGroup and water companies to maintain supplies. We face increasing pressure on our water resources. That is why this government is taking decisive action, including the development of nine new reservoirs to help secure long-term water resilience.”Hydrologists are alarmed by the extent of the drought and the very real possibility it could cause problems next summer. The strategy of waiting for significant rain carries big risks.Prof Hannah Cloke, a professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, said: “We now need exceptional rainfall all winter just to recover. Even with recent improvements in some areas, many drought orders and hosepipe bans are staying in place. That tells you how serious the water resource deficit really is. Some reservoirs are sitting at less than a third of their capacity, which is alarming at this point in the year.“With climate change drying Britain out for longer periods in the future, we need to adapt to the climate we have now. Building new reservoirs will help, but we also need much more management of demand, and a more ambitious plan for water resilience.”Dr Megan Klaar, associate professor in the School of Geography at the University of Leeds, said: “We know that climate change is making rainfall patterns more variable, with longer dry periods and more intense wet periods. This growing volatility makes it harder to plan or foresee with certainty making the reliance on rain to arrive ‘just in time’ an unreliable strategy.”There are actions the country could take now, she said: “Nature-based solutions including restoring wetlands, reforesting catchments and improving soil health all help retain water in the landscape and slow its movement through river systems. Households can also help by reducing water use, especially during dry periods, and slowing and storing water during high rainfall by replacing impermeable surfaces like concrete and installing water butts to collect rainwater from roofs which stores water locally and reduces runoff during heavy rainfall.”Explore more on these topicsDroughtWaternewsShareReuse this content"

But all seven were junior ministers under Starmer, losing their jobs in September’s reshuffle.Thomas, who was minister for Africa under Gordon Brown and served as a business minister for Starmer, said that in the earlier role he had seen the impact of the Global Fund’s work first-hand, for example mothers able to protect their unborn children from HIV infection because of antiretroviral drugs provided by the Switzerland-based organisation.“These were not abstract statistics. They were healthy babies who would not have survived without this assistance. The question now is whether we have the will to see this through,” he said.“Since 2002, this remarkable partnership has saved 70 million lives and built resilient health systems across the world. We face a stark choice: stand firm and maintain our commitment or retreat from one of the world’s greatest health achievements.“The cost of retreat would be devastating. A 20% cut to Britain’s pledge would result in nearly 6m preventable infections, putting the most vulnerable – especially children – at serious risk. Such a move would not only be a moral failure but a strategic one.”Thomas highlighted the UK’s decision earlier this yearto cut supportfor another major international aid project, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was, however, more than had beenfeared by manyin the aid sector after the decision by the UK government to cut its foreign aid commitment from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%, which willthen fallto 0.3% in 2027, with speculation ministers might have increased the sum due to political pressure and media coverage.The reduction in Gavi funding was “a troubling signal of retreat”, Thomas said, adding: “We are moving in the wrong direction, precisely when we must defend international cooperation and multilateralism most vigorously.”He went on: “But this is about more than health. It’s about Britain’s national security. Healthy communities that can learn, work and thrive create stable, resilient societies. Tackling disease in the poorest countries alleviates the conditions that fuel instability, displacement and conflict.”Other Labour MPshave highlightedthe particular risk over HIV and Aids, given developments such as the slashing of US aid funding. Another private letter saw 43 backbenchers write to Starmer on this.Aid groups say a cut to UK money for the Global Fund would risk overturning years of progress in combating the diseases, particularly after the collapse in US aid.Last month, polling commissioned by a major aid groupfound that62% of Britons believe the government should maintain or increase its support for the Global Fund. The polling was conducted by More in Common for the One Campaign.A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “The UK continues work with the Global Fund to play a significant role in the global response to fight disease globally. Our work has contributed to saving 70 million lives and reducing the combined death rate from HIV, TB and Malaria by 63%.“We remain firmly committed to tackling global health challenges, not only because it is right, but to help deliver the plan for change in the UK by supporting global stability and growth.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

TheUK’s dealincluded a baseline tariff on all goods of 10% and a 25% one for steel, whilethe EU agreedrates of 25% and 50% respectively.However, exporters say the new derivative tariffs make a mockery of these agreements, because they mean many goods could soon face paying the higher rate on their steel content – on top of the baseline rate on the cost of the whole item.The latest requests for tariffs on products with steel elements came before a 21 October deadline set by the US commerce department, the second consultation in three months.‘Existential threat’: what do EU’s 50% steel tariffs mean for UK industry?Read moreExperts said companies asking for products to be added to the first list of steel derivative tariffs in August had a near 100% success rate, fuelling fears that most of the items now being proposed would make the latest list and hit exporters in December or January.Among those submitting requests to the US commerce department are Guardian Bikes in Indiana, the tomato-canning company Red Gold, firms making steel wheels for trucks, a mattress spring company and manufacturers of 200 industrial machines used in everything from tunnelling, printing and flooring.One of Europe’s biggest farm machinery firms halts US exports over ‘hidden’ tariffsRead moreIn an 11-page plea to the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, Guardian Bikes said the US bike industry “was lost” owing to 11m bicycles being imported in 2024.Its letter blamed China for the “severe competition”, but if its request for inclusion in the second steel derivatives tariffs list was accepted, the import duty would apply globally and could affect companies such as Brompton in the UK or high performance bike brands such as Pinarello or Bianchi from Italy.Red Gold, which cans tomatoes from 43 farms in Indiana, Ohio and Michigan, made a similar case. In its 12-page letter to Lutnick, it complained it was facing tariffs of 25% on tinplate steel imported from the UK and 50% on steel from elsewhere used in its own can production.However, foreign businesses that sold finished tin-plated cans directly to the US paid “no comparable tariff” and were able to undercut domestic can producers, Red Gold pointed out, urging a steel derivative levy for the sector.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They complained that China was “flooding the market” with low-cost commercial cookware, putting Chinese products at an “unfair” advantage.George Riddell, a senior adviser at the advisory firm Flint Global, said the latest demands were confirming European fears that the US would now operate an “expansionist” policy for its tariff list.He said: “The US have taken a very liberal, expansive approach to including new requests with almost zero requests for inclusion rejected last time round.”Riddell added that the move spoke to “the uncertainty in the relationship with the UK and the EU despite having these deals”.A decision on which products are included for the new batch of tariffs is expected to be made in December, 60 days after the deadline for requests.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The office stopped short of indicating exactly who made the agency aware of the video.Studies through the years have attributed cellphone use while driving to an increase in the potential for serious crashes – or worse.A screen recording of a TikTok livevideostreamed on Monday was then published on the social media app on Friday morning, and it showed user “Tea_Tyme_3” speaking at her phone before a loud thud. The live stream was quickly disconnected after the thud prompted her to curse, a child to ask what happened and someone else to ask the driver if she was OK.The user, it has beenreported, has since changed her name and made her account private, deleting the biography section in which she had previously described being in Zion, Illinois.Athreadon the Reddit platform separately was started by a user who described seeing the video when it was livestreamed and wondering whether something deadly had happened. News stories later confirmed that user’s worst fears, as the user put it.“It feels like I accidentally witnessed the moment someone’s life was taken and now I can’t stop thinking about the victim, and how avoidable it was,” the user said. “I just keep replaying that sound in my head.”The user also said the person driving while onTikTok“wasn’t paying attention to the road because she was reading comments and grinning at her phone”.“A man died because she wanted attention from a livestream,” the Reddit user also wrote.Monday’s crash occurred at about 5.30pm, police said. Darren Lucas, 59, of nearby Beach Park, was unresponsive after being hit, and he was later pronounced dead at a hospital emergency room from blunt force injuries inflicted on him by the crash, the local coroner’s office said in a statement.Lucas’s son-in-law, Chris King,toldthe Lake and McHenry County Scanner that news of the video made his family “hold our loss tighter to our hearts”.“We … will continue to pray for what the driver must be going through,” King reportedly said. “We are trying to find our ways to live, without someone we cherished so much.”Explore more on these topicsChicagoTikToknewsShareReuse this content"

Iranian police said Sarlak had “died by suicide”.But anti-government media and activists say the timing of the death, so soon after he made a public outcry against the government, raises suspicions about whether he was killed for his views.Hours before Sarlak’s body was found, a video posted on his social media account showed him burning the photo of the Islamic Republic’s leader, Ali Khamenei.The furore presents a threat to the regime, with Sarlak becoming an icon for activists, many of whom have followed him by burning Khamenei’s photo in solidarity and posting the videos online.Suspicions have grown after a widely circulated video showed Sarlak’s father reportedly saying at the site of his son’s death: “They killed my champion here.”An off-screen voice in the same clip was heard saying he was “surrounded and shot”.Later, in a televised interview aired by state media, Sarlak’s father requested people to “not pay attention to what’s circulating on social media and to let the judicial authorities handle the matter”. Activists have called the video forced and said the family was under surveillance.View image in fullscreenIran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Photograph: Iranian Supreme Leader’S Office/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockHundreds of mourners who attended Sarlak’s funeral on Monday demonstrated and chanted slogans such as “Death to the dictator” and “Death to Khamenei”.In the clip shared on Instagram by Sarlak hours before his death, a recording is audible in the background of a speech by Iran’s former shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In 1979, Pahlavi fled Iran, with the Islamic government taking power the same year. Some anti-government activists are nostalgic for the monarchy.On another one of his last Instagram stories, he wrote: “How long should we endure humiliation, poverty and being ridden over? This is the moment to show yourself, young people. These clerics are nothing but a stream for Iran’s youth to cross.”Sarlak was a student of aviation and an amateur boxer who was a fan of the Iranian wrestler Ebrahim Eshaghi. Eshaghi told the Guardian Sarlak had contacted him on Instagram shortly before he died. “He sent me a message that his life was in danger and that if anything were to happen to him, we should be his voice.”Eshaghi, who lives in Germany, said that since his death several of Sarlak’s close friends said they believed he had been killed by the intelligence services.“He loved life and had an upcoming boxing competition in two weeks. He loved the Pahlavi family and supported them. The regime also imprisons or kills young, athletic people, something it has been doing for years.”Sarlak’s death has reignited some of the same pain and outrage that emerged after the death ofMahsa Jina Amini, a Kurdish woman who was arrested by the country’s “morality police” and died in custody in 2022,igniting huge, countrywide protests.Child bride faces execution in Iran unless she pays £80,000 in ‘blood money’Read moreBahar Ghandehari, director of advocacy at the US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran, said it was notable that people inside Iran were burning photos publicly, “despite the fact that insulting or burning the supreme leader’s photo is considered a serious offence, carrying grave risks of arrest, imprisonment, harsh sentences, torture and even death”.In one video shared with the Guardian on the condition of anonymity, two men burned images of Khamenei, saying: “We burn this photo for justice, for freedom, for hope. I am Omid Sarlak. Death to Khamenei and long live the shah.”The editor of the Amirkabir Newsletter, an Iranian student movement website, said so far students have not held any protests in universities over Sarlak’s death “because the atmosphere on campuses remains heavily securitised”.The editor, who has no public profile to protect them and their staff while operating inside Iran, said they believed there would be “serious protests” this year or early next year. “Day by day, people’s anger over the killing of thousands of innocent people is growing, and they are distressed and upset,” they said.Separately, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled oldest son of the former shah has called Sarlak a hero and a brave soul who stood against the “oppression of the Islamic Republic and sacrificed his life for Iran’s freedom”.Explore more on these topicsIranProtestActivismMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt added in an email: “That would be a beautiful name, as it was President Trump who made the rebuilding of the new stadium possible.”Fox Sports drops Mark Sanchez permanently and hires Drew Brees as NFL analystRead moreThe Commanders declined comment, but team officials say they have spent several days preparing for Trump’s visit to Sunday’s home game against the Detroit Lions, where informal conversations about the stadium are expected. No formal talks have taken place.Trump’s push comes as the team prepares to return to the RFK Stadium site, which served as Washington’s home from 1961 through 1996. The new 65,000-seat domed venue, part of one of the gigantic mixed-use development projectsthat have become the vogue in American sports, is scheduled to open in 2030.Although the Commanders own the rights to sell a commercial stadium sponsorship, they cannot unilaterally decide to name the venue after an individual. The land is controlled by the National Park Service, and the District of Columbia Council will lease the stadium to the team under legislation it approved in September.“The team doesn’t have the authority. They can’t name the stadium on their own,” said a source with direct knowledge of the process. “The city would be involved, and the Park Service would be involved.”Those layers of approval give Trump significant leverage. As president, he oversees the federal agencies responsible for environmental and land-use approvals at the RFK site – bottlenecks he could slow or block if he chooses. “He has cards to play,” said one source. “He can make it very difficult to get this stadium built unless people align with him on the name.”Sources say Trump is not seeking to buy naming rights or have a private donor do so. He wants the stadium to carry his name as a tribute, similar to Chicago’s Soldier Field or Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin.The broader RFK project is the largest economic development effort in Washington’s history. The Commanders will invest $2.7bn, plus cost overruns, while the district will contribute $1bn. The redevelopment will include housing, retail and a sports complex across 174 acres.Trump has repeatedly waded into Commanders politics. In July, he threatened to block the stadium unless the team restored its former nickname, the Redskins,which was dropped in 2020. The Harris group has shown no interest in revisiting the name, though some fans continue to push for it.Trump is scheduled to attend Sunday’s game as Harris’s guest and is expected to take part in military appreciation ceremonies at half-time.Explore more on these topicsWashington CommandersNFLDonald TrumpWashington DCUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

One importer said delays were adding £200 of costs to each load.There are also warnings that trees and shrubs are repeatedly being damaged when unloaded and reloaded on to lorries during the inspection process.Since Brexit, deliveries of animal and plant products between Britain and the EU have required paperwork and been subject to stringent inspections at the border as a part ofsanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) controls.All plant products rated as high or medium risk – including bedding plants, cut flowers and bark – are inspected, with the checks aimed at enhancing Britain’s biosecurity and preventing harmful plant and animal diseases from entering the country.However, several traders said they were facing significant problems during border controls at Sevington, including trucks stuck there for several days before being released.A recent shipment of olive trees from a nursery in Pistoia in Italy, destined for Premier Plants near Chelmsford in Essex, was held up for five days, according to the company’s co-founder Karl Clark.“It’s frustrating and adds cost. We have been importing plants from Italy for over 20 years and never had these sorts of problems beforeBrexit,” Clark said.John Davidson, the finance director at Tom Brown Wholesale, which brings daily deliveries of cut flowers and plants into the UK from the Netherlands through Sevington, said delays at the border post “go in waves”.“Three weeks ago we had three delays in a row, but the following week was fine,” he said. “An hour or two delay can really set us back in our business.”The latestdelaysat Sevington come at a busy time for importing plants, following a lull during the warm summer months when larger shrubs and trees tend not to be exported from the EU.Premier Plants, which supplies landscape designers, developers and local councils, said recurring delays at the border risked making the company unreliable, while also adding costs. Clark estimates delays add an extra £200 to each load, on top of transport charges and administrative expenses.“Luckily, at this time of year the delays are not too disastrous, but you can imagine what it is like in the summer; the plants are going to cook or dry out,” Clark said.Marco Innocenti’s family-run nursery in Tuscany is one of Premier Plants’ suppliers and delivers to the UK twice a week.When one of its most recent shipments arrived with customers after checks in Sevington, some potted plants inside the lorry were upside down, while others had broken branches. Innocenti called this “unacceptable” and blamed the damage on the truck being “unloaded and reloaded carelessly”.“We cannot continue this way,” he said. “The authorities must recognise the seriousness of this issue.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Companies importing goods subject to SPS controls are required to pay a “common user charge” for using the facility, which is £29 for each species in a consignment, whether it is checked or not, and is capped at £145 for each delivery.Following construction, the facility was described as a “white elephant” and wasnot used for some timeafter the UK repeatedlydelayed the introductionof physical checks on plant and animal products from the EU.However, these finally began in April 2024 and traders have reported a significant increase in items requiring inspection in recent months, since the announcement ofKeir Starmer’s “reset” dealwith the EU.Industry body the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) and many plant traders say an SPS agreement with the EU thatcould remove the need for border checksas part of the “reset” cannot come soon enough, although this may not be implemented until 2027.“The last few weeks have not been good at Sevington,” one logistics company told the Guardian. “Some companies are struggling with the costs and with damage. In the end some exporters are maybe going to say ‘sorry, we give up on the UK.’”The outsourcing firm Sodexo was awarded the £184.5m contract by the government to run Sevington for three years from July 2023 on behalf of HM Revenue and Customs, and is also responsible for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) border control posts located on the site.The Swiss-headquartered logistics company Kuehne + Nagel handles vehicle inspection at Sevington under a deal with Sodexo. Kuehne + Nagel and Sodexo did not respond to requests for comment.The government is reviewing its procedures at border control posts, the Guardian understands. The government is also understood to claim that any complaints about damage are investigated, with a response provided to the trader as soon as possible.A government spokesperson said: “Protecting UK biosecurity remains one of our key priorities. We are working with border control posts to ensure they operate effectively, and with traders to ensure checks are completed efficiently, swiftly and without significant delays.“We are focused on negotiating an SPS deal that could add up to £5.1bn a year to our economy, by cutting costs and reducing red tape for British producers and retailers.”Explore more on these topicsBrexitHMRCEuropean UnionInternational tradeKentEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They rushed away the cupboards and chairs, his shirts and socks. Ragpickers took the rusted appliances. A young woman, the guitar. I remember my father practising Greensleeves over and over. Or did I make that up? It was raining, but my eyes stayed dry. No time for tears – that’s how fast an empire is dismantled. Another landscape gone.I was already writing about loneliness, about Sonia and Sunny, who meet on the night train to their respective grandparents’ homes, journeying into their past – the past being a kind of home to us all. I was already sensing the restorative depth of their bond, as well as its fragility.Sonia and Sunny’s relationship unfolds over years and continents – across the United States, Italy, Mexico, India. As they meet and part, negotiating a world without a centre, I wrote about the rifts between nations, between races, genders, religions, all as a kind of loneliness. I wrote about the spaces where news stories disconcertingly changed form, where people made unknowable creatures of themselves. And about shadowlands occupied by phantoms and nightmares that anticipated that a dark undercurrent of history might at any moment explode into renewed violence. I wrote about longing for the vanishing natural world, the magical creatures that forests and oceans once concealed. But I was also interested in loneliness shifting shape into a quiet that is peace after the war is over. A sought-out solitude during a time of transformation. An exquisite artistic loneliness. A discovery of the dignity and privacy of one’s individual being.Everything I experienced during the years of writing was swept into the river of this book – diaries, newspaper articles – and, at one point, my book lay in pieces and I struggled to hold it together. Wherever I went, my ungainly tome came along, weighing down my luggage. I lugged it in market bags, to be mailed from various locations to my home in New York City, which was filling up with paper.Then a wondrous coincidence happened (in my experience life always gives you what you need to write your book). The Italian artist, Francesco Clemente, who has worked in India for decades, asked me to write an introduction to an exhibition of his paintings, a meditative and mystical series that powerfully conjured India. His watercolours were in constant flux, suspended between wakefulness and dream. As a gift, he sent me one of his paintings, a demon god without a face. It might have come out of a primeval forest. In this faceless, eyeless deity that I kept beside my writing table, I found the visual symbol I needed to unite the many stories, to think of them in terms of who is in whose purview, who is captured and controlled by whose gaze – when it comes to the power divides I mentioned, when it comes to journalism, when it comes to art, when it comes to love. The unseen world, the shadow world, together with the plot of Sonia and Sunny’s long unresolved romance, together became The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny.Ben MarkovitsThe Rest of Our LivesView image in fullscreenIt started with the opening lines, about a man whose wife had an affair when the kids were small. I was working on something else at the time, but I wrote the first few pages one afternoon and then put them aside. Maybe a year later, I had another look. My own kids were getting older and I wanted to write about a certain period of family life coming to an end. Those opening pages seemed like a way in: a guy drops his daughter at university and instead of going home afterward, keeps driving.There were other things about the idea that interested me. The fact that it wasn’t the man who had the affair; also, his feeling that, I haven’t done anything wrong, and yet here I am. The last sentence I’d written said something like: even when things smoothed over, the best I could claim was a C- marriage, which makes it hard to score much higher than a B overall on the rest of your life. This seems reasonable enough but also clearly the wrong way of thinking about it, and I thought that tension might make a good basis for a novel.By the time I finished the first draft, both Tom, my narrator, and I knew what we had, and I was going through chemoMeanwhile, odd medical stuff had started happening to me: sudden exhaustion while jogging, random head rushes, a swollen face in the morning. My GP couldn’t find anything, but I put these symptoms in the book as another symbol of middle age, the gradual decline that you can’t quite understand. By the time I finished the first draft, both Tom, my narrator, and I knew what we had, and I was going through chemo. Obviously this shaped the book – not just the plot but how I felt about the story. My original idea was to leave Tom completely abandoned at the end, but the more I wrote, and the sicker I got, the less that made sense. Being sick focuses a lot of attention on you; it also changes how people feel about you, if only temporarily.One of the problems of road trip novels is that your hero is usually running away from the source of the story: in this case, an unhappy marriage. But it occurred to me that I often find it easier to talk to other people in my head when they’re not around – you keep the conversation going, sometimes more honestly and lovingly than you can in their presence. In other words, even though Tom was driving away from his wife, this could still be a novel about reconciling themselves, if not to each other then to the next stage of their lives, which in one way or another they both have to face.Susan ChoiFlashlightView image in fullscreenI recently saw Eleanor Catton ask Sarah Moss, of her latest work: “What is the earliest ancestor of this book?” I thought this was such a great question because it gets at how the genesis of a book can sometimes take place long before any actual writing, or even recognition that there might one day be writing, takes place. The earliest, prehistoric, fish-that-still-hasn’t-grown-legs ancestor of this book is a childhood trip I took to Japan with my parents in the late 1970s. I had never been out of the US, and Japan at that time was hardly westernised as it is now, so the culture shock was profound. I never forgot that trip, and a long time later when I’d started writing I wished I could write about it, but although the trip had been life-changing for me, nothing had happened that would seize the interest of a reader.Jump forward two decades, and I’m leaning against the kitchen counter in my first New York City apartment, reading my housemate’s New York Times. “Defector’s tale reminds Japan of a lost girl” catches my eye. I still haven’t published my first book, let alone learned any writerly habits such as paying attention to possible ideas or even making note of them.The articlekept my attention from start to finish. It was about a Japanese schoolgirl who had vanished into thin air while walking home from badminton practice. Her disappearance had taken place the year before my family’s time in Japan, and she’d been just a handful of years older than me. These weren’t particularly remarkable coincidences, but they kept her in my mind.Jump forward another two decades plus, and I’m sitting on my back deck gazing into the unusually clear spring sky, reading Dickens, which seems very fitting somehow for the terrifying pandemic that has upended life around the globe, and trying to work out whether my idea – to write about that dreamily recalled Japan of my childhood, but from the point of view of a very different child, one subjected to catastrophe – could possibly work. Whether out of perversity or as a sort of warding-off of misfortune, I often find myself imagining something familiar – like my own childhood journey – fed through a fantasy machine of worst-case scenarios, so that the old familiar material comes out the other side warped beyond recognition. Could I hurl thunderbolts of the extraordinary on to a childhood landscape of the ordinary? The actual thunderbolt I was considering seemed almost too thunderous for fiction, and I got stuck again. “This is too outlandish,” I discouraged myself. I decided to cheat, and write about my young protagonistpost-thunderbolt, without owning up to what the thunderbolt had been. (This is a great hack for when you’re stuck while writing fiction: skip ahead.) The resulting short story, Flashlight, came out in late 2020. After that, I was committed – I really had no choice but to go through with the thunderbolt, the result being Flashlight the book.Andrew MillerThe Land in WinterView image in fullscreenThe origins of a novel are quickly covered over. Rule of thumb says it started months or even years before you think it did. The new idea, prodded, looks a lot like an older idea you liked but didn’t know what to do with. Perhaps it was weather that came first, something visual, a landscape blurred by snowfall. Then, around that image, or rising out of it, a time and place: 1962, a village outside Bristol, the village never named but reconstructed from my memories of where I spent the first years of my life. And somewhere inside this welling up of images and possibilities, inhabiting them as a kind of armature, an anecdote of my mother’s, a very bare story about the day she and my doctor father ran across the field to an emergency at the farmhouse on the other side.Pretty much from the off, I had a good feeling about the book, about the writing. The previous novel had been an anxious struggle. Now, with The Land in Winter, I felt suddenly liberated. I didn’t worry much about themes. As long as there was a good forward energy, I was happy just to follow it. One of my guiding intentions – a central one – was to let my four main characters have the freedom to see out their parts in whatever way was right for them. No one was going to be shoved around by plot. As ever, there were moments of doubt – a book without a crisis is one I’d start to worry about – but the writing was often joyful and there are no bite marks in the manuscript (there are in some).I wanted the book to keep a certain wildness, even a certain oddness. You cannot write if you do not trust your intuitionIn the summer of 2023 I sent it off. I thought I was finished, more or less, but my editor, with a cooler eye, could see there was still much to be done. Things I’d believed were present in the manuscript had not been visible to him at all. So began a year of intensive rewrites. Not to tidy up – I wanted the book to keep a certain wildness, even a certain oddness – but to make it a little more shapely, and perhaps just to understand it better, its preoccupation with how big our lives might be, and what a bigger life might mean, the consequences of that. Handing it over a second time, I had the snow-blindness most writers experience at the end of a long project. It’s hard to know any more what you’ve made. The affirmations of this spring and summer have been deeply reassuring because they tell me that what I felt about the work – that freedom and that joy – was not delusional. You cannot write if you do not trust your intuition.Katie KitamuraAuditionView image in fullscreenAudition has a simple premise. The narrator is an actress in rehearsal for a difficult new play. She is successful, happily married, and settled in her life. Then, a young man approaches her and tells her that he believes he is her son. From that point, two narratives unfurl – two versions of events, two distinct realities. In one, the young man is a stranger. In the other, he is in fact her son.I can pinpoint the origins of the novel quite precisely. Some years ago, I came upon a headline, reading: “A stranger told me he was my son.” I immediately knew this was material I wanted to work with in some way. I was careful not to click on the link and read the article, in part because I wanted to sit with the strangeness of the headline. On the one hand, I was fascinated by the idea that a single encounter could change everything you understand about yourself and your place in the world.But I was also interested in the illogical nature of the headline. The two terms, “a stranger” and “my son”, seemed diametrically opposed, even mutually exclusive. I didn’t want the mystery of that opposition to be resolved. The article would, I felt sure, contain a perfectly plausible explanation for the mysterious headline. Perhaps the author of the article had placed a child into adoption. Or perhaps the stranger in question had a mental health disorder.Neither of those options felt particularly satisfying to me as a novelist. In them, all the wonderful mystery of the headline seemed to drain away. Some time later, I went for a walk with a friend and I told her about the headline – about how beguiling I found it, and how I wasn’t entirely sure how to enter into the world that I could sense hovering just behind the headline. She asked me to repeat the sentence, and then she said: “But that’s just parenting. Every time my son comes home from college, it’s like a stranger has walked into the apartment.”After that conversation with my friend, I had a sense of what I wanted to try to do in the novel. I wanted to write about how many universal experiences – of love, of motherhood – can feel like two mutually exclusive things at the time. I never clicked on that headline, but now I wonder if the story behind it was not a story about adoption, or about delusion, or about a hoax of some kind – all ideas that I had pondered and played around with. I wonder if instead it told a very human and very simple story about the long process through which a child must necessarily grow up to become a stranger to their own parents – about both the satisfactions and the devastations of that experience.David SzalayFleshView image in fullscreenFlesh was conceived in the shadow of failure. In the autumn of 2020 I abandoned a novel I had been working on for nearly four years. This was obviously not an easy decision. It represented the writing-off of a huge investment of time, hope, energy and emotion. A lot of work had been done. I had written over 100,000 words. But by that autumn I had long had the sense that the thing wasn’t working. The struggle to make it work was becoming anguished. It was with a feeling of exhausted relief, more than anything else, that I finally just binned it, resolving to have a good night’s sleep, and start again the next morning with a blank sheet of paper, or at least a new Word document.At that point I was about a year away from the date by which my publishers and I had agreed that I would deliver a new book. I had, in other words, one year or slightly less in which to write a novel from scratch. The pressure of that did get to me. After a few weeks of staring at a blank screen, at a blinking cursor, it was obvious that I would need to ask for more time, and I did.It wasn’t a problem.Still, I was dogged by self-doubt. Dogged by the feeling that while it might be sort of OK to abandon one half-finished novel, it would be disastrous – for me, psychologically – to abandon two in succession. I wasn’t sleeping well. I was becoming depressed. The greatest difficulty, in a way, was just deciding what to write about. What specific story to tell. Where to start. In a way, I wished that someone would tell me what to do, what to write about. There was no one to do that, though. I was on my own, in what felt quite a lot like an anxiety dream.I made myself start with a few simple ideas. (One of the main problems with my previous effort was that it had been too intricate, too fiddly.) I decided that I would write something that was partly English and partly Hungarian. And that the story would somehow express the feeling I had that our existence is a physical experience before it is anything else, that all of its other aspects proceed from that physicality, and of course finally return to it too when we ourselves return to being what Auden memorably called “irresponsible matter”.Those two ideas, if they can even be called that, were the fixed points with which I started the new work. They were the seed from which it grew.The Booker prize will be announced on 10 November. Buy all six Booker prize-shortlisted books for £75, saving over £28, atguardianbookshop.com.

Doing it because you watchedThe Big Lebowskiis probably even worse. But as I faced up to what would be my eighth year in an IT role, I watched Jeff Bridges meandering his way through the chaos of life in a dressing gown. And I found myself thinking: maybe the Dude had it figured out.For most of my working life, my identity has been strongly bolstered by work: doing well career-wise felt like evidence of my utility and respectability (despite the fact no one ever really understood what my job was anyway). And, like most millennials, I’d felt exceptionally lucky to eventually get a grad job out of university at all, especially one that paid more than a “living wage”. On top of that, as a second generation immigrant, I’d been repeatedly told from a young age that being jobless is a terrible state of affairs.I had been unhappy for some time, but leaving without a new role to go to had always seemed totally unthinkable. But life has a funny way of telling you when you’re no longer where you should be; against my will, I was moved to another department, with a nightmare boss. I then got another role where the colleagues were lovely, but the job felt deeply uncreative and uninteresting. Shortly after, senior leadership began talking about job cuts – it was clear we were expected to do just as much with even less.There was something deeply philosophical about my sudden affection for the filmWhen two years earlier I’d watched the Coen Brothers’ 1998 classic The Big Lebowski, I’d spent much of it scrolling on my phone and then stupidly wondering why I wasn’t finding the film particularly interesting. But this summer, facing a dreaded project that I had almost no passion for, and with little else to distract me, I watched it properly for the first time. I was completely captivated. I watched it every day for a week, read bits of the script and scoured the internet for any half-decent podcasts about it, so I could figure out why a film that seemed so ridiculous also meant so much to me.A lot of people have described encountering “Dude-ism” as a quasi-religious experience, and there was certainly something philosophical about my sudden affection for the film. The attitude of Jeff Bridges’s bowling-obsessed slacker the Dude is to “take it easy” in a chaotic world that is constantly trying to push him into urgency and action. One of his antagonists, the philanthropist known as “the Big Lebowski”, represents the absurdity of modern, capitalist life, screaming “get a job sir!” and “the bums will always lose!” The Dude is treated by most as an unemployed waster against the backdrop of the 90s economic boom. But by the end of the film it’s difficult not to believe that the Dude is the one who’s really rich in life. He keeps his inner tranquility, despite all the madness around him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The final straw came in a meeting with a manager, where I was being encouraged to learn more skills for a role from which I was already mentally checking out. “What would the Dude do?” I asked myself. I already had my answer.Not everyone initially thought it was a great idea. “But what if your boiler broke down?” my mum exclaimed, having anxiously predicted any little thing that could go awry. Still, my mind was made up. I handed in my notice with nothing in particular lined up and an acceptance that life is full of “strikes and gutters”.One of the most strikingly beautiful aspects of The Big Lebowski is the bowling alley the Dude goes to, a space of habitual calm and simplicity. Since leaving I’ve reimmersed myself more in those small rituals of peace, repetition and community; cooking a meal from scratch in peace and quiet, grabbing a coffee with a friend to talk about nothing much at all. Outside the demands of full-time work, I’ve been able to remember what’s really important in life.I’m not exactly living like the Dude; after all I still have a mortgage to pay. For now, I’m living off the savings I built up from my old job, a small income from the media and education platform I’m continuing to fundraise for, and bits of journalism work on the side.I know much of that is a privilege – but I’m grateful to have the choice to live at a slower pace, on my own terms. And if you still think my decision to be jobless was a bad idea, well that’s just, like, your opinion, man.Share your experienceShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Can it avoid the fate of other once-mighty reality juggernauts?Gwilym MumfordSat 8 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Nov 2025 02.03 ESTShareThat’s it then. The curiously pristine SUVs are back in the garage, the cloaks are off to the dry cleaners and your favourite hits of the 80s and 90s are safe, for a few months at least, from thoseabsurdly melodramatic cover treatments. Yes, The Celebrity Traitors is over, having served up a finale that had just the right amount of intrigue, double-crossing and slack-jawed looks to camera from the terminally outwitted. We won’t ruin things here for anyone who hasn’t watched it yet, but for a full spoiler-filled debrief you can read Lucy Mangan’s review of last night’s dramahere.It was a fitting capstone to a remarkably successful first Celebrity Traitors outing. Fears that its big names might be too media-trained or overly deferential to one another – or just lacking the ruthlessness and desperation of their civilian equivalents, who actually need the win a fair bit more than the celebs do – proved unfounded. The show’s core appeal was still there, but in a supersized state. The casting managed to be preposterously starry – featuring at least half a dozen people who wouldn’t usually go within a 10-mile radius of a reality TV show – but also carefully consistent with the civvy edition’s usual mix of personality types. More broadly, the Traitors franchise is now in its imperial phase; a ratings hit in apost-ratings era, a format that it feels like everyone is watching and talking about, even if they’re not.But here we should probably insert a warning from history – history in this case meaning “two days ago on Channel 4”. Did you know thatThe Great British Bake Offcrowned its 16th winner on Tuesday? If you didn’t, you can hardly be accused of living under a rock. There was barely an echo of the breathless, news-alert coverage that the series used to attract, and overnight ratings for this currentbunrun have been the lowest since its move to Channel 4 (and the lowest altogether since those early experimental series on the BBC with those infuriating cutaway segments on the history of suet pudding or whatnot).View image in fullscreenWho won, who cares? … the finalists in the most recent season of Bake Off.Photograph: Laura Palmer/Channel 4I don’t mean to have a dig at a redoubtable reality institution that, having launched just after the coalition government was formed, is now on its sixth prime minister. Bake Off is clearly still valued by Channel 4; those ratings, though low by the show’s standards, tower over the rest of the network’s output. But it does illustrate how perilously quickly a reality franchise can fade from view. Reality TV has a raw deal in this sense. With most scripted series (excluding soaps or procedurals like CSI) a limited shelf life is baked in, even encouraged. Reality TV, though, is expected to continue indefinitely – and then we inevitably lose interest in it, often due more to overfamiliarity than any major fault of its makers. Think of any reality format – the traffic-stopping, thinkpiece-prompting sensation that was Love Island, say – and it’s probably experienced a similar boom and bust. (I’m a Celebrity … and Strictly are curious exceptions – though the sheenseems to be coming off the latter.) All that can be done is to keep those boom times going a little longer, season by season.It’s certainly boom time for The Traitors, but the pitfalls are obvious. The episodes’ daily table-murder structure is vulnerable to feeling repetitive. The usual response to that fear from producers would be to introduce twists or MacGuffins – last season’s Seer power would be an example of the latter – which has the risk of making the series feel overly engineered or manipulated. And there’s the danger of contestants getting a little too familiar with how the game is played – though actually that has been a benefit to the celebrity series, withJonathan Rossusing his knowledge of the show’s many international formats to inform his Traitorly behaviour.But the biggest threat to the Traitors franchise is surely overexposure. Buried at the end of last night’s finale was an atmospheric, though essentially information-free, trail for the regular, original-flavour Traitors, coming soon on BBC One. It’s unclear how soon, but going by previous years it should be back as soon as the start of January. That’s an awful lot of Traitors in a short time for a show that had previously only occupied three nights a week for two months once a year. Other shows have doubled upand paid the price. Will viewers happily readjust to civvy Traitors, or will it feel underwhelming with the memory of Alan Carr and the other hyper-charismatic celeb traitors and faithfuls still fresh?These are good problems to have though, and producers Studio Lambert have talented people on staff to solve them. Season four of the series proper was filmed just a few months after the celebrity edition and no doubt was being constructed and tweaked with its celeb forerunner in mind. New ways of keeping an old game fresh will have been devised. And, most importantly of all, there will always be people, famous or otherwise, ready to make fascinating, maddening, completely engrossing decisions across a big, round table.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not literally of course, but try telling that to someone who has nailed Free Bird’s four-minute guitar solo in front of a packed living-room audience.Developed by Harmonix, published by RedOctane and inspired by Konami’s GuitarFreaks, Guitar Hero gave players a guitar-shaped controller with which to match coloured notes scrolling down the screen in time with a song. Each riff or sequence corresponded to specific notes, creating the feel of a genuine performance.Harmonix had already tried its hand at rhythm games with the PlayStation 2 titles Frequency and Amplitude when it partnered with RedOctane, which was purchased by Activision in 2006. Together they laid the foundations for an unlikely billion-dollar franchise that had a remarkable impact for many of the artists featured, introducing decades-old bands such as Cheap Trick, Kansas and Lynyrd Skynyrd to millions of younger players.View image in fullscreenStrum-thing new … a line of people playing plastic guitars.Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty ImagesMichael Dornbrook, former COO of Harmonix, recalls the initial financial challenges of licensing the recordings – even though the first two games mostly used cover versions – but also how their bargaining power shifted once the game was a hit.“We rerecorded all the music because the dollar figure was so high,” he says. “Even with the publishing rights alone, it was nearly impossible. We couldn’t get bands like the Who – RedOctane had virtually no money, and we were pretty convinced it would fail. But once Guitar Hero took off, and record sales and radio play were going up, everyone wanted to be in.”He adds: “One of the amazing things was how many parents got in touch and thanked us for introducing their kids to the music they loved. It became a multigenerational thing.”Northern Irish blues-rock band the Answer had Never Too Late included on the 2008 game Guitar Hero World Tour. Guitarist Paul Mahon remembers how the series brought classic rock back into vogue: “Guitar Hero offered a bigger, younger audience. Generally this had been seen as music that was past it, but then when it was featured on the game and teenagers were finding it, suddenly it was cool. That legitimised it, and got rid of the ‘dad rock’ tag. It gave all our music a new life.”In 2008, the Answer’s debut album was still unreleased in the US, meaning the game was a key medium of discovery for the band as they went on a North American tour supporting AC/DC. “Their crew were playing Never Too Late on the tour bus, and some of them knew us from Guitar Hero,” Mahon says.View image in fullscreenSpin-off games such as Guitar Hero: Aerosmith were themed around the band.Photograph: ArcadeImages/AlamyRock’s heavyweight names soon capitalised on the series’ popularity, with Aerosmith, Metallica and Van Halen featuring in dedicated spin-off titles that focused on each band’s catalogue and associated lore, imagery and rock’n’roll mythology. In the case of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, it was said to have made the band more money than any of their studio albums did. It sold well over half a million copies in its first week, while sales of Aerosmith’s music saw an increase of up to 40% at a time when the music business’s established orderwas already collapsingin a changing landscape.The series continues to inspire nimble-fingered fanaticism among its fans. Earlier this year, streamerCarnyJared completed an impressive attemptof DragonForce’s Through the Fire and Flames – a notoriously difficult power-metal song made popular by Guitar Hero – on Clone Hero, a freeware game with almost identical gameplay but an array of customisation options. This track is challenging enough on expert mode, let alone played at double speed and without missing a single one of its near 4,000 notes. CarnyJared claimed it took nine months of practice.View image in fullscreenNotoriously difficulty … DragonForce guitarist Herman Li.Photograph: Gary Miller/FilmMagicA mindboggling feat, but at what point does one pick up an actual guitar? “It doesn’t really matter, because you can’t play [that song] in nine months! There’s zero chance,” says DragonForce guitarist Herman Li, who considers the game world and the real world to be very separate. “Guitar Hero is a fun, fantasy thing. If you play Call of Duty, that doesn’t mean you should pick up a real gun and go to war.”DragonForce had already wrapped up a successful tour when Through the Fire and Flames was featured on Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, but Li says it made them a household name. “I remember the record label calling to tell me that we were selling albums like crazy,” he says. “It exploded when we next toured, and we were playing just before the headliners Slipknot and Disturbed on the Mayhem festival.”In fact, DragonForce’s exposure from Guitar Hero was so immense that it has threatened to overshadow everything else the band has done. Last year, the song was used in a trailer for Despicable Me 4. “In the past I thought differently, but I’ve made peace with it,” Li says. “If you only listen to one DragonForce song, it’s totally cool – everyone’s got their own musical journey and I’m glad we’ve been part of people’s lives”.The best marketing, whether it’s for cars, clothes or video games, goes further than selling something – it evokes a desire. Did Guitar Hero tap into that? “That’s exactly what we were trying to create,” Dornbrook says. “That thrill of being a rock star on the stage. From day one, Alex [Rigopulos] and Eran [Egozy], who co-founded Harmonix, felt that there’s an instinctive human desire to make music, and they wanted to use technology to allow people to do it”.The majority of Guitar Hero games were released in just a five-year period between 2005 and 2010, including spin-offs DJ Hero, complete with a turntable controller, and Band Hero, the two games releasing a week apart in 2009: Dornbrook says “Activision is famous for burning out franchises, they tend to overdo it”. After that, the publisher’s interest in plastic instruments died down, aside from a short-lived revival in 2015 with Guitar Hero Live.Games such as Clone Hero and Fortnite Festival have kept the scene alive, and there’s set to be something from the original publisher on the way: RedOctaneGames,, a new studio which has “entered production on its debut rhythm-based title”. Original co-founders Kai and Charles Huang are both involved as special advisers. Is the world ready to embrace another game in the spirit of Guitar Hero?“We thought those games could be like Madden where you can update every year,” Dornbrook says. “There’s so much new music that it could be evergreen, so I’ve always been optimistic. There’s no reason why it can’t continue with new generations.”Explore more on these topicsGamesActivision BlizzardAerosmithfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The play begins in a pub where Jones (Simon Holland Roberts) is hiding out after escaping from prison. He is holding drinkers rapt with stories of his “heroic” past and it is clear that he knows how to self-mythologise. But is he speaking the truth? And is he a common criminal or an incendiary force of rebellion?Because of the tonal uncertainly of this play – a comedy-cum-farce that flips to darkness moments before the end – you do not feel invested enough to be pulled in by these central puzzles.Jones might have carried shades of Rooster, the charismatic rogue fromJez Butterworth’s Jerusalem, but is too broadly, flatly drawn: a growlingly mischievous figure of fun like a barefootFalstaffwhose motivations are unclear.Under the direction of Dan Jones, the comedy and characterisation is too generic. Reginald Jones-Bateman (Qasim Mahmood) is the haughty Englishman and tyrant landowner in pursuit of Jones, with a police officer (Rhys ap Trefor) who is so ineffectual that he seems to have arisen out of a saggy 1970s sitcom.View image in fullscreenOutlandish … from left: Mia Khan, Theo Woolford and Simon Holland Roberts.Photograph: Kirsten McternanThe plot wanders into the outlandish and incredible: Reginald’s party has a gun but fail to apprehend Jones. The police officer is assaulted and beaten after being mistaken for a badger in a sack (why doesn’t he cry out to make them stop?). A giant cauldron is heaved on to the stage by Jones which he says he has carried across the Irish seas (what is the point of that?). Perhaps it is there to feed the blurred lines between reality and myth but instead it seems far-fetched and distracting.Cross-class and illicit romances are touched on, but seem like cogs to the plot, and intrigues are given away by characters too soon, so that any tension which might have grown is aborted. Poverty and war are mentioned but untethered to the story.Designer Mark Bailey’s period pub is evocative with its spare wood sparseness. There are rumbles of the approaching Great War as well as friction closer to home. Reginald mentions his time in India as part of the Raj, and there are unspoken parallels to the colonisation of Wales. Like Rooster, Jones is connected to this land which has been “invaded” by English aristocracy. But this theme is diluted by the busy plot and humour.The tragedy and climactic segue into the realm of myth – is Jones real or the spirit of thenative, ancient Prince of Wales? – does not have the impact it should. There is a powerful play about outsider spirit, rebellion and the slippery nature of storytelling within this one, emerging in glimmers.AtTheatr Clwyd, Mold, until 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreTheatr ClwydreviewsShareReuse this content"

New bike lanes had recently been installed and it seemed to be taking drivers time to adjust. “There was some resistance and a lack of understanding by local people of this new way of moving around the city,” Escobedo de la Riva says.He took this image in the aftermath of one particular incident and knew instantly that he’d captured something special. Many people get the impression of a red and white lighthouse against a blue sea, but his interpretation is far more grandiose: “I was actually more reminded of the work of Russian constructivism from the early 20th century,” Escobedo de la Riva, an architect, says “the strong geometrical architecture and composition” drew him to the scene in the first place, adding that he would “love for people to be inspired to use their imagination and find these kinds of geometrical compositions in their cities.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In the 70s and 80s Essex of my youth, no one had a realChristmastree unless they lived in the country, or perhaps Loughton. Our family’s skinny artificial tree is now 54 years old and still comes out every year at my sister’s. It’s shed a few plastic “needles” down the years, but it’s still standing proud – which is more than you can say for a real Christmas tree bought in 1971, or even 2024.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Therein lies the surprising environmental efficiency of artificial Christmas trees. TheCarbon Trustsays using a fake tree over seven to 20 years (depending on its weight and materials) can create fewer emissions than buying a new, commercially grown tree every year. The key is to buy an artificial tree you’ll love enough to roll out for decades.To help you choose your forever tree, I rounded up a veritable forest of the best fake Christmas trees, including pre-lit, frosted and mini models. Along with my husband, Alan, I compared them on factors including appearance, durability and whether they could be assembled without causing a breakdown in domestic relations. I also attempted a few on my own to see how easy they were to put up without help.Here I reveal which trees made Christmas come early, and which ones drove us straight to the mini liqueurs.At a glanceBest Christmas tree overall:Habitat mixed-tip upswept£120 (6ft) at ArgosBest budget Christmas tree:Robert Dyas Alaskan pine with LEDs£49.99 (6ft) at Robert DyasBest realisticChristmas tree:Christmas Tree World Matterhorn pine£119.99 (6ft) at Christmas Tree WorldBest space-saving Christmas tree:Homcom pencil slim£26.38 (6.5ft) at AliExpressWhy you should trust meI’ve spent three decades reviewing products, from smartphones tomattresses, so I’m professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to magically improve our lives by buying their stuff. I also have a solid background inhay feverandcats, both of which are triggered by having a real tree in the house, so I’m on a mission to find the best, greenest and safest alternative.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘We timed how long it took to unbox each one, assemble it and arrange its foliage.’Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianArtificial Christmas trees vary in many factors other than height. Foliage style, material, width, number of tips and method of assembly are important considerations when buying, but brands don’t always reveal these specs. My testing, then, involved a lot more measuring and tip counting than anticipated.To keep things simple, I requested the 6ft model of every full-size tree on my shortlist, all sourced from manufacturers and retailers. Taller trees tend to be correspondingly wider, and there was no way I’d fit a forest of 8ft trees in my house (or indeed reach them). I awarded kudos for the range of sizes available, though.While height in feet is the one specification you’re guaranteed to get when buying a tree, I learned not to take it too literally. My “6ft” trees varied in height from 180cm (actually 5ft 11) to 183cm (just over 6ft).My lawfully wedded testing partner, Alan, helped me put up most of the trees one weekend. I also assembled a few on my own, including the largest and heaviest, to see whether they’d be too much trouble for someone living alone.We timed how long it took to unbox each one, assemble it and arrange its foliage. We looked for clearly marked sections that slotted easily but securely together, sturdy stands, strong, flexible branches that were easy to separate and position, and clear instructions.After measuring each tree, counting its tips and pausing for a much-needed mince pie, we gave them all a good shake. Fake plastic trees shed needles, too. Not nearly as many as a real tree, but some – including our own budget Lidl tree – are litter bugs, screeding the floor with tiny plastic strips. Minimal shedding is a good sign of a tree’s build quality and durability.View image in fullscreenA shining star: Jane’s homemade tree-toppers featured her beloved late cat, Iggy.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianNext, we loaded each full-size tree with decorations to see if the branches drooped or baubles slid off. The smaller trees were subjected to less festive baggage, but we crowned each one with a 150g homemade tree-topper to see how well its vertical top branch remained standing, if at all.Pre-lit trees save time when assembling, provided they have a good number of lights arranged evenly and attractively. However, there’s no point in spending more on a pre-lit tree (usually about £15 extra for a full-size model) if you have to spend time rearranging or embellishing it with additional lights. With these models, we also looked for well-concealed cables that didn’t get in the way of assembling the tree, plus easy-to-connect sections and a long mains cable.Finally, we took each tree apart again and tried to squeeze them back into their boxes, with mixed success. They were collected by Southampton hardship charityScratch, which will distribute them to families in need this Christmas.The best artificial Christmas trees you can buy in 2025View image in fullscreenBranching out: let the tree-testing commence …Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianBest Christmas tree overall:Habitat mixed-tip upsweptView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£120 (6ft) at ArgosThis beautiful tree uses a realistic silhouette and a mix of foliage materials to create a classy, textured look. It made a strong statement in the corner of our living room before we’d even added a bauble.Why we love itHabitat’s magnificent Alpine fir lookalike was one of the easiest trees in my test to put together. Its three clearly marked sections slotted together easily, and the metal-hinged branches dropped effortlessly into place. This is one of several trees I tried assembling on my own, and I was pleasantly surprised by how quick and painless I found it – once unboxed, it took six minutes to get to a basic tree shape. It’s quite heavy when assembled, though, so I’d recommend building it in the spot you want it to stand for the next few weeks.This tree can be as bushy as you choose. If you prefer your festive topiary on the dense side, you can go to town sculpting the wired branch tips until there’s little space between them. If you’d rather have plenty of room to hang decorations, leave the branches as they are and fill the gaps with dangly doodads.As with most artificial Christmas trees, this one is “upswept”, which means the tips point upwards and can double as hooks for decorations. The branches supported ornaments well, and the top branch was strong enough to stand proud when adorned with my 150g topper.Most of the fake foliage on this tree is your standard AstroTurf-style slivers of green plastic, but thoughtful details set it apart. Each batch of fluffy fronds has a coniferous shape with shorter blades at the end, and several of the tips are rubbery PVC in a different shade of green to create a natural look. No bits fell to the floor, even when we gave the tree a good wobble.It’s a shame that …the gorgeously wide sweep of the lower branches means you’ll need a fairly spacious room to put it in. You’ll have loads of room for presents underneath, though.Dimensions (6ft version):183cm tall by 117.5cm at widest pointBranch tips:1,951Lights:noneOther heights available:5ft,7ft,8ftFoliage material:PVCBest budget Christmas tree:Robert Dyas Alaskan pine with LEDsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£49.99 (6ft) at Robert DyasA good-value buy isn’t just cheap, but built to last. Despite costing less than £50 (or £34.99 for theunlit version), this richly coloured tree is conveniently pre-lit and robust enough to survive several years of use.Why we love itBudget Christmas trees used to be sorry affairs, all droopy neon plastic with bald bits. Not any more, judging by two of the cheapest trees in my test. The Robert Dyas isn’t quite as bushy as the Homcom tree mentioned below, but once you fluff up its plentiful branch tips, it’s an impressively verdant pyramid. Plug in the pre-adorned lights, and it’s showy enough to need few further embellishments.The lights are a simple affair. Each of the tree’s three sections has a string of LEDs with cable connectors, and the resulting combined string is mains-powered, so you don’t have to worry about batteries. It’s quick to put together and saves an awful lot of time and fairy-light-based hassle.There are no display options, such as flashing or colours, but the warm white light is a cosy choice. My experience with similar lights suggests these may only last a few years, but the tree itself is sturdy enough to survive many a Christmas and not just end up in landfill.It’s a shame that …it’s not as natural-looking as the Habitat tree and sheds a few fake needles, although far fewer than a real tree.Dimensions (6ft version):180cm tall by about 90cm at widest pointBranch tips:we counted about 550Lights:we counted about 120 LEDsOther heights available:4ftFoliage material:PVCBest realisticChristmas tree:Christmas Tree World Matterhorn pineView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£119.99 (6ft) at Christmas Tree WorldThe dark green foliage of this gloriously lifelike pine will have your neighbours and visitors doing a double take. Its needles feel rather realistic, too, so it’s just as well that you get a pair of protective gloves in the box.Why we love itWhen I read “PVC”, I tend to think of shiny black pleather, but the dense PVC needles of this artificial pine tree are more like wire. It makes the branches feel a bit like bottle brushes, so you wouldn’t want to sit around stroking them, but I concede that Christmas trees are made to look at rather than fondle – and this one is a serious looker.Initial assembly was really quick, but plumping its strong branch tips to their fullest took us a while. Every one of the nearly 900 tips is adjustable and strong enough to support multiple decorations, and if you’re patient, the end result is spectacular.The Matterhorn is the heaviest and most robust of all the trees I tested. It comes with a 10-year guarantee, but I expect it will last much longer. As Christmas Tree World says in its excellent instruction booklet, this is far from being single-use plastic. I could even see it being passed down generations. Just don’t be tempted to put it outside because the steel hinges will rust.It’s a shame that …the foliage is darker than your average bright green fake tree. My husband adored it but I found it a little too dark, needing plenty of decorations to look camp enough for Christmas.Dimensions (6ft version):180cm tall by 110cm at widest pointBranch tips:856Lights:noneOther heights available:5ft,7ft,8ft; pluspre-litFoliage material:PVCBest space-saving Christmas tree:Homcom pencil slimView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£26.38 (6.5ft) at AliExpress£34.99 at TescoI was happy to break my 6ft-max rule for this 6ft 5in tree because its slim silhouette (54cm at its widest) means it hogs little space in the faux forest that’s taken over my living room. Its height and dense foliage make it a real standout.Why we love itHomcom’s tree is far more than just a standard tree with shorter branches. Real thought has gone into packing plenty of interest into its slim frame. The greenery is unusually varied, with some tips boasting long fronds and light frosting that make them look like festive dandelion clocks. My favourite feature was the 27 artificial pine cones, each attached using bendy wire so you can adjust them to your liking.This tree is a winner on practicality. It was the quickest and easiest tall tree to put together; its branches needed relatively little shaping, and even a short person like me found it light and easy to move around the room.It’s a shame that …the short, bushy branches don’t leave much room for decorations, but honestly this tree doesn’t really need them – maybe just a star at the top. Also be aware that its 195cm height is actually 6ft 4.8in, not six and a half feet.Dimensions (6ft 5in version):195cm tall by 54cm at widest pointBranch tips:556Lights:noneOther heights available:5.5ftFoliage material:PVCskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Its lights are powered via a sealed battery pack designed to withstand the elements, and the greenery is a weatherproof, rubbery plastic.Each branch is posable and quite long – this is a wide tree rather than a tall one. It comes firmly embedded in a high-quality pot, so you can pick up the whole thing by the tip without sending the pot crashing to the ground.You don’t even have to remember to switch off the lights. Once on, they’ll stay lit for six hours before automatically switching off – and then come on again at the same start time the next day.It didn’t make the final cut because …the light strings got tangled in the branches, so assembling this tree was more trouble than its 3ft size warranted. You also have to supply your own batteries.Dimensions (3ft version):90cm tall by 86cm at widest point;tips:about 200;lights:50 warm white LEDs;other heights:none;foliage material:PVC and polyethyleneDunelm snowy blue spruceView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£99 (6ft) at DunelmBest for:an indoor white ChristmasThis tree is not just lightly dusted with fake snow: it’s drenched in the stuff, like you’ve dipped it in glue then rolled it down an Alp. This makes its branches much thicker, and we found it hard to hang many baubles without making it look overdone, but at least that means it doesn’t need much work. String it with fairy lights or even just a topper, and it’s good to go.Underneath the frosting is a decent mid-range tree with a mix of tip types, not unlike the Habitat. We found it easy to assemble, and its metal stand is unusually sturdy. The best snowy tree I tested.It’s a shame that …the fake snow (which is unlikely to enhance this tree’s sustainability credentials) litters the floor in what looks like the dandruff of a giant.Dimensions (6ft version):180cm tall by 106cm at widest point;tips:we counted about 700;lights:none;other heights:7ft;foliage material:plasticAldi snowy Christmas treeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£39.99 at Aldi (in store only)Best for:a budget frosted tree that doesn’t look cheapAldi’s tree comes in a green or snowy version, both just under 6ft. I was sent the snowy version, which had the same dandruff as the Dunelm, but comes with by far the most impressive stand of all the trees I tested – a wooden cross that took us far too long to screw into place using the supplied nuts and washers. Once done, the stand looked fantastic and gave the tree a solidity that made it fairly easy to move around.This tree has a relatively high number of branches according to Aldi’s count, but they don’t look quite as dense as those of the Dunelm tree, and we found them easier to separate and position.It’s a shame that …you can’t buy Aldi’s tree online, only in store – and at this superb price it’s likely to sell out fast.Dimensions:180cm tall by 108cm at widest point;tips:972;lights:none;other heights:none;foliage material:polyethyleneRobert Dyas Westbury multicolour fibre opticView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£49.99 (3ft) at Robert DyasBest for:anyone for whom “too much” is never enough at ChristmasThe Westbury (or Woodbury, on the box) is the smallest tree I tested, but has the biggest kitsch appeal by far. After minimal adjustment of the fluffy branches, we plugged the tree into the mains and it threw out so much light and colour that we squealed like excited children.The tree was a breeze to assemble, without even a cable to get in the way, because the fairy lights and fibre-optic filaments are firmly embedded in the branch tips. Its handy remote control is ready to go out of the box, so we immediately set about changing colours, playing with effects and testing the timer.It didn’t make the final cut because …£50 is a lot to spend on a fun novelty choice that’s unlikely to be your main tree for years to come. Shame it’s not more securely attached to the pot, either.Dimensions (3ft version):90cm tall by 20cm at widest point;tips:we counted about 250;lights:80 fibre optic tips and approx 80 LEDs;other heights:none;material:plasticChristmas Tree World pre-lit ultra pop upView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£149.99 (6ft) at Christmas Tree WorldBest for:going from zero to fully lit tree in seconds before guests arriveThis one’s quicker to prepare than eggnog. Open the box and lift out the tree – like a big green crinoline skirt with branches and fairy lights attached – then prop it on to its central pole, switch on the lights,et voilà: your tree.It’s an absolute cracker, too. There’s plenty of room for decorations, but the mix of green shades gives the bendable tips a dense, textured look that means you can get away with a minimal scattering of baubles.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s expensive for what you get, and the uniformly triangular shape of the tree means no one would mistake it for the real thing.Dimensions (6ft version):180cm tall by 60cm at widest point;tips:686;lights:200 warm white LEDs;other heights:7ft;foliage material:PVC and polyethyleneRobert Dyas Duchess slim pre-litView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£69.99 (5ft) at Robert DyasBest for:anyone short on time and spaceI expected this tree to be little more than a slimmed-down version of the cheaper Robert Dyas Alaskan pine. It’s much bushier, though, and its lights feel more securely attached, giving it a more durable feel.The branches are thickly adorned with deep green plastic foliage, giving a denser look than most other trees I tested – even before you’ve spent time adjusting all the tips. At 75cm wide, it’s big enough to look impressive but small enough to suit smaller living spaces.It didn’t make the final cut because …the thick foliage looks great, but it doesn’t leave much room for decorations.Dimensions (5ft version):150cm tall by 75cm at widest point;tips:327;lights:150;other heights:none;material:plasticWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenDurability is key to reducing an artificial Christmas tree’s environmental impact.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianCan an artificial Christmas tree really be more sustainable than a real one?You mean, is a 7ft pyramid of plastic more environmentally friendly than an actual tree? Obviously not. Even if you retire a real tree by setting fire to it – a process not exactly short on pollutants and greenhouse gases – it’s still a greener choice in the short term. “An artificial tree has 10 times the carbon footprint of a natural tree that’s burned after Christmas,” says Alex Robinson, CEO of UK environmental charityHubbub.An artificial tree is not just for one Christmas, however. “As long as an artificial tree is reused for 10 years or more, its environmental impact will balance out,” says Robinson. This backs up theCarbon Trust’s finding that a fake tree used for seven to 20 years, depending on its weight and materials, produces fewer emissions than buying a new, commercially grown tree each year.Real and fake trees have their environmental pros and cons, says Tristan Sissons, head of purchasing at Hillier Nurseries. “Real trees are biodegradable, and they’re grown for years before they’re sold, absorbing carbon dioxide from the air as they grow. But artificial trees can be used for years, so they avoid the ‘one use and dispose of’ mentality.”The best artificial Christmas trees are investment pieces thatcut landfill– you would hope. “Sadly, it’s estimated that artificial Christmas trees are used on average only four times, so it’s important to buy one that gets used year after year,” says Robinson.You don’t have to wheel out the same tree for 54 years like my family, but a decade or more is easily achieved if you choose wisely. All the trees I mention above are robust enough to last 10 years or more, and a few – notably the Habitat and the Christmas Tree World Matterhorn pine, which comes with a 10-year guarantee – are so well built that they probably have a longer life expectancy than I do.How else can I minimise my tree’s carbon impact?View image in fullscreenHanging around: ideally, decorations, including LED lights, should have a similar lifespan to artificial trees. Many don’t, however.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFlocked trees are trending in 2025, according to retailers includingChristmas Tree WorldandWayfair, but the fake snow they’re covered in makes your tree less green in more ways than one. A flocked tree can still have a smaller carbon footprint than an annual series of real trees, though, if you use it every year for long enough. According to the UK environmental organisation100Green, artificial flocking increases the carbon break-even time for an artificial tree to 15 years, and if you spray it on a real tree it’ll render the tree non-recyclable. It also makes a mess on the floor, albeit more manageable than real tree needles.Pre-lit trees have their green drawbacks, too. LED strings are unlikely to have as long a lifespan as a fake tree, and they’re often attached so securely to pre-lit trees that they can be a hassle to replace.The most frustrating environmental aspect of artificial Christmas trees, though, is where they’re made: China, almost without exception. Not a single tree I was able to source was made in the UK, including those, such as the Atkin and Thyme Nordmann fir, whose brands put a homegrown vibe at the centre of their appeal. I’m now redoubling efforts to find UK-made trees to add to this roundup in plenty of time for Christmas.Jane Hoskyn is a features journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and “testing” coffee machines while deadlines loom.

Six groups of fan friends share how they metBySam Wollaston. Introduction by author (and Norwich FC fan) George Harrison. Portraits: Fabio De PaolaSat 8 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTShareJump toManchester CityArsenal WomenMerthyr TownWigan AthleticSt JohnstoneBirmingham CityLike so many football fans, I have my own routines and rituals with which I tie together the home games of a league season. Last year, one such routine involved the older gentleman in the seat to my right. I’d nod hello and, above the strains of pre-match music, ask him what he thought of Norwich’s chances – 23 times I asked, and 23 times he replied along the lines of: “We’ll probably get thumped” or “I don’t see where our goals are coming from.” A shred of contempt would be spared for the referee. Always, the referee was known to him and, always, I’d be forewarned that this or that referee was an “arsehole”, a “wanker”, or – once – “an arsehole and a wanker”.This neighbour of mine was a retired engineer, a Norfolk boy, and a follower of both first team and academy, home and away. He was just one of thousands with a season ticket at the back of Carrow Road’s lower Barclay stand: a Saturday afternoon companion, a stranger at the start of the last season who became a little less strange as the matches went by. I was able to glean, for example, that after decades of loyal (if pessimistic) fandom, he would soon be moving to Yorkshire with his partner, unable to ignore his dreams of the Dales. He had already decided that he wouldn’t be renewing his season ticket. My first year in this part of the ground was his last.There are other faces I recognise every week, most of whom returned to their usual seats after the long summer break: the dad and his two young lads in front, the Scottish-born council worker to my left, and behind me the woman who, unusually, attends games with the best friend of her grownup son. In my first season among these people there were moments – celebrating a late equaliser, belting out the club song before kick-off – when I felt quite close to them. So begins the process by which tentative exchanges on the terrace can provide the foundations for more meaningful connections … and perhaps even genuine friendships.From the outside, football fandom looks a lot like a cult. Every other week, we troop down to the stadium in our thousands, wearing the same colours, singing the same songs. We share a sense of collective triumph after a goal – just as we bear, together, the humiliating misery of the net bulging at the other end. It’s not a religious experience but, to me, there’s something liturgical about the timeworn routines, the replica shirts, and the almost spiritual reverence in which the club and its players are held. In such an environment, how could you not make friends with the people around you?View image in fullscreenGeorge Harrison at Carrow Road.Photograph: Emily DinsmoreOf course, it starts with the easy stuff, the stuff that’s right there on the pitch. Talking about the last game, about today’s lineup, transfer rumours, the weather. Is our striker Josh Sargent still injured? Who’s that Danish chap we’ve been linked with? In time, real life bleeds into these conversations. After all, in the 40-plus hours you’ll spend together over the course of a season, it’s not too great a leap from grumbling together about Norwich midfielder Kenny McLean’s latest suspension to asking someone what they do for work. By the time you reach the business end of things, you’re sharing chips on the concourse and celebrating goals arm in arm. Next time out, in the expectant quiet before the whistle, you may even take the greatest of leaps and ask your neighbour’s name. Maybe.In my case, it took until the second half of last season to properly introduce myself to any of the people in my vicinity. “Isn’t it ridiculous that I see you every week, and I don’t even know what you’re called?” So said the man two seats to my left at Christmastime, glowing, perhaps, with the spirit of the season. We swapped names, shook hands, and now I know I’ll get a smile and an “All right, George” before each kick-off.As a working-class man (and a graduate of the grunt-and-nod school of social interaction), I can recognise that this behaviour is typical of men like me: grumbling for hours about the manager’s tactics but waiting months or years for an actual introduction. But at least football gets us talking. And, given time, the social glue of fandom can easily bind strangers – men and women, working-class or otherwise – into mutual acquaintanceship. From there, deeper connections beckon.I’m not the first person to bang the drum for the potentially transformative power of football friendships. In October 2023, Norwich City FC releaseda short videoto mark World Mental Health Day. Its resonance was such that, on holiday last year, a Portuguese man recognised the Norwich crest on my cap and told me, unprompted, that he’d seen the video and had cried watching it.The video launched by Norwich City FC to mark Mental Health Day in 2023At the start of the clip, we see two men taking up their seats, and then we follow these men from game to game, witnessing the celebrations and commiserations of the stands, interspersed with snatches of conversation (“How’s the week been?”). In a genuinely touching and unexpected ending, we discover that one of the men had been suffering in silence all the while. At the start of the following season, a scarf is laid on his empty seat: an impromptu memorial for one of the 4,200 men who kill themselves in England and Wales each year. Indeed, in a country in which men die by suicide at three times the rate of women, we should look to the still male-dominated football stadium as an arena in which usually taciturn men may be persuaded to open up. In this context, striking up a football friendship may be more than just a pleasant way to fill the half-time interval. Talking to the person next to you could save a life.For many, the significance of sporting friendships has grown as the sense of community has diminished in British civic lifeIt was a coincidence that when that video was released, I had recently finished drafting my debut novel, Season. The story follows two male football fans (unnamed, of course) as they gradually form their own slow-burn intergenerational friendship in the stands of a fictionalised club – albeit one that closely resembles Norwich. As the matches tick by, both men come to lean on one another in unexpected ways, their shared stake in the football becoming a refuge from the world beyond the stadium. From what readers have told me, this plot has its parallels up and down the country. And, for many, the significance of sporting friendships has only grown as the sense of community has diminished almost everywhere else in British civic life.Certainly, I felt a strange sadness when the whistle blew at the end of the last campaign and my season ticket neighbour said his goodbyes to everyone around him – including some diehards who had had their seats for almost as long as him. He and I never made it to the point of friendship – and even with a few more seasons under our belt, we might never have got there. But, still, it was bittersweet, after all those hours together, to wish him a good summer, knowing I would never see him again.He was one of those whose names I never caught, but I still found myself thinking of him when I returned to Carrow Road in August. The club may have lost just one of its many longsuffering fans, but I’ve lost part of my pre-match routine. Indeed, nobody has taken up his old season ticket; the seat I always thought of as his is now occupied by a carousel of casual fans, strangers who take his place for one match before giving way to somebody else next time out. This is why, in recent weeks, after a goal or a shocking miss, I’ve looked more readily to my left. There stands my acquaintance from north of the border, who has turned out to be an eager conversationalist, always willing to share from his own surplus of gripes and obsessions.Yet I know that next time a particularly hopeless referee screws us out of three points, I’ll still end up thinking of my old neighbour and wondering whether up there, in North Yorkshire, he’s finding it any easier to see the positives in life.Season by George Harrison is published by Eye Books.

I love them to bits’View image in fullscreenManchester City fans (from left) Liam, his dad Andy, friend Dan, and husband and wife Katie and OllyIt started – all the best things do – with a big, messy hug. And then – not so good – a night in A&E. The year was 2009.Manchester City, at home to Hamburg in the Uefa Cup, equalised from the penalty spot. “Ask any City fan about the best atmosphere in the stadium, they’ll talk about that night,” says Andy, who was at the game with his brother Dave.They knew Dan and Olly, who stand in the same part of the ground (no one sits down in block 110), but their interaction hadn’t gone much beyond nods of acknowledgment. That changed with Elano’s spot-kick conversion, and the grab-anyone-within-reach jubilation that followed. For Dan, though, the ecstasy quickly turned to agony. “I felt this sharp pain in my right eye. We were celebrating, hugging and cheering, the atmosphere was buzzing, but I couldn’t really see. My eye was killing me.”Dan left the match and went to hospital, with a scratched cornea. He still doesn’t know how it happened; it might have been Olly – his best mate since the age of four – waving his cowbell around. “Olly brought a cowbell to the game, to get the atmosphere going.” But the incident, then Dan turning up to the next game with an eye patch, proved to be the beginning of beautiful friendship. “As catalysts and chain reactions go in terms of friendships, it’s quite unique.”Dan and Olly started joining Andy and Dave – and then, increasingly, Andy’s son Liam – for a beer at half-time. In fact, Olly bought Liam his first pint. (I won’t say how old he was: “He was very tall, I just assumed,” says Olly, in a lame attempt at justification.) The friendships progressed from beers at half-time to beers on the way to the game, and an invitation to Andy’s 40th (he’s 13 years older than Dan and Olly). Other family members, friends and partners started going to games – Andy’s daughter Phoebe, and Dan’s girlfriend Tara. And Katie, who was with another group in the family stand. “But there wasn’t much atmosphere there,” Katie says, “so I used to sneak out, go to 110, get the drinks round there.” Another reason she was sneaking off to block 110 was Olly, whom she’d met clubbing and was dating. They were married in 2014, with the City gang very much in attendance. There’s a photo of them all at the wedding.That’s a true test of friendship, when you spend more than 24 hours with themI’ve got some of them on a Zoom call: Dan, Andy and Liam (22 now and legally allowed a pint), Katie and Olly. Katie and Olly’s boys – Maddox, nine, and Phoenix, six – are clambering around, in and out of the call. They’ve started going to games, too, where they clamber around the Etihad Stadium.The group’s friendship has transcended football. Everyone went to Olly and Dan’s 40ths when they, too, hit the milestone. They go clubbing and to gigs together; they’ve seen each other’s kids grow up. Dan and Tara went on holiday to Ibiza with Andy and his wife, Emma. “That’s a true test of friendship, when you spend more than 24 hours with them,” Dan says. A test they seem to have passed: Dan now also uses a desk in Andy’s office.Covid was difficult, but on match days they met up on Zoom, to watch (and drink) along together. “It wasn’t the same – I missed the day out,” says Andy, who is now 53. “These guys make me feel young. I’m still a 40-year-old when I’m with them. They’ve also been fantastic role models to my son.”View image in fullscreenThe friends pictured by a mural of Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola that’s opposite the Etihad StadiumLiam, who graduated from university earlier this year, agrees. “Coming to City and seeing these guys, that’s what gets me through the week.”“It’s a dopamine hit,” says Dan. “It’s helped my mental health massively – football, getting to hang out with these guys and call them my friends. I love them to bits.”“They’re a sound bunch,” says Olly. “We could be winning, we could be losing – it doesn’t really matter as long as we’re together.”I’m on the verge of welling up now. City did win that match against Hamburg in 2009, but lost on aggregate over the two legs, and went out of the competition. But, apparently, they have had some success since …Arsenal Women‘Meeting each other was like finding gold’View image in fullscreenArsenal Women fans (from left) Jemma, Hollie and Bonnie at the Emirates StadiumBonnie’s confidence was low in 2022. It had taken a hit during Covid, and on top of everything she’d been made redundant. “I was finding it hard going out, being too far from home,” she says.At the same time, the England women’s team won the Euros and Bonnie found herself getting into women’s football. On a freezing Sunday evening, she plucked up the courage to take herself to an Arsenal game at Borehamwood in Hertfordshire (the women’s team weren’t playing a lot at the Emirates then). Walking from the station to the stadium, she felt quite alone, but things got better inside. “I saw Stina Blackstenius and Beth Mead in the flesh – people I’d seen on TV – and I got all fangirl.”Bonnie only made it to half-time, due to a combination of nerves, the cold, and “I think it was Beth Mead who kicked the ball so hard it hit the back of the area I was sitting in and then hit my shoe – I was so embarrassed!” But she loved the atmosphere. “I thought, I’ve got this far, I’m going to give myself a push.” On a supporters’ club forum, she found out about a pub people went to before games and decided she’d do that next time …We’re all completely different. But somehow it works really well, and I don’t understand how it does, but I’m so gratefulJemma had a different path to the Pick & Shovel in Borehamwood. She enjoyed football as a kid, but isn’t from a football family. When she got older, she was told that girls didn’t play football. “And that was kind of the end of that, until uni, where one of my housemates, who was Spanish, was obsessed and we watched the Euros together.”Jemma managed to persuade some friends to go with her to watch Arsenal, but they only wanted to go once, for the experience. Jemma was hooked, though. She had heard about the Pick & Shovel, so for the next game, she went along alone, nervously. “I walked round by myself for an hour. I walked in, then back out. Then a friend texted asking if I’d got to the game, so I was like, I’m going to have to do this.”Inside, she found people in Arsenal shirts, standing around chatting. “No one seemed to know each other very well, just people saying hi.” One of them was Bonnie: “And I thought, she seems fun, I’ll cling to her.”They clung to each other, and started going to games together. Then in 2024, two became three when they met Hollie at the League Cup final at Wolverhampton’s Molineux Stadium (where Arsenal beat Chelsea). Sometimes, being in a group gives you the courage to get more involved and be more vocal. And, among this trio, Hollie’s the most vocal. “I’m really invested in what’s happening on the pitch, and if I don’t agree with something I will call out the people who’ve done it – not very politely most of the time. We often tell the ref they need to get their eyes checked, but not in such friendly terms,” she says.View image in fullscreenJemma, Hollie and Bonnie in front of graffiti art of vice-captain Leah Williamson in a tunnel near the stadiumHollie says all three women are completely different. “But somehow it works really well, and I don’t understand how it does, but I’m so grateful.”Bonnie agrees: “But our morals align, and obviously our support for Arsenal. It was like finding gold.” They’re now best mates, and they text and chat between games. When Arsenal reached the final of the Champions League in May, the trio went to Lisbon together and shared an Airbnb. On the day, Mead teed up Blackstenius to stun favourites Barcelona and take the title. “For me, it was one of the best days of my life,” Bonnie says. “And the celebration afterwards, we filled a whole street, everyone standing on chairs singing, sharing the same energy. You get the feeling that you belong somewhere.”Merthyr Town‘We give each other endless amounts of abuse, but we’ve also got each other’s back’View image in fullscreenMerthyr Town fans (from left) Mark, Nigel, Mike, Jason and LouisMark and Nigel remember the first time they met, in the early 80s. Not actually on the terraces, but heading to an away game: Merthyr Town were playing Cardiff City in the Welsh Cup. “Me and my then girlfriend were having a nice kissing session on the train, while Nigel was getting hassled by some Cardiff fans,” Mark says.Nigel remembers Mark, who was a skinhead at the time, disentangling from his amorous liaison and emerging from under a sheepskin coat “like David Jason’s in Only Fools and Horses” to come to his aid, and has been grateful ever since. Merthyr lost the game 5-0, but Mark and Nigel both gained a mate for life, and they’ve watched the Martyrs together from the same spot at Penydarren Park ever since.And it’s not just the two of them. Mike showed up, later in the 80s. “He’s from a different part of town, a different religion – we’ve still got Catholic and Protestant schools in Merthyr,” Mark says. The group grew, and started a fanzine: they became the Dial M for Merthyr lads.There’s now a core of 15 or 20 pals, and I’m on a video call with five of them: Mark, Nigel and Mike, plus more recent recruits Louis and Jason, speaking from in and around Merthyr Tydfil. “An oasis of football in the sea of rugby in the south Wales valleys,” says Mark. “Since the deindustrialisation of our area, the only thing we have left is football.” Actually, Mark’s not at home right now. He’s gone to another away game – Wales’s World Cup qualifier against Kazakhstan; he’s in a hotel room in the capital, Astana.Oh, and they’re all part-owners of the club, which became fan owned in 2010 after liquidation. Mark, Nigel and Mike were instrumental in that, too, but this is more about terrace friendship than business affairs.For home games at Penydarren Park, the Dial M lads stand in the CTM memorial stand – not its official name, but what they started to call it after one of their lot, 72-year-old Colin the Monk (named after a bad haircut), didn’t show up for a few weeks. “We thought he was dead, so we put up a little plaque,” says Mark, who does most of the talking. “But, a few weeks later, he reappeared. He’d just moved away with a new girlfriend.” Colin the Monk is off again soon, to live in the Philippines.They look out for one another, even if they don’t see much of each other away from the CTM stand. “It’s a bit like the Cheers bar, where everyone knows your name,” says Mark. “You can be having a really bad week, you could be depressed, we’ve had a few of those: three o’clock and so-and-so’s not here, let’s give him a ring and see what’s up.”Some of these boys, they’ll be carrying my box. I’ll be carrying some of theirsMike tells me about the time he was experiencing depression and anxiety, and how the Dial M lads were there for him. “It’s a safe place – we know where we are. I know we give each other endless amounts of abuse, but there’s a line, and we’ve also got each other’s back. You can tell anybody anything, really, if you’re not right. We did have a friend who took his own life – he wasn’t in our group, but he was a Merthyr fan and it hit us all hard.”Mike says they’ll be there for each other even after they’ve gone. “Some of these boys, they’ll be carrying my box. I’ll be carrying some of theirs.”An “extended family” is how Jason describes it. He brings his actual family – his three kids, including his five-year-old daughter. The first Dial M wedding came after Mark took his sister to a few games. “She fancied one of our mates, Mick, and they ended up getting married.” And Mark’s six-year-old grandson is going to his first game, against Worksop Town (Merthyr play in the National League North), the Saturday after we talk. Mark’s dad, who’s been going since 1949, will be there, too; there’ll be four generations of the family in attendance.View image in fullscreenThe Merthyr Town FC fans who started the Dial M For Merthyr fanzine are pictured with friends and family. Second left is Mark (blue cap), with his dad David (with walking stick) and son Nathan who has his grandson Osian on his shouldersNigel is the joker in the pack. Halfway through the call, he nips off and reappears wearing a wig. He says he found it lying around the hospital where he works, “saving lives” (as a porter). They’re not a clique, he insists. “Whoever wants to come and join us, you’re welcome, but you’ve got to take the banter. If I say you’ve got a big nose you’ve got to take it, know what I mean?”Oh, and Louis does the songs, mostly Abba ones, with new lyrics. Go on, Louis, give us a blast, I say. So he does, choosing the one they sing for centre-forward Ricardo Rees, to the tune of Voulez-Vous:Ricardo (aha)Running down the wing (aha)He’s scoring all thegoals (aha) …An hour with the Dial M for Merthyr boys in the valleys of south Wales (and the Kazakh Steppe) has been a blast, and given me a little taste of what they’ve been up to together for more than 40 years: taking the piss and looking out for each other.Wigan Athletic‘Back then, not many women went tomatches. I saw Julie and thought: not bad’View image in fullscreenWigan Athletic fans Julie and DaveWigan were playing away – to Stockport, Julie thinks, but isn’t 100% sure; it was a while back – in 1982. She was getting a lift with her friend Terence, as she often did. “He took people to away games and I used to just get in with anyone else who was going.”On that day, Dave was going. “He’d taken someone’s place, just happened to be there.” First impressions? “Yeah, I thought, he’s a bit of all right,” she laughs. “And that was it!”What about Dave, does he remember what he was thinking? “Not bad,” he says, deadpan. I don’t think Dave is prone to overexuberance. Actually, he was surprised more than anything. “Back then, not many women went to football matches.”In those days, some grounds didn’t even have women’s toilets. Julie remembers one away game – in Middlesbrough, possibly – when Dave “had to go into the toilets and wait for the men to come out and then I could go in. He kept them out until I’d been.”He did that because, guess what, they got together at the last game of that season, in May 1982. “They ran a train – a football special, they used to call them – to Aldershot for the game,” says Julie. “We both went, along with Terence and some others, and that’s kind of when we decided we wanted to be together.”When I met her I had a full head of hair and a full bank account, now I’ve not got eitherWhich they have been since, though it took them until 1988 to get married. “I was thinking about it, considering my options,” says Dave, typically. “When I met her I had a full head of hair and a full bank account, now I’ve not got either,” he moans.They’re speaking from their home in Wigan, sitting on the sofa, Julie doing most of the talking, Dave occasionally chipping in sardonically. Wigan Athletic has been a big part of their life together. They used to go to both home and away fixtures, hardly missing a game.Julie’s the louder of the two on the terraces. “I like going to away games, singing and chanting behind the goal. I enjoy that, more than him, probably. I like the atmosphere.”Is Julie more of an ultra then? “She can be,” says Dave. She tells me about an altercation with a couple of Millwall fans. “They wanted to fight me, and I had two young children with me!”View image in fullscreenAn early photograph of Dave and JulieTheir kids – Hannah and Amy – got wrapped up in warm clothes and lugged along to home games as babies. In fact, Amy was for a time the youngest member of the Wigan Junior Latics, after Dave signed her up for the team when she was just 30 minutes old. “Dave called his mum first, said, ‘She’s here’, then got her registered,” says Julie. And Hannah became a footballer; she has played for several sides including Blackburn Rovers Women.Julie and Dave have seen highs and lows at Wigan. The arrival of three Spanish players in the 90s – the three amigos (including Roberto Martínez, who would later become manager) – was a high. Then the Premier League, winning the FA Cup in 2013, playing in Europe and an away trip to Bruges. It beats Stockport or Middlesbrough, even if it was raining, there was no beer in the stadium and the score was 0-0. “The atmosphere going over on the ferry, then all the Latics fans and flags in the square in the centre of Bruges – it was fabulous,” says Julie.The club going into administration in 2020 was definitely a low. “I wouldn’t wish that on any football fan,” says Julie. Now Wigan are in the third tier, League One. Julie and Dave still go to all home games together, but have to take it in turn for away matches – not because of the girls (who are now grown up), but because of Dora their cockapoo.After speaking to them, I get an email from Julie with a few attachments. There’s video of the scenes inside Wembley at the final whistle after Wigan beat Man City in the 2013 FA Cup final. There are some photos, too: one of her and Dave soon after they met; a picture of Julie, the girls, and the Three Amigos; and one from last Saturday of their elder daughter Hannah who has just scored on her debut for her new club, Wigan  Athletic.St Johnstone‘You can go months without seeing pals, but Saints are a constant’View image in fullscreenSt Johnstone fans (from left) Pam, Emma, Cary and ClareEmma used to go to McDiarmid Park, home ofSt Johnstonein Perth, with her dad. At half-time during one game, probably around 2008, she found herself next to Cary and Pam in the queue for the toilet. They recognised each other from school in the late 90s, even though they weren’t in the same year.They reconnected, bonded again, and had a big night out on the town when Saints were promoted to what was then the Scottish Premier League in 2009. And they changed their season tickets so they could sit together, in the east stand. When Emma’s dad died in 2016, having Cary and Pam’s support was a huge comfort. “I valued that they knew him. They came to the funeral, and they were there when his name was announced in a list of supporters who had passed away that season. As time has gone on, people in my life have increasingly not met him, so that means a lot.”I’ve temporarily been allowed into their WhatsApp group, Oh When the Saints, on a group call. Clare is the fourth and most recent member. Pam met her at a hen do, and they got chatting about football. Then Clare started going to away games with them. At home, she sits in the main stand. It’s posher, the others say. “More leg room,” she says, apologetically. There is one more member of the gang – Frazer, but, well … he’s a bloke. He’s useful, though – he has a car, and he doesn’t drink. Apart from Emma, who now lives in Edinburgh, the group are all still in Perth.My sister is a fan, too, and with my mum it was a case of, if you can’t beat them, join them, so she got a season ticketCary went to her first game as a kid with another friend and was hooked. “I think that friend slowly lost interest over the years and when I discovered Pam was a Saints fan I just migrated over and joined her family.”Pam first went to a match when she got a free ticket at primary school. “My sister is a fan, too, and with my mum it was a case of, if you can’t beat them, join them, so she got a season ticket.” For Pam, going to games brings structure, and regularity, to friendships. “You can go weeks and months without seeing pals as everyone has a busy life, but Saints are a constant and allow us to catch up regularly.”View image in fullscreenEmma with her dadMore women and families attend St Johnstone games now than when the gang started going – including a group of slightly older women who sit near them – but, beyond that, the stands are still mostly a sea of men, some of whom they have nicknames for. “The Dutchman”, for example, who’s not actually from the Netherlands but is so called because he once yelled at the ref: “If that was a foul, you’re not bald and I’m a fucking Dutchman.”The four friends are as shouty, and as sweary, as anyone else there. They join in on all the songs. Except one, which gets sung when St Johnstone play big rivals Dundee. I won’t include the lyrics here, but there is a line about domestic violence. “I cringe every time I hear it,” says Pam. “You’ve got your wife and your children sitting beside you – what kind of example is that to a young girl?”“Or young boy,” adds Cary. Anyway, Pam put her head above the parapet. Racist and sectarian abuse at games gets called out, and she wanted to do the same in this case. So she did, on a Facebook banter page. “I got a lot of support, but also a lot of people jumped in and said I was a snowflake, go back to the kitchen, that kind of rhetoric. But I’m glad I did it.”Clare, who was at the most recent away game at Dundee, chips in. “Somebody started it, but it died out pretty quickly. So I think the message is getting over.”And there’s another sign of progress for St Johnstone’s female supporters: the women’s toilets in McDiarmid Park now have bins for sanitary products, which wasn’t the case when Emma, Pam and Cary reunited there all those years ago.Birmingham City‘We used to sneak under the turnstiles. I think I was the onlysouth Asian around at that time but being young, I was none the wiser’View image in fullscreenBirmingham City fans (from right) Micky, Caroline, her daughter Molly and grandson JudeCaroline and Micky both have blue blood. Not in a royal way, in a Birmingham City way. Micky’s family lived on St Andrew’s Road; he could see the stadium from his school. “We used to sneak under the turnstiles. I think I was the only south Asian around at that time but being young, I was none the wiser.”Later, when he was in his teens, Micky used to go early and hang around to get autographs of the players. That’s when he met a fan called Bill. Bill was older, in his 20s; he knew some of the players and stewards. “We became friendly, had the same passion for the club.”Micky wanted to join Birmingham’s official ­supporters club, to go to away games. “I was blocked. I realise now it was probably because they didn’t want any dark faces or whatever.” This would have been the late 60s; Micky is now 70.“That really niggled me. I thought: nobody’s going to deny me going to see my club.” He challenged it, and went to the paper, the Sports Argus. Some of the stewards helped; Bill, of course, was on his side. And eventually, when he was 18, Micky got his membership and could go to home and away games with Bill.If we won, my dad would just be so happy and we’d go to the shop on the way home and he’d get treatsCaroline was three in 1971 when Bill, her dad, first started taking her to St Andrew’s. “If Blues scored, he would throw me up in the air, so I always wanted them to score. If we won, he’d just be so happy and we’d go to the shop on the way home and he’d get treats.”Caroline remembers seeing Trevor Francis, Birmingham’s great striker and Britain’s first £1m signing, play. And meeting Micky. “My dad said, ‘There’s Mick’, and there was Mick.” Bill died eight years ago. “My dad would’ve been in his 80s now, and it’s not great to say, but some people of that generation … you know. But my dad brought us up to treat everyone equally. I knew why Mick was my dad’s friend; he would have been that person to say to Mick, ‘Come with us, we’ll get you in.’ That’s who he was, and I’m really proud of him for that.”So Caroline grew up watching the Blues with her dad and Micky, then later with Micky’s son Bik, too. “We went to Bik’s wedding – that was lovely.” Caroline’s daughter Molly went to a few games, but when Bill died she started to go regularly, sitting in his seat. “I said, ‘Do you want me to sit there – because it’s on the end it’s a bit cold,’” Caroline tells me. “And she’s like: ‘No, I want to sit in grandad’s seat.’”Micky, Caroline and Molly sit together in the Main Stand; Bik’s a few rows away. It means the world to Caroline having Micky there. “He brings back memories of my dad. He doesn’t have to say anything. Something might happen in the game that’s emotional, he’ll give me a look, and I know he’s thinking about my dad.” Micky says he still dreams about Bill and that Caroline – and Molly – “are part of my family. I love them to bits.”View image in fullscreenCaroline and Micky in the standsIn 2016, Micky and Bik set up the supporters groupBlues 4 Allwith the aim of getting more people who look like them into the crowd. “It’s got better and better,” says Micky. “We never used to see Asian girls and women. Now, because of winning the Euros, Asian women are bringing our daughters to our academy, which is fantastic.” They haven’t had an Asian player break through in the men’s side yet. “But we’ve got the first Punjabi girl, Riya Mannu, to sign for Birmingham City – shescored on her debut.”It seems a long time ago that Micky wasn’t allowed to join the supporters club. “We’re moving in the right direction. Football brings families and everybody together,” he says.Oh, and there’s a new member in their family group. Molly has started bringing her two-year-old son Jude – Caroline’s grandson, Bill’s great-grandson – to games. The blue bloodline goes on.Explore more on these topicsFriendshipManchester CityArsenal WomenSt JohnstoneWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But since that was published in 2018, I have had a baby,a breakdown, travelled back to Thailand and eaten more massaman curries, all events that have contributed to this new recipe. The old dish is delicious, but in 2025 I didn’t want to make a paste from scratch. Instead, I wanted the funk and soul that a ready-made curry paste could give me and to use that as a springboard to fly into dinner time. A shortcut on time and ingredients, yes, but not on fun and flavour.Massaman tofu and potato curry with rainbow chardNot all vegan fish sauces are equal:Thai Tastemakes a good one.Prep15 minCook45 minServes4Rapeseed oil450g extra-firm tofu, torn into bite-sized pieces4 round shallots(140g), peeled and quartered4 tbsp red curry paste(I useThai Taste)1 tsp ground cumin1 tsp ground cinnamon2 lemongrass stalks, bashed2400ml tinscoconut milk2 tbsp crunchy peanut butter3 large maris piper potatoes(600g), peeled and cut into 4cm x 4cm pieces200g rainbow chard, stalks cut into 2cm pieces, leaves cut into 4cm-wide strips1 tbsp vegan fish sauce, plus extra to serveSliced mild red chillies, to serve (discard the seeds and pith if you prefer less heat)Cooked jasmine rice, to servePut two tablespoons of oil in a large pot on a medium to high heat and, when it’s hot, add the torn tofu and fry it for eight minutes, turning the pieces every now and then, until they’re golden on all sides. Transfer to a plate.Pour three more tablespoons of oil into the same pan and, when that’s hot, add the shallots and fry, stirring, for five minutes, until they soften and take on some colour. Stir in the red curry paste, cumin, cinnamon and lemongrass, and fry, stirring often, for three minutes, to release the aromatics.Pour in the coconut milk, add the peanut butter and potatoes, then bring the mix to a simmer and cook gently for 15 minutes, until the potatoes are tender. Return the fried tofu to the pan, stir in and simmer for five minutes more.Put a couple of tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a medium heat until the oil is shimmering hot. Add all the chard, stir-fry for five minutes until the leaves wilt, then stir through the fish sauce.Pour a few tablespoons of fish sauce into a small bowl and add the sliced chilli.Serve the curry with rice in shallow bowls, with the chard mix spooned over the top and with the bowl of fish sauce and chilli alongside.Join Meera Sodha at aspecial eventcelebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted byNish Kumarand alongside writersStuart HeritageandTim Dowling, withGeorgina LawtonhostingYou Be The Judgelive.

It’s a fairytale city, not only because of the hilltop castle that overlooks its cobbled streets and half-timbered houses, but also because this is where the Grimm brothers once lived and studied, starting the collection of folklore stories that would eventually become their famous anthology of fairytales. Throughout the city, sculptures – some perched in improbable places – pay homage to this past, forming a mile-long route known as theGrimm Path. It’s very much like a treasure hunt.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But on my visit to Marburg, I had a different type of treasure hunt in mind and, once done with enchanted mirrors and kissy-lipped frogs, headed straight for theSecondHand by DRK(Deutsches Rotes Kreuz – the German Red Cross) to scout for pre-owned items.Whereas once there was a stigma to buying secondhand, nowadays it’s on trend. “Thrifted” has been tagged more than 7m times on Instagram, and accounts such as@charity_shop_lifeand@my.thrifted.abodehave tens of thousands of followers. According toBooking.com’s 2025 travel predictions, “Thrift shopping and vintage stores are becoming a core part of the travel experience, with 73% of travellers having already purchased secondhand items while abroad”. Google data also shows that searches for destination-specific secondhand shopping – “thrifting in Berlin” or “vintage markets in Stockholm”, for example – have skyrocketed.View image in fullscreenRita Brocante et Cantine, a restaurant-cum-thrift store in Marseille.Photograph: Image Broker/AlamyGuides and tour operators haven’t been slow to jump on board either – for £200,Fashion Tours Londonwill guide you around the capital’s secondhand stores for a whole day, whileRed Shed Vintage ToursandGold Crestwill set you loose on a variety of Frenchbrocantes(flea markets).But while curated tours suit some, for me it would dampen the thrill of exploring on my own. There is bounty almost everywhere, of course, but I’ve found France great for rustic kitchen and homewares, Madrid a good hunting ground for vintage designer accessories, while in Venice it’s glassware (there’s a tiny charity shop attached to a church where I almost always find genuine pre-loved Murano glass).The appeal of a tour also depends on how you feel about rummaging with others in tow. For me, it’s a bit like skiing: you don’t want to stop others from having a good time, but nor do you wantthemto affectyourgood time. Personally, when I’m in treasure-hunting mode, I prefer being alone, without someone sighing at my shoulder. I’ll just meet you at the bar later and reveal my finds, OK? “You’re a bit like Oscar the Grouch in the Muppets,” observed one friend. “Happiest alone in the bin.” Well, quite.‘You’re a bit like Oscar the Grouch in the Muppets,’ a friend observed. ‘Happiest alone in the bin’Whatever your MO, it always helps to do some research before you go – get acquainted with the names of the charity shops at your destination; look for Instagram accounts specialising in vintage. Use Google to search for pop-ups such as kilo sales, and in France usebrocabrac.frto look for brocantes calendars in the area you’re visiting – they generally move from location to location each weekend. This worked nicely for me in the summer, when the brass swans I’d been eyeing up one Sunday were still available the following week on the same stall – but in the next town.Google Lens can be helpful, too, in determining whether the item you’ve found is genuine or worth the price being asked. Towns with an ageing population, such as Kraków and Léon, tend to have the best bargains, while capital cities and those with a university will probably have higher prices, due to the number of avid shoppers. And generally speaking, the farther out of town you travel, the better the bargains will be. I also wander the streets surrounding weekend markets as residents often capitalise on the passing footfall to set up their own little garage sales.View image in fullscreenThorvaldsen Plads antique market in Copenhagen.Photograph: HelloWorld Images/AlamyI’ve been buying secondhand since my early teens and it still gives me a dopamine hit: in Germany I stumbled across an ostrich leather handbag for €2, right next to a synthetic Primark one tagged €3.50; in Romania I unearthed a silk Hermès scarf in a bin full of polyester ones; and in Greece I sifted through shelves of books to find a volume of beautiful botanical drawings. An angry rooster jug I picked up for 100 krone (£12) at a market in Copenhagen remains one of my most beloved purchases. Only recently did I discover he was made in Czechoslovakia in the 1930s and that others like him have sold for close to £200 on Etsy (although there’s no way I’m ever selling mine).One of the great delights of buying secondhand abroad is that you’ll uncover items not readily found at home and they make the best souvenirs. The vintage stoneware escargot dishes I nabbed in a market near Biarritz, for example, that now sit on my dresser holding my rings, remind me of that trip daily. I love, also, the interactions that such purchases spark. People on market stalls or in small shops tend to be far more engaging than staff in big chains and this often leads to interesting chats and fun exchanges.Honestly, who could leave a perfect, €10 cashmere coat or Italian leather boots that actually fit?“Non, non, ce n’est pas pour toi!” shrieked a woman, laughingly, at a flea market in Nantes, as I peered closely (too closely, in retrospect) at a small statue, trying to make sense of it, before realising it graphically depicted a sex act. “German,” scoffed the man on the stall in Copenhagen, as I examined a mustard pot in the form of a boy squatting with his pants down (the mustard was dispensed via his bottom).Of course, it’s very easy to get carried away, and you need to be mindful of what you can pack and carry. On a girls’ weekend in Lisbon a few years ago, theHumanasecondhand stores were so full of gems that some serious sitting on suitcases was required for the return journey – but, honestly, who in their right mind would leave an utterly perfect, €10 camel cashmere coat behind? Or a pair of Italian leather boots that actually fit?View image in fullscreenA flea market in central Athens.Photograph: Mario Guti/Getty ImagesThe really impossible items – furniture, huge mirrors and ornate frames – make me sad because even I have to admit there’s no way that chaise longue or antique dressing table can be squeezed into my bag (and where shipping is available, it tends to be from slicker operations with consequently higher prices). It may well be time for a driving holiday – in a lorry. And I doubt I’m the only one with such ideas: on a recent stay at a campsite in France, the noticeboard listed a week’s worth of local brocantes andvides-greniers(“empty attics” or car boot sales).As for the DRK in Marburg? Well, I didn’t strike gold on my own behalf – but I did for someone else. A few years ago, while travelling, I met an Australian woman as keen on secondhand shopping as I am. We’ve stayed in touch and she mentioned recently how much she likes Boden prints. Guess what was hiding on the rails? A blouse in a vibrant green pattern, tick; silk, tick; size, tick; one parcel winging its way to Oz, tick. Proof that thrifting isn’t just good for the planet and addictively fun – it’s a great way to make friends, too.Explore more on these topicsShopping tripsEurope holidaysVintage fashionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m in a coffee shop next to a petrol station, across the car park from the Travelodge where I spent the night, somewhere just north of Brighton. The middle leg of the band’s autumn tour is complete, and I’m on my way home. But first I want coffee.“Can I take a name?” says the woman behind the counter.“Um, yeah,” I say. “It’s Tim.”“Great!” she says. “Can I get you anything else today, Tim?”It’s always mildly humiliating to have a name like Tim used on you. It sounds deliberately belittling even when that is not the person’s intention. But it’s always deliberate on my part: whenever I meet someone called Tim, I use their name as much as I can: “Hi, Tim! How are things, Tim? So tell me, Tim, what have you been up to, Tim?”It feels good to offload a bit of that humiliation on to somebody else. It may sound callous, but in my experience everyone named Tim does this. If that sounds somehow disloyal, remember: there is no honour among Tims.I shuffle my way along to stand with the other waiting customers. Everyone, including me, is looking at their phones. Behind the counter, a staff member approaches us with a cup in her hands.I go upstairs to run a bath. As I’m turning the tap I notice a man staring at me through the window“I’ve got a latte here for the lovely Tim!” she says.Some days later, on a cold and rainy morning, I am drinking a latte I made myself, in my own kitchen, with the middle one sitting next to me. We are both silent, both staring at our laptops, and both holding our feet up in the air to stop the tortoise biting our toes. I’ve tried giving the tortoise some lettuce, but he’s ignored it in favour of rampaging between the chair legs in search of human flesh.My wife walks in with the dog at her heels.“Stop following me!” she shouts, turning around. “You’ve been fed!” The dog wanders to the far end of the kitchen and eats the tortoise’s lettuce.“It’s dog school this afternoon,” my wife says. “That will teach you.”“How’s dog school going?” I say.“The results have been mixed,” my wife says. “On the one hand, she’s attentive and eager to please.”“A swot,” I say.“But then all the dogs were given a toy each for training purposes, and she immediately disembowelled hers in front of everyone.”“Oh,” I say.“It was funny,” my wife says. “No one else laughed.”“I am never going to dog school,” I say.“Did you have any plans at all today?” she says. “Either of you?”“Work!” says the middle one, pointing at his screen.“I was thinking I might have a bath,” I say. “I’m still acclimatising.”“Acclimatising to what, exactly?” my wife says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She explains that Monkey was the beloved toy of a friend’s dog, but after a brief encounter with our dog Monkey is now an amputee.“So she was given the arm, as a prize?” I say.“What are they gonna do with it?” my wife says.“They could sew it back on,” I say.“There’s not that much left of Monkey,” she says. The dog steps between us, picks up Monkey’s arm and walks out of the room.“Bad dog,” I say.“Baby steps,” my wife says.“Ow!” says the middle one, as the tortoise bites down on his toe.I go upstairs to run a bath. As I’m turning the tap I notice a man staring at me through the window, his eyes just over the top of the frosted lower sash. He has something heavy in his raised hand; a piece of metal. I back out of the bathroom, and go to find my wife in her office.“The scaffolders are here, then,” I say.“They’ve been here all morning,” she says. “Didn’t you hear them?”I go out to my office shed, where I sit back in my chair and think: life was so much simpler back at the Travelodge. And at the coffee shop just across the car park, where everybody knew my name.Join Tim Dowlingand other Guardian journalists at a special live event hosted by Nish Kumar on 26 Nov.

But here they are, leaping and bouncing on a sunny hilltop in November.Autumn lambs have been a familiar part of country life in these parts for hundreds of years. As far back as the 17th century, sheep from west Dorset and south Somerset were renowned for their ability to lamb out of season, due to a genetic quirk which somehow arose in the region. With careful planning, healthy ewes could have three pregnancies in 24 months.They became a registered breed during the Victorian era. Local shepherds vied to name it after their own county, and Dorset won: in 1891 farmers near Bridport established theDorset Horn Sheep Breeders’ Associationand attracted the patronage of the queen herself.The lambs I see playing here are part of the longest-established Dorset Horn flock in the world, first registered in 1906 by Frederick Fooks. It is now managed by his great-grandson, Francis, who runs the farm with his brothers and nephews.View image in fullscreenFrancis Fooks with the flock.Photograph: Sara HudstonAs I watch, Francis sends his young border collie, Bea, racing in an arc to bring the animals closer. About a third of the adults have horns that spiral downwards in front of their ears like scaly ammonites. Those without horns arePoll Dorsets, a closely related variant originally created in Australia by crossing imported Dorset Horns with other pedigrees.“The Polls are easier to manage,” Francis explains, “they don’t get hooked up on things, or bash you in the legs. But there’s something about the Horns; they are very pleasing to the eye.”Both types have white faces and distinctive rosy nostrils and lips, a genetic legacy of the now extinct pink-nosed Somerset sheep that was lost in the rivalry of more than 100 years ago. These modern animals are chunky creatures, well upholstered with thick, creamy fleeces good for felting; some of their wool goes to a specialist firm in Yorkshire to make biodegradable coffins.Born in September, the lambs have already grown large and sturdy. By the time they are weaned in January, lambing will have started again with the other portion of the flock, but this time the scene will be more commonplace.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsFarmingCountry diaryFarm animalsRural affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Tanzanian government has said these figures were exaggerated but did not give its own figures.Chadema said its deputy secretary general, Amani Golugwa, was arrested by police on Saturday. Authorities are seeking the arrest of nine more people, including others in the party.Tanzanian authorities have charged more than 200 people with treason after last week’s protests – a charge that could carry the death penalty, though no executions have been carried out in the country since 1995.The incumbent president, Samia Suluhu Hassan, was deemed the winner of the election, with98% of the vote, but the opposition – which was barred from participating – condemned the results as fraudulent.Tanzania’s Hassan declared landslide winner in election that triggered violent protestsRead moreThe government claimed the elections were free and fair, but the main rivals were not allowed to run, and election observers said the vote was not democratic and cited instances of ballot stuffing.“The police force, in collaboration with other defence and security agencies, is continuing a serious manhunt to find all who planned, coordinated and executed this evil act,” a police spokesperson said in a statement.Chadema’s secretary general, John Mnyika, and the head of communications, Brenda Rupia, were among those wanted for arrest.The leader of Chadema, Tundu Lissu, wascharged with treasonin April and not allowed to run in the elections. The exclusion of Lissu and other political figures from the ballot fuelled the ensuing protests.According to Amnesty International, in the run-up to the elections, Tanzanian authorities carried out enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings.Protests were held on 29 October in cities across Tanzania, leading to violence and clashes with police, a statement from authorities said.Amnesty International said authorities cut off internet access and used excessive force in an attempt to suppress post-election protests.About 700 killed in Tanzania election protests, opposition saysRead moreRights groups said the government had cracked down on individuals perceived to be associated with the protests, including the prominent businesswoman Jenifer Jovin, who was accused of encouraging protesters to buy gas masks.President Samia acknowledged that there were deaths, but blamed the unrest on foreigners, stating: “It was not a surprise that those arrested were from other countries.”Despite the protests, Samia was sworn into office on Monday. Her inauguration ceremony was televised but closed to the public and held at a military parade ground in the capital.Samia became Tanzania’s first female president in 2021 after the then president, John Magufuli, died in office while she was his vice-president. She was initially praised by activists for easing political repression, but has since been accused of reversing course.Explore more on these topicsTanzaniaAfricaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

But unlike in previous elections, it was not the APNU that emerged as the main opposition force – it won only 12 seats – but Mohamed’s party, with 16.Last Monday, three days after Mohamed was arrested and released on bail, he was sworn in alongside the rest of the new congress. Hearrivedin the Lamborghini at the centre of an alleged mail fraud case against him, in which he is accused of submitting a false $75,300 invoice for a vehicle said to have cost $680,000.Although the US extradition request was issued last October, the investigation into Mohamed and his father began earlier, and the indictment is said to cover offences committed between 2017 and 2024.In June 2024, a shipment containing about $5.3m in gold bars sent from Guyana by Mohamed’s Enterprise wasseizedat Miami international airport. That same month, the Mohameds were sanctioned by the US Department of Treasury on charges of gold smuggling, evading more than $50m in taxes owed to the Guyanese government and bribing local public officials.At a press conference last week, vice-president Bharrat Jagdeo – who led the country between 1999 and 2011 –saidthe extradition request came from Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state.“You see his signature there? ‘Marco Rubio,’” he said. “It’s not a junior man in Florida … that’s the seriousness [of it] … We are part of a treaty. We are part of an international community that believes people must pay for their crimes,” said Jagdeo.Mohamed and his lawyers declined to comment to the Guardian, but have previously denied wrongdoing.In addition to describing the case as political persecution, his legal team has told local media that some of the offences listed in the US indictment are not crimes in Guyana and therefore Mohamed should not be subject to extradition. The lawyers said they intend to challenge the case at every level, including the constitutional court and, ultimately, the Caribbean court of justice.Wickham said the case is likely to drag on. “While it goes on, he [Mohamed] remains a member of parliament … and I think he will continue to make life as difficult as he can for the government in his role as opposition leader,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGuyanaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But the results are also a reminder for Carney, the wonkish economist, of the unpredictable and fortuitous realities of politics.François-Philippe Champagne, the finance minister, unveiled the Liberal government’s sprawling federal budget on Tuesday, explicitly acknowledging that a protracted trade war with the United States and a weakening domestic economy hadforced the government to run a deficit tens of billionslarger than initially forecast.Canada budget adds tens of billions to deficit as Carney spends to dampen Trump tariffs effectRead more“The level of uncertainty is higher than what we have seen and felt for generations,” he told lawmakers during his budget speech. “Bold and swift action is needed.”That action takes the form of billions in “generational investments” that would fundamentally reshape the nature of the country’s economy.In last December’s fiscal update, the federal deficit was projected to be C$42.2bn in 2025-26. But the Liberal plan will run a deficit of C$78.3bn in 2025-26. The government says it will aim to reduce the federal deficit to C$56.6bn by 2029-30.Leading up to the budget, Carney seemed uninterested in catering his budget to opposition parties that simultaneously argued it spent too much and too little.He has cultivated an image of a no-nonsense technocrat eager to focus on the economy without the distractions of politics.After Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative leader, lost his seat in the federal election, Carney oped to swiftly call a by-election, rather than forcing the top Tory to suffer in the political wilderness.“No games,” he said.But earlier this week Carney only controlled 169 seats – three short of the threshold required to pass a budget without help from opposition parties. Steven MacKinnon, the government house leader, warned the Liberals didn’t have the votes, and warned the country could face a Christmas election.On Tuesday, however Chris d’Entremont, a Conservative MP, crossed the floor to the Liberals in response to the budget.D’Entremont, who represents a riding in Nova Scotia, told reporters his decision was partly a repudiation of Poilievre’s brusque leadership and suggested there were other disaffected Conservatives.His defection was a key win for Carney’s Liberals, who govern with a parliamentary minority. With d’Entremont now sitting with the Liberals, the party needed the support of two lawmakers from other parties to pass this budget and avoid an election.Then on Thursday evening, as MPs were voting, Matt Jeneroux, a long-serving Edmonton MP, announced his surprise resignation just seven months after he was narrowly re-elected to “spend more time with his family”.He later denied rumours he had been forced out of the Conservative caucus following speculation he was considering leaving the Tories after meeting privately with Carney.“There’s no way this is just a coincidence,” Mark Gerretsen, the government whip told reporters, adding Poilievre was seeing progressive lawmakers in his ranks “abandon” the party.Rumours of discontent within the Conservative caucus have persisted, alongside reports that Liberals are looking to woo over disgruntled Tory MPs.Carney himself appeared more willing to play politics, telling reporters he would “speak to anyone publicly or otherwise” who might support his legislative goals.“Carney is not a lifelong politician and that was part of his appeal to voters in the spring election. He presents himself as being above the partisan games that characterize Canadian politics,” said Lori Turnbull, director of Dalhousie University’s school of public administration. But his decision to shift the Liberal party towards a focus on the economy, and fiscal responsibility helped him able to attract moderate conservatives.“They have a lot in common with Carney.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasMark CarneynewsShareReuse this content"

A terminal spokesperson said it had robust processes to ensure due diligence and was fully compliant with applicable laws and sanctions.Neither disclosed how Macquarie had financially benefited from its investment in the terminal or guaranteed the terminal had sold no Russian oil to Australia, when asked.Kateryna Argyrou, chair of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations, called on Macquarie Bank to review its investment and disclose whether the terminal had facilitated the handling of Russian oil.“Australia cannot stand with Ukraine while Australian capital helps sustain Russia’s war economy,” Argyrou said.“Every drop of Russian oil sold helps finance the destruction of Ukrainian homes and lives.

Spokespeople for Vitol, Viva Energy and Trafigura each said their businesses acted in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including sanctions.They did not guarantee they had not bought or sold Russian-origin oil products to Australian businesses, consumers and government agencies, when asked.Trafigura’s spokesperson said it did not trade with sanction-designated entities and Vitol’s spokesperson said it had rigorous policies and sought an open and transparent relationship with authorities wherever it operated.The foreign minister, Penny Wong, has called on businesses to ensure their supply chains do not indirectly fund the Russian government.“Australians do expect that their businesses ensure that their supply chains don’t inadvertently fund Russia’s illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine. Businesses should uphold that responsibility and expectation,” Wong told Senate estimates in October.She refused to commit to further restricting the trade, saying the government would struggle to trace indirect purchases.

More than 300 metres long and capable of carrying about 60 aircraft, the £5.4bn super-vessel placesChinasecond among the world’s navies, with three aircraft carriers, though still a long way behind the global leader, the US, which has 11.China’s latest aircraft carrier enters service to extend reach into high seasRead moreYet for all the great power projection of the new warship, nearly 5,000 miles away from its home port another conflict appears to suggest size may not matter. In the Black Sea, Ukraine achieved an extraordinary military success byinflicting a “functional defeat” on Russia’s naval fleetusing swarms of skilfully targeted sea drones.The contradiction, however, is likely to be more apparent than real. In a new era of state competition, and in particular the growing rivalry between China and the US, for all their size and expense, aircraft carriers remain an attractive resource for projecting power and conducting harder edged diplomacy.This is why the US president, Donald Trump, ordered the USS Gerald R Ford – at $12.8bn the world’s largest and most expensive warship – to sail to Venezuela to intimidate the country’s regime. Capable of carrying 70 aircraft, able to operate up to 125 sorties at peak, and with four destroyers in support, the manoeuvre was so unusual it raised the question of whether the force on display would be used against President Nicolas Maduro.It is also the reason why there has been so much interest in the building and testing of the Fujan, whose formal launch earlier this week was attended by China’s president, Xi Jinping. It is a demonstration of Beijing’s fast-growing military power: its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning,completed in 2012, was built from a hulk first made in the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and sold on by Ukraine after its collapse.Ironically, as Nick Childs of the International Institute for Strategic Studies notes, China has also invested heavily in anti-ship missiles to try to protect its coast from the US. But, he says, Beijing clearly sees “aircraft carriers as an indispensable element in building a navy that can independently project power and influence globally”, because they remain “unrivalled in their flexibility” and are “incredibly useful in a whole range of potential conflict scenarios” – one of which may one day be an attempt to force a reunification with Taiwan.The UK, which completed the build and deployment of two aircraft carriers for £6.2bn four years ago, has far less global power, making its military need less obvious. Neither ship was deployed during the Middle East conflict of the past two years, though their construction secured jobs in Scotland’s shipyards during the 2010s. Their use so far has been as a form of floating diplomacy, as demonstrated by the visit by HMS Prince of Wales to Tokyo in August to impress allies rather than to intimidate.For now, aircraft carriers are not expected to meet a military threat with the tactical sophistication of Ukraine, never mind a peer-level opponent. Houthi rebels in Yemen attacked the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier and its support destroyers with drones in the Red Sea earlier this year. But the most serious damage doneduring the attack was not to the warship, but to a $70m F/A-18E Super Hornet fighterthat fell overboard when the carrier turned to avoid incoming fire.Destroyers, such as the Royal Navy’s HMS Diamond, which specialise in shooting down incoming drones, form the heart of the carrier strike groups that protect the mother ship. In theory, even if struck, carriers are designed to be hard to sink. The Soviet rule of thumb in the cold war was that it would take12 conventional missilesto bring down a super-carrier; while it took four weeks for the US to sink USS America in 2005, a test in which the American vessel was shot at in an effort to establish how resilient it was in practice.As for the Black Sea, the Ukrainian success came against a small, poorly organised navy, far weaker certainly than the US or China. Russia does not possess a functioning aircraft carrier, and has not had one since 2017 when the 40-year-old Admiral Kuznetsov put in for repair. The country’s shipbuilding chief said it was likely to be scrapped or sold. The failure to modernise or replace it is a demonstration of wider Russian geopolitical, military and economic weaknesses.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

But if the state Coalition tears itself apart over net zero, she could be left talking up a fractured oppositionGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastSat 8 Nov 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Nov 2025 19.32 ESTShareCompared with their federal colleagues, theNew South WalesCoalition has been a relatively collegial conservative political grouping. But no more.Over the next fortnight, the NSW Liberals could well dump their leader, Mark Speakman, and face the almost impossible task of reconciling divergent positions on net zero emissions with junior coalition partner the Nationals. There is a real prospect that the state opposition could fracture.It’s likely to be an ugly two weeks, and the Labor premier, Chris Minns, will be delighted as he sits back and watches the chaos that is already trashing the Liberal brand in Canberra come to Macquarie Street.The first drama to play out will be the Nationals’ party room discussion of net zero policy on Monday and Tuesday.It is almost certain the Nationals will abandon or water down their commitment to the point that it becomes meaningless.Thegrassroots Nationals voted in June to abandon net zeroby 2050 and the NSW Nationals leader, Dugald Saunders, faces increasingly angry backbenchers whose electorates are resentful about windfarms, large-scale solar and transmission lines, which they see as being foisted on the regions to provide power for the cities.Lose moderate voters or face another Coalition break-up? Sussan Ley is dogged by bad options and bad timingRead moreThe anger is being stoked by conservative groups such as Advance, which announced six months ago that it would overturn net zero and return Australia to a coal-fired past.Until now, NSW had enjoyed bipartisan support for the 2020 energy transition roadmap, which was put in place by the previous Coalition government.But, with the federal Coalition eating itself alive over climate change policy and Donald Trump walking away from the Paris agreement, the NSW roadmap is in real trouble.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe question is whether the more moderate Saunders, who has a slender hold on the leadership, will survive or be replaced by the more conservative Paul Toole. And if he stays, what price is he prepared to pay in terms of concessions on policy?Meanwhile, there is trouble afoot for the senior Coalition partner, the NSW Liberals.Unlike the federal Liberals, who seem to revel in their self-destruction, the NSW division is walking reluctantly toward a leadership change.View image in fullscreenMark Speakman.Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAPThere is a view that Speakman, while well liked, lacks cut-through and has failed to take the shine off Minns.A new Resolve poll, out this week, is likely to show a further slide in the Coalition primary vote (hardly surprising in the light of the comprehensive trashing of the brand by the feds).InJuly, the NSW Coalition slumped to 32% primary vote, compared with 38% for Labor, which analysts said could result in a loss of about 10 seats. That makes MPs in marginal seats nervous and those in safer ones facing at least two more terms in opposition, absent a massive reversal of fortune.Thefederal Coalition now has a primary voteof just 24%, according to Newspoll, so the NSW Liberals fear it could get worse for them too.Speakman’s demise, if it happens, won’t materialise until the second week of this last sitting period.His fellow moderates are hoping he can be persuaded to resign, and the new leader slotted in without facing question time, giving them the Christmas break to settle in.The new leader is likely to be the first-term MP for Vaucluse, Kellie Sloane – a moderate who has cut through as a communicator and clearly got up Minns’ nose from time to time.View image in fullscreenVaucluse MP Kellie Sloane is tipped to become the new leader of the NSW Liberals.Photograph: Flavio Brancaleone/AAPThe former Channel Nine journalist is personable, good at delivering lines, has worked hard in her health portfolio and doesn’t shy away from a bit of a skirmish in parliament.That’s a contrast to Speakman, who struggled to get airtime and whose lawyerly attacks were easily swatted away by Minns, who largely prosecutes his case through the tabloids and on 2GB.Those backing Sloane hope that her better relations with the Daily Telegraph and 2GB’s Ben Fordham will combat, or at least neutralise, the unfettered run that Minns gets.But Sloane is also a political neophyte. She’s been in parliament less than three years, and is a relatively new recruit to the party.A cleanskin can be great, but no experience as a minister, not having a history with the factions and not having lived through a few political crises will make it tough.RememberJodi McKay, the former Labor leaderand former journalist who was put in as opposition leader to deodorise the whiff of corruption around Labor?McKay had been a minister and in parliament for nine years before she became leader, yet as an outsider to the Labor familyshe was chewed up and spat out by the factionsand by the highly effective premier of the day, Gladys Berejiklian.The public glimpsed how bitter NSW Liberal factional infighting can be ahead of the 2022 federal election.Preselection fightsspilled into the news.Why does it matter for the parliamentary leader? Because not having a functioning party machine, and having factional brawls over everything from preselections to broad ideology is corrosive to running an effective government or opposition.Then there is the difficult dance with the Nationals that will be even more problematic, if, as expected, the Nationals dump net zero.Speakman has done his best to avoid a showdown with the Nationals over issues like feral horses and thegreat koala national parkby agreeing to disagree.But managing divergent policies on fundamental issues like climate change and energy is a big ask.‘Not over’: Liberal MPs fearing calamity in city electorates launch rearguard action to salvage net zero policyRead moreHow do the urban Liberals avoid a teal wave on the north shore and elsewhere when voters have shown they are willing to shift on climate policy, especially if they perceive that the National party is wagging the dog?There is talk in Macquarie Street of a possible split from the Nationals, as one solution.It might make things easier in the short term but longer term it makes it even harder to find common ground on policy and eventually convince voters to return the conservatives to government.Speakman, or more likely Sloane, will need to navigate this minefield. The risk for Sloane is that inexperience will cause slips that will leave her damaged, ineffective and eventually dispensable.Anne Davies is Guardian Australia’s NSW state correspondentExplore more on these topicsNew South Wales politicsNew South WalesLiberal partyanalysisShareReuse this content"

The 75-year-old had booked a nearby hotel, about 1.5km away, to spend the night after the late arrival.Heron grabbed his bag, left the airport and wandered over to the taxi rank across from the Virgin Australia terminal about half an hour later. A worker at the rank directed him to a taxi waiting in a bay. But Heron said the cab refused his fare because the trip was too short.“He said, ‘oh no, you need to walk there’,” Heron recalled of the driver in a phone call with Guardian Australia. “Straight outside the Virgin terminal was the taxi rank, and it wasn’t very busy at all. There were lots of taxis.”Heron was instead directed to another taxi waiting in the rank. He said he got the same response.Fare game: what the battle between taxis and Uber means for your airport trip in Sydney and MelbourneRead more“How am I going to walk there, alone at night, along a pathway I don’t know?” he said. “It was a maze of roads, footpaths, no lights, so it would not be an easy thing at 11 o’clock at night to get there in the dark.“And besides, I’m quite happy to pay for a taxi.”Heron eventually did manage to get into a cab after speaking with a supervisor at the rank and snapping photographs of the two cabs that allegedly denied him a fare. The ride to the Moxy Hotel near the airport was less than five minutes, but he said he paid about $28, which he was happy to do.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailA worker at the hotel, who declined to give their name, said difficulties getting taxis to and from the Moxy were a known problem.“If it’s from domestic, they usually walk,” the manager said of customers who stay at the hotel. If travellers want a ride, he usually suggest guests take an Uber.The New South Wales government’s point to point transport commissionerissued 12 fare refusal penalty noticesbetween January and June of this year, the latest period it has released data for on the matter. It issued 58 similar penalties last year, with more than a third of those in December alone.In total, the commission has issued more than 1,200 fines in recent years.The fine for taxi drivers for the first fare-related offence will be increased from $1,000 to $3,000 in an effort to deter drivers from overcharging, refusing fares or failing to use their meters.The commission told Guardian Australia all passengers have the right to hire a taxi from a rank, including at Sydney airport, “regardless of how short the journey may be”. There are onlycertain limited circumstanceswhere journeys can be refused.The commission said in a statement that “the vast majority of taxi drivers in NSW do the right thing”. However, to support a new$60 flat fare to the CBD trial, which launched on Monday, “authorised officers are out in force at Sydney airport, conducting both plainclothes and highly visible operations”.If a passenger is refused service due to a short fare, the agency said, they are encouraged to note the taxi’s number plate, company name and report the incident to the point to point’s taxi fare hotline.Nick Abrahim, the CEO of the NSW Taxi Council, said the majority of drivers do the right thing when it comes to accepting fares. It was unacceptable for any driver to fail to uphold industry standards and not abide by the law, he said.“We don’t tolerate that,” Abrahim said. “Whatever rationale the driver has, however long they’ve been waiting, that is not the fault of any passenger … and in actual fact, it is breaking the law.“We are there to serve passengers, regardless of where they’re going, or regardless of how far that trip may be.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The council is actively working on a solution to support drivers and ensure passengers can get a ride when and where they need it, including some type of a short fare system.But, he said, drivers must follow the law.A new trial for fixed taxi fares from the rank at Sydney airport to the city’s CBD began on 3 November, widely seen as an effort tohelp cabs remain competitivewith rideshare services. For 18 months, passengers travelling to a defined area in the CBD will be charged a set fare of $60 for a standard taxi or $80 for a maxi taxi.That fare includes all road tolls, fees, levies and taxes, except for credit card or payment surcharges.Asked about incidents like Heron’s,Sydney airportsaid in a statement to Guardian Australia that it takes fare refusal and passenger rights “seriously”.“All passengers are entitled to a metered fare at regulated rates,” an airport spokesperson said. They urged passengers to report any driver who refuses a trip or fails to use the meter.Sydney airport recently introduced a taxi concierge program, in partnership with the taxi council and the commissioner, to ensure drivers accepted all fares and operated meters correctly.Heron said he understood the taxis’ point of view, but said some trips were long, and some were short.“If that is a problem for short trips, maybe put a surcharge on it,” he suggested.“I don’t mind paying a surcharge. In fact, I’d give him a generous tip if he’s a good guy.”Have you had a driver refuse to take you on a short trip?

But it’s a tool and we should not treat it as so many others … have: in a rather undisciplined, romantic way.”Williams warned that technology can encompass the values of those who create or control it, and said he was concerned what this might mean for AI.“There are many value constructs that are reflected in AI that can be seen in some ways as being potentially dangerous and sinister,” he said.“Many of the participants in the financing – and even in the origination and leadership of some of the AI [companies] – have unusually severe views of human organisation and politics, and in some instances … have views that are extremely autocratic, and believe in an anointed few being in charge of the many.”ABC executive who sacked Antoinette Lattouf paid $836,000 for eight-month employment, annual report showsRead moreWilliams said that as a believer in democracy and the contest of ideas, it’s “clearly immensely socially dangerous” for people to limit and censor the views of those they disagree with.“We should not underestimate the potency and power of these technologies – and we are seeing living examples of the technologies in the hands of some governments, where we have real life demonstrations of just how dangerous this can be.”Asked whether, he thought media organisations – includingNews Corpandthe Guardian– should be signing deals with AI companies, Williams said everyone needed to carry the responsibility of using these technologies with a sense of the public and national interest.“I speak about it openly with colleagues because I think these things are immensely important.”View image in fullscreenKim Williams says: ‘I think the impact on journalism will probably be a lot more benign.

You’ve got to pay people who have invested their lifetimes in creating works.”Williams said he saw AI as potentially devastating for entry-level jobs in industries such as accounting or law, but he believed the effect on journalism jobs would not be as damaging.“I think the impact on journalism will probably be a lot more benign. Well, actually, a lot more positive than people think because journalists are smart, perspicacious people, and they’ll figure out ways that AI will actually make them better and stronger and will improve journalism,” he said.“But boy, in so many other areas, I just think it can be an employment destroyer.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Broadcasting CorporationAustralian medianewsShareReuse this content"

It is exploring procuring its own software – which the council estimates could cost $500,000 to set up, not including ongoing subscriptions.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailBrisbane City council’s environment chair, Tracy Davis, said the “reckless and dangerous” change would end vital access to real-time flood data and called on the federal government to intervene.“Scrapping this service to councils could mean the end of creek alerts and leave lives at risk,” Davis said.“This is cost shifting with potentially deadly consequences.”When asked to respond to the council’s concerns, a spokesperson for the BoM said: “Flood warning data information will continue to be published for free on the bureau’s website”.“Under the Meteorology Act 1955, the Bureau of Meteorology provides riverine flood forecasts and warnings across Australia. Flash flood warnings are a local and state government responsibility,” the statement said.The Gold Coast City council estimated the cost of replacing Enviromon at about $600,000 over five years.Its mayor, Tom Tate, called on the federal government to meet those costs as “the BoM is a commonwealth responsibility”.“We are doing our bit but we need all levels of government to continue to fund critical disaster management infrastructure,” he said.How historic is what we’re seeing in the Queensland floods? It’s hard to grasp the full magnitudeRead moreThe Local Government Association ofQueenslandchief executive officer, Alison Smith, called on BoM to “provide an equivalent replacement service” to local governments across the state.“When weather events are becoming more frequent and more severe it simply does not make sense that a service taxpayers have already funded wants to charge for emergency information,” Smith said.“The BoM has a core role as a national provider of public weather and environmental information.”Unlike in Queensland, where flood warnings are the responsibility of local government, in New South Wales that role falls to the State Emergency Service.A NSW SES spokesperson said the organisation used Enviromon software and was “working with the bureau as we transition to alternative arrangements”.A Victorian SES spokesperson said it did not use Enviromon.BoM said Enviromon no longer met “basic cybersecurity, stability and resilience standards required of a flood forecast and warning system”.“As a result, the Bureau has been engaging with external users to support them through the transition,” the spokesperson said. “The individual user requirements will determine the option that works best for them.”The software change will not just affect local government. Seqwater – which manages dams and reservoirs in south-east Queensland and works in flood mitigation, including the release of water during times of flood – uses Enviromon but is now trialling a product by the company behind OneRain as a replacement.The office of the federal environment minister, Murray Watt, referred questions to BoM.The controversy over Enviromon comes asthe BoM faced another storm of criticismover its new $86m website. The Bureauapologised for the handling of the redesignlast month and promised to make changes after Watt said the website was “not meeting many users’ expectations”.“After failures such as the website for such a high amount of money, we have concerns about the internal processes of checking and validating any technology BoM seeks to roll out,” the shadow emergency management minister, Ross Cadell, said.Cadell said BoM should have made sublicensing to councils and dependent organisations a precondition of its contract when looking to replace Enviromon.OneRain Australia director James Logan said Enviromon was no longer “a viable platform”. Written over 30 years ago, he said it required outdated versions of Microsoft Windows that were insecure and could not meet modern requirements.Logan said the councils had several choices, including other private companies, and that his was just one option.“In general, it’s a good thing that there is a process to get everybody to update to some new software that has more capability than Enviromon has,” he said.Explore more on these topicsQueenslandAustralia weatherFloodingMeteorologynewsShareReuse this content"

Three were killed in the south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region, regional officials said.Energy infrastructure in Kyiv, Poltava and Kharkiv regions was damaged by the strikes, according to the Ukrainian prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko.Energy companies were working to restore electricity, water and heating provision, while several cities resorted to generators to keep the power on. Kremenchuk and Horishni Plavni in the central Poltava region, were using generators to maintain water supplies, municipal officials said.Map of frontlineZelenskyy called for more sanctions after the strikes. “For every Moscow strike on energy infrastructure – aimed at harming ordinary people before winter – there must be a sanctions response targeting all Russian energy, with no exceptions,” he said.Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy sector have increased in recent months, with the military attacking gas facilities nine times in the past two months, according to the state energy firm Naftogaz.On Saturday, Ukrainian drones hit an electricity substation in northern Russia and separately wounded two other people in a strike on a residential building in the city of Saratov.Russia claimed its “massive strike” was on Ukrainian weapons production and energy facilities. It also said it had captured a village in eastern Ukraine as its forces there continued to gradually push on the frontline.Despite US pressure for a ceasefire, negotiations for a permanent truce in Ukraine have faltered.

They are its alleged failure to implement and enforce an effective anti-racism policy and the organisation of clubs in occupied Palestinian territories without the consent of the Palestinian FA.Fraught, tense and visceral: there’s never been a football match quite like Maccabi’s visit to Aston Villa | Barney RonayRead moreThe resolution was backed by 74 votes, with seven opposed and two abstentions, the FAI said in a statement.Uefahas yet to comment on the vote.Uefa paused plans to ban Israelfrom European football at the end of September after the announcement of Donald Trump’s proposed peace plan for the region. Uefa never officially confirmed that it was considering an extraordinary meeting of its executive committee to vote on the issue, but plans on the proposal were understood to be well developed, with any meeting expected to have been called at short notice.RTÉ, Ireland’s national broadcaster, reported that the FAI statement said: “In an extraordinary general meeting of the Football Association of Ireland, an ordinary resolution was posed to members of the FAI General Assembly. It passed by a majority – 74 in favour, seven against, two abstained.”RTÉ added that the FAI said it intended to “submit a formal motion to the Uefa executive committee requesting the immediate suspension of the Israel Football Association from Uefa competitions due to its violating two independent provisions of the Uefa statutes”.It went on to list them as the “organisation of clubs in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank without the consent of the Palestinian Football Association, in breach of Fifa statutes (Article 73) and Uefa statutes (Article 5)” and “the failure of the IFA to implement and enforce an effective anti-racism policy, in breach of Uefa statutes (Article 7bis)“.The Irish resolution follows calls in September from the heads of the Turkish and Norwegian governing bodies for Israel to be suspended from international competition. Those requests came after United Nations experts appealed to Fifa and Uefa to suspend Israel from international football, citing a UN commission of inquiry report that said Israel had committed genocide during the war in Gaza. Israel has denied committing genocide and described the report as scandalous.If Uefa decided to ban Israel, it would put the organisation on a collision course with the government of the United States – co-hosts for the 2026 World Cup – which strongly opposes such an action. Even though Europe’s governing body has the power to suspend Israel or its clubs from the region’s competitions, it may not be able to stop them from competing in World Cup qualifiers, which is overseen by Fifa.Explore more on these topicsUefaFootball politicsIsraelIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A recent YouGov poll suggested voters were more worried about migration than the state of economy.The Labour government also faces significant challenges from Nigel Farage’s Reform party, which is ahead in the polls. Reform promises to radically overhaul the immigration system if it gains power, most notably scrapping the right of migrants to qualify for permanent settlement in the UK after five years.Who is granted asylum in Denmark?After excluding data from 2020, when significant travel restrictions were in place because of the pandemic, the number of people granted asylum in Denmark is at a 40-year low.People targeted personally by foreign regimes are normally given protection by Denmark but this is often on a temporary basis, with the government reserving the right to return an asylum seeker to their home country when it is deemed safe.For example, in 2022, the Danish government told about 1,200 refugees from Damascus, Syria, that they would be returned after it judged there was no longer a risk to them in the region. This decision was at odds with the positions taken by the UN and the EU.Can refugees bring family members to Denmark?This is permitted under certain circumstances, but the rules are very tight. Refugees normally have to demonstrate they can’t live safely with their partner or children in another country.There are various criteria a refugee must meet to bring their partner to Denmark, which the government says were designed in part to guard against forced marriages. Both must be at least 24 and have passed a Danish language test. The refugee in Denmark must not have claimed benefits for three years and be in a position to put up a financial guarantee.Why have Denmark’s immigration rules attracted controversy?Some feel Danish laws penalise people from certain ethnic groups. Refugees who live in housing estates earmarked as “parallel societies”, where more than half of the people are from “non-western” backgrounds, are not eligible for family reunion.The law also enables the state to demolish apartment blocks within these estates. Although the Danish government says this is designed to encourage integration, an EU official recently raised concerns about potential discrimination.How is the Danish approach viewed by the left of the Labour party?Although Denmark’s immigration policies were designed by the centre-left Social Democrats, and are seen as key to the party maintaining power, they have faced vehement criticism from the left of the British Labour party.The Norwich South MP, Clive Lewis, said the Social Democrats had “adopted many of the talking points of what we would call the far right”. Nadia Whittome, the MP for Nottingham East, said copying the Danish system would be “a dead end – morally, politically and electorally”.Do any Labour MPs support the plans?Some Labour MPs, particularly in “red wall” seats where support for Reform is strong, have welcomed the possibility of moving closer to a Danish model. The Bassetlaw MP Jo White, who is chair of the Red Wall Caucus, said the party would be “annihilated” by Reform if it failed to tighten immigration rules. Gareth Snell, the MP for Stoke-on-Trent, said the plans were “worth exploring”, and that his constituents found the current system “inherently unfair”.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeDenmarkMigrationLabourReform UKEuropeexplainersShareReuse this content"

Denmark’s tighter rules on family reunions and restricting some refugees to a temporary stay are among the policies being looked at.Mahmood will announce the changes later this month, according to the BBC, which firstreportedthe plans.Why does UK government want to copy Denmark’s immigration system?Read moreThe proposals have drawn scorn from someLabourMPs, particularly from those on the left of the party, who said it was a “dangerous path” to take, although others want the government to go further.In Denmark, refugees who have been personally targeted by a foreign regime are more likely to be given protection, while those fleeing conflicts are usually only allowed to remain in the country on a temporary basis. Denmark itself decides what is a safe country.In 2022, the Danish governmentnotifiedabout 1,200 refugees from Damascus in Syria that their residency permits would not be renewed because, breaking with the UN and EU, it judged the region to be safe for refugees to return.UKHome Officeofficials have also been drawn to Denmark’s tighter rules for family reunions. When a refugee granted residency rights wants their partner to join them, there are numerous thresholds that must be met. Both people must be age 24 and above, the partner in Denmark must not have claimed benefits for three years and also has to put up a financial guarantee. Both partners must also pass a Danish language test.Denmark has also barred those who live in housing estates designatedas “parallel societies” by the government – where more than 50% of residents are from what it considers to be “non-western” backgrounds – from being granted family reunion.In 2021, Denmarkpasseda law enabling it to process asylum seekers outside Europe, which drew anger from human rights advocates, the UN and theEuropean Commission.The Labour MPClive Lewiswas deeply critical of the British government’s plans to adopt the Danish system in an effort to outflank Reform UK.“Denmark’s Social Democrats have gone down what I would call a hardcore approach to immigration,” he said. “They’ve adopted many of the talking points of what we would call the far right.“Labour does need to win back some Reform-leaning voters but you can’t do that at the cost of losing progressive votes.”Nadia Whittome, the Labour MP for Nottingham East and a member of Labour’s Socialist Campaign Group, said it would be a “dangerous path” to take and that some of the Danish policies, especially those around “parallel societies”, are “undeniably racist”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One importer said delays were adding £200 of costs to each load.There are also warnings that trees and shrubs are repeatedly being damaged when unloaded and reloaded on to lorries during the inspection process.Since Brexit, deliveries of animal and plant products between Britain and the EU have required paperwork and been subject to stringent inspections at the border as a part ofsanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) controls.All plant products rated as high or medium risk – including bedding plants, cut flowers and bark – are inspected, with the checks aimed at enhancing Britain’s biosecurity and preventing harmful plant and animal diseases from entering the country.However, several traders said they were facing significant problems during border controls at Sevington, including trucks stuck there for several days before being released.A recent shipment of olive trees from a nursery in Pistoia in Italy, destined for Premier Plants near Chelmsford in Essex, was held up for five days, according to the company’s co-founder Karl Clark.“It’s frustrating and adds cost. We have been importing plants from Italy for over 20 years and never had these sorts of problems beforeBrexit,” Clark said.John Davidson, the finance director at Tom Brown Wholesale, which brings daily deliveries of cut flowers and plants into the UK from the Netherlands through Sevington, said delays at the border post “go in waves”.“Three weeks ago we had three delays in a row, but the following week was fine,” he said. “An hour or two delay can really set us back in our business.”The latestdelaysat Sevington come at a busy time for importing plants, following a lull during the warm summer months when larger shrubs and trees tend not to be exported from the EU.Premier Plants, which supplies landscape designers, developers and local councils, said recurring delays at the border risked making the company unreliable, while also adding costs. Clark estimates delays add an extra £200 to each load, on top of transport charges and administrative expenses.“Luckily, at this time of year the delays are not too disastrous, but you can imagine what it is like in the summer; the plants are going to cook or dry out,” Clark said.Marco Innocenti’s family-run nursery in Tuscany is one of Premier Plants’ suppliers and delivers to the UK twice a week.When one of its most recent shipments arrived with customers after checks in Sevington, some potted plants inside the lorry were upside down, while others had broken branches. Innocenti called this “unacceptable” and blamed the damage on the truck being “unloaded and reloaded carelessly”.“We cannot continue this way,” he said. “The authorities must recognise the seriousness of this issue.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Companies importing goods subject to SPS controls are required to pay a “common user charge” for using the facility, which is £29 for each species in a consignment, whether it is checked or not, and is capped at £145 for each delivery.Following construction, the facility was described as a “white elephant” and wasnot used for some timeafter the UK repeatedlydelayed the introductionof physical checks on plant and animal products from the EU.However, these finally began in April 2024 and traders have reported a significant increase in items requiring inspection in recent months, since the announcement ofKeir Starmer’s “reset” dealwith the EU.Industry body the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) and many plant traders say an SPS agreement with the EU thatcould remove the need for border checksas part of the “reset” cannot come soon enough, although this may not be implemented until 2027.“The last few weeks have not been good at Sevington,” one logistics company told the Guardian. “Some companies are struggling with the costs and with damage. In the end some exporters are maybe going to say ‘sorry, we give up on the UK.’”The outsourcing firm Sodexo was awarded the £184.5m contract by the government to run Sevington for three years from July 2023 on behalf of HM Revenue and Customs, and is also responsible for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) border control posts located on the site.The Swiss-headquartered logistics company Kuehne + Nagel handles vehicle inspection at Sevington under a deal with Sodexo. Kuehne + Nagel and Sodexo did not respond to requests for comment.The government is reviewing its procedures at border control posts, the Guardian understands. The government is also understood to claim that any complaints about damage are investigated, with a response provided to the trader as soon as possible.A government spokesperson said: “Protecting UK biosecurity remains one of our key priorities. We are working with border control posts to ensure they operate effectively, and with traders to ensure checks are completed efficiently, swiftly and without significant delays.“We are focused on negotiating an SPS deal that could add up to £5.1bn a year to our economy, by cutting costs and reducing red tape for British producers and retailers.”Explore more on these topicsBrexitHMRCEuropean UnionInternational tradeKentEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He is expected to join an anti-Islamic State US-led coalition.The US state department and Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The US envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, said this month that Sharaa would “hopefully” sign an agreement to join the international US-led alliance against Islamic State.The state department’s decision on Friday to remove Sharaa from the blacklist was widely expected.A spokesperson said Sharaa’s government had been meeting US demands, including on working to find missing Americans and on eliminating any remaining chemical weapons.On Thursday, Washington led a vote by the Security Council to remove UN sanctions against him.Formerly affiliated with al-Qaida, Sharaa’s group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, was delisted as a terrorist group by Washington in July.Washington is preparing to establish a military presence at an airbase in Damascus to help enable a security pact the US is brokering between Syria and Israel, six sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters.A US administration official also previously said Washington was constantly evaluating its necessary posture in Syria to effectively combat Islamic State.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIslamic StateMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The far-right security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, ordered it back into service after the 7 October attacks in 2023.The cells, a tiny exercise “yard” and a lawyers’ meeting room are all underground, so inmates live without any natural light.The jail was initially designed for a small number of high-security inmates occupying individual cells, holding 15 men when it shut in 1985. In recent months, about 100 detainees have been incarcerated there, official data obtained by PCATI shows.Under the ceasefire agreed in mid-October, Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners who had been convicted in Israeli courts, and 1,700 Palestinian detainees fromGazawho had been held indefinitely without charge or trial. The young trader held at Rakefet was among them.However, the scale of detentions has been so vast that even after that mass release, at least 1,000 others are still held by Israel under the same conditions, including the nurse represented by PCATI.View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers stand by a truck used to transport Palestinian detainees, who have been stripped, bound and blindfolded.Photograph: Moti Milrod/AP“Though the war is officially over, [Palestinians from Gaza] are still imprisoned under legally contested and violent wartime conditions that violate international humanitarian law and amount to torture,” PCATI said.The two men who met PCATI lawyersin September were a 34-year-old nurse detained while at work in a hospital in December 2023 and a young trader seized in October 2024 as he passed through an Israeli checkpoint.“In the cases of the clients we visited, we are speaking about civilians,” said the PCATI lawyer Janan Abdu. “The man I spoke to was an 18-year-old who worked selling food. He was taken from a checkpoint on a road.”Ben-Gvir had told Israeli media and a member of parliament that Rakefet was being rehabilitated to hold Nukhba – meaning “elite” – Hamas fighters who led massacres inside Israel Oct 7th, and Hezbollah special forces fighters captured in Lebanon.Israeli officials said no Palestinians involved in the 2023 attacks were released under the ceasefire deal that resulted in the teenage prisoner being returned to Gaza.end newThe Israeli Prison Service (IPS) did not respond to questions about the status and identity of other prisoners held at Rakefet, which means “cyclamen flower” in Hebrew.‘Cruellest forms of torture’: freed Palestinians describe horrors of Israeli jailRead moreClassified Israeli dataindicatesthe majority of Palestinians taken prisoner in Gaza during the war were civilians. Israel’s supreme courtruled in 2019that it was lawful to hold the bodies of Palestinians as bargaining chips for future negotiations, and rights groups have accused it of doing the same with living detainees from Gaza.Unique abuseConditions for Palestinians were “horrific by intention” at all prisons, said Tal Steiner, the executive director of PCATI. Current and formerdetainees, andwhistleblowersfrom the Israeli military, have all detailedsystemic violationsof international law.However, Rakefet imposes a unique form of abuse. Holding people below ground without daylight for months on end has “extreme implications” for psychological health, Steiner said. “It’s very hard to remain intact when you are held in such oppressive and difficult conditions.”It alsoaffects physical health, impairing basic biological functions from circadian rhythms needed for sleep to vitamin D production.Despite working as a human rights lawyer, and visiting prisons at the complex in Ramla, south-east of Tel Aviv, where Rakefet is located, Steiner had not heard of the underground jail before Ben-Gvir ordered it back into service.View image in fullscreenItamar Ben-Gvir visiting the Rakefet prison wing.Photograph: KoKoIt was closed before PCATI was founded, so the legal team turned to old media archives and the memoir of Rafael Suissa, the head of the IPS in the mid-1980s to find out more about the jail.“[Suissa] wrote that he understood being held below ground 24/7 is just too cruel, too inhumane for any person to endure, regardless of what their actions have been,” Steiner said.This summer, PCATI lawyers were asked to represent two men held in the underground prison, so Abdu and a colleague were able to visit for the first time.They were led underground by masked, heavily armed security guards, down a flight of dirty stairs into a room where the remains of dead insects dotted the floor. The toilet was so dirty it was in effect unusable.View image in fullscreenA newspaper report from May 1985 on the closure of Rakefet prison that also details its original purpose as a high-security facility for members of organised crime groups.Photograph: Akevot Institute for Israeli-Palestinian Conflict ResearchSurveillance cameras on the walls violated the basic legal right to a confidential discussion, and guards warned that the meeting would be cut short if they talked about detainees’ families or the war in Gaza.“I asked myself, if the conditions in the lawyers’ room are so humiliating – not just personally to us but also to the profession – then what is the situation for the prisoners?” Abdu said. “The answer came soon, when we met them.”The clients were brought in bent over, with guards forcing their heads to the ground, and remained shackled at their hands and feet, she said.Saja Misherqi Baransi, the second PCATI lawyer on the trip, said the two detainees had been in Rakefet for nine months, and the nurse began the meeting by asking: “Where am I and why am I here?” The guards had not told him the name of the prison.Israeli judges who authorised the detention of the men at very brief video hearings, during which the detainees had no lawyer and did not hear evidence against them, said only that they would be there “until the war ends”.The men described windowless cells with no ventilation, holding three or four detainees, and reported often feeling breathless and choking.Prisoners told the lawyers they faced regular physical abuse including beatings, assaults by dogs with iron muzzles, and guards stepping on prisoners, in addition to being denied adequate medical care and given starvation-level rations. Israel’s high courtruledthis month that the state was depriving Palestinian prisoners of adequate food.They have very limited time outside the cell in a tiny underground enclosure, sometimes just five minutes every other day. Mattresses are taken away early in the morning, usually at about 4am, and only returned late at night, leaving detainees on iron frames in otherwise empty cells.Their descriptions matched images from a televised visit to the prison made by Ben-Gvir to publicise his decision to reopen the underground jail. “This is terrorists’ natural place, under the ground,” he said.He has repeatedly boasted about mistreatment of Palestinian detainees, rhetoric that former hostages taken during the 7 October attacks saypromptedan escalation of Hamas abuse when they were in captivity.‘Locked up for 24 years’: release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees sparks joy and sorrowRead moreThis included holding hostages in underground tunnels for months, depriving them of food, isolating them from news of relatives and the outside world, and violence and psychological torture, including being ordered to dig a grave on camera.Israel’sintelligence serviceshave warned that the treatment of Palestinian prisoners puts the country’s wider security interests at risk.Misherqi Baransi said the detained nurse last saw daylight on 21 January this year, when he was transferred to Rakefet, after a year passing through other jails including the military’s notorious Sde Teiman centre.The nurse, a father of three, has had no news of his family since his detention. The only fragment of personal information lawyers can share with detainees from Gaza is the name of the relative who authorised them to take on the case.“When I told him: ‘I talked to your mother and she authorised me to meet you,’ then I am giving him this tiny thing, at least telling him that his mother is alive,” Misherqi Baransi said.When the other detainee asked Abdu if his pregnant wife had given birth safely, the guard immediately cut off the conversation to threaten him. As the guards took the men away, she heard the sound of an elevator, suggesting their cells were even deeper underground.The teenager had told her: “You are the first person I have seen since my arrest,” and his last request to her was: “Please come see me again.” His lawyers were later informed he was released to Gaza on 13 October.The IPS said in a statement that it “operates in accordance with the law and under the supervision of official comptrollers” and added that it “is not responsible for the legal process, classification of detainees, arrest policy, or arrests”.The justice ministry referred questions about Rakefet and detainees to the Israeli military.

Iranian police said Sarlak had “died by suicide”.But anti-government media and activists say the timing of the death, so soon after he made a public outcry against the government, raises suspicions about whether he was killed for his views.Hours before Sarlak’s body was found, a video posted on his social media account showed him burning the photo of the Islamic Republic’s leader, Ali Khamenei.The furore presents a threat to the regime, with Sarlak becoming an icon for activists, many of whom have followed him by burning Khamenei’s photo in solidarity and posting the videos online.Suspicions have grown after a widely circulated video showed Sarlak’s father reportedly saying at the site of his son’s death: “They killed my champion here.”An off-screen voice in the same clip was heard saying he was “surrounded and shot”.Later, in a televised interview aired by state media, Sarlak’s father requested people to “not pay attention to what’s circulating on social media and to let the judicial authorities handle the matter”. Activists have called the video forced and said the family was under surveillance.View image in fullscreenIran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Photograph: Iranian Supreme Leader’S Office/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockHundreds of mourners who attended Sarlak’s funeral on Monday demonstrated and chanted slogans such as “Death to the dictator” and “Death to Khamenei”.In the clip shared on Instagram by Sarlak hours before his death, a recording is audible in the background of a speech by Iran’s former shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In 1979, Pahlavi fled Iran, with the Islamic government taking power the same year. Some anti-government activists are nostalgic for the monarchy.On another one of his last Instagram stories, he wrote: “How long should we endure humiliation, poverty and being ridden over? This is the moment to show yourself, young people. These clerics are nothing but a stream for Iran’s youth to cross.”Sarlak was a student of aviation and an amateur boxer who was a fan of the Iranian wrestler Ebrahim Eshaghi. Eshaghi told the Guardian Sarlak had contacted him on Instagram shortly before he died. “He sent me a message that his life was in danger and that if anything were to happen to him, we should be his voice.”Eshaghi, who lives in Germany, said that since his death several of Sarlak’s close friends said they believed he had been killed by the intelligence services.“He loved life and had an upcoming boxing competition in two weeks. He loved the Pahlavi family and supported them. The regime also imprisons or kills young, athletic people, something it has been doing for years.”Sarlak’s death has reignited some of the same pain and outrage that emerged after the death ofMahsa Jina Amini, a Kurdish woman who was arrested by the country’s “morality police” and died in custody in 2022,igniting huge, countrywide protests.Child bride faces execution in Iran unless she pays £80,000 in ‘blood money’Read moreBahar Ghandehari, director of advocacy at the US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran, said it was notable that people inside Iran were burning photos publicly, “despite the fact that insulting or burning the supreme leader’s photo is considered a serious offence, carrying grave risks of arrest, imprisonment, harsh sentences, torture and even death”.In one video shared with the Guardian on the condition of anonymity, two men burned images of Khamenei, saying: “We burn this photo for justice, for freedom, for hope. I am Omid Sarlak. Death to Khamenei and long live the shah.”The editor of the Amirkabir Newsletter, an Iranian student movement website, said so far students have not held any protests in universities over Sarlak’s death “because the atmosphere on campuses remains heavily securitised”.The editor, who has no public profile to protect them and their staff while operating inside Iran, said they believed there would be “serious protests” this year or early next year. “Day by day, people’s anger over the killing of thousands of innocent people is growing, and they are distressed and upset,” they said.Separately, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled oldest son of the former shah has called Sarlak a hero and a brave soul who stood against the “oppression of the Islamic Republic and sacrificed his life for Iran’s freedom”.Explore more on these topicsIranProtestActivismMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It is contaminated plastic. Marine animals will ingest small plastic items once they are in the sea, they will attract algae, they will smell like food, effectively.“Once they’ve eaten it, that’s it: they can’t get it out. They will float on the surface. It will create a slick which attracts plunging seabirds.”He said the clean-up efforts have been exhausting. “Yesterday I was out there cleaning it up. We are trying to really piece together the timeline and the story for this horrendous event. It’s terrible.View image in fullscreenCamber residents joined the giant hoovering machine, Rother district council, Rother coastal officers and Strandliners for the cleanup effort.Photograph: Strandliners“They are so small that, from a very long way off, the beach looks normal. But as soon as you get close up you see there are millions of black pellets, nestled under seaweed. It’s an impossible task – volunteers have been raking for days, and they will continue to rake, but we won’t be able to get rid of them all. It is the worst I have ever seen of a polluted beach.”Dollimore, the Labour and Cooperative MP who joined the clean-up efforts, said: “The huge number of plastic beads that have washed up here risks an environmental catastrophe. These biobeads are deadly to marine life and wildlife, and we are already seeing more dead seals, fish and porpoises on the beach.“Local residents are working tirelessly to remove as many beads as possible, but it’s a race against time. Southern Water must urgently establish if their local wastewater plants could be the source of these biobeads, and I’ve asked them to dedicate all available resources to supporting the clean-up operation in the meantime.”The beads are also dangerous to dogs as they contain a high number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are known to have carcinogenic properties, and they often contain toxins including lead, antimony and bromine.A Southern Water spokesperson said: “We are working closely with the Environment Agency and Rother district council to investigate the source of plastic beads which have washed up on Camber Beach. This investigation work is ongoing.“Rother district council is leading the clean-up of the beach, using specialists with a vehicle with suction equipment to remove the beads. We are also supporting with the clean-up.“We’ve conducted water-quality sampling on the beach, which has shown no impact to environmental water quality. This data has been shared with Rother district council and the Environment Agency.”An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “We are aware that a large number of plastic nurdles have washed up along a stretch of coastline in East Sussex which includes Camber Sands.“We are providing advice and guidance to Rother district council, which has employed contractors to carry out a clean-up operation. This work is currently under way.“We are working with other responders to identify the source of the pollution.”Explore more on these topicsEast SussexBirdsWaterWater industryAnimalsWildlifeEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

John Ashby, 32, has been charged in connection with a religiously aggravated rape in relation to the alleged Walsall attack.Those incidents, as well as a violent attack on two elderly Sikh taxi drivers in Wolverhampton, prompted a meeting in parliament at the end of October about anti-Sikh hate crimes in the region.Sukhvinder Kaur, the chair of Sikh Women’s Aid, a domestic abuse charity in the West Midlands, said women were changing their daily routines to protect themselves.“The fear, the now complete changing of your day-to-day living, that is real. I have not seen that before,” she said. “This is the first time since I’ve set up Sikh Women’s Aid where women have said to us: ‘We are no longer doing the things that we enjoy because we might get harmed doing them.’”Women were “not comfortable” going to the gym, or going for walks or runs now, she said. “They are doing this in groups. They are sharing their location with their friends or a family member.“An attack in Walsall is going to make women in Coventry feel scared because it’s the Midlands,” she said. “There has definitely been a shift in the way women think about their own safety.”Earlier this week, police confirmed a woman in her 50s was the victim of a racially aggravated assault in Wolverhampton in which an electrical stun device was used. The Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill wrote on X that the victim was Sikh. When approached, West Midlands police declined to confirm this information.Sikh places of worship across the Midlands have begun distributing rape and security alarms to women in an effort to keep them safe.At the Nanaksar gurdwara, in Walsall, Kam Kaur, a regular attender, said the incidents had “changed everything” for Sikhs living in the area.In particular, she said she did not feel safe going to the gurdwara on her own, and she had told her elderly mother to be careful when opening her front door. “We’re all targets,” Kaur, 55, said. “Anyone can be attacked day or night.”View image in fullscreenInderjeet Kaur (left) and Kam Kaur.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianAnother attender, Inderjeet Kaur, 32, said she was taking extra precautions when going to work. “I try and find parking nearer to the bus station,” she said. “I putpaath[prayer] in my headphones but it’s on a very low volume, to the point where I can still hear cars go past, I can still hear surroundings around me.”Surinder Kaur, 57, who has three daughters, said: “We go for walks, the girls and I, and it just feels very unsafe at the moment with all these crimes.“We’ve never thought about taking these precautions before,” she said. “I’m looking over my shoulder constantly.”For Surinder Bajwa, 55, who grew up in Walsall, the atmosphere is reminiscent of the racism older generations faced in the 1970s and 80s.“We’ve experienced all this in the 1980s when our mums used to go past where the community hall is,” she said. “We used to have the National Front and all the people sat there and they used to spit at them, call them names or set dogs on them. For some reason, I’m going back to that. In my head, I think those times are almost back.”A Labour councillor, Simran Cheema, echoed this, saying people felt “we’ve gone back in time … where there was a lot of open racism”.View image in fullscreenSimran Cheema.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian“People are scared to go out in the community,” she said. “People are scared to wear the artefacts of their religion; turbans or head coverings.”Cheema said Walsall council had provided extra CCTV around gurdwaras to reassure the community.West Midlands police said they were holding meetings with local politicians, women’s groups and community leaders, as well as visiting faith establishments, to discuss women’s safety.“It’s been a very difficult week for the community,” Ch Supt Phil Dolby told the Walsall gurdwaras committee on Sunday. “No one deserves to live in a community feeling afraid.”Walsall council said it had been “actively working alongside the police with the Sikh community and our communities more widely to provide support and reassurance”.The leader of Sandwell council, Kerrie Carmichael, said: “We were all shocked by the awful incident in Oldbury.” She added that the council worked with the police as part of the Safer Sandwell Partnership to tackle violence against women and girls and hate crime.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

I found a lump a few weeks ago. It came and went but then I was working on The Masked Singer and Lorraine, the TV show, and Lorraine Kelly had put signs on the backs of all the doors saying ‘check your breasts’ and every time I went for a wee I did that.“It was still there, and then one morning I saw myself in the mirror and thought: ‘I’m going to get that looked at.’“I had a biopsy. I found out it was indeed breast cancer and I had it taken out in a lumpectomy nearly three weeks ago.”McCall added: “It was very, very small, so I got it very, very early, which is incredibly lucky. But I am so relieved to have had it removed and to know that it hasn’t spread.“My lymph nodes were clear, I didn’t have any removed, and all I’m going to do now is have five days of radiotherapy in January as kind of an insurance policy.”In her post, McCall, 58, paid tribute to medical staff, her family and her partner, the hairdresser Michael Douglas.She said: “I just want to say a massive thank you to everybody at the Royal Marsden [hospital] … all the nurses, doctors who have helped me, thank you for your support.“Thanks to my family, to my brilliant kids, and an extra special thanks to Michael. It’s been a lot. I was very angry when I found out, but I let go of that and I feel in a much more positive place now.”She added: “I think my message is, get checked if you’re worried, check yourself regularly. If you are due a mammogram, then get it done. And I have dense breasts, and I had a mammogram in August, and I was postponing the ultrasound. I just couldn’t find time to do it. Don’t do that.”Last November, thepresenter had surgeryfor a “very rare” tumour. The benign brain tumour, known as a colloid cyst, was found after she was offered a health checkup as part of her menopause advocacy work.‘I wasn’t terrified of dying, but I didn’t want to leave my kids’: Davina McCall on addiction, reality TV and the brain tumour that nearly killed herRead moreIn a tearful interview earlier this year, McCall said the craniotomy, which entailed removing a portion of her skull to extract the tumour, was “the hardest thing” she had endured. In April, she said her benign brain tumour was“not coming back”.The former Big Brother host has long advocated on women’s health issues and has presented documentaries on contraception and menopause.

However, it omitted a section of the speech where Trump urged the crowd “to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard”.In an interview with the Telegraph, Leavitt said: “This purposefully dishonest, selectively edited clip by the BBC is further evidence that they are total, 100% fake news that should no longer be worth the time on the television screens of the great people of the United Kingdom.“Every time I travel to the United Kingdom with President Trump and am forced to watch the BBC in our hotel rooms, it ruins my day listening to their blatant propaganda and lies about the president of the United States and all that he’s doing to make America better and the world a safer place.”The newspaper said its reporting was based on a memo written by Michael Prescott, a former adviser to the BBC’s editorial guidelines and standards committee. Prescott left his role earlier this year and has not commented on the document, understood to have been leaked by a whistleblower.It published an extract that read: “It was completely misleading toedit the clipin the way Panorama aired it. The fact that he did not explicitly exhort supporters to go down and fight at Capitol Hill was one of the reasons there were no federal charges for incitement to riot.”The memo reportedly added that Prescott, a communications consultant and former political journalist, had raised concerns about the way BBC Arabic covered the war in Gaza.BBC accused of selectively editing Trump clip from day of Capitol attackRead moreThe Telegraph said Prescott alleged there were “systemic problems”, which had not been addressed by senior management, claiming there were “stark differences” between the coverage of the war on BBC Arabic and on the main BBC website. One issue Prescott is said to have highlighted is the repeated use of commentators who were antisemitic or pro-Hamas.The 19-page dossier is also reported to have criticised the BBC’s coverage of transgender issues, saying the broadcaster had been “captured by a small group of [staff] promoting the Stonewall view” of gender identity issues and that its LGBT desk would “decline to cover any stories raising difficult questions”.It is said to have alleged that stories raising complex questions about trans issues were suppressed, with a “constant drip-feed of one-sided stories celebrating the trans experience without adequate balance or objectivity”.In response, the BBC said: “While we don’t comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback it takes it seriously and considers it carefully.“Michael Prescott is a former adviser to a board committee where differing views and opinions of our coverage are routinely discussed and debated.”Explore more on these topicsBBCDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Ultimately, the driver lost control of the car and hit more than a dozen people outside the bar, police said.Three victims died at the scene and a fourth victim died at a hospital. As of Saturday morning, a fifth victim was hospitalized in critical condition, and eight additional victims were being treated at local hospitals but were listed as stable, police said. Two other victims experienced minor injuries and declined treatment at the scene. All 15 victims are adults.“What happened this morning was a senseless tragedy, our hearts are with the loved ones of the victims and all those who were impacted,” the Tampa police chief, Lee Bercaw, said in a statement.Officers identified the suspect as 22-year-old Silas Sampson, who was booked on Saturday and is being held at the Hillsborough county jail.Court documents showed Sampson has been charged with four counts of vehicular homicide and four counts of aggravated fleeing or eluding with serious bodily injury or death. All are first-degree felonies. No attorney was listed for Sampson.“Our entire city feels this loss,” said Tampa’s mayor, Jane Castor, who also served as Tampa’s first female police chief, in a post on social media.“My thoughts are with everyone affected. The investigation into this crash is ongoing, and we are working to get answers,” she wrote.In recent years, some states and local agencies have pushed to restrict the use of high-speed car chases to protect both civilians and officers. After a rise in fatalities, a 2023studyfunded by the US justice department called for police chases to be rarely used, noting that the danger to suspects, officers and bystanders often outweighs the immediate need to take someone into custody.Still, Florida has doubled down on the tactics, with the state’s highway patrol amending its policies to loosen limitations on the use of car chases and pit maneuvers. The justice department-backed report described those tactics as “high-risk” and “controversial”.Explore more on these topicsTampaUS crimeUS policingFloridanewsShareReuse this content"

But it has deepened the impact felt by what is now the nation’s longest federal shutdown.“We all travel. We all have somewhere to be,” said Emmy Holguin, 36, who was flying out of Miami on Saturday to visit family in the Dominican Republic for the week. “I’m hoping that the government can take care of this.”Analysts warn that the upheaval will intensify and be felt far beyond air travel if the cancellations pick up and move closer to the Thanksgiving holiday.Near Ohio air force base, food pantries and businesses grapple with effects of shutdownRead moreAlready there are concerns about the impact on cities and businesses that rely on tourism and the possibility of shipping interruptions that could delay getting holiday items on store shelves.Here’s what to know about the flight reductions:Both of the first two days of the FAA’s slowdown have seen more than 1,000 flights canceled, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks flight disruptions.On Saturday – typically a slow travel day – the airport serving Charlotte,North Carolina, was by far the hardest hit, with 120 arriving and departing flights canceled by midday.Airports in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver and Orlando,Florida, were among the others with the most disruptions. Staffing shortages in Charlotte and Newark, New Jersey, slowed traffic too.Not all the cancellations were due to the FAA order, and those numbers represent just a small portion of the overall flights nationwide. But they are certain to rise in the coming days if the slowdown continues.The FAA said the reductions affecting all commercial airlines are starting at 4% of flights at 40 targeted airports and will be bumped up again on Tuesday before hitting 10% of flights on Friday.The US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, has warned that even more flight cuts might be needed if the government shutdown continues and more air traffic controllers are off the job.Air traffic controllers have gone without paychecks for nearly a month as the shutdown continues, leading many to call in sick and add to already existing staffing shortages.Most controllers are working mandatory overtime six days a week during the shutdown without pay, and some are taking second jobs to pay their bills, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) has said.Most travelers were relieved to find that airlines largely stayed on schedule on Friday, and those whose flights were called off were able to quickly rebook.

Then you put these disruptions in place and it really makes everything more challenging,” she said.Rental car companies reported a sharp increase in one-way reservations on Friday, and some people are simply canceling flights altogether.Other repercussions from the air traffic slowdown might also include higher prices in stores, as nearly half of all US air freight is shipped in the bellies of passenger aircraft.Major flight disruptions could bring higher shipping costs that get passed on to consumers, said Patrick Penfield, professor of supply chain practice at Syracuse University.More losses will ripple through the economy if the slowdown continues – from tourism to manufacturing, said Greg Raiff, CEO of Elevate Aviation Group.“This shutdown is going to impact everything from cargo aircraft to people getting to business meetings to tourists being able to travel,” he said. “It’s going to hit the hotel taxes and city taxes.

People familiar with the situation told the paper that the two intended to use the jets to expand deportation flights – and for personal travel.Those sources also claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials had cautioned them that buying planes would be far more expensive than simply expanding existing flight contracts.ICE facing fierce backlash after video apparently shows unconscious man clutching child during arrestRead moreComplicating matters further, Spirit, whichfiled for bankruptcyprotection for the second time, in August, did not own the jets and their engines would have had to be bought separately. The plan has since been paused, according to the Journal.Meanwhile, Democrats on the House appropriations committee said in October that during this fall’s record-long government shutdown, the DHS had already acquired two Gulfstream jets for $200m.“It has come to our attention that, in the midst of a government shutdown, the United States Coast Guard entered into a sole source contract with Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation to procure two new G700 luxury jets to support travel for you and the deputy secretary, at a cost to the taxpayer of $200m,” Democratic representatives Rosa DeLauro and Lauren Underwood wrote ina letterto the DHS.A DHS spokesperson told the Journal that parts of its reporting about the plane purchases were inaccurate but declined to provide additional clarification.Congress had previously approved Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill” in July, which dedicates roughly $170bn for immigration and border-related operations, a sum that makes ICE the mostheavily fundedlaw enforcement agency in the federal government.In September, the Guardianreportedthat the Trump administration was moving immigrants detained as part of its deportation agenda in ways that violated their constitutionally protected rights, often by plane.Leaked data reviewed from charter airline Global Crossing (GlobalX) detailed the journeys oftens of thousandsof immigrants who have been shuttled around the country before deportation.Explore more on these topicsKristi NoemUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The office stopped short of indicating exactly who made the agency aware of the video.Studies through the years have attributed cellphone use while driving to an increase in the potential for serious crashes – or worse.A screen recording of a TikTok livevideostreamed on Monday was then published on the social media app on Friday morning, and it showed user “Tea_Tyme_3” speaking at her phone before a loud thud. The live stream was quickly disconnected after the thud prompted her to curse, a child to ask what happened and someone else to ask the driver if she was OK.The user, it has beenreported, has since changed her name and made her account private, deleting the biography section in which she had previously described being in Zion, Illinois.Athreadon the Reddit platform separately was started by a user who described seeing the video when it was livestreamed and wondering whether something deadly had happened. News stories later confirmed that user’s worst fears, as the user put it.“It feels like I accidentally witnessed the moment someone’s life was taken and now I can’t stop thinking about the victim, and how avoidable it was,” the user said. “I just keep replaying that sound in my head.”The user also said the person driving while onTikTok“wasn’t paying attention to the road because she was reading comments and grinning at her phone”.“A man died because she wanted attention from a livestream,” the Reddit user also wrote.Monday’s crash occurred at about 5.30pm, police said. Darren Lucas, 59, of nearby Beach Park, was unresponsive after being hit, and he was later pronounced dead at a hospital emergency room from blunt force injuries inflicted on him by the crash, the local coroner’s office said in a statement.Lucas’s son-in-law, Chris King,toldthe Lake and McHenry County Scanner that news of the video made his family “hold our loss tighter to our hearts”.“We … will continue to pray for what the driver must be going through,” King reportedly said. “We are trying to find our ways to live, without someone we cherished so much.”Explore more on these topicsChicagoTikToknewsShareReuse this content"

Last Friday was really bad too,” says Jane. “Around 250 families, including 300 children, come to the pantry every day it’s open.”The pantry is situated a half mile from Wright-Patterson air force base – the largest single-site employer inOhiowith 38,000 workers – outside Dayton, Ohio, which has been rocked by the federal government shutdown.With tens of thousands of military personnel working without pay, and local contractors and civilian workers furloughed, the wider regional economy is in trouble.About8,100 civilian workersat the Air Force Material Command, headquartered at the Wright-Patterson air force base, have received furlough notices, according to local media.The effects of this are being starkly seen at food resource centers.“In September, we were probably averaging 250 families a week. This week, I anticipate we’ll probably help 500 families,” says Doorley.“We’re seeing this heightened anxiety. You can just feel it when people come. Everybody wants to come at the beginning [of the day], for fear that the food is going to run out.”For decades, the military has been regarded as a stable source of employment, even through recessions and other economic crises. For a part of the industrial midwest that’s never fully recovered from the collapse of manufacturing activity in the late 20th century, the air force base has been a lifeline, fueling an additional40,000 off-base, indirect jobs.Every year, the base generatesnearly $16bnfor the local economy. Dotted along streets outside the facility, which spans 8,000 acres, are dozens of military-adjacent and defense companies such as Lockheed Martin, GE Aviation and Northrop Grumman, which have provided decades of stable employment, largely through contracts from the federal government that are paid for by taxpayers. Startups such asJoby Aviationhave recently flocked to the area to take advantage of access to air force facilities and intellectual property.But now, local businesses are feeling the full effect of the shutdown.“We’ve really lost most of our customers because of the government shutdown. It used to be really busy but now it’s empty,” says Tik Taew, who works at Tik’s Thai Express, a restaurant located a short distance from the base that’s been in business for more than 15 years.“Weekday mornings are usually our busiest time, but right now, it’s really quiet; we’re only getting five to six [customers].”Across the country, aroundthree-fourths of a millioncivilians work with the US military.Around halfare thought to have been currently furloughed.Reportsfrom the Trump administration made public on 4 November suggested many of those furloughed may not be legible for back-pay, or that it could be used as a negotiating tactic with Democratic party leaders working to end the shutdown.Democrats have refused to sign a funding deal to end the shutdown unless subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, which provides medical care at a reduced cost for millions of Americans, is renewed into 2026, a measure the White House opposes.While a last-minute measure late last month saw the Trump administration pull together $5.3bn to ensure military service members were paid on 1 November, avoiding an historic first, experts say service membersare unlikely to be paidat the next payroll date if a deal isn’t reached.“[B]y November 15 our troops and service members who are willing to risk their lives aren’t going to be able to get paid,” the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent,toldFace the Nation on 26 October.Polls showthat more Americans blame Trump and the Republican party than Democrats for the shutdown, which is now the longest in US history. And yet, a plurality of voters in Ohio, Greene county, where the base is situated, members of the air force andmilitary veterans as a whole, broadly vote for Republicanpolitical candidates.The air force base isn’t the only large military entity in the Dayton area to be closed by the shutdown.The National Museum of the US Air Force, the world’s largest military aviation museum that’s adjacent to the air force base has also been closed since 1 October. More than66,000 peoplefrom around the country visit the museum every month, adding millions of dollars to the local economy by staying at local hotels and dining at restaurants.Local county authorities are having toadd millions of additional dollarsto support food banks. The Dayton Foodbank, which includes a network of 122 local pantries, has delivered 500 emergency food boxes to the base since the start of the shutdown.“While base civilians, who are still unpaid during the shutdown, might be living above poverty levels while receiving a paycheck, they may not have the funds needed easily available via savings or a credit card in the case of an emergency like now,” says Lee Lauren Truesdale of the Dayton Foodbank.One localrestaurant is offering a $5 menuto military members to help them offset the financial strain. Others aregiving awayfree cooked meals.“While going unpaid, these civilian employees still must pay day to day expenses such as rent, daycare (to hold spots in anticipation of returning to work), buy food, pay medical bills, car bills [and] utilities.”All the while, the Trump White House has worked to undermine these groups.Thousands of pantries across the country, including the Fairborn Fish Food Pantry, used to receive financial support worth a total of $117m through the federal government’s Emergency Food and Shelter Program, but that wastaken awayin January.“That’s on a pause, probably forever,” says Doorley. “We [now] rely entirely on donations.”At the Fairborn Fish Food Pantry, which has initiated dedicated days for military families, Doorley says meat is the number one sought after commodity.“The donations have increased a little bit, but we go and buy meat for 500 families a week. That is not sustainable for us,” she says, adding that it’s time for politicians in Washington DC to find a solution.“It’s time for the two sides to recognize that we are all Americans and we have people who are hungry and need help. [They need to] get together and somehow find a middle ground to move things forward and help those in our community.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Then, in late February, Reid was suddenly forced out, and her show, The ReidOut, was cancelled as part of a broader programming shakeup at the network. Reid has since launched her own streaming show, The Joy Reid Show, and has a few things to say about the mainstream media she was once part of.Now that it’s been eight months since you were abruptly fired byMSNBC, how do you view your departure?I still miss my team. I love my little ReidOut team. We had a great family. We had an amazing, amazing time. And I love the people that I worked with, but I overall see my departure as a blessing, to be honest. I think in this moment, not being a part of corporate media is actually a gift. Because from now, on the outside looking in, I don’t know that I could live with the kind of restrictions that people in corporate media are facing. So I think – it was a blessing.What kind of restrictions are you referring to?It’s that these corporations are all doing business with the administration. They all have business before the FCC [Federal Communications Commission], and therefore they are going to make their content and the journalism being done at those institutions – they’re going to make it bow to the bigger corporate need.In other words, Comcast is a donor to the Epstein ballroom. They’re going to give money to Donald Trump. Everyone is paying him. ABC paid him off, CBS paid him off, Comcast – they’re all bowing to his will or writing him a check. And therefore, everyone who works in those organizations has to be mindful that if they displease Donald Trump, if he notices their journalism and it makes him mad, he could have his Project 2025-author FCC chair [Brendan Carr] punish them.‘Censor-in-chief’: Trump-backed FCC chair at heart of Jimmy Kimmel stormRead moreIf they have too much diversity, if they have too many Black people on air, if they hire too many minorities, too many gay people, too many women, if they’re too visibly diverse, he could have his FCC punish them.And I’m looking at each of these entities. I’m looking at CBS being warped by being owned by a Trump fan who’s gobbling up the media, he and his dad [David and Larry Ellison], our new Murdochs, eating up the media.View image in fullscreenLarry Ellison at the White House on 21 January 2025.Photograph: Aaron Schwartz/CNP/Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyAnd you can see the results at CBS News:mass firings at Paramount CBS. You can already see CBS News running stories under Bari Weiss that they would never, never have run, questioning whether the Gaza death count was real or whether people were dying of natural causes. The things that are happening at CBS – I can almost feel the visceral pain that CBS News employees have got to be feeling having this Substacker be their boss when they are longtime, experienced journalists having to answer to a rightwing Substacker. And a rightwing ombudsman.You know, I’m watching ABC and you’rehearing these storiesof even the View being pressured: “Not so much anti-Trumpism, please.” They’re there to comment on the news of the day, but, you know, curtail that. I’m hearing from friends that still work at MS NOW [MSNBC’s new name], whatever its new name is, having to work in a place thatfired Matt Dowdfor saying an absolutely true and inoffensive fact and now having to realize that he was dismissed summarily for saying a true thing about Charlie Kirk, and each of them could be as well. And knowing the pressures that are on the people there about what they can and cannot say, and that those pressures are being – they’re coming as Comcast has business before the administration, as ABC Disney does, as CBS Paramount does.It seemed notable that top executives at Comcast, MSNBC’s owner,issued a memo denouncing Dowd’s commentsabout Kirk. [Dowd had said, after the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, that “hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions”.]The things I hear just internally of people just feeling less freedom to do the journalism they know that they’re capable of. I mean, look, Rachel Maddow is still Rachel Maddow-ing. You know what I mean? Lawrence O’Donnell is still Lawrence O’Donnell-ing. The great journalists at MSNBC are still doing the great stuff they’ve done, and they’re still really tough on the administration. They’re still holding to their brands and to their integrity. So I’m not saying everyone is being suppressed. Obviously the voices are getting out. Chris Hayes is still Chris Hayes-ing. You know what I mean? I still see and hear the clips of people still doing the work. But the problem is everyone in this business right now, if you work for a corporate media entity, you know over your shoulder stands Donald Trump and Brendan Carr.View image in fullscreenMatthew Dowd during an ABC election special on 3 March 2020.Photograph: Lorenzo Bevilaqua/ABC via Getty ImagesEveryone knows that, whether you’re in cable or broadcast. Brendan Carr cannot regulate cable news, but he can regulate Comcast. He can regulate your boss’s boss. And so I feel like I personally am grateful to not have to wake up every morning worrying about what punishment Brendan Carr might mete out to my organization and my company based on the journalism I do on my little show. I don’t want to wake up and think about that. I don’t want to think about, you know, whether or not Donald Trump tweeting at me somehow impacts my staff or impacts my executive producer or could get them in trouble. I am thankful not to have to think about that. [An MSNBC spokesperson said in response that “viewers who watch MSNBC any day of the week know that the values and tone of our coverage have not changed”.]When you were at MSNBC, did you feel like you had the ability to push back on some of your larger coverage concerns at the network, or did you feel you had to stay in your lane?I pretty much just focused on my show. I wasn’t there to be a critic of the way the network operated. Two ways that I did have some frustration was the amount of time we spent going live to Trump – when I was on my weekend show really. This was a big tension, and I think this was a tension that’s normal. I didn’t feel like every time Donald Trump belched we had to go live to him. And look, we had a difference of opinion. I didn’t want to go live to him, for instance, when he was at the National Cathedral, but the Women’s March was going on. And we have that tension. And so that’s normal stuff that happens inside of a network.I definitely feel like on the coverage of Gaza, I had tremendous frustration that I felt like it was very difficult for us to get the other side of the story. And that wasn’t because of our network, that was because of the government of Israel not allowing journalists into Gaza and not allowing any objective reporting without a minder. And so that wasn’t my frustration with my network, that was a frustration with a foreign government that was trying to shape coverage of a genocide. But internally, I will say, you could feel that coverage of the genocide as a genocide was unwanted and that the people that I worked for were not really enthusiastic, I’ll say, about the coverage of that genocide as a genocide. That was not wanted. And now that I’ve left, I feel like that definitely contributed to my departure. Because I think when you see a genocide happening, you have an obligation as a journalist to cover it as what it is.Where did you draw the linewhen you felt it was worth calling out your network on air and potentially risk your job?Specifically on the Gaza issue, I felt like: “What was the point of having the platform if I couldn’t speak out against a genocide?” On that one, I knew that it was risky, and I had people constantly telling me: “Please stop talking about Gaza. You’re going to get fired.” I had people, even including my own family, who were worried about me, but to be honest with you, I never dreamed in a million years that they would lay off my whole staff. Normally they just lay off the host or cancel the show, and then they make the host a contributor.View image in fullscreenPalestinian families returning to Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip are continuing their lives with limited means amidst buildings reduced to rubble by attacks on 6 November 2025.Photograph: Omar Ashtawy/APAImages via ShutterstockI think what pushed Rachel [Maddow, who called the cancellation a “bad mistake”] to speak out in an incredibly valiant way, and I love and adore her, by the way – I think she is so brave and such a great journalist – but I think what pushed her was what enraged all of us, which is that they didn’t just cancel my show. You can cancel my show. I don’t own Comcast. I don’t own MSNBC. They laid off our whole staffs. Like, that is not normal. And I think if you go back and listen to her rant, it wasn’t just about me, it was about these incredible journalists, including on her own staff, on all of our staffs. That is not the way MSNBC has ever operated. … These are not people who are making millions of dollars a year. These are people with mortgages and rent to pay and families and children. And I was shocked that that happened to my team. Would I have felt differently if I thought my staff was in jeopardy? Yeah, I would have been more circumspect, but I still feel like I would have covered Gaza the way I did, honestly. I don’t regret that at all, because I think that is our obligation as journalists. I felt like I had to do it, but I would have had in the back of my mind my staff was in jeopardy. I never thought that. [The vast majority of Reid’s staffers were ultimately able to get other jobs at the network.]Were you heartened that some of your former colleagues in MSNBC– Rachel Maddow, Lawrence O’Donnell and Stephanie Ruhle–called out Comcast for their donationto the East Wing ballroom project?Absolutely. And they are the best of people. I’m so heartened by it, and yes, I think it’s brave, I think it’s smart, and I think they had to do it. … I feel like we have to have some integrity in journalism. Had they not said anything about Comcast giving to this ballroom, I think they wouldn’t have been able to sleep at night. So I’m glad they did it.And I assume you would have done it also, if you were still on?A hundred percent. Oh, a thousand percent. If I was still there, a thousand percent.Have you found that your cable news audience has moved with you to your streaming show?Absolutely, yeah. People who enjoyed me, people will still find me on Substack. They’re still gonna find me on my YouTube show, onThe Joy Reid Show. They’ll still find me on my TikTok, on my [Instagram]. It’s just that it fragments the audience because they’re not all having to go to MSNBC. I have found that people are finding me where they’re comfortable and the mediums in which they’re comfortable. … It’s just a matter of you understanding in this business that you are your brand and that your company is not your brand.And you’ve found it to be a good business so far?Yeah, and I was not a YouTube person, so I’m very new to it. Thank god we have great partners. … So I have found a soft landing, and I’m grateful for the audience, and I’m very grateful to the partners that we have. And we’re building a business. Now it is different, right? My husband and I have had a production company for many, many years, but we haven’t had to make it our primary focus because we’ve always been doing other things. But now we’re focusing on it full-time and we are leaning into our entrepreneurial era. My husband’s been at it a lot longer because he was running that side of the business for a while. … Now we’re working on our own and I’m loving it. I’m loving the independence.Is there anything you miss about having a nightly cable news show?I am realizing it is an incredible blessing to have 15 staffers, 15 producers to make your TV. I used to be a booking producer, I used to be a producer-producer, a news producer, and I am a booking producer and a news producer again. It is so much more work. I am so blessed with our team, but our team are part-timers. We don’t have a full-time staff. Our full-time staff is my husband, myself. We hired our daughter to work for us. But we are a tiny, tiny, tiny team, so it is a lot harder to do things with far fewer people.Last week, CBS Newsguttedtheirrace andculture unit. NBC Newsalso recently made cutsaffecting its teams dedicated to covering Black, Asian American, Latino and LGBTQ+ communities. Do you think we are seeing an intentional unwinding of some of the moves that were made by media companies in response to the events of 2020 and the backlash to George Floyd’s killing?It wasn’t because of George Floyd. It was because Barack Obama got elected. And suddenly these corporations were really being pushed by the [National Association of Black Journalists] and [National Association of Hispanic Journalists] and also by the LGBTQ organizations that work with the media to say,: “Hey, we need representation. You have a Black president. You need more voices, right?” And so these initiatives really were born around the Obama administration. I think the demise of them in the wake of this backlash against the George Floyd DEI revolution is part of the national backlash. There is just a general backlash among conservatives against any diversity initiatives or even any diversity, period, in the country. …It feels like the media is capitulating to that and that they’re aligning their own policies with the administration self-protectively, because they don’t want to be punished. But also I think partly because in some ways these major media companies, which again are not run by liberals, they’re run by people who are maybe libertarian to somewhat conservative, they’ve been relieved of the burden of having to do diversity. So they don’t want to do it. If you did it reluctantly anyway, I don’t think it’s really bothering you to get rid of it.Explore more on these topicsUS newsMSNBCTelevision industryTelevisionTrump administrationTV newsUS politicsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

There simply isn’t enough of it. Thecalendar is too packed, the demands on players too great and, just because there is something almost hypocritical about managers moaning about the number of games they have to play when the fixture list is a direct result of the greed of the clubs they work for, that doesn’t mean their fundamental point is not a valid one.Transition is always difficult, particularly when it involves not only a change of players but of style. Arsenal may have brought in more players thanLiverpoolthis summer, but it would require a particular obtuseness to think that bolstering and finessing a system that already fundamentally works is a source of greater disruption than implementing an almost entirely new style.Silence over Sudan: why do Manchester City’s owners get away with so much?Read moreBut transition has been made harder by the fact that time available on the training pitch has been so diminished: little wonder an increasing number of managers are preferring to focus on set plays as a way of maximising the limited opportunity they have to work with their teams.Arsenal went into the weekend six points clear ofManchester Cityand seven of Liverpool. They look settled in their style, fluent and confident, with a squad deep enough to ride out all but the severest of injury crises. Their two obvious rivals, meanwhile, are trying to implement a new way of playing.An interviewPep Guardiolagave to TNT in January seems increasingly important in outlining how he saw the future of football. “Today,” he said, “modern football is not positional, you have to ride the rhythm. It is unbelievable, and we could not, simply we could not [play in a positional way] because we did not have the players.“The teams that are playing once a week, it is another story and that doesn’t count. It counts when you are playing every three or four days. Injuries happen, but not this amount in certain positions and this amount of important players, it has never happened before.”Squads have to be bigger. Managers have to rotate more. Without time to devise and implement tactical schemes for every fixture, football has to be simplified. The game’s administrators, in expanding competitions, producing ever more content, increasing the demands on elite players, have actively changed how the game is played; it’s fairly evident Guardiola would see that change as being for the worse.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola has tweaked his tactics to get the best out of Erling Haaland.Photograph: Matt West/ShutterstockNever before, not even in the four years when he had Lionel Messi in his side at Barcelona, has Guardiola focused his play so much on one player. After overhauling his squad since January, everything is geared tocreating chances for Erling Haaland, who has scored a preposterous 27 goals in 17 games for club and country this season.City’s leading scorer in the league this season after Haaland is Maxime Estève, who scored two own goals in City’s5-1 win over Burnleyin September. Once Guardiola would demand his side played 15 or 20 passes to deal with a potential counter before launching an attack; now everything is about trying to play Haaland in quickly behind the opposing defensive line.There’s something almost passive-aggressive about the switch: “Look at what you’re making me do,” Guardiola seems to be saying, the great overthinker casting aside his complex diagrams and schema for a radical simplification of football, refining the game to its most basic form: goalscorer scores goals.But this is Guardiola, so nothing is ever quite that simple. Although the shape tends to be a 4-3-3, Phil Foden is habitually the most advanced midfielder, whether operating centrally or drifting in from the right. Rayan Cherki fulfilled a similar roleagainst Bournemouth last week. Opposing defences, terrified of Haaland hitting space behind them, often drop off, and that creates an area in which intelligent creators can prosper – often by feeding Haaland.Foden scored twice against Borussia Dortmundon Wednesday but he had quietly been having an excellent season even before that, returning to something like his best after a frustrating 2024-25.Arne Slot has been through a similar process. Having brought in only Federico Chiesa for last season, Liverpool’s squad required a refresh for this one. But Slot has acknowledged that he felt other sides had worked his team out by the end of the title-winning campaign and so has attempted something more ambitious than simple rejuvenation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The sense was of Slot going back to basics, slowly evolving rather than attempting wholesale revolution. When time is limited, all that is possible is incremental change.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah (centre) celebrates scoring the first goal against Manchester City in February 2025.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesNeither Villa nor Madrid took the approach that has so unsettled Liverpool this season, going long and trying to exploit the space behind the full-backs. When they meet at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, the directness of City’s approach will be a gauge of how committed Guardiola is to his new pragmatism and, if they do try to exploit a vulnerability about which Slot has been open, that will be an indication of whether Liverpool really have stabilised or if these last two wins have been the result of playing sides whose strengths could not disguise their weaknesses.The likelihood is of a Liverpool closely resembling the side of last season, overhaul temporarily paused, versus a Guardiola side playing against type (or at least type as it was in every season up till this one) and trying to exploit the power and pace of their centre-forward,as they did at Arsenal. It’s an unexpected turn of events, one caused largely by the fixture list.Mikel Arteta has already overseen his transition. As Liverpool and City go through theirs, as they face each other knowing defeat would be a grievous blow to their title hopes, time has rarely felt so squeezed.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityInside footballLiverpoolPep GuardiolaArne SlotFootball tacticscommentShareReuse this content"

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt added in an email: “That would be a beautiful name, as it was President Trump who made the rebuilding of the new stadium possible.”Fox Sports drops Mark Sanchez permanently and hires Drew Brees as NFL analystRead moreThe Commanders declined comment, but team officials say they have spent several days preparing for Trump’s visit to Sunday’s home game against the Detroit Lions, where informal conversations about the stadium are expected. No formal talks have taken place.Trump’s push comes as the team prepares to return to the RFK Stadium site, which served as Washington’s home from 1961 through 1996. The new 65,000-seat domed venue, part of one of the gigantic mixed-use development projectsthat have become the vogue in American sports, is scheduled to open in 2030.Although the Commanders own the rights to sell a commercial stadium sponsorship, they cannot unilaterally decide to name the venue after an individual. The land is controlled by the National Park Service, and the District of Columbia Council will lease the stadium to the team under legislation it approved in September.“The team doesn’t have the authority. They can’t name the stadium on their own,” said a source with direct knowledge of the process. “The city would be involved, and the Park Service would be involved.”Those layers of approval give Trump significant leverage. As president, he oversees the federal agencies responsible for environmental and land-use approvals at the RFK site – bottlenecks he could slow or block if he chooses. “He has cards to play,” said one source. “He can make it very difficult to get this stadium built unless people align with him on the name.”Sources say Trump is not seeking to buy naming rights or have a private donor do so. He wants the stadium to carry his name as a tribute, similar to Chicago’s Soldier Field or Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin.The broader RFK project is the largest economic development effort in Washington’s history. The Commanders will invest $2.7bn, plus cost overruns, while the district will contribute $1bn.

Rojas, at second base, received the ball just a split second before a Blue Jays runner barreled into him, knocking him backwards.This wasn’t just a great sporting moment, perhaps the decisive shift in momentum in the Dodgers’ favor after looking for much of the series like the weaker team. For Molina it was exhilarating, politically and culturally, a badly needed morale boost for Latinos, and forLos Angeles, after months of immigration raids, troops patrolling the streets, and a steady drumbeat of negativity from the White House.“Kike and Miggy put forth this counter-narrative,” said Molina, a professor of American studies and ethnicity at the University of Southern California. “The world saw Latinos showing an infectious pride and joy in what they do, being leaders on the team, having a different kind of masculinity. They’re bombastic, they’re yelling, they’re taking off their shirts.“It was such a juxtaposition with what we see on the news – ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] raids, Latinos thrown to the ground and chased down. It’s so easy to be demoralized right now.”Not that it’s exactly simple to be a Dodgers fan these days – for Molina or for the legions of other Latinos who show up faithfully to home games and fill up as many as half of the stadium’s 50,000 seats each time.View image in fullscreenFans are seen along Grand Avenue during Los Angeles Dodgers World Series Championship parade at on Monday in Los Angeles, California.Photograph: Nicole Vasquez/MLB Photos/Getty ImagesWhen the Trump administration began conducting aggressive immigration raids in Los Angeles in early June and sent national guard troops and marines into the city to respond to the ensuing protests, two of the city’s soccer teams quickly put outstatementsof solidarity with immigrant families – but not the Dodgers.The team president, Stan Kasten, has said the Dodgers want to steer clear of politics – a view colored, perhaps, by the fact that a sizable minority of the fans, including Latinos, are Trump supporters. (Under considerable public pressure, the team later pledged $1m in support for families directly affected by the raids but made no public criticism of Trump’s administration.)If the Dodgers are bad for baseball, why was the World Series so much fun?Read moreThree months earlier, the team did not hesitate in accepting Trump’s invitation to celebrate their 2024 World Series victory at the White House – a move that the Los Angeles Times sports columnist Dylan Hernandez described as “pathetic… spineless … and hypocritical”, given the Dodgers’ pride in having been the first major league team to break the color barrier in the 1940s and thefrequentinvocationsof that legacy and the values it embodies by executives and present and former players. Several team members including the manager, Dave Roberts, had expressed unwillingness to go to the White House during Trump’s first term but either changed their minds or succumbed to pressure from team management.A further complication for fans is that the Dodgers are owned by a corporate behemoth, Guggenheim Partners, whose equity holdings, according to media reports and its own published balance sheets, include a stake in the GEO Group, a private prison corporation that operates ICE detention centers. Guggenheim’s leadership has said many times that it wants to stay out of politics, but its critics say the silence – and the GEO investment – are their own form of acquiescence to Trump’s agenda.View image in fullscreenWorkmen busy erecting Dodgers’ new stadium in Chavez Ravine in 1961.Photograph: Ray Graham/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesAll of that adds up to considerable mixed feelings among Latino fans in particular – feelings that surfaced even in the euphoria of this year’s hard-won World Series victory and the ensuing explosion of Dodgers pride across Los Angeles.“Is it okay to root for the Dodgers?” local columnist Erick Galindo agonized at the start of the playoffs in anelegant essayruminating on “Dodger blue in our veins, but doubt in our hearts”. Galindo couldn’t ultimately bring himself to watch the World Series, but he still cared deeply, to the point that he decided his one-man boycott must have brought the team the luck it needed to win.Many fans who share Galindo’s misgivings appear to have decided that they can continue to support the team and its roster of international players, including the Japanese megastar Shohei Ohtani, while pouring scorn on the team’s corporate overlords. Nowhere was this more evident than at the victory celebration at Dodger Stadium on Monday, when the capacity crowd roared in approval of Roberts and his players but booed Kasten and Mark Walter, the chief executive of Guggenheim Partners.“These men in suits don’t get to take our boys in blue from us,” Molina said. “We’ve been with the Dodgers longer than they have.”The problem, though, runs deeper than just the team’s current owners. The deal that brought the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles in the late 1950s involved the city razing three working-class Latino neighborhoods on a hill above downtown and then selling the land to the team for a fraction of its market value. A song on Ry Cooder’s 2005 album Chavez Ravine, which chronicles the story, has an impoverished parking attendant at the stadium revealing that the home he lost to eviction is now third base.Gustavo Arellano, perhaps southern California’s most widely followed Mexican American columnist and broadcaster, sees a darker side to the long, dysfunctional relationship between the team and its fanbase. He calls the Dodgers theFlamin’ Hot Cheetosof baseball, “a corporate entity with an undue, even unhealthy following by too many Latinos” that has been shortchanging its fans for decades.“They’ve put one arm around Latino fans while picking their pockets with the other for so long because they have been able to get away with it,” Arellano wrote over the summer, when calls to boycott the team over its lack of response to the ICE raids were upended by the uncomfortable fact that attendance at home gamesdid not dip, even at the height of the protests when downtown LA was subject to a nightly curfew.View image in fullscreen‘Some day the Los Angeles Dodgers hope to be playing ball where Mrs Barden Scott is playing with her three children, Richmond, five; Matthew, three, and Valerie, 18 months. She figures that when the Dodgers build their fancy new ball park in Chavez Ravine home plate will be just about where her home is.’Photograph: University of Southern California/Corbis/Getty ImagesSeparating the team from its corporate owners is not a simple matter, not least because it was Guggenheim that committed more than a billion dollars last year to bring Ohtani and the dominant pitcher of the World Series, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, to Los Angeles. Guggenheim has been in the forefront of internationalizing the sport more generally, finding so many business opportunities through rights and merchandising that, according tosome reports, it has already recouped the eye-popping $700m investment it made in Ohtani alone.Indeed, there was talk across baseball, even before Los Angeles snagged its second World Series in a row, that the Dodgers were ruining the sport with their financial muscle, snapping up so many star players that it was unfair to everyone else. Perhaps the greatest gift of the brilliant, compulsively watchable series with the Blue Jays, though, was how vulnerable the Dodgers looked and how hard they had to scratch and claw to save themselves through both concluding, must-win games.Karen Bass, LA’s mayor, is not alone in seeing parallels with a singularly rough year in the city’s history, starting with January’s devastating wildfires that destroyed entire neighborhoods and displaced tens of thousands of people. “The city has been on pins and needles,” shetoldthe New York Times. “Given the year we’ve had, we can use this burst of adrenaline, this burst of good will.”View image in fullscreenFans cheer as the Dodgers pass by during the Los Angeles Dodgers World Series championship parade in Los Angeles on Monday.Photograph: Jill Connelly/EPAThe players themselves, meanwhile, clearly see a connection between their performance on the field and the community at large, and the feeling is mutual. Hernández, the Puerto Rican left fielder who plays multiple other positions, endeared himself to many fans by making his ownstatementcondemning the ICE raids over the summer. “I may not be [an Angeleno] born and raised,” he wrote, “but … I cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart.”Roki Sasaki, the youngest of the team’s Japanese superstars, won the hearts of Latino fans from the moment he chose a catchy Spanish-language dance number, Báilalo Rocky, as his walk-up music before he pitches. (The song, he explained, was suggested to him by Rojas.)All this is grist to the conversations that Latino fans have with each other before, during and after games. Many say they would no sooner stop loving the team known in Spanish as “los Doyers” as they would stop loving the mothers and fathers who first brought them to games and gave them their taste for baseball.“What do you do when you feel something, and it’s complicated?” Molina asked. “For many Latinos, the Dodgers are how they connect to an American identity. It’s the most American institution most immigrants in LA feel connected to.”Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles DodgersLos AngelesBaseballMLBUS sportsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)featuresShareReuse this content"

Never underestimate the haplessness of this Tottenham Hotspur. Never underestimate the capacity of the Premier League to uncover drama in the least plausible situation. The embers of a game of little quality seemed cold and dead but somehow burst into glorious flame in the final six minutes plus stoppage time.What it means is anybody’s guess, other than that these are two sides who remain deeply flawed. The shadow of Bilbao andlast May’s Europa League finalwas unavoidable; in purely technical terms, that game was just as bad as the first 84 minutes of this one, but it at least had a sense of edge. Nervousness is permissible if there is something to be nervous about. Such scrappiness in a routine league meeting is far less explicable.De Ligt snatches last-gasp draw for Manchester United in chaotic finale at SpursRead moreFor the second week running, United took the lead, seemed comfortable, conceded twice and were left talking about their resilience and character after getting away with a 2-2 draw. But the truth is that this was a game they should have had wrapped up long before the Spurs fightback belatedly began. Not for the first time this season, their intensity dropped in the second half as Casemiro tired.Spurs had offered nothing in the first half, not a shot on target, not the glimmer of a threat. Their xG at the break was 0.07, a 40% improvement on what they managed in the entirety of last Saturday’sdrab defeat by Chelsea, but still the sort of figure you can generate if your centre-forward looks hard enough at the opposition goal. The game drifted. Worst of all was the sense that neither side was actually trying to kill the game, that, like Lennie with the rabbits in Of Mice and Men, they’d done so by mistake, as a result of their own clumsiness. There was a rumbling sense of frustration. The stadium gearing up for a symphony of booing. And then suddenly three goals happened in 11 minutes and nobody knew quite what to think.The blunt fact is that Spurs haven’t won any of their last five Premier League home games. Six games at theTottenham HotspurStadium have yielded five points. They might have begun the day sixth in the table but poor home form is far less forgivable than poor away form, particularly for fans who regularly protest against rising ticket prices. The smallish contingent who felt they were above appointing a manager from Brentford now find themselves joined in scepticism by those bewildered at just how unadventurous some of Thomas Frank’s football has seemed.Frank did not win any of his first eight games as manager of Brøndby and lost eight of his first ten games at Brentford. The circumstances were slightly different, admittedly, but still the precedent is there: he has a track record of overcoming poor starts. It may even be that the slow start is part of the process of him instilling his way of doing things.But there are also specific circumstances: Tottenham have been without Dominic Solanke, James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski for most of the season, and they lost Lucas Bergvall and Mohammed Kudus last weekend.View image in fullscreenXavi Simons has struggled to adapt to the Premier League.Photograph: Ian Walton/APThat is a significant creative deficit to make up, particularly given Xavi Simons appears to be finding acclimatisation to the Premier League so testing. In the end, although it was Mathys Tel and Richarlison who got the Spurs goals, the key figure in coaxing the game’s ashes into life was Wilson Odobert, who had come on at half-time for Randal Kolo Muani.The 20-year-old’s beginning to life at Tottenham has been hampered by hamstring problems but there is a reason why he has been capped 14 times by France’s under-21 side. He carries the ball well and, afterscoring against Copenhagenin the Champions League on Tuesday, played three key passes here as part of a 100% pass completion rate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Frank may work for Spurs or he may not but the pattern of his previous jobs, limited evidence though that may be, is that it takes a while for him to get his teams playing his way. The Europa League success obscures just how awful Spurs were at times last season; that will take time to rectify, and the injuries in forward areas will only extend that process. The fix was never going to be quick.With United enduring a similar rebuild, perhaps a game of mixed quality, a mishmash of the dismal and the excellent, was only to be expected.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurManchester UnitedanalysisShareReuse this content"

With the World Cup taking place in his city, he should challenge Fifa nextSat 8 Nov 2025 08.14 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Nov 2025 08.39 ESTShareAfterwinning the electionfor mayor of New York City, an exuberant Zohran Mamdani took to the stage at his victory speech andsaid, “If there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.” He was alluding to Donald Trump, but the sentiment also applies to Fifa, the world’s governing body for soccer.In September, Mamdani’s team kicked off a “Game Over Greed”campaigntargeting Fifa’s use of dynamic pricing for 2026 men’s World Cup tickets,callingit an “affront to the game.” His petition demanded that Fifa cease its rapacious dynamic pricing scheme, place a price cap on tickets that are resold on Fifa’s ticketing platform, and reserve a tranche of tickets for local residents. Mamdani, a longtime Arsenal fan, told theGuardian’s Football Weeklypodcast, “I have long been quite troubled by how the supposed stewards of the game have opted for profit time and time again at the expense of the people that love this game.”Trump ally Infantino to award first Fifa peace prize at World Cup draw in DCRead moreNow that he’s been elected mayor, Mamdani has the power and the platform to push further against the hideous “stewards” of the beautiful game. It’s time to target Fifa’s jaw-dropping tax exemptions and the ridiculous contractual demands that soccer’s world governing body places on World Cup host cities. Fifa honchos ooze privilege, making them the perfect political target at a time whenpublic supportfor taxing the rich is widespread. As a genuine fan of the sport and a generational political talent, Mamdani might be able to achieve the unthinkable: force the Fifa behemoth to share its lucre.At times, it seems like Fifa is just a money factory with a bit of football stashed in its annex. Spurred by the 2026 World Cup, Fifaset the goalof securing a whopping $11 billion in revenues through the four-year cycle, up from the$7.5 billionit hoovered up from Qatar 2022. The 2026 World Cup, expanded to include 48 teams, is on pace to become the most lucrative event in the history of sports.Behind the scenes, tax exemptions have become a key element of the Fifa greed machine. After studying the lopsided contracts between Fifa and the South African government for the 2010 men’s World Cup, lawyer Sophie Nakueiradescribedthe world’s governing body as a “floating sovereign.” In other words, Fifa is a parastate that acts like a parasite, treating World Cup hosts like its own private Vegas buffet.In itsBid Evaluation Reportfor the two candidature files for the 2026 World Cup, Fifa makes a special point to rate each country’s willingness to offer massive tax exemptions for both media and marketing. Assessing Morocco’s unsuccessful bid and the “United” bid of Canada, Mexico, and the US, Fifa rated highest Morocco and Mexico (in the pre-Claudia Scheinbaum era) for their willingness to offer a “full tax exemption.” The US assured Fifa of a “full tax exemption” for media and a “close-to-full tax exemption” for marketing revenues, and President Trump supplied a letter of support in 2018 to settle any jitters that Fifa might have been feeling. Meanwhile, Canada played hardball with taxpayer funds and earned a—womp-womp—“limited tax exemption” rating in both areas. Although the tournament ends in mid-July 2026, Fifa somehowrequiresits tax exemptions to last through 31 December 2028.View image in fullscreenZohran Mamdani’s team launched a ‘Game Over Greed’ campaign targeting Fifa’s use of dynamic pricing for 2026 World Cup tickets.Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesNick McGeehan, the director of the human-rights groupFairSquare, told the Guardian,“Tax exemptions allow Fifa to suck vast amounts of money out of its hosts. The majority of the cost of preparing the tournament falls on the hosts, while Fifa pockets all the revenue that is generated from the sale of broadcasting and marketing rights.” McGeehan added, “Fifa demands tax exemptions on all of this money and for the revenue generated by many of its partners too.” This includes some of the wealthiest media and marketing firms in the world.Acquiring specific information about Fifa’s tax breaks is a gumshoe affair involving obscure government and Fifa documents. The task is complicated by the fact that Fifa pennedindividual contractswith all eleven US host cities—unlike the last time the country hosted a men’s World Cup in 1994, when a centralized organizing committee oversaw the contract—thereby splintering liability and gifting Fifa with a chance to put the squeeze on a city-by-city basis. Solidarity be damned. Ironclad secrecy rules.Mamdani should push for full transparency: all Fifa contracts ought to be released to the public, starting withNew York New Jersey. The New York Timesreviewedthe New York New Jersey contract, concluding that it gives enormous power to Fifa and very little power to local hosts, but every single Fifa contract should be available on the City website for all to read. To date, only a few cities have made public their contracts with Fifa, such asSeattle,Vancouver,Toronto, andSanta Clara, some with significant redactions. If host cities are contractually expected to host matches at astronomical prices—including fan festivals, which can cost$1 million per dayper city—everyday people should be able to know the details. Feeling the fiscal pinch, cities like Bellingham, Washington are dramaticallyscaling backplans for public fan zones, depriving soccer enthusiasts one of the only affordable ways to partake. Challenging Fifa privilege chimes with Mamdani’s election-winning demand that working people are confronting a crisis of affordability and the 1 percent is not doing its fair share.Host-city agreements withFifaaren’t engraved in stone tablets delivered from Mt. Sinai; they can be amended, as long as changes are in writing and agreed to by the host city authority, Fifa, and the US Soccer Federation.For its part, Fifa says the money it gains from events like theWorld Cuphelps the sports itself. “The revenue [Fifa] generates is reinvested to fuel the growth of the game - men, women, youth - throughout Fifa’s 211 member associations globally,” the organization told the Guardian in September.Mamdani might look backward to move forward. Back in 2012, a successful activist campaign shamed London 2012 Summer Olympics corporate sponsors intoforgoingtheir tax exemptions. Mamdani’s democratic-socialist supporters could lead a grassroots campaign to reclaim public money from avaricious corporations.View image in fullscreenThe MetLife Stadium in New Jersey will host the World Cup final next July.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersWhen it comes to the World Cup, host cities are taking the fiscal risks, while Fifa scoops up the rewards. In numerous World Cup host cities, residents are bracing for extra costs related to security and logistics. Although theBig Beautiful Bill Act, passed last summer, allocated $625 million for “security and other costs related to the Fifa World Cup,” local leaders are concerned that costs in the neighborhood of “$150 million per city” could fall on the shoulders of local taxpayers. In Massachusetts, Democratic Governor Maura Healey recentlyproposedcreating a $20 million Fifa World Cup reserve fund.Meanwhile, in Canada, the World Cup is skewing public priorities. Amid layoffs in Vancouver’s city government, World Cup planning remains unaffected. “It’s a contractual obligation” with Fifa,explaineda deputy city manager. “We have no wiggle room in terms of delivering what we need to deliver.” It’s no wonder that soccer-mad cities likeMinneapolisandChicagosaid thanks but no thanks to hosting matches due to Fifa’s unwillingness to negotiate in good faith and stiffinsistenceon tax breaks and loading liability on the hosts’ backs.Canadian journalist Bob Mackin – who deserves enormous credit for wrenching documents from the clenched fists of World Cup organizers in Vancouver – told me, “Vancouver’s involvement in Fifa 26 lacks any credible, publicly available business case, only rosy government news releases with a variety of cost ranges, revenue estimates and aspirations of a future tourism legacy.” He added, “There is no effort to mitigate the harms to the people struggling in the community.”Mamdani has a golden opportunity to expose the outrageous burdens that Fifa places on World Cup host cities and to demand that World Cup boosters “mitigate the harms” they inflict on working people. After all, vast sums of money swirl around the World Cup. The leader of Vancouver’s local organizing committee, Jessie Adler,hauled ina whopping $470,000 in 2024, dwarfing the British Columbia Premier David Eby’s salary of around $227,000. Mamdani could use Fifa’s brand of trickle-up economics to his political advantage.Much is possible, and the timing is propitious, with Mamdani riding high and the general public feeling low about corporate poweramassing moreand more while everyday people suffer. For too long, Fifa has been “fully focused on monetizing the sport, no matter the collateral damage,” as Leander Schaerlaeckensput itin these pages.With the 2026 World Cup coming into ever-sharper focus, now is the time to push back. Mamdani, a real-deal soccer aficionado and magnetic political force is the right guy to lead the charge.Explore more on these topicsFifaWorld Cup 2026Football politicsWorld CupZohran MamdanicommentShareReuse this content"

The Briton is looking increasingly like the man who would be king as his championship ambitions were backed with a statement of intent, having already secured victory in the sprint race.His success was given added impetus as both his title rivals, Oscar Piastri andMax Verstappen, suffered disappointment in Brazil. Piastri’s championship hopes took yet another blow as he crashed out of the sprint and qualified only in fourth, while Verstappen could manage only 16th on the grid.São Paulo Grand Prix: Lando Norris claims pole position after flying lap – liveRead moreVerstappen had already dropped points to Norris after he was fourth in the sprint for Red Bull and the British driver now has the chance to put genuine daylight on both his rivals. At this race last yearVerstappen came back from 17th to winbut that was in the wet and when he was not suffering from a compromised setup. The world champion now needs an immense drive on Sunday to keep his chances alive.With the sprint victory Norris has extended his lead over Piastri to nine points, while Verstappen is 39 points behind the British driver, with 108 on the table from the remaining four meetings, including one more sprint race.Norris, who notably does not really believe in momentum, acknowledged that perhaps he was on something of a roll. “I was under a bit of pressure because I messed up on my first lap, so more stressful than I would’ve liked. But stayed calm when it mattered and put it all together,” he said. “I think when I’m in a good rhythm, when I can stay calm, put it all together I’ll be on top.”Quick GuideSão Paulo GP qualifying timesShow1Lando Norris(GB) McLaren1min 09.511sec2Kimi Antonelli(Ita) Mercedes1:09.6853Charles Leclerc(Mon) Ferrari1:09.8054Oscar Piastri(Aus) McLaren1:09.8865Isack Hadjar(Fr) RB1:09.9316George Russell(GB) Mercedes1:09.9427Liam Lawson(NZ) RB1:09.9628Oliver Bearman(GB) Haas F11:09.9779Pierre Gasly(Fra) Alpine1:10.00210Nico Hülkenberg(Ger) Sauber1:10.039Eliminated in Q211Fernando Alonso(Spa) Aston Martin1:10.00112Alexander Albon(Tha) Williams1:10.05313Lewis Hamilton(Gbr) Ferrari1:10.10014Lance Stroll(Can) Aston Martin1:10.16115Carlos Sainz Jr(Sp) Williams1:10.472Eliminated in Q116Max Verstappen(Neth) Red Bull1:10.40317Esteban Ocon(Fr) Haas1:10.43818Franco Colapinto(Arg) Alpine1:10.63219Yuki Tsunoda(Jpn) Red Bull1:10.71120Gabriel Bortoleto(Br) Kick Sauberno timeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The woes of his competitors stand in stark contrast to the Briton, for whom the victory comes on the back of his dominant pole-to-flagwin in Mexicoas he continues what has been an enormously strong and consistent run of form. His pole lap, a one-off shot he had to make after a mistake on his first run, was immense and flawless as he looks to take the title by the scruff of the neck.Piastri had been in better form in qualifying but the damage had already been done in the morning’s sprint race. Norris led from pole to the flag at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in a race that opened in damp conditions after earlier rain that made the track tricky and which caught Piastri out as he crashed after losing grip when he put a wheel on to a kerb. It was an enormously costly error and not the first in recent races for the Australian.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen said his car was ‘completely broken’ in Brazil.Photograph: DPPI/ShutterstockVerstappen had been unhappy with his car all weekend and described it as “completely broken” on Friday. He simply could not hook up a lap in qualifying, adrift in the car with no explanation as to quite what was wrong. He was knocked out in Q1 for the first time since the Russian Grand Prix in 2021.“I have zero grip,” he said with no little frustration. The team had adapted their setup post-sprint in an effort to find better pace but it appears they had simply gone in the wrong direction in an attempt to fix the car’s instability over the bumps of Interlagos. The team principal, Laurent Mekies, admitted they had taken a risk with their setup, looking for performance that had not paid off.Verstappen said: “I don’t understand how it can be this bad.”Piastri will be most concerned that his touch increasingly appears to have deserted him. He has endured a run of difficult races, including crashing out in Baku and being off the pace in the US and Mexico, and he too needs to come back strongly on Sunday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fearsomely quick, he went top as Piastri followed him out. The Australian could not improve however and while Kimi Antonelli delivered an immense run for second place, Norris had pole with a 1:9.511 lap.Charles Leclerc was in third for Ferrari but his teammate Lewis Hamilton could manage only a disappointing 13th. Isack Hadjar was an impressive fifth for Racing Bulls.A dramatic sprint race was also marked by an horrific accident for the São Paulo boy Gabriel Bortoleto. On the final lap the Brazilian lost the rear looking to go up the inside heading into turn one and speared into the barriers on the inside which catapulted him airborne into the barriers on the opposite side of the circuit with an enormously heavy impact.Bortoleto emerged from the car and was taken to the medical centre and pronounced unhurt but his car was too damaged to be repaired in time for qualifying.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Lando NorrisOscar PiastriMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullFormula OnenewsShareReuse this content"

The victory marks the 26-year-old’s fourth big title after wins at Wimbledon in 2022, and Indian Wells and the Italian Open a year later. This is her third title of the season and her 11th title on the WTA Tour overall.WTA Finals tennis: Elena Rybakina rocks Aryna Sabalenka to claim title – as it happenedRead moreUntil a few weeks ago, 2025 had been a disappointing year for the Russian-born Kazakhstani, whose presence in Riyadh was far from certain. She qualified for the tournament with a brilliant late run of form and has followed it up with some of the best performances of her career, winning her last 11 matches in the process.Over the past few years, Sabalenka has built her reputation and immense success behind her enormous ground strokes and ceaseless aggression but here she found herself against the one opponent who has proven on numerous occasions that she is capable of outhitting the Belarusian.A day after striking 15 aces in her semi-final win over Jessica Pegula, Rybakina reaffirmed her status as the best server in the world by making her service games impenetrable and putting so much pressure on Sabalenka to hold her own. The Kazakhstani took the first strike in many of the baseline exchanges, forcing herself inside the baseline and absolutely eviscerating the ball off both wings. As she tried to counter Rybakina’s relentless pace and depth, so often Sabalenka had no time to set up her strokes.View image in fullscreenElena Rybakina only qualified for the WTA Finals with a late burst but then won every match at the season-ending event.Photograph: Fatima Shbair/APAfter snatching the decisive break of the opening set by laying waste the Sabalenka second serve, Rybakina piled pressure on her opponent throughout the second set, breezing through her own service games while forcing the No 1 into long games on her own serve.As usual, Sabalenka fought desperately until the end, holding firm in generating two set points on Rybakina’s serve at 5-4 in the second set, but the Kazakhstani pulled herself together and ended the match serving and striking the ball at an astonishing level. She struck 36 winners with 13 aces, while limiting Sabalenka to 12 winners.Since her surprise run to theWimbledon title in 2022,Rybakina’s past few seasons have been fascinating. She is so highly regarded that she has often been discussed alongside Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff even when her results have not matched theirs. Too often Rybakina has not been able to find her best tennis in the important moments during the biggest tournaments. She has also been unsettled by numerous off-court problems, particularly the suspension of her coach, Stefano Vukov, who had beenaccused of being verbally and emotionally abusivetowards Rybakina before hisban was lifted in August.However, there has never been any doubt about the quality of her serve and ball striking. She has now placed herself back among the best in the world and positioned herself for even greater success in 2026.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sport must do moreSat 8 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTShareViewed through one end of the lens, the two new autobiographies from the sporting legends Boris Becker andBradley Wigginsmight seem like classic tales of the downfalls of two deeply flawed heroes who then claw their way back to redemption. But viewed through the other end of the lens, we see troubling portrayals of an extremely inhumane and, at times, unsafe world of sport where talent is no saving grace, in fact it’s more of a liability.There are striking similarities between the stories of two different characters, sports, countries and generations. Both went bankrupt. Both made bad choices and admit their agency in their own demise. Both hit rock bottom and found themselves stripped bare of all dignity, be it in a prison cell or snorting cocaine in a toilet. Becker wasconvicted by a British courton four counts out of 24 and ended up in prison, surrounded by drug addicts. Wiggins writes thathe was abusedby his youth cycling coach and after sport became hooked on cocaine on a path that he himself admits could easily have ended behind bars. Both were massively failed by trusted adults around them in positions of authority.Bradley Wiggins says he is ‘lucky to be here’ after revealing cocaine addictionRead moreAt only 17 after winning Wimbledon and reaching the heights of success, Becker feels desperately restricted by others around him: “I’m living in a box … I need to enjoy what I do. I need to feel free. And I’m not allowed.” He describes this as “the moment everything changed. The moment my path was set”. Wiggins was failed right from the start. Already “abandoned” by his father who left home when he was two years old, he suffers the twisted torment of his formative youth coach who he says sexually abused him while at the same time being the person who made him believe in his capabilities on a bike.Wiggins’s story reminds us of the unequivocal need to keep children safe in sport, and how easily abusers can operate, particularly with vulnerable children from unstable homes. While this took place 30 years ago, stories of abuse in sport continue. There is still no independent structure to set and uphold coherent standards for safe sport in this country, despite shifts across society in recent times that have led to independent structures being established across sectors from education, the church and the creative industries.View image in fullscreenBoris Becker triumphed at Wimbledon, aged 17, but he felt afterwards that he was denied his ‘need to feel free’.Photograph: PAAs an adult, Wiggins continues to suffer at BritishCyclingand Team Sky. On reaching out to Team Sky to admit “I’m really struggling”, Wiggins claims he is told to “pull yourself together”. Dave Brailsford is, in the good times (ie when he is winning), like a brother to Wiggins, but he soon believes “I was disposable to him. I felt I could be rinsed of all use and chucked in the bin with the rest of the rubbish.” His deeply destabilising experiences of abandonment by his father seem to be devastatingly repeated by cycling’s top coach and leaders, where “the line between critical and derogatory was so blurred as to be meaningless”.Our most vivid memories of these incredible athletes at their peak flash up pictures of “Becker the Wunderkind”winning Wimbledon at 17and falling to his knees in disbelief and joy, and images of Wiggins sitting on a throne at Hampton Court Palace having wonOlympic time trial goldat the London 2012 Olympics. In their books, Becker and Wiggins share their own perspectives. Becker rues: “If I hadn’t won Wimbledon aged 17, I would never have gone through any of this”, while Wiggins explains how snorting cocaine off his Olympic medal was a deliberate act of “disrespecting this medal, this particular medal, because I blame it for the person I’ve ended up”. Wiggins states that his “definitive answer” to the frequently asked question of what it’s like to win the Tour de France is: “It’s like doing drugs. It gives you everything you’ve ever asked for in that moment, but it takes so much more from you in return.” It’s about as far as you can get from the dream that talented youngsters in sport are promised.Neither athlete finds purpose nor meaning through sport. Becker’s motivation seems to centre around wanting to make his opponent’s mother weep, and he quickly loses discipline and motivation when he stops winning. Later, in prison, he eagerly consumes lessons on the Stoic philosophers in a course led by a pivotal guiding figure who runs the prison gym, filling a hole of meaning that sport never filled. For Wiggins, cycling is an escape from “a lifelong lack of self-worth,” but ultimately “sporting glory can never magic away scar tissue”. He lacks personal support during his sports career, though reconnecting with his children and breaking his father’s parenting patterns, the enduring friendship with Mark Cavendish and finding a new partner gradually move him forward.View image in fullscreenBradley Wiggins in 2022. The former Olympic champion describes cycling in his book as an escape from ‘a lifelong lack of self-worth’.Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PABoth sportsmen reflect on moments of bitterness and jealousy towards key rivals: for Becker it’s Michael Stich who beat him and shocked him out of his complacency in his final Wimbledon. They win a historic Olympic gold for Germany playing doubles yet barely speak to each other nor celebrate the win afterwards. For Wiggins, the mistrust with Chris Froome is so great that Wiggins can’t be trusted to be part of the Sky team to support Froome to win the Tour de France, despite his performance levels. Both Becker and Wiggins find huge comfort and much-needed resolution when these relationships right themselves years later, with Stich writing a powerful, moving letter to Becker in prison, and Wiggins reaching out to Froome years later to make amends.Zooming out, the loudest message from these stories is that deep, trusted relationships are what matter above all else. Trophies and medals don’t last: Becker sells his to pay off mounting debts, and Wiggins smashes his Sports Personality of the Year trophy and knighthood box in front of his children because they only bring him “more grief”. To the extent each has found redemption, it has come largely from relationships outside the sporting world, from trusted friends, genuine love and finally finding who they each are beyond the sporting identity that defined them for so long.Naturally, elite sport is tough and neither of these athletes disputes that. But it’s hard to look at these phenomenal sportspeople and accept these experiences as the necessary, even inevitable “price of winning”. These are not stories to inspire the next generation or reinforce sport’s capacity to unlock human potential and reinforce basic social values. Sport is often described as having the power to change the world. But these stories – which must sit alongside many stories that will never be heard – show that sport needs to change itself first if this is ever to become possible.guardianbookshop.com.

A 94th-minute strike from the substitute Brian Brobbey claimed a point for the home side, who are fourth in the table.“It’s not a nice feeling,” said Arteta. “It’s disappointment and frustration, because we wanted the three points. We had to navigate through a tough game. We knew that. [They were] very disruptive. We had to deal with situations that were obviously difficult to deal with.”Sunderland fight back with late Brobbey equaliser to hold leaders ArsenalRead moreThe formerArsenalacademy player Dan Ballard had opened the scoring during a first half that had seemingly unsettled the visitors; asked how he felt when Arsenal’s club-record run of eight clean sheets was ended, Arteta said: “A pain in my tummy, because I don’t want to concede any goals.” His side improved after the break and took the lead through goals from Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard.Arteta said of Sunderland’s opener: “We conceded a goal that was not in our standards, but after that, the team reacted really well, showed a lot of personality and courage. Scored the first goal, scored the second goal, and we totally dominated the game.“You have to rely on defending the box when they start to commit six, seven players there. It can be from a direct play, it can be from a throw, or it can be from any situation. We can defend the action better. And today we haven’t done it, we have conceded a goal.”Even after Brobbey’s equaliser, Ballard had to block a Mikel Merino shot. Arteta said: “In the last minute, we had another massive chance to win, which I think we deserved.”Régis Le Bris praised the “character” of his Sunderland team, whose motto in last season’s successful run in the Championship playoffs was: “Till the end”.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta reacts to a missed opportunity for his league leaders.Photograph: Richard Lee/Shutterstock“It shows that the team has a really strong character,” said Le Bris. “It’s still tough against a team like Arsenal, one of the best teams in Europe, so you have to do a masterclass, otherwise it’s impossible to win something.“I think the first half was well balanced, we tried to defend high when possible, organised a deep block, really compact, narrow, aggressive, and we had the opportunity to manage the ball sometimes.“The second half was a bit tougher, because you defend for long periods, and then you have to stay composed with the ball, and we still have a really young squad, really young players without great experience in the Premier League, so it’s a good lesson.“I think we were just on the edge after the 2-1, and Arsenal were dominant, and they were able to keep the ball. But with the energy of the stadium, I think the characteristics of our players, and the background we have now, I think it’s really positive for this faith, and this belief, that we can change the dynamic.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetaSunderlandnewsShareReuse this content"

We were comfortable in the game but I think we should do better, be more aggressive, feeling the environment in the stadium and that the three points were there, the space was there.“I think we felt too comfortable during the game. We need to expect that in one play anything can happen and change the mood of the stadium, and today was that. We need to do better because the game was there to take.”There was concern over an apparent knee injury to the second-half replacement Benjamin Sesko. “We think he has a problem but let’s see,” Amorim said.Amorim’s counterpart,Thomas Frank, defended his substitutions after a negative response from the home crowd when he withdrew Xavi Simons for Tel in the 79th minute.

The corner that led to the goal should have been a goal-kick, but once it was given the goal should have stood.“I had no idea,” said Slegers. “The goal is scored, no one is calling for it, the players are celebrating, the stadium goes crazy, it’s a fantastic moment. Then, all of a sudden, I turned around and saw somebody saying the goal was disallowed so I was very surprised.”View image in fullscreenHannah Hampton fails to keep out Alessia Russo’s shot for Arsenal’s equaliser – but was the forward offside?Photograph: Yui Mok/PAAlessia Russo’s goal with three minutes remaining earned Arsenal a draw, though replays showed she may have been offside. The Gunners believed they had grabbed an added-time winner soon after, but Frida Maanum was flagged offside, in another marginal call that highlighted the need for VAR.Speaking on Sky Sports, the former England international Izzy Christiansen called the two decisions “absolutely abysmal” and lamented the impact on Arsenal’s title challenge. “It’s cost them.

Though hope is not yet extinguished. A second home win in succession for Nuno Espírito Santo’s team, with old faithful Tomas Soucek key in defeating a fellow relegation contender inBurnley.Three points wrested from a contest low on proficiency may prove vital in the fight against the London Stadium staging Championship football next season. “It means everything,” said Nuno.Once Soucek had scored the Hammers’ second, before his shot was spilled into fellow sub Kyle Walker-Peters’ path for the third, home fans were singing lustily. They had already made it known once again, and in no uncertain terms, what they think of those running the club. Following protests against Crystal Palace, theboycotting of the Brentford game, a sit-in against Newcastle, a pre-match march had been staged.A banner declared: “15 years of denyingWest Ham United.” The entrance for club directors’ luxury cars was blocked off by thousands of protesters as black balloons floated and a coffin was carried. That West Ham had “sold our soul” by moving to the former Olympic stadium was the loudest chant.View image in fullscreenWest Ham fans hold a protest against the club’s owners before kickoff.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PASaturday’s victory is highly unlikely to dim dissatisfaction with co-owner David Sullivan and vice-chair Baroness Brady. Though hardly the first dissent of their stewardship, a critical mass is being reached. “We are giving small steps in our relationship with our fans,” said Nuno, one of football’s leading diplomats. “I think we are giving them something and they are returning a thousand times more.”More positive signs: Freddie Potts, home-grown star ofbeating Newcastle, again exhibited the look of the archetypal West Ham midfielder before coming off injured after an hour: upright, strolling, capable of picking a pass, with bite in the tackle, as evidenced by an early challenge on Loum Tchaouna.Quick GuideWest Ham 3-2 Burnley key factsShow• Callum Wilson has scored seven goals in his last six Premier League games against Burnley. He has eight goals against the Clarets overall in the competition, only netting more against …  West Ham (12).• West Ham have conceded a league-high nine headed goals in the Premier League this season, already one more than they shipped in the whole of the 2024-25 campaign.• Tomas Soucek scored his 38th Premier League goal for West Ham, the joint-most of all Czech players in the competition’s history, level with Patrik Berger, the former Liverpool forward.OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Burnley manager, Scott Parker, was such a player for West Ham, the one-man team of their 2010-11 relegation season. Before this fixture, his side had taken – with 7.4 – the lowest ever average shots perPremier Leaguegame as yet recorded, and he may learn a lesson that West Ham’s goals came once he had gambled on taking the three points. “We’ve fallen short in moments of concentration,” Parker said. “This is a big boy league. I can always accept a loss. I can also accept conceding a goal but certain boxes need to be ticked.”Despite nine efforts on goal and 56% of possession, his team headed back north empty-handed. Had Zian Flemming connected with Quilindschy Hartman’s cross, Burnley might have taken an earlier lead than they did. “We were exceptional, everything we wanted to be,” said Parker of the first half. He agonised that a “massive opportunity” had been squandered in the second half. “I thought the game was there, I felt really comfortable.”Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball.

A 20-minute spell in the second half aside, the visitors were easily subdued by Everton’s greater urgency, physicality and quality. Fulham will be in trouble on this evidence. The hosts had three goals disallowed for offside too but a poacher’s finish from Gueye in first-half stoppage time and Keane’s late effort ensured there would be no reprieve for the former Everton manager.Sunderland v Arsenal: Premier League – liveRead more“We got what we deserved,” admitted Silva. “We only played for 20 minutes. We lost the game in the physical side, we didn’t handle it at all. You can lose a game because the other team is better than you but not because you don’t come up to the physical standard. That is not negotiable.”Everton striker Thierno Barry drew another blank in front of goal and was again downcast when substituted for Beto, as was the case at Sunderland on Monday. But the 23-year-old departed to a rousing ovation in recognition of a much-improved display. Barry’s movement and work-rate occupied Fulham’s central defenders and helped give Everton the edge throughout. Moyes, his decision to stick with the striker vindicated, said: “The fans were brilliant for Barry today but Barry gave them something too and he deserved to be applauded off. The supporters need a great deal of credit for that because we need both boys to keep their confidence up.”The hosts dominated the early exchanges with Barry heading over from Iliman Ndiaye’s cross and Bernd Leno saving a 30-yard free-kick from James Garner, awarded after Sasa Lukic was booked for hauling down Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall. Lukic later tripped the same player but the referee, Andrew Madley, rightly ignored Everton appeals for a second yellow. Silva was taking no further chances, however, and withdrew the midfielder at the interval.View image in fullscreenMichael Keane makes the points safe with Everton’s second goal.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PABarry thought his luck had finally turned when sliding in at the back post to convert a low cross by Gueye. But the joy of a first Everton goal was erased by an assistant referee’s flag. Ndiaye was offside when attacking the cross at the near post and the video assistant referee backed up the on-field decision.Fulham came into the contest fleetingly with Sander Berge and former Everton midfielder Alex Iwobi working well in midfield but the first-half threat from the visitors was minimal. Raúl Jiménez shot tamely at Jordon Pickford when teed up by Iwobi and put a free-kick from a dangerous position straight into the Everton wall. And that was it.Everton, driven on by the excellent Dewsbury-Hall, had a second goal disallowed when Leno parried Keane’s header and James Tarkowski volleyed in the rebound. The home captain had strayed offside when heading on Jack Grealish’s cross in the build-up. But Everton’s third attempt past Leno did stand. Vitalii Mykolenko floated over a lovely cross when found in space by Tim Iroegbunam. Tarkowski met it with a thumping header against the bar and, though Iroegbunam fluffed his lines at the rebound, his midfield partner Gueye followed in to convert from close range. The relief inside Hill Dickinson Stadium was palpable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ndiaye had cushioned the delivery towards Barry, who was offside when challenging Joachim Andersen for the touch that fell to the Everton midfielder. Everton would have to wait until the 81st minute for the comfort of a two-goal lead. Dewsbury-Hall was the provider with a corner that Keane glanced over Leno. The defender did so with the back of his shoulder, and Fulham’s appeals for handball were dismissed by VAR.Silva’s side carried more of a threat after the introductions of Josh King and Rodrigo Muniz, although the latter was himself replaced by Adama Traoré after suffering a suspected recurrence of a hamstring injury. Pickford saved well to prevent Muniz scoring with his first touch and denied Traoré with another important stop late on, but Everton’s victory was never seriously in doubt.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Bayern top theBundesligaon 28 points and in fact extended their lead to six, as RB Leipzig lost 3-1 at Hoffenheim.Bayern, who had made it 16 victories from 16 games with 2-1 win at Paris Saint-Germain, the Champions League holders, on Tuesday, looked to have run out of steam against the hard-working Berlin side. The hosts thought they had taken the lead with Ilyas Ansah’s ninth-minute header but the fans were bitterly disappointed after the referee ruled it marginally offside following a video assistant referee review.They still went in front in the 27th minute when Manuel Neuer let Doekhi’s weak shot slip through his hands and under his body. It was the first time Bayern had conceded a first-half goal and the first time they were trailing in the Bundesliga this season.Luis Díaz, who had scored twice but was also sent off against PSG, drew them level after playing a superb one-two with Josip Stanisic, sliding to keep the ball in play and curling a shot from near the sideline into the top far corner.The Colombian should have scored again for the champions in the 45th minute after he was sent through by Kane but he fired well wide with only the keeper to beat. It was the hosts who scored again in the 83rd when Doekhi volleyed in after Kane failed to clear a free-kick. The England captain, however, made amends with his 13th league goal of the season.Kane said: “It was a tough game. It wasn’t our best game, but we stayed focused and managed to equalise. That’s football, there are games like today where things go against you. We’ll take the point.“It would’ve been worse to go into the international break with a defeat. We can keep the momentum going with this draw. Sixteen wins in a row is incredible but now that it is over, it won’t be the main talking point any more. We move on.”There was also a last-gasp equaliser asBorussia Dortmundsettled for a 1-1 draw atHamburg.

Frank Lampard watched on calmly, arms folded, from the technical area. But even he had allowed himself a celebratory jig with his staff at the goal and why not? His doubters, and there were many, are not so audible now.This was not classic 2025/26 Coventry, all free flowing and even freer scoring. They were in a battle and they knew about it. “It was crying out for that bit of extra skill or it would have petered out into a nil-nil,” Lampard said. “Our approach was what I really liked as it showed a side of us that had a real focus.”Quick GuideLeague One roundup: Wilshere's Luton win againShowThe top three in League One were all beaten as Jack Wilshere's positive start to life asLuton’smanager continued with a 3-0 victory over table-toppersStockport.

It’s chalk and cheese from last season, so we’ve got to take a little bit of a breath and a bit of realism.”Robins is right. Stoke, who slipped to third, showed enough to suggest that their resurrection is still on.

The former had Stoke’s best two openings but was twice thwarted by the sound defence of Jay Dasilva.Manhoef looked primed to meet a teasing first-half cross at the back post, only for Dasilva’s vital touch to cause the ball to bounce off his face and to safety. Offside was suspected but the flag remained down and, given the lack of video assistant referee, it would have stood.Staying on video technology, Thomas found fortune in its absence. “My bad, my bad”, he mouthed when swarmed by blue shirts after he kicked the twisting Tatsuhiro Sakamoto near the touchline. It was mistimed, not malicious, but he wore a guilty face.In the second half, a cleverly weighted Bae Jun-ho pass set Manhoef through but Dasilva pushed him wide before throwing his body at the shot.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball.

But France, now on a four-match losing streak, cracked under pressure as their discipline disintegrated despite the Springboks being reduced to 14 men on the stroke of half-time.Fabien Galthié’s side looked irresistible early on as the winger Damian Penaud scored twice to become his country’s all-time leading try-scorer with 40, surpassing Serge Blanco’s longstanding record.A succession of reckless infringements and a costly yellow card, however, handed the initiative to the Springboks who punished every mistake in ruthless fashion.South Africa fought back with tries from Cobus Reinach, André Esterhuizen, Grant Williams and Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu, who also slotted two penalties and three conversions.It had all started brightly for France. The full-back Thomas Ramos sent a perfectly weighted chip over the defence after four minutes which Penaud gathered to score. The winger struck again soon after, diving into the corner to double the lead, and when De Jager was sent off for a dangerous tackle on Ramos, France seemed in full control despite being only one point ahead.View image in fullscreenSouth Africa celebrate at the final whistle after three second-half tries secured victory in Paris.Photograph: Nathan Barange/DPPI/ShutterstockThen came South Africa’s spectacular revival through a mixture of clinical attacking and iron discipline. The France winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey was sent to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on, and the world champions pounced.Esterhuizen powered over from a maul after the visitors had chosen to go for the lineout after being awarded a penalty, before Williams darted through a splintered defence for another try as the momentum swung quickly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After last weekend’s deflating 26-13 loss to the All Blacks in Chicago, tries from Jack Crowley and Nick Timoney (pictured) helped Andy Farrell’s much-changed side overcome a slow start at the Aviva Stadium.Eddie Jones' Brave Blossoms trailed only 17-10 at half-time after Kenji Sato's score and five points from the boot of Lee Seung-sin. But the hosts, who face upcoming appointments against Australia and world champions South Africa, improved significantly in the second period.. But the hosts, who face upcoming appointments against Australia and the world champions, South Africa, improved significantly in the second period. Andrew Porter crossed to increase Ireland’s lead before wing Tommy O’Brien sealed victory after Gus McCarthy and Paddy McCarthy each came off the bench to touch down. Crowley also kicked seven points, with replacement fly-half Sam Prendergast slotting two conversions.Asked if he got the response he wanted to the deflating defeat to the All Blacks, Andy Farrell, who made eight alterations to his starting XV, replied: “In short, no. Certainly not in the first half. But the response that we wanted from half-time onwards was pleasing enough because when you make a good few errors within your game it can suppress you a little bit.“We were feeling sorry for ourselves a little bit and the mood wasn’t how it should be. But how we got over ourselves and got some tempo back into the game in the second half is credit to the lads.\"Farrell has concerns over full-back Jamie Osborne, who was forced off injured in the 65th minute. “It doesn’t look good, poor lad – you could see by the way he was holding his arm,” said Farrell. “I thought he might have broken something. But it’s the shoulder, we think, that was out of place and back in place now. But to know that for sure we’ll have to get a look at that.”Eddie Jones felt his side missed an opportunity to record a famous victory. “We put ourselves in a position to win the game in the first half, probably went into half-time with a little bit of momentum, Ireland had [Jacob] Stockdale in the bin,” said the Australian. “But we didn’t take advantage of the sin-bin and then – whether we got disappointed – we just faded badly in the last 30 minutes.PA MediaPhotograph: Niall Carson/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With France rattled and conceding a succession of penalties, Feinberg-Mngomezulu sealed a remarkable comeback, rounding the defence on the outside and sliding over the line before converting his own try.“The credit goes to the whole team,” South Africa’s coach, Rassie Erasmus, said. “Some say they’re getting old. They’re getting wiser, calmer.”Galthié rued his team’s missed opportunities. “Around the 60th minute we had three clear chances where we should have scored, then we conceded a series of penalties, and we were forced to defend our line until the yellow card and the try,” he said.South Africa have now beaten France in nine of their past 10 meetings.

Only in the final quarter did the home side pull away on the scoreboard and, for lengthy periods, they had to work extremely hard for theirsecond victoryin as many weeks.They will definitely need to find another gear to see off next Saturday’s opponents New Zealand.Equally there is no doubting the fact England are finishing games more strongly and have some rare talent lurking in reserve. This time it was their birthday boy, Henry Arundell, who shone brightest off the bench, scoring one scorching try and looking dangerous every time he touched the ball on his first appearance for England for two years.England 38-18 Fiji: Autumn Nations Series rugby union – as it happenedRead moreIt was also a good night to be English and hyphenated. Chandler Cunningham-South, Manny Feyi-Waboso and Luke Cowan-Dickie all had forceful games, with the latter pair claiming two of their side’s six tries. On a calm, mild evening in south-west London – not that the palm trees in Twickenham high street ever sway too wildly – Ollie Chessum was also prominently involved while Ellis Genge led purposefully from the front.Quick GuideEngland v Fiji teams and scorersShowEnglandM Smith; Freeman (Arundell 66), Lawrence, Dingwall, Feyi-Waboso; F Smith, Mitchell (Spencer 62); Genge (co-capt; Baxter 53), Cowan-Dickie (George 53), Heyes (Opoku-Fordjour 53), Coles (Itoje; co-capt 53), Chessum, Pepper (Pollock 53), Earl, Cunningham-South (T Curry 53).Tries:Cowan-Dickie, Feyi-Waboso, Genge, George, Arundell, Itoje.ConsF Smith 4.FijiRayasi; Ravutaumada, Ravouvou, Tuisova, Wainiqolo (Maqala 56); Muntz (Armstrong-Ravula 59), Kuruvoli (Wye 66); Mawi (Hetet 56), Ikanivere (capt; Togiatama 56), Doge (Tawake 56), Nasilasila (Vocevoce 65), Mayanavanua, Salawa, Canakaivata (Murray 61), Mata.Yellow cardsRavutaumada 35, Tuisova 59.TriesIkanivere 2, Muntz.PenMuntz.RefereePaul Williams (NZ).Att78,678.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But rather like the pre-game minute’s silence, which was interspersed with a persistent automatic tannoy message blasting out of the stadium’s bowels, it was ultimately a mixed bag from an English perspective. This was a game they had earmarked as a chance for some experimentation but the physicality of a gallant Fiji side rudely interrupted some of Steve Borthwick’s best-laid plans, not least the search for his ideal backline blend.There is little doubt George Ford will get the nod at 10 against New Zealand but, as with the All Blacks and the talented duo of Beauden Barrett and Damian McKenzie, Borthwick still has one or two conundrums to solve. Fraser Dingwall and Ollie Lawrence were not always in perfect harmony in England’s midfield while Arundell’s electric contribution will reopen the debate about the future shape of the back three. Freddie Steward is fit again but the Bath flyer may yet emerge as a better long-term starting option at 15 than the versatile Marcus Smith.It all made for a thought-provoking evening with Fiji again doing themselves proud. Replicating theirfamous win in this stadiumin August 2023 was never going to be easy but, after an early score for a charging Cowan-Dickie, the visitors built some impressive first-half momentum.First a well-engineered rolling maul produced a try for the skipper Tevita Ikanivere and England then fell victim to one of those uniquely unplayable Fijian attacks that remain their hallmark.View image in fullscreenMaro Itoje dives over to seal England’s win against Fiji.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThere had already been some glorious passing before the scrum-half Simione Kuruvoli chipped the English defence and was taken down without the ball by Marcus Smith. In the event Fiji did not need the advantage, Caleb Muntz gathering the bouncing ball and just reaching the line despite Ben Earl’s desperate tackle.With a subsequent penalty by Muntz extending the visitors’ lead to 13-7 just before the half-hour mark, Fiji simply needed to keep calm and carry on. It was less than ideal, then, when the winger Selestino Ravutaumada was given a yellow card for clattering Feyi-Waboso in the air and England took swift advantage of their extra man when Fin Smith lobbed a cross-kick to an unmarked Feyi-Waboso who cut inside to score. Smith’s conversion restored the red rose lead and settled a few fluttering home nerves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fiji, though, stick in games for much longer these days. Six of the pack, plus all their forward replacements, play Super Rugby for the Fijian Drua and one of them, Ikanivere, plunged over for his second try after a crafty front-of-the-lineout ploy.Only Muntz’s recurring failure to land a conversion prevented the scoreboard gap from narrowing further, while a yellow card for the formidable Josua Tuisova was another untimely blow. England were lucky, though, that a quite brilliant 50-metre team score by Fiji was ultimately ruled out for the smallest of knock-ons by a sliding Kuruvoli, which the Fiji coach Mick Byrne felt could have been awarded.Instead it was the hosts who finished the stronger, helped by a stunning burst of pace from Arundell who surged past a startled Kalaveti Ravouvou to collect a Marcus Smith kick and celebrate his 23rd birthday in style. His exile in the French Top 14 has ruled him out of England contention for the last season and a half but he has now reminded everyone exactly what he can do. Maro Itoje, another influential second-half arrival,applied the icing with England’s sixth try but the All Blacks, as ever, will present the ultimate autumn Test.Explore more on these topicsAutumn Nations SeriesEngland rugby union teamFiji rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

We are all asking how to deal with this.”Advertising prescription drugs in the UK is illegal, but the Guardian has found that a number of TikTok influencers are collaborating with private medical clinics to advertise blood tests, which are legal to promote, as a route to testosterone therapy.View image in fullscreenAdvocates for testosterone replacement therapy with thousands of followers are being paid or offered incentives by private clinics to promote discount codes and giveaways.Photograph: TikTokAdvocates for testosterone replacement therapy who have thousands of followers are being paid or offered incentives by private clinics to promote discount codes and giveaways, encouraging men to get their testosterone levels checked and potentially access treatment.In one of the posts, a man does bicep curls, saying: “Get your testosterone tested … shoot me a DM for a £20 discount.” In another video, a free blood test is offered as part of a giveaway, telling men it will help them “take control” of their performance.The Guardian flagged these posts to the Advertising Standards Authority for potential breaches in regulation, due to them promoting prescription drugs, prompting an investigation by the watchdog.Jayasena said: “I have just come back from a national teaching course for next-generation endocrinology consultants, and most people raised concerns about reproduction and this issue: a flurry of men being pushed to up-tick their testosterone.”He added: “Putting the influencers aside, this is a huge problem. Hospital specialists are seeing patients coming in after having private blood tests, often arranged through influencers, perhaps, and then being told by inexperienced doctors or a wide range of healthcare professionals that they should start testosterone. The advice they are giving is wrong.”Private clinics charge about £1,800 to £2,200 for the first year of TRT. Packages include medication, monitoring and consultations.Once a niche medical treatment for a small number of men with clinically diagnosed hormone deficiency, TRT has increasingly been reframed as a lifestyle or “performance optimisation” tool. Online clinics offer at-home blood tests and subscription packages, making it easy to access outside traditional healthcare systems.View image in fullscreenPrivate clinics charge about £1,800 to £2,200 for the first year of full testosterone replacement therapy.Photograph: Ian Dewar/AlamyThe social media posts often suggest that low motivation, tiredness or ageing are signs of “low T”, driving more men to seek tests and treatment, even though medical guidelines restrict TRT to those with proven hormonal deficiency.Jayasena said: “There are specific clinical guidelines on who should and should not be started on testosterone. Certain symptoms, such as erectile dysfunction, are clearly associated with low testosterone. Other symptoms, like not having enough muscle or feeling depressed, are not associated with low testosterone. A man might say: ‘I’m not very muscly,’ and be told to get tested, but there’s no evidence he needs one.“The most worrying thing is these clinics are starting testosterone for men with normal testosterone levels. There is no evidence that testosterone levels greater than 12 nmol/L are beneficial, and I have heard of clinics starting men below 18, which includes much of the population.”He added that taking it when not needed can cause infertility. “It suppresses the testicular and hormonal signals from the brain needed for the testicles to work, so clinics give a concoction of other drugs to stop that happening, the same approach used by anabolic steroid users.”TikTok has been approached for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

If you didn’t step in and fund my legal fight I’d probably be in jail,” Robinson said. “Thank you, Elon.”In the period immediately after Musk’s messy departure from the White House, theTeslaCEO repeatedly suggested that he was done with politics. Investors who had pushed him to refocus on his businesses were delighted. Tesla’s stock rose. The months since, however, have proved that Musk has failed to abandon his political preoccupations. He has done the opposite, veering further into election conspiracies and extreme anti-immigration views.Musk’s political endeavors since leaving the Trump administration have included leveraging his social media platform as a pulpit to influence New York City’s mayoral race and creating an AI-generated, rightwing knockoff of Wikipedia. In interviews, he has said there is a “homeless industrial complex” of nonprofits ruining California and complained that “it should be okay to have white pride”. On X, he proclaimed that the UK would fall into civil war and western civilization would collapse.The same day that Robinson extended his gratitude, Musk posted claims that “illegals” were committing voting fraud in the US, retweeted complaints about video games becoming “woke” and called established media outlets leftist propaganda.The political fixations of the world’s richest man have taken a toll on his businesses. AYale studypublished last month found that his divisive rhetoric and far-right political affiliations cost Tesla about a million vehicle sales between his acquisition of Twitter in 2022 and April of this year. Consumer polling found that Tesla’s brand loyaltyplummetedover the course of 2025 as Musk’s “department of government efficiency” dismantled government agencies, which included cuts to foreign aid that experts project couldresult in around 14 milliondeaths globally.Musk’s personal approval rating has also sunk to record lows this year, according tomultiplesurveys. Heheld the lowest favorabilityout of 14 major political newsmakers, according to a Gallup poll from August, ranking five percentage points below Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facingcharges of war crimesfrom the international criminal court. A separateQuinnipiac poll in Junefound that only around 2 in 10 women in the US held a favorable view of Musk.Yet the social and financial backlash to Musk’s politics has not quelled his public embrace of the far-right, and in characteristically stubborn fashion, he has begun flaunting his affiliations more openly while suggesting that being labeled racist or extremist is now meaningless to him. Tesla’s shareholders have also continued to endorse him. On Thursday, theyvoted by a huge margin in favor of a $1tn compensation packagefor him, slated to be the biggest in corporate history.Insulated from major financial consequences and existing in an online bubble of his own making, Musk has positioned himself as a fixture of the international far-right even after his influence within the Trump administration has waned.Backing the international far-rightMusk has long maintained friendly relationships with some of the world’s most prominent far-right leaders, ringing in the year with an appearance at a campaign rally for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party. His speech, which came days after he was accused of giving fascist salutes on stage following Trump’s inauguration, drewcriticism from Jewish leadersafter he told the crowd that Germany has “too much of a focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that”.In recent months, Musk’s affiliations with pro-nativist political movements have gone beyond established parties to direct engagement with far-right activists and influencers via X. Robinson, a longtime anti-Islam campaigner who has previously been jailed for contempt of court after libeling a teenage Syrian refugee, has received special attention.“It is time for the English to ally with the hard men, like Tommy Robinson, and fight for their survival or they shall surely all perish,” Musk wrote on X in response to a video of a man being stabbed to death. He claimed the same “will happen to all of England if the tide of illegal immigration is not turned.”In September, Musk appeared via livestream at one of Robinson’s rallies in London to call for the UK government to be dissolved and claim that immigration was causing “the destruction of Britain”.“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die,” Musk told the crowd. Downing Streetlater condemnedMusk’s remarks, saying they threatened to incite violence and intimidation.Musk’s acquisition of Twitter in 2022 has overall been a boon to the UK’s far right. The company’s previous ownership had banned many of the movement’s leaders for violating policies around hateful conduct. Musk reinstated activists from Britain’smost prominent neo-Nazi groupand restored Robinson’s account, which had been removed after he posted calls to mass deport Muslim refugees.Musk has also become the most prominent backer of the fringe UK political movement Restore Britain, with the Texas-based billionaire posting positive messages about its leader Rupert Lowe. Restore Britain published a 113-page policy document earlier this year outlining a plan for the mass deportation of all undocumented immigrants, which suggested using military aircraft to put thousands of people on deportation flights to Rwanda regardless of their country of origin.Musk’s increasing meddling into UK politics has drawn criticism from the country’s Labour government, as well as anti-hate groups and other establishment politicians.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The idea that artificial intelligence would become too “politically correct” and “woke” in its outputs has haunted Musk for years, and he has frequently indulged in futuristic thought experiments to voice his fears.“If it says everyone must be diverse it means there can be no straight white men, then you and I will be executed by AI,” Musk said on Joe Rogan’s podcast last week, tweaking the famous “paper clip problem”, which theorizes that an AI would decimate humanity to make paper clips if instructed that manufacturing them was its sole purpose.Musk’s answer to his version of AI’s alignment problem has been to use his xAI artificial intelligence company, which hastaken up much of his attentionsince leaving government, to create products that more closely align with his views. In theory, he’s creating right-wing copies of popular sites and products that function the same way as their originals. In practice, they have malfunctioned. Musk’s attempt to create a more conservative-leaning AI model has led to incidents in recent months like xAI’s Grok chatbot spouting conspiracies about “white genocide” and calling itself “MechaHitler”.As well as speaking to online allies aligned with him, Musk has also used his social media platform to attack non-profits and politicians he opposes.Musk was at the center of a campaign last month against the Anti-Defamation League, the US’ most prominent Jewish advocacy organization, which faced rightwing backlash for an article that documented connections between slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s group Turning Point USA and extremists. Musk claimed that the ADL “hates Christians” and encouraged murder and shared rightwing influencers’ posts attacking the group. The campaign led tothe ADL removing its entire glossary of extremism, which it had previously touted as the most comprehensive resource on extremist organizations and movements.Musk once again used his platform in the lead up to New York City’s mayoral election, using a paid promotion feature to boost the reach of his post attacking Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani, crowbaring his tweet into more users’ feeds. On election day, he reposted a series of tweets that misinterpreted the election system and suggested a voting conspiracy was at play.As an extension of Musk’s pursuit of an alternative information ecosystem, xAI also launched a Wikipedia imitation called “Grokipedia” last month that Musk has touted as superior and free of bias. Researchershave foundthat it contained a large amount of false information on public figures and events, had copied some entries almost verbatim from Wikipedia and emphasized rightwing narratives about slavery, immigration and trans rights.An entry on Britain First, described by Wikipedia as a “neo-Fascist party,” referred to the organization as a “patriotic political party”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But when he started looking at his options the ability to lease a used electric vehicle (EV) caught his eye.A couple of years ago someone looking for their next car would have been hard pushed to find a used EV – let alone lease one – but that is changing fast.View image in fullscreenAnthony Santos with his Mercedes EQA, which he leases for £360 a month instead of the usual £570 via a salary sacrifice scheme.There are now1m EVs on British roads, and the cars bought by early adopters are hitting the secondhand market.Generally speaking EVs have lost value more quickly than petrol or diesel cars, which is a big problem for the owners of leasing companies, rental businesses or corporate fleets. But the flipside for consumers is that it is possible to find a cheap leasing deal.In the second quarter of 2025, the number of used car leases in the UK rose by 166%, compared with the same period a year ago, with electric cars driving the growth, according to the latest data available from the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), a lobby group.“Three years ago used EV leasing was very small because there were very few used EVs on the market,” says Thom Groot, the chief executive of the Electric Car Scheme, a broker. From about 15% of sales in 2024, used EVs now make up nearly half its business.At Octopus EV,which is part of the UK’s largest energy supplier, the number of used EV leases has doubled in the last year.The picture is helped by fact that big players in the leasing market, including Lloyds Banking Group’s Lex Autolease, BNP Paribas’s Arval, and the independent group Zenith, have started now offer leases on used EVs.With the average price tag of a new electric vehicle sitting at £50,000, putting them out of reach of many Britons, in the summer the government launched asubsidy scheme. But buying secondhand makes going electric even more affordable.Santos discovered that he could lease a lightly used Mercedes-Benz EQA without paying anything upfront. His company offered a salary sacrifice option (more on that later) via the Electric Car Scheme, which meant he could pay £360 a month for a car that would usually cost £570.“There was no deposit – the tax benefits really made sense,” Santos says. “That’s what made me move forward with it.”How leasing worksPeople who lease their cars pay a monthly fee, typically for two or three years, avoiding the need to stump up tens of thousands of pounds upfront. As well as the car, costs such as road tax, breakdown assistance, service and maintenance are often included – but typically not things such as insurance.Leasing a used EV is a lot cheaper than buying a new one, even for vehicles in good condition that are only two or three years old. That means more expensive models can be more affordable, making it easier for people on lower incomesto cut their carbon emissions.View image in fullscreenOn a standard lease a new Škoda Enyaq costs about £567 a month, but that falls to £292 for a used model on salary sacrifice.Photograph: Arnd Wiegmann/ReutersThe Electric Car Scheme gives the example of the Škoda Enyaq, an SUV. On a standard lease a new model costs about £567 a month, but that falls to £292 for a used model on salary sacrifice. Volkswagen’s ID.4 SUV similarly falls from £506 to £296 a month, a decrease of 42%.However, not every cost will be picked up by the owner. Lessees will still have to pay damage outside fair wear and tear, and some also add an excess mileage charge. While 10p a mile may not sound like much, high-mileage drivers will have to consider whether they will face a big extra bill when they hand the car back.Salary sacrificeThe best deals will almost certainly be limited to those whoseemployers have signed up for a salary sacrifice scheme. The key thing about salary sacrifice is that the cost is deducted from your pay before tax – lowering your tax bill. How much you save depends on your tax bracket: so lower-rate taxpayers save 20%, higher-rate taxpayers (salaries of £50,271 to £125,140) save 40%, and 45% above that.Ian Hughes, the chief executive of the corporate and consumer business of Zenith Group, says salary sacrifice has been “a major foundation stone of the transition” to electric cars due to the tax advantages.Many employers offer salary sacrifice – ranging from very small companies to household names such as HSBC, BT and Jet2, as well as a number of NHS trusts. There are usually no fees for the employee, but employers pay the scheme provider the equivalent of the tax saved from lower national insurance contributions.Often the companies offering salary sacrifice impose conditions, such as a minimum contract length, or a gross basic salary above a certain threshold. People leasing will also have to go through a mandatory credit check, as well as affordability checks to make sure they can handle the monthly payments.View image in fullscreenAn electric 2022 Mini Cooper S with 17,400 miles on the clock would cost £256 a month via salary sacrifice.Photograph: Malcolm Haines/AlamyThere are still options for someone whose employer does not offer a salary sacrifice scheme. Carwow’s “Leasey” leasing service, for example, offers used EVs. An electric 2022 Mini Cooper S with 17,400 miles on the clock would cost £256 a month. That is still significantly more than the £209 offer for those able to use an employer’s scheme, but well below the £310 a month (on top of a £3,000 upfront payment) for the equivalent new model bought from Mini directly.Gary Comerford, a consultant who runs theEV Musings podcastfor electric car drivers, says his experience of leasing a used EV is “very smooth” but adds that he would not say it is flawless. He could not do a test drive before committing via Car360, although he had the option to return with no questions asked within the week. He paid a deposit of £1,200 and pays £310 a month for a 2021 Polestar 2.“As long as you can work within your budget it’s quite easy to get a lease,” Comerford says – although he adds that limiting tax benefits to salary sacrifice is unfair to self-employed people like him.View image in fullscreenAfter paying a £1,200 deposit, a 2021 Polestar 2 costs £310 a month.Photograph: ZarkePix/AlamySome optional extras can be included with the car (and can benefit from salary sacrifice tax savings), such as car insurance, home chargers, and even electricity.At the end of the term the choice is generally to either extend your lease or hand the car back, although some companies also offer the ability to buy the car outright. Note though: early returners will probably end up paying an early termination fee (although fees for salary sacrificers are usually waived if they leave they employer through resignation, redundancy or dismissal).If it works for you, and you meet the conditions, used leases make it much easier to drive an EV, says Zenith’s Hughes. “The very, very exciting opportunity is it lowers the price of entry from an affordability perspective,” he says. Zenith’s newly launched used EV salary sacrifice scheme has had “a nice balance of 20% and 40% taxpayers”, he says.Beating depreciationLeasing companies are not offering deals out of the goodness of their hearts. Offering used EVs helps them cope with their least favourite word: depreciation. They bought a load of electric cars a couple of years ago, only for secondhand, or “residual” prices, to drop more than expectedamid slower overall demand for EVs.Leasing companies have a large supply of rapidly depreciating vehicles, says Toby Poston, the BVRLA chief executive. They do not want to sell at a steep loss, so leasing helps solve a problem.View image in fullscreenA 2020 MG ZS. The number of EVs leased in the UK in the second quarter of 2025 is up by 166% on the same period last year, taking the total to 40,600.Photograph: ZarkePix/AlamyHolding on to electric cars means leasing companies can continue to make money from them. The industry’s experience with thousands of electric cars is that there are far fewer breakdowns, compared with equivalent petrol or diesel cars, meaning they are less likely to face huge repair bills as the vehicles age.Hughes expects Zenith’s cars to go through two or even three drivers over eight years before they sell it on – potentially meaning no residual loss whatsoever. (Contrary to one persistent anti-EV claim, meaningful battery degradation is “just not a thing” for the average car, he says. And most EVs come with eight-year manufacturer warranties on batteries, which means leased cars would be covered.)Without costly breakdowns to worry about there is “less potential risk” so it easier to offer leases, Poston says. At the same time, there is “overproduction of cars across the world”, he adds. “The deals you can get now are stupendous.”Explore more on these topicsMotoringElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not literally of course, but try telling that to someone who has nailed Free Bird’s four-minute guitar solo in front of a packed living-room audience.Developed by Harmonix, published by RedOctane and inspired by Konami’s GuitarFreaks, Guitar Hero gave players a guitar-shaped controller with which to match coloured notes scrolling down the screen in time with a song. Each riff or sequence corresponded to specific notes, creating the feel of a genuine performance.Harmonix had already tried its hand at rhythm games with the PlayStation 2 titles Frequency and Amplitude when it partnered with RedOctane, which was purchased by Activision in 2006. Together they laid the foundations for an unlikely billion-dollar franchise that had a remarkable impact for many of the artists featured, introducing decades-old bands such as Cheap Trick, Kansas and Lynyrd Skynyrd to millions of younger players.View image in fullscreenStrum-thing new … a line of people playing plastic guitars.Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty ImagesMichael Dornbrook, former COO of Harmonix, recalls the initial financial challenges of licensing the recordings – even though the first two games mostly used cover versions – but also how their bargaining power shifted once the game was a hit.“We rerecorded all the music because the dollar figure was so high,” he says. “Even with the publishing rights alone, it was nearly impossible. We couldn’t get bands like the Who – RedOctane had virtually no money, and we were pretty convinced it would fail. But once Guitar Hero took off, and record sales and radio play were going up, everyone wanted to be in.”He adds: “One of the amazing things was how many parents got in touch and thanked us for introducing their kids to the music they loved. It became a multigenerational thing.”Northern Irish blues-rock band the Answer had Never Too Late included on the 2008 game Guitar Hero World Tour. Guitarist Paul Mahon remembers how the series brought classic rock back into vogue: “Guitar Hero offered a bigger, younger audience. Generally this had been seen as music that was past it, but then when it was featured on the game and teenagers were finding it, suddenly it was cool. That legitimised it, and got rid of the ‘dad rock’ tag. It gave all our music a new life.”In 2008, the Answer’s debut album was still unreleased in the US, meaning the game was a key medium of discovery for the band as they went on a North American tour supporting AC/DC. “Their crew were playing Never Too Late on the tour bus, and some of them knew us from Guitar Hero,” Mahon says.View image in fullscreenSpin-off games such as Guitar Hero: Aerosmith were themed around the band.Photograph: ArcadeImages/AlamyRock’s heavyweight names soon capitalised on the series’ popularity, with Aerosmith, Metallica and Van Halen featuring in dedicated spin-off titles that focused on each band’s catalogue and associated lore, imagery and rock’n’roll mythology. In the case of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, it was said to have made the band more money than any of their studio albums did. It sold well over half a million copies in its first week, while sales of Aerosmith’s music saw an increase of up to 40% at a time when the music business’s established orderwas already collapsingin a changing landscape.The series continues to inspire nimble-fingered fanaticism among its fans. Earlier this year, streamerCarnyJared completed an impressive attemptof DragonForce’s Through the Fire and Flames – a notoriously difficult power-metal song made popular by Guitar Hero – on Clone Hero, a freeware game with almost identical gameplay but an array of customisation options. This track is challenging enough on expert mode, let alone played at double speed and without missing a single one of its near 4,000 notes. CarnyJared claimed it took nine months of practice.View image in fullscreenNotoriously difficulty … DragonForce guitarist Herman Li.Photograph: Gary Miller/FilmMagicA mindboggling feat, but at what point does one pick up an actual guitar? “It doesn’t really matter, because you can’t play [that song] in nine months! There’s zero chance,” says DragonForce guitarist Herman Li, who considers the game world and the real world to be very separate. “Guitar Hero is a fun, fantasy thing. If you play Call of Duty, that doesn’t mean you should pick up a real gun and go to war.”DragonForce had already wrapped up a successful tour when Through the Fire and Flames was featured on Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, but Li says it made them a household name. “I remember the record label calling to tell me that we were selling albums like crazy,” he says. “It exploded when we next toured, and we were playing just before the headliners Slipknot and Disturbed on the Mayhem festival.”In fact, DragonForce’s exposure from Guitar Hero was so immense that it has threatened to overshadow everything else the band has done. Last year, the song was used in a trailer for Despicable Me 4. “In the past I thought differently, but I’ve made peace with it,” Li says. “If you only listen to one DragonForce song, it’s totally cool – everyone’s got their own musical journey and I’m glad we’ve been part of people’s lives”.The best marketing, whether it’s for cars, clothes or video games, goes further than selling something – it evokes a desire. Did Guitar Hero tap into that? “That’s exactly what we were trying to create,” Dornbrook says. “That thrill of being a rock star on the stage. From day one, Alex [Rigopulos] and Eran [Egozy], who co-founded Harmonix, felt that there’s an instinctive human desire to make music, and they wanted to use technology to allow people to do it”.The majority of Guitar Hero games were released in just a five-year period between 2005 and 2010, including spin-offs DJ Hero, complete with a turntable controller, and Band Hero, the two games releasing a week apart in 2009: Dornbrook says “Activision is famous for burning out franchises, they tend to overdo it”. After that, the publisher’s interest in plastic instruments died down, aside from a short-lived revival in 2015 with Guitar Hero Live.Games such as Clone Hero and Fortnite Festival have kept the scene alive, and there’s set to be something from the original publisher on the way: RedOctaneGames,, a new studio which has “entered production on its debut rhythm-based title”. Original co-founders Kai and Charles Huang are both involved as special advisers. Is the world ready to embrace another game in the spirit of Guitar Hero?“We thought those games could be like Madden where you can update every year,” Dornbrook says. “There’s so much new music that it could be evergreen, so I’ve always been optimistic. There’s no reason why it can’t continue with new generations.”Explore more on these topicsGamesActivision BlizzardAerosmithfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But a New York Times podcast is fretting about excessive wokenessSat 8 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Nov 2025 09.01 ESTShareLean in (to misogyny), ladies!Are you a woman? Do you want to rapidly raise your profile and get booked on the speaking circuit? Are you good at mental gymnastics?If you answered yes to all of the above then gender grifting may be for you! This often-lucrative career path involves explaining to less enlightened women why feminism has gone too far and the world is much better off being run by men. You get extra points if you aren’t white, and canexplain to the masseshow racism is good, actually.You can see this hustle in thetradwifecontent all over social media. As Jameela Jamilrecently noted, all the “tradwives” preaching to young women about how they should be submissive little ladies are massive hypocrites. They’re all making money, building their brands and securing their independence while telling other women they shouldn’t be doing the same.You can also, of course, see gender grifting on the likes of Fox News, where ambitious, albeitidentikit, female anchorstut-tut on TVabout how #MeToo has gone too far.And now, because the right has been so successful in rewriting reality, you can see gender grifting splashed all over the homepage of the New York Times. On Thursday, the Timespublished a transcriptof a recent episode of the conservative columnist Ross Douthat’s podcast Interesting Times. This veryinteresting(in theBritishsense) piece wasoriginallytitled: Did Women Ruin the Workplace? The headline was then changed to the more nuanced: Did Liberal Feminism Ruin the Workplace?Douthat generously invites two women into his own workplace: the podcast features two critics of liberal feminism, Helen Andrews andLeah Libresco Sargeant, in conversation about “what a right-wing politics of gender should look like.” Andrews apparently caught Douthat’s eye because she had just written an essay for Compactcalled The Great Feminization, which argues feminism has failed because it has driven masculine virtues out of our institutions. The word “woke” or “wokeness” was used unironically 11 times in the piece: a failsafe sign you should not takeanything in it seriously.Andrews continued to just mutter wokeness, wokeness, wokeness in her conversation with Douthat (variants of the word were used 25 times in the conversation), explaining that “the pathology in our institutions known as wokeness is distinctively feminine and feminized … in a very literal sense, our institutions have gone woke because there are more women in them than there used to be.”The conversation unfurls exactly as you’d expect. Carefully cherrypicking examples, Andrews explained that #MeToo was woke, college campuses are too woke, and “the law is currently lopsided in favor of punishing male vices and allowing feminized vices totally free rein.” In response to a question about what constitutes “feminine vices”, Andrews explains that women like “gossiping” and have an “inability to deal with conflict directly”.Sargeant, who has some valid critiques of liberal feminism, does her best to push back against some of this nonsense, but Andrews does most of the talking. Hilariously, towards the end of the conversation Douthat asks Andrews: “What do you like about women, Helen?” She seems unable to answer that question.I know that this is just one man’s podcast rather than, say, a piece by the editorial board, but putting a piece like this on the homepage of the New York Times in 2025 is certainly aninterestingdecision. Taking the sort of misogynistic nonsense that you see on Fox News and repackaging it as a pseudointellectual debate in a prestigious publication imbues these arguments with a dangerous validity. (If you want a proper intellectual interrogation of gendered inequality and supposedly traditional values, by the way, I suggest you readAngela Saini’s The Patriarchs.)While the New York Times is busy pondering whether liberal feminism has ruined the workplace, women’s rightsare being rolled backaround the world. In the very same week that this piece came out, Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaumwas gropedby a drunk man as she mingled with citizens on the streets of Mexico City. The leader of a country can’t do her own job without being harassed in public, and the Times wants us to consider whether the workplace has beentoo feminized.Over in the US, the gender pay gap haswidenedfor the second year in a row, and the Times wants us to consider the possibility that wokeness has gone too far. Mike Johnson, the House speaker,recently shrugged offdomestic assault allegations leveled against Republican congressman Cory Mills, and we are expected to ponder, with a straight face, the idea that the workplace is now hostile to men. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, has beenaccused of sexual assault. (Mills and Hegseth have denied the allegations.) Two out of the five men on the US supreme court have been accused ofsexual misconduct. The president of the US is an adjudicatedsexual predator, whoassociated with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile, and we are supposed to think that our institutions have been feminized. Interesting times indeed.Mexican president pressing charges after being groped“This is something I experienced as a woman, but it is something that all women in our country experience,” Sheinbaum said after beinggroped in the street. “If I do not file a complaint, where does that leave all Mexican women? If they do this to the president, what happens to all the other women in the country?”The incidenthas felt like a personal affrontto many women in Mexico, where violence against women and femicide are major problems. But you have to ask yourself, don’t you:has feminism gone too far?Nearly half of LGBTQ+ TV characters cancelledGLAAD’s2025 reporton queer representation on TV shows a small increase from last year’s 468 to 489 LGBTQ+ characters across all platforms.

Now he should take on FifaJules BoykoffNew York’s mayor-elect has taken on powerful institutions. With the World Cup taking place in his city, he should challenge Fifa nextSat 8 Nov 2025 08.14 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Nov 2025 08.39 ESTShareAfterwinning the electionfor mayor of New York City, an exuberant Zohran Mamdani took to the stage at his victory speech andsaid, “If there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.” He was alluding to Donald Trump, but the sentiment also applies to Fifa, the world’s governing body for soccer.In September, Mamdani’s team kicked off a “Game Over Greed”campaigntargeting Fifa’s use of dynamic pricing for 2026 men’s World Cup tickets,callingit an “affront to the game.” His petition demanded that Fifa cease its rapacious dynamic pricing scheme, place a price cap on tickets that are resold on Fifa’s ticketing platform, and reserve a tranche of tickets for local residents. Mamdani, a longtime Arsenal fan, told theGuardian’s Football Weeklypodcast, “I have long been quite troubled by how the supposed stewards of the game have opted for profit time and time again at the expense of the people that love this game.”Trump ally Infantino to award first Fifa peace prize at World Cup draw in DCRead moreNow that he’s been elected mayor, Mamdani has the power and the platform to push further against the hideous “stewards” of the beautiful game. It’s time to target Fifa’s jaw-dropping tax exemptions and the ridiculous contractual demands that soccer’s world governing body places on World Cup host cities. Fifa honchos ooze privilege, making them the perfect political target at a time whenpublic supportfor taxing the rich is widespread. As a genuine fan of the sport and a generational political talent, Mamdani might be able to achieve the unthinkable: force the Fifa behemoth to share its lucre.At times, it seems like Fifa is just a money factory with a bit of football stashed in its annex. Spurred by the 2026 World Cup, Fifaset the goalof securing a whopping $11 billion in revenues through the four-year cycle, up from the$7.5 billionit hoovered up from Qatar 2022. The 2026 World Cup, expanded to include 48 teams, is on pace to become the most lucrative event in the history of sports.Behind the scenes, tax exemptions have become a key element of the Fifa greed machine. After studying the lopsided contracts between Fifa and the South African government for the 2010 men’s World Cup, lawyer Sophie Nakueiradescribedthe world’s governing body as a “floating sovereign.” In other words, Fifa is a parastate that acts like a parasite, treating World Cup hosts like its own private Vegas buffet.In itsBid Evaluation Reportfor the two candidature files for the 2026 World Cup, Fifa makes a special point to rate each country’s willingness to offer massive tax exemptions for both media and marketing. Assessing Morocco’s unsuccessful bid and the “United” bid of Canada, Mexico, and the US, Fifa rated highest Morocco and Mexico (in the pre-Claudia Scheinbaum era) for their willingness to offer a “full tax exemption.” The US assured Fifa of a “full tax exemption” for media and a “close-to-full tax exemption” for marketing revenues, and President Trump supplied a letter of support in 2018 to settle any jitters that Fifa might have been feeling. Meanwhile, Canada played hardball with taxpayer funds and earned a—womp-womp—“limited tax exemption” rating in both areas. Although the tournament ends in mid-July 2026, Fifa somehowrequiresits tax exemptions to last through 31 December 2028.View image in fullscreenZohran Mamdani’s team launched a ‘Game Over Greed’ campaign targeting Fifa’s use of dynamic pricing for 2026 World Cup tickets.Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesNick McGeehan, the director of the human-rights groupFairSquare, told the Guardian,“Tax exemptions allow Fifa to suck vast amounts of money out of its hosts. The majority of the cost of preparing the tournament falls on the hosts, while Fifa pockets all the revenue that is generated from the sale of broadcasting and marketing rights.” McGeehan added, “Fifa demands tax exemptions on all of this money and for the revenue generated by many of its partners too.” This includes some of the wealthiest media and marketing firms in the world.Acquiring specific information about Fifa’s tax breaks is a gumshoe affair involving obscure government and Fifa documents. The task is complicated by the fact that Fifa pennedindividual contractswith all eleven US host cities—unlike the last time the country hosted a men’s World Cup in 1994, when a centralized organizing committee oversaw the contract—thereby splintering liability and gifting Fifa with a chance to put the squeeze on a city-by-city basis. Solidarity be damned. Ironclad secrecy rules.Mamdani should push for full transparency: all Fifa contracts ought to be released to the public, starting withNew York New Jersey. The New York Timesreviewedthe New York New Jersey contract, concluding that it gives enormous power to Fifa and very little power to local hosts, but every single Fifa contract should be available on the City website for all to read. To date, only a few cities have made public their contracts with Fifa, such asSeattle,Vancouver,Toronto, andSanta Clara, some with significant redactions. If host cities are contractually expected to host matches at astronomical prices—including fan festivals, which can cost$1 million per dayper city—everyday people should be able to know the details. Feeling the fiscal pinch, cities like Bellingham, Washington are dramaticallyscaling backplans for public fan zones, depriving soccer enthusiasts one of the only affordable ways to partake. Challenging Fifa privilege chimes with Mamdani’s election-winning demand that working people are confronting a crisis of affordability and the 1 percent is not doing its fair share.Host-city agreements withFifaaren’t engraved in stone tablets delivered from Mt. Sinai; they can be amended, as long as changes are in writing and agreed to by the host city authority, Fifa, and the US Soccer Federation.For its part, Fifa says the money it gains from events like theWorld Cuphelps the sports itself. “The revenue [Fifa] generates is reinvested to fuel the growth of the game - men, women, youth - throughout Fifa’s 211 member associations globally,” the organization told the Guardian in September.Mamdani might look backward to move forward. Back in 2012, a successful activist campaign shamed London 2012 Summer Olympics corporate sponsors intoforgoingtheir tax exemptions. Mamdani’s democratic-socialist supporters could lead a grassroots campaign to reclaim public money from avaricious corporations.View image in fullscreenThe MetLife Stadium in New Jersey will host the World Cup final next July.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersWhen it comes to the World Cup, host cities are taking the fiscal risks, while Fifa scoops up the rewards. In numerous World Cup host cities, residents are bracing for extra costs related to security and logistics. Although theBig Beautiful Bill Act, passed last summer, allocated $625 million for “security and other costs related to the Fifa World Cup,” local leaders are concerned that costs in the neighborhood of “$150 million per city” could fall on the shoulders of local taxpayers. In Massachusetts, Democratic Governor Maura Healey recentlyproposedcreating a $20 million Fifa World Cup reserve fund.Meanwhile, in Canada, the World Cup is skewing public priorities. Amid layoffs in Vancouver’s city government, World Cup planning remains unaffected. “It’s a contractual obligation” with Fifa,explaineda deputy city manager. “We have no wiggle room in terms of delivering what we need to deliver.” It’s no wonder that soccer-mad cities likeMinneapolisandChicagosaid thanks but no thanks to hosting matches due to Fifa’s unwillingness to negotiate in good faith and stiffinsistenceon tax breaks and loading liability on the hosts’ backs.Canadian journalist Bob Mackin – who deserves enormous credit for wrenching documents from the clenched fists of World Cup organizers in Vancouver – told me, “Vancouver’s involvement in Fifa 26 lacks any credible, publicly available business case, only rosy government news releases with a variety of cost ranges, revenue estimates and aspirations of a future tourism legacy.” He added, “There is no effort to mitigate the harms to the people struggling in the community.”Mamdani has a golden opportunity to expose the outrageous burdens that Fifa places on World Cup host cities and to demand that World Cup boosters “mitigate the harms” they inflict on working people. After all, vast sums of money swirl around the World Cup. The leader of Vancouver’s local organizing committee, Jessie Adler,hauled ina whopping $470,000 in 2024, dwarfing the British Columbia Premier David Eby’s salary of around $227,000. Mamdani could use Fifa’s brand of trickle-up economics to his political advantage.Much is possible, and the timing is propitious, with Mamdani riding high and the general public feeling low about corporate poweramassing moreand more while everyday people suffer. For too long, Fifa has been “fully focused on monetizing the sport, no matter the collateral damage,” as Leander Schaerlaeckensput itin these pages.With the 2026 World Cup coming into ever-sharper focus, now is the time to push back. Mamdani, a real-deal soccer aficionado and magnetic political force is the right guy to lead the charge.Explore more on these topicsFifaWorld Cup 2026Football politicsWorld CupZohran MamdanicommentShareReuse this content"

That is how long it would take to mourn everylife lostin Gaza. By then, your grandchildren’s great10grandchildren would be dust, and still you would be burying Palestinian bodies from a “war” Israel insists was about self-defense. Even then, this number does not tell you about the thousands of ways these bodies wereburned,torn, crushed and made anything but whole.And yet here we are, watching world leaders gather in Egypt for a “peace summit” last month where the only people absent were Palestinians. The banner read “Peace 2025”, while Palestine’s representatives were barred from the room.Like clockwork, this “peace” has already eroded with Israel violating the ceasefire through continued bombardments. Why does the world act surprised when a country that commits genocide violates the “ceasefire” it orchestrated? Israelliedabout 40 beheaded babies to justify a genocide. And now we’re supposed to believe their commitment to peace?In the first month, Israel has broken its own agreement at least 100times: at least 200 murdered, the yellow line breached, food and fuel blocked, reconstruction prevented. In fact, Israel continues to destroy civilians homes in Gaza. Muhammad al-Hallaq, 10, wasexecutedby Israeli forces in occupied Al-Khalil (Hebron) on 17 October 2025. On 19 October, Israel launched20airstrikes in Gaza. They call this “maintaining the ceasefire”.This is the pattern: Israel turns the volume of violence up and down at will, maintaining full dominion over Gaza and the West Bank, then calls each pause a generous “ceasefire”. They violate it immediately, kill Palestinians who dare exist in their own land, then wait for any response, any stone thrown, any rocket fired in defense, to justify their pre-planned retaliation. They did the same thing after theyviolatedthe ceasefire in March 2025 during Ramadan. The genocide never ends; it only modulates between active slaughter and slow strangulation. The fact that Israel’soccupationand colonial expansion hascontinuedunpunished by international authorities since 1967 is proof enough that they will never be held to the fire they started.In 1949, immediately after the UN-brokeredarmistice, Israeli forces began violating demilitarized zones and launching attacks that killed civilians. In 1967, Israellauncheda surprise attack on Egypt and Syria despite knowing Egypt posed no serious threat. Between 1981 and 1982, defense minister Ariel Sharonrepeatedlyviolated a UN ceasefire with the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon with the Sabra and Shatila massacres, trying to provoke a response that would justify his long-planned invasion.In 2001, as Israeli and Palestinian security officials met to shore up a six-week ceasefire, Israelassassinateda senior Hamas member; nine days later came a retaliatory suicide bombing in Jerusalem. In 2008, Israelviolateda months-long truce with Hamas by launching an operation that killed six Hamas members, then used the predictable rocket response to justify Operation Cast Lead, which killed over 1,400 Palestinians, most of them civilians. The method never changes: violate the ceasefire, wait for retaliation, claim victimhood, launch the offensive you’d already planned.Just look at the West Bank, where Palestinians laid down their weapons after the sham that is theOslo Accords. What did demilitarization bring them? More settlements, more checkpoints, more children shot by snipers, more olive groves burned, more homes demolished. Even complete submission doesn’t stop hunger.In fact,nearly half of all Palestinian children killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the occupied West Bank since records began in 2005 werekilled in just the past two years, 224 children since January 2023 out of 468 total. In 2024, Israelstole24,258 dunams of Palestinian land, approximately half of all land declared as “state land” since Oslo was signed over 30 years ago. At least 59 new illegal outposts wereestablishedin 2024, with 215 Palestinian homes demolished in East Jerusalem. This year, Israel approved itslargest settlement expansionsince Oslo, 22 new illegal settlements, some deep within Palestine. The UNsecurity council, in Resolution 2334,saidIsrael’s settlements have “no legal validity and constitutes a fragrant violation under international law”.This is why Israel destroys not just people, but the means of survival itself: the watertreatmentplants, the agriculturalfields, every hospital, every university. Even after the ceasefire, IsraelcontrolsGaza’s agricultural land.Since 1967, more than 800,000 Palestinian olive trees have beenillegallyuprooted. Not because Hamas hides there, but because Palestinian existence itself is the threat. They learned from American history: between 30 million and 60 million buffalo roamed North America until the US military deliberately supported theirslaughterto control Native Americans, reducing the population to fewer than 1,000 by the late 1880s.Within one generation after the buffalo slaughter, the average height of Indigenous peoples dropped by more than an inch, child mortalityincreasedby 16 percentage points, and income remained 25% lower through today. You don’t need to kill every Indigenous person if you destroy their capacity to sustain life. The reservation system taught them that the defeated can be left alive as long as they’re left dependent.Israel won’t be satisfied until Gaza is theirs and the West Bank is gone. Finance minister Bezalel Smotrichsaid: “Palestinians will leave in great numbers to third countries.” Heritage minister Amichai Eliyahudeclared: “All of Gaza will be Jewish.” They broadcast their intentions while the world pretends surprise at each new violation, each broken agreement, each dead child they claim was a mistake.Thus, the “peace process” has become a piece process, Palestinians robbed of their land piece by piece, until nothing remains but the reservations they’re allocated. Just look to Sinjil in the West Bank, nowfencedin; or,JeninandNablushaving been besieged in the last two years.But how can we even speak of “peace” when we carry Gaza in our bones? Peace cannot exist for any Palestinian, or anyone with eyes still capable of witnessing, who has seen Israel’s depravity. I still hear the Palestinian child wiping his mother’s blood from the floor; I hear the father’s wail as he placed the pieces of his child into a plastic bag; I feel the ways Palestine has been carved, dehumanized, and brutalized to carry out an extermination campaign by those who call themselves “chosen”.These images don’t fade with “ceasefires”.Palestinian self-determination cannot end with Palestinians relegated to the same systems of oppression that destroyed Indigenous peoples across the world. It cannot end withapartheidand rebranded as compromise. True peace requires what terrifies Israel most: equal rights forallfrom the river to the sea. As America might say, from sea to shining sea.They want us to celebrate when the bombing pauses, to be grateful for the moments between murders, to thank them for allowing a trickle of food into the concentration camp they’ve built. But we know what “peace” built on graves looks like. A genocide can’t bring peace because the logic that justifies mass murder doesn’t stop at borders drawn by killers. But every Palestinian child born is proof that genocide fails, “existence is resistance” as the phrase goes, and we’ve never stopped existing.Ahmad Ibsais is a first generation Palestinian American, law student and poet who writes the newsletter State of SiegeExplore more on these topicsPalestineOpinionDonald TrumpGazaWest BankIsraelMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

That is, a resurgence of cultural conservatism and a backlash to the shifting cultural attitudes on race, LGBTQ+ rights, immigration and the “wokeness” of the Obama and first Trump eras. The conservatives were in control not only of the White House, but, more importantly to them, the culture. Corporations, media outlets, and even Democratic politicians who had sought to portray a tolerant, inclusive image rushed to match this new vibe.Of course, the evidence for this shift was scant. Trump had won the election without a popular vote majority, and acloser lookat the results showed a more conventional explanation: voters, rather than yearning for the days before there were interracial couples in television commercials or demanding a military crackdown on their cities, thought that they were working too hard for too little and maybe Trump would change it. They wanted lower prices, higher wages and a feeling of security. A year into Republican government and its top-down imposition of a new vibe, perhaps the reaction shows there finally is a vibe shift. Just not the one they planned on.The first electoral message of the second Trump era was an extremely strong one.Democratsbeat Republicans up and down the ballot by shocking margins. In blue cities, progressives and democratic socialists beat moderates. Turnout was unprecedented for an off-year election. Democrats won the races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia by significantly more than both the 2024 results and the polls projected. Democrats won 64 out of 100 seats in the Virginia house of delegates. They also won over 60% of the vote in statewide races in Georgia and Pennsylvania, states that went for Trump in 2024.Democrats broke a Republican supermajority in Mississippi. Colorado voted by massive margins to increase taxes for free school meals. Maine voted for new gun control measures and against restrictions on absentee voting and new voter ID requirements by over 25%. Even scandal-tarred Democrats like Virginia attorney general candidate Jay Jones, who joked about murdering Republicans, won easily, by more than Harris carried the state a year ago.In California, voters passed a proposal essentially nuking most of the state’s Republican house delegation. Counties that voted for Trump last year voted by double digits to eliminate their own Republican representatives in response to Trump’s demands that Republican states eliminate their own Democratic seats. And in New York City, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani followed up his shockingprimary winby winning a majority of voters in the general election, winning over a million votes, nearly as many as voted at all in the last mayoral election.Will this send a message to the White House and the right? Will it send a message to the Democratic establishment? While the Trump administration is clearly taken aback by the scale of the rejection, it is unlikely they will change their behavior. Indeed, they may even increase their aggression toward most of the country. For the Trump administration, backlash was anticipated. They knew everything they did would be unpopular, and they made the calculation that what they could do in two years with control is more valuable than whatever they lose.Their assault on the government and constitution cannot easily be rolled back. The entire political project is based on winning with minority support and using that power to further entrench minority rule. All of their actions have been aimed toward cementing minoritarian rule, and if anything, the scale of electoral backlash will cause them to accelerate their project. There’s a reason it’s called Project 2025, not Project 2027.What they’ve brought to the country is chaos and authoritarianism. Masked secret police kidnapping people in broad daylight, sending them to prison camps for life without charges or trial. Armed troops occupying major cities. Massive cuts to science and academia, even cancer research. Open graft and corruption. Gleeful cruelty, videos of immigrants and protesters being brutalized shared with pride. Under Republicans, even the air and the water are less clean. It’s no wonder people are upset, from base Democratic voters to working-class Latino voters who pulled the lever for a Republican for the first time in 2024.How do people resist a regime that is overtly anti-democratic as a principle? And why didn’t polls catch the scale of the Democratic wins? The answers to these questions are connected and can be seen in the historic Mamdani campaign. The Democrats won, in large part, from voters who do not like the Democratic party. The party’s favorable ratings are athistoric lows. Huge majorities disapprove of the party’s leadership, and in particular,their lack of resistanceto Trump.This is a wholesale change from 2017, when angry and upset Democrats rallied behind their party and its leaders. The second wave of resistance is far more anti-establishment, strident and left-wing. Rank-and-file Democratic voters now have far more positive views ofdemocratic socialismthan party leadership. These feelings opened the door for the Mamdani campaign, but the campaign showed how to harness them and provide real resistance.Trumpism is built on the disintegration of working-class institutions and civil society. Only a society with fraying bonds can produce a movement built on fear and resentment like this. The key to stopping it is rebuilding these institutions and this community. While many have known this for years, actually showing a path was easier said than done. Many campaigns have sought to bring the disaffected back into the political process in huge numbers. Mamdani’s was the first to succeed.In both the primary and the general, Mamdani reshaped the electorate, bringing hundreds of thousands of non-voters out to the polls, from young people to left-behind immigrant communities. For the first time, the electorate who came out to vote actually reflected the city’s demographics, rather than being predominantly older homeowners. Mamdani also built a coalition based on class,winning the cityacross races, powered by the lower-income renters and public transit users who make the city run, while losing among wealthy liberals and conservatives alike.But the most important number from Mamdani’s campaign is 100,000. That’s the number of people who actively volunteered for the campaign, knocking on doors, talking to their neighbors and co-workers. That’s one in every 10 people who even voted for Mamdani. They recognized politics as a living, breathing act of being in community, beyond just showing up to tick a box every few years. This has been foreign in this country for decades, but the Mamdani campaign and the Democratic Socialists of America are trying, and succeeding, in rebuilding this community and solidarity – in rebuilding working class political agency. To defeat Trump and the far right, this is what is necessary, across the country and on a massive scale. That’s the vibe shift we are just starting.Ben Davis works in political data in Washington DC.

But he’s a billionaire, so we can’tGeorge MonbiotMoney talks – and his essay denouncing ‘near-term emissions goals’ at Cop30 mostly argues the case for letting the ultra-rich off the hookSat 8 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Nov 2025 07.43 ESTShareLet’s begin with the fundamental problem: Bill Gates is a politics denier. Though he came to it late, he nowaccepts the realities of climate science. But he lives in flat,embarrassing denial about political realities. Hislatest essayon climate, published last week, treats the issue as if it existed in a political vacuum. He writes as if there were no such thing as political power, and no such thing as billionaires.His main contention is that funds are very limited, so the delegates at this month’sclimate summitin Brazil should direct money away from “near-term emissions goals” towards climate “adaptation” and spending on poverty and disease.Yes, the funds available for any good cause are scarce, but that’s not because of some natural law, some implacable truth about human society. It’s because oligarchic power has waged war on benign state spending, leading to thedestruction of USAIDand drastic cuts to the aid budgets of other countries,including the UK. Austerity isa political choice. The decision to impose it is driven by governments bowing to the wishes of the ultra-rich.There are truckloads of money available. Just after Gates published his new missive, Oxfam revealed that the net worth of the 10 richest US billionairesgrew by $698bnin the past year. That money alone, the increment in the wealth of 10 people, is almost 10 times theannual amount required to end extreme povertyworldwide. How have they managed to channel so much of the world’s money into their pockets? And why can’t we get it back through effective taxation? The answer is their translation of economic power into political power. The richer they become, the more they can bend the state and economic system to their will, ensuring that they become richer still. But Bill Gates says nothing in his essay about how and where extra money for both climate action and poverty relief could be found.View image in fullscreen‘His essay reads like nothing so much as a peace offering to Donald Trump.’ Bill Gates, right, with the Trumps at a private dinner for business leaders in Washington DC on 4 September 2025.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersThere’s a direct link between the poverty Gates claims to care so much about and the wealth he fails to mention. In the US,homelessness is breaking records, and so is theshare of assets owned by the top 0.1%. While this might not be Gates’s own business model, by holding down wages, racking up rents, busting trade unions and winning tax and spending cuts, the ultra-rich thrive on impoverishing other people.Aremarkable studyinPerspectives on Politics, among the very few to have penetrated this secretive world, found that the ultra-rich have radically different political views from the great majority. The multimillionaires it interviewed, in stark contrast to mere earthlings, saw budget deficits as the most important of the issues it listed, and climate breakdown as the least. They were far more likely to insist that social security and federal healthcare should be cut, and far less likely to believe that the unemployed should have a “decent standard of living”, or that there should be more regulation of oil companies, banks and health insurers. They were fiercely opposed to redistribution.So whose views prevail? The tiny minority or the great majority? Though the study was conducted in the Obama years, it found that the very rich had far more access to politicians and officials than average citizens. And now?I scarcely think I need to spell it out.That’s another telling absence in Bill Gates’s essay: at no point in its 5,000 words does it mention Donald Trump. Were Gates to do so, he’d have to acknowledge that the second of his major assumptions is shaky: reductions in the cost of new green technologies lead inexorably to environmental progress. Of course it helps that wind, solar and other green technologies are becoming radically cheaper than fossil fuels. But Trump and similar demagogues are doing everything they can toimpede the transition.Partly as a result, fossil fuels remain highly lucrative. This could be why, despite Gates’s claim that his foundation had divested all its “direct holdings in oil and gas companies” in 2019, itsfossil fuel stock and bond holdingshave,in fact, increased.To Gates, overthrowing the power of the ultra-wealthy may be unthinkable. I don’t mean only that it clashes with his worldview. I mean that, judging by his remarkable silences on the issue, he might be literally incapable of thinking about it. Perhaps this is a symptom of “billionaire brain”: a profound incapacity to see the world fromother people’s point of view. While the ultra-rich are notoriously hard to study, extrapolating from research into how gaining wealth and status affects cognition could suggest that acquiring huge amounts of money is like taking a blow to the head. Wealth seems toscramble certain cognitive functions, particularly those related toempathyandperspective.But perhaps there’s also calculation here: his essay reads like nothing so much as a peace offering to Donald Trump. Trump certainlytook it that way: “I (WE!) just won the War on the Climate Change Hoax. Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue. It took courage to do so, and for that we are all grateful. MAGA!!!”Gates has alwaysbeencompletely WRONGonthe issue, though not for the reasons Trump imagines. He has consistently lagged behind the curve, reciting fossil fuel claims (green technologies could reduce global CO2 emissions only at a“beyond astronomical” cost) long after they’ve been discredited. He has spread confusion and misinformation, such as the groundless assertion in his new essay that the purpose ofSri Lanka’s disastrous banon synthetic fertilisers was “to cut emissions”.Gates calls his essay Three Tough Truths About Climate. So here’s another tough truth he studiously ignores. If, as now seems likely,crucial Earth systems cross tipping pointsand suddenly collapse, the effects on human life, let alone the survival of other life forms (a topic he fails, as usual, to mention), would destroy the smooth and steady progress he foresees. Because environmental change is likely to proceed not in gradual and linear ways, but through sudden changes of state, the possible impacts on human wellbeing are extremely hard to predict. His argument that we should align all funding to current “data-based analysis” of improvements in human welfare, while it might sound rational, introduces in the face of systemic change a profound irrationality, prompting us to ignore the greatest threats.I wish we could ignoreBill Gates. Unfortunately his economic and political power makes that impossible. But unlike him, we can recognise that this power exists and, when it speaks, it does so on its own behalf.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBill GatesOpinionClimate crisisGreen economyThe super-richRenewable energyDonald TrumpCop30commentShareReuse this content"

Most of that information is digital exhaust, decipherable and valuable only to those who hold the key, but the shop window is filled with a tantalising showcase of video fairytales.A virtual Tower of Babel.Netflix alone has more than 16,000 titles that “live practically in perpetuity, even as they are slowly entombed by new shows, new movies, new documentaries”.Even if it were humanly possible, it would take more than three years, 24/7 – at least five years if you allowed time to sleep and eat – to watch them all back-to-back.Multiply that by Disney, Apple, Prime Amazon, HBO, Binge, Stan, Hulu, Peacock and then add the14bn videos on Google’s YouTubeand the endless repeats on free-to-air TV and you realise that the rules of supply and demand have been rendered obsolete.The old notion of wanting to see our own stories, people and places reflected back to us on screen remains real, urgent and admirable but somehow quaint – a bit like visiting an antique store and marvelling at how people once lived.Before the algorithm, we watched ‘surprise TV’, and it can still offer unexpected delights | Emma WilkinsRead moreLast week the Australian government almost honoured an election promise when it took a tentative legislative step to require some of these companies to spend about7.5% of their local revenue making Australian drama, documentaries, education, arts and children’s programs.Although this potential budget was greeted enthusiastically, government insiders have conceded that this is probably not that much more than the$341m already being spent by the US streaming companiesthat are masters of global commerce (think Apple and Amazon) and tax minimisation.Before he became the arts minister, Tony Burke promised to mandate anincrease of Australian content on the streaming platforms, a promise that was given flesh in Revive, the 2023 national cultural policy. There were airy discussions about 20% quotas and demands for “algorithmic prominence”.But then, until the local industry bought billboards in Canberra and briefed MPs and stepped up its “Make it Australian” campaign, it was a promise that was moved quietly into the too-hard basket. Even asother countries imposed significant quotas– 30% in Europe – policymakers here wrung their hands:What about the free trade agreement, the threat of tariffs, the possibility of a producer boycott?Over the past decade, since the streamers began to make their presence felt, there have beeneight official inquiresinto how best to ensure more Australian content is produced. In that time the regulations mandating the number of hours of Australian content on free-to-air broadcasters have been watered down, public funding for screen production has barely grown, the production industry has become more fragile, jobs have been lost and the handful of local feature filmsreached even smaller audiences.Screen Australia reportsan industry in stasis– despite some international break-out hits (Colin from Accounts, Bluey), production has not kept pace with population growth.This is made worse by the uncertainty fostered by the US president who talks airily about 100% tariffs on foreign films andmandating post-production onshore. This makes it even harder for local producers to find the US distributors that could guarantee the last million dollars needed to make a project viable.The day after the minister introduced thelegislation to mandate the changesand require streamers to make Australian content, Sarah Snook’s latest blockbuster, All Her Fault, became available on Binge.The battle for Australia’s Home of HBO – and why too many streaming services could squeeze out Foxtel and Stan | Dan BarrettRead moreThis eight-part thriller was made in Melbourne, with a budget of more than $70m,supported by VicScreen and Screen Australia. The series made by Universal International (which now owns Matchbox) employed hundreds of people and will no doubt provide quality distraction for a few hours. The budget alone points to one of the problems of the mandated expenditure model – the streamers have made television expensive, feature film-scale budgets are now required to make the glossy TV shows that will cut through. But even eight hours is gone in a blink, not a cultural moment.But does dressing up Melbourne to make it look like Chicago, and showcasing the most outstanding film star of her generation, make this an authentic Australian story?Answering that question, and in the process reflecting on what it means to really see ourselves on screen in the Tower of Babel, will require more policy innovation than setting expenditure requirements. There are other policy tools that might help: changing the producer offset agreement to help television producers, and increasing the budgets for Screen Australia and the public broadcasters.But the bigger, existential question is how do you create an authentic local cultural moment in an age of algorithmic digital colonisation? Decolonisation was hard a century ago and will be again.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of Australia.

But the answer isn’t simpleEmma Kavanagh is a psychologist who has worked for the police and the militarySat 8 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Nov 2025 05.01 ESTShareThe devastatingattack on train passengersin Cambridgeshire last weekend was shocking. There hasbeen talk of heroeswho risked their lives to help others, and ofthose who hidto save their lives. If you are anything like me, you will be asking yourself: what if that were me? How would I cope? And just who would I turn out to be when the worst happens?Some of us imagine that we would vault to the rescue, fighting off attackers. Others, perhaps the more realistic among us, anticipate flight, extricating ourselves from the situation as quickly and efficiently as possible. Most of us would like to think that we would stay our urge to run, lingering long enough to offer aid to those in need.People tend to think of “fight or flight” as the body’s natural responses to danger. But the reality is a lot more complicated. As humans, we are a social species, which means we also have the “tend and befriend” drive. You see it all the time in emergencies. In fact, my background in police psychology has shown me that one of the biggest challenges in dealing with any disaster, be it a plane crash, or a threat to a school, is managing all of the people who will inevitably converge at the scene: people running towards danger. Not to confront it, but to reach their loved ones. When we are in a life-threatening situation, we have an instinctive urge to draw those we love close to us. We also have an inbuilt urge to protect those who have been harmed.So, what turns someone into a helper? The first thing to remember is that running away does not equate to cowardice. If someone is coming at you with a weapon, fear is sensible, flight is adaptive. Removing yourself from the situation is the rational thing to do. But once you have done that, new opportunities are then presented to you. You may not be the one who will charge down the attacker, but I’m willing to bet that once you have done what evolution programmed you to do and removed yourself from danger, you will then turn to those who are harmed, offering them aid. This is the tend and befriend response in action. Remember that few things create bonds as quickly or as powerfully as danger. Once you have survived the immediate threat, the survival of those around you is likely to become your top priority.It’s important to recognise trauma – but we should not let it become our entire identity |  Gill Straker and Jacqui WinshipRead moreIt also depends on who we see ourselves as being. Have we imagined ourselves as the hero? It may sound silly, but what we imagine for ourselves can create a schema of behaviour, a mental model that provides us with a template for how to respond in a crisis. Schemas are incredibly important in fast-moving situations. When our stress response is high, we lose the capacity to think rationally. The part of the brain that governs rational thought (the prefrontal cortex) receives less blood flow when we are in a highly stressful situation. So, instead we rely on other parts of the brain (notably the limbic system), responsible for things such as instincts, emotions, muscle memory and schemas. Having a pre-existing schema in place thatincludes us helpingwill go a long way towards creating that behaviour.It also matters whether we have had experience of emergencies before. In my experience, emergency services and military personnel are oftenexcellent in a crisis, because they have learned to quell the immediate stress response, calm themselves long enough to assess the situation and see what needs to be done. But anyone who has learned how to manage their own fear reaction can function well in a situation like this. The truth is, having survived previous crises is powerful learning for us. It tells us that we can experience terrible things, and we can survive.Another factor is how closely a person identifies as someone who does good things. Some people spend a lot of time considering the value they add to the world. Other people don’t. If you do, you are more likely towant to helpbecause that’s simply who you are.The truth is that disasters, for the most part, move quickly. Moments may feel like hours, but they will pass in the blink of an eye. And then you are left, a survivor of the worst of times. If that happens, it is OK not to be OK. In the immediate aftermath of a life-threatening event, most of us will fall apart. Even if it is only for a little while. If, in the aftermath of trauma, you have struggled with painful recollections, difficulty sleeping, feeling jumpy and tearful or angry, know that this is the human stress response doing what it does best. Your brain has been presented with the most unlikely and terrible of circumstances. It now has to build a place to store these experiences – a new schema, in which you are a survivor. That can be abumpy process.But what we also know is that, for most people, these feelings will settle over time, as the initial stress response fades and you incorporate this new piece of you into your understanding of who you are. Sometimes, if the stress response clings on, some help may be needed to assist you in processing your experiences. Remember, terrible moments hit each of us differently, weaving their way into our past experiences and our current situations, creating a unique response for each person affected.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Succinct and to the point, it is a sentiment shared by many women in Mexico after watching the now viral video of a drunk man groping the country’s first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum, as she walked from the National Palace to the education ministry on Monday. Sheinbaum, who has pressed charges against the man,said much the sameat her daily press briefing on Wednesday: “If they do this to the president, what happens to all the other women in the country?”Sheinbaum’s unprecedented position has made this a teaching moment in a country where women have long complained that sexual harassment and assault on streets and public transport were too often normalised and not taken seriously. The leftist Sheinbaum’s political opponents on the right have done just that byclaiming her sexual assault was stagedto distract from the assassination of a local mayor, Carlos Manzo, an outspoken critic of organised crime who had called on the government to do more to protect him and others. Most women here, on the other hand, know that sexual violence does not have to be set up –half of them have experienced itat some point in their lives.Sheinbaum, like her predecessor and mentor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, is known for wading into crowds, shaking hands, chatting with people and posing for selfies. She was doing just that when she was groped. “It’s a fragile balance between being safe and being close to the people,” said Ishtar Cardona, a sociologist who specialises in cultural studies at the National Autonomous University ofMexico, when she and I met at her Mexico City home for tea, both feeling enraged.And for a female president it’s a reminder that you often can’t win.If Sheinbaum abandoned the closeness to people that her party prides itself on, she would be accused of being scared and not fit for office. Maintaining the tradition as a woman who was so brazenly assaulted, she is open to accusations of being reckless. Already, her opponents are saying that she deserved it, both Camastra and Cardona told me. As Cardona explained to me:“For people that are raised in a very traditional way in which a patriarchal structure is normalised, a woman (like Sheinbaum), who is a scientist, a leftist, represents all that macho men, patriarchal status quo men, in Mexico, hate.” She told me of an incident three years ago when a student approached her in the melee of people congratulating her after she gave a keynote speech and tried to grope her. President or professor, neither woman’s position or power protected her from patriarchal men.Sexual assault is not unique to Mexico, of course. Talking to Mexican women about what happened to their president burst open a cupboard of stored memories and a sharing of war stories. When Cardona told me that she urges her women students not to freeze when they’re groped, I told her of how Ifroze at the age of 15when I was sexually assaulted twice during the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, including by a Saudi policeman. (I started using the hashtag#MosqueMeTooin 2018, which went viral at the time,and to which many Muslim women still share their experiences with sexual assault in sacred sites.) And when she told me of punching her fair share of gropers in the street, I told her how at the age of 50Ibeat up a manwho groped me in a dance club in Montreal, Canada. (I started#IBeatMyAssaulter, which also went viral, and encouraged women around the world to share stories.)Perhaps this is the moment when the dam breaks for Mexican women.“We have been breaking the taboo for about 10 years now but it’s very tough,” says Cardona. “Many women are ashamed but now we can talk with more freedom, more freely about this.” She always talks to her students, men and women, about the precautions she takes when she leaves home, she tells me. “I think about how to dress to try not to be grabbed by the ass or have some man tell me something gross. And I ask my male students: ‘Have you ever thought about that?’ Never.” Once they have seen it happen to their president, in broad daylight, in footage beamed across the world, will Mexican men think differently about it now?“I tell my students you have to embrace the anger!” Cardona told me.I told her I know that man who groped me in a club will always remember the woman who beat him up.Mona Eltahawy writes theFeminist Giantnewsletter.

Yet the treachery of the turret appears to have dragged them back to the TV.The overnight ratings for The Celebrity Traitors – which measures the number of people watching live or later that evening on iPlayer reveal that more than half of the people aged between 16 and 24 viewing the show within that time slot watched every episode of The Celebrity Traitors as it was broadcast.The show’s finale broke records. Its overnight average audience was more than 11 million, the biggest of the year and the biggest since the Gavin & Stacey special on Christmas Day. It was watched by 81% of the viewers aged 16-24 who were watching linear TV in that time slot, according to Digital i.The Celebrity Traitors viewing figures for 16- to 24-year-olds watching linear TV in that time slot“At a time when younger audiences are increasingly turning away from live linear TV,The Traitorshas grown into appointment viewing for 16- to 24-year-olds in the UK,” said Matt Ross, Digital i’s chief analytics officer. “The most recent iteration has been a major draw for younger viewers.”The race is now on to dissect that success and see what lessons can be taken from the show – or whether its mass appeal and ability to reach younger viewers is simply an increasingly rare anomaly.Katy Fox, executive producer at Studio Lambert, which makes the show for theBBC, said: “The idea of the whole family stopping what they’re doing and sitting round the telly to share in a hugely positive, joyous show is exactly what you hope for as producers.“The best thing about the 16- to 24-year-olds taking to Traitors so faithfully is just the sheer amount of energy and creativity they bring to fandom – from memes to videos to Halloween costumes and everything in between – it’s fantastic.”View image in fullscreenCat Burns, Claudia Winkleman, Alan Carr, Nick Mohammed, David Olusoga and Joe Marler during The Celebrity Traitors final, which broke records.Photograph: Paul Chappells/BBC/Studio LambertThe show’s success is timely for the BBC after concerns were raised about its long-term appeal to gen Z. Just this week, Jordan Schwarzenberger, the manager of the hugely successful YouTube collective theSidemen, said the corporation risked becomingculturally irrelevant to young audiences.Industry insiders say there are plenty of lessons to be learned from The Celebrity Traitors. They point to its “always on” appeal, with the live show acting almost like a live sports event, with an official podcast, numerous clipped moments and an embrace of fan-made memes and content meaning there is always Traitors-related material to consume during the week.Kate Phillips, the BBC’s chief content officer who first commissioned the programme, said her initial interest in the show was born out of the pandemic, when she felt the need to find shows that brought people together. Since then, she says the show, which began as a Dutch format, grew rapidly by word of mouth across the generations – a key measure for the BBC, tasked with providing content with mass appeal.“What I want is shows that have the 3Gs at their heart,” she said. “By that, I mean shows that have three generations of people all watching together. One thing I’ve taken away is that, actually, young people really love to watch with their parents, with their grandparents. People really appreciate it.”View image in fullscreenAlan Carr was the eventual winner of The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertAs for why the show had reached younger viewers, she pointed to partnerships with TikTok, linking the platform directly with iPlayer. She also says the show’s social strategy was “built with the under-35s, and particularly the under-24s, firmly in mind”. The show has been endlessly clipped, while the BBC has also been relaxed about fans jumping in and making their own viral content.Phillips said for all the talk of linear TV’s declining importance, The Celebrity Traitors also demonstrated how the medium could still play a critical role as a “shop window” for the best content.“Celebrity Traitors can be on linear TV, but it evolves into a cross-platform, shared experience that feels very current, very fun and very unfiltered,” she said. “The memes and the comments – it’s like a kind of second entertainment show running alongside the main show.”Jon Willers, a media consultant who has been thinking about how to reach gen Z, said the show’s success pointed to the industry’s need to reinvent and reskill itself for the social media age. “It’s one of those few shows that bridges two different worlds,” he said. “There’s a digital world, which skews younger and it’s more about socials and less about watching traditional telly. Then you’ve got the traditional world, which is about seeing what’s on at 9pm.“There are very few instances at the moment where a show can kind of penetrate both of those places. There needs to be more shows that have that vision and that ambition. It shows that people aren’t necessarily leaving TV. They’re leaving TV that doesn’t really speak to them.“We’ve all been very siloed up to this point. TV producers make TV programmes. Social creators make content on socials. Broadcasters are essentially the publishers and help with marketing. TV producers are now trying to be much more multi-platform.”View image in fullscreenThe Celebrity Traitors presenter Claudia Winkleman. The makers of the show say casting is crucial.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertIn fact, The Celebrity Traitors is not the only big hit to find an audience with gen Z, as traditional broadcasters attempt to adapt to the different ways in which they find and dissect their chosen shows.The prime example is Dancing With the Stars, the US version of Strictly Come Dancing. It was once on a par with other reality formats, but has now found itself as the dominant title in the genre. It did so by embracing online culture by using viral songs, bringing in dancers with a big social media presence and broadening the cast.“Dancing With the Stars leaned heavily into the creator ecosystem – casting creators as contestants,” said Evan Shapiro, a Hollywood producer turned leading analyst on the creator economy. “It obviously paid off,” he added.“Celebrity Traitors collected a truly fascinating cross-section of entertainment culture in the UK and then leaned heavily into creator ethos – clipping the show ad nauseam, encouraging user-generated content.”He said it was proof that big broadcasters and titles could adapt to changing consumption. “The mindset of successful crossover IP [from TV to social media] is ‘the show is the clip and the clip is the show – and together they are the show’. It’s all proof that when big publishers act like creators, they can be dominant creators themselves.”For The Celebrity Traitors, its makers say casting was crucial and included the likes of Niko Omilana, who has more than 8 million subscribers on YouTube, though he left the game early on.View image in fullscreenNick Mohammed during the final roundtable.Photograph: BBC“We’ve always believed that The Traitors is a format that can appeal to every generation, and have always tried to reflect that in our casting,” said Fox. “Having a celebrity cast with a broad range of ages and personalities meant we were confident younger viewers would identify with cast members they already know … and maybe even get to know national treasures they didn’t! We’re delighted with the results.”For others in the industry, the discussion about how to keep younger audiences tuned in is complicating a simple equation. In show business, the golden rule still stands – it is all about hits.Peter Fincham, co-CEO of the production company Expectation and co-hosts the podcast Insiders TV, said: “The most powerful form of marketing is always going to be word of mouth. It’s in the conversation at home, at work, at school.“When that happens, you get young people watching. What is maybe a little bit more unusual in the modern age is what you would call an old-fashioned, mainstream hit that gets everybody talking.“I’m quite wary of the trend analysis. This is the simplest thing in the world. Have a great big hit and you will get a lot of people viewing it of all ages. That was true 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago.”"

But it is Anderson as a sour, ragey alcoholic who truly mesmerisesRhik SamadderSat 8 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTShareIt’s cliché to compare a love story to Romeo and Juliet. It’s like saying a detective reminds you of Sherlock Holmes. Yet it’s hard to avoid, watching Channel 4’s drama set in 1970s Northern Ireland. Trespasses follows Cushla Laverty, a 24-year-old Catholic teacher who falls for a swashbuckling Protestant, Michael Agnew. They begin seeing each other secretly, around Michael’s high profile establishment job: he’s an outspoken barrister, who campaigns for justice on behalf of young Catholic boys caught up in police bullying. This puts him, and those close to him, at risk of violent reprisal from both sides. Puts your commute into perspective, eh?There’s much to admire. The show’s vintage palette for one, dripping with melancholy browns and orange. Was it perpetually autumn in the 70s? Michael and Cushla, played by Tom Cullen and Lola Petticrew from Say Nothing, have chemistry. And then there’s Gillian Anderson, who plays Cushla’s widowed mother, Gina. She steals so many scenes I wonder if she’s been hanging around the Louvre.Sometimes, when actors ‘do’ accents it’s like someone wearing a fur coat in the supermarket: you can’t pay attention to anything else. And make no mistake, Norn Irish is a fearsomely challenging accent, second only to Newcastle. (When I was learning it at drama school, I had to repeat certain phrases over and over, to key into its particular music. ‘Sloppy Giuseppe’ being the one that sticks in my head.)Anderson inhabits the role, the diametrical opposite of her candid, adventurous Jean Milburn in Sex Education. It’s also pretty far away from her role as Gillian Anderson, doula to women’s fantasies, following her brilliant book Want. Every woman I know is obsessed with Gillian Anderson. They have tattoos. They lose their minds when a new picture shows up of her in a suit. To them, she represents a flawless combination of intelligence, classic grace and liberated sexuality. Also, Scully from the X Files was an OG.View image in fullscreenSteamy windows … Michael Agnew (Tom Cullen) and Cushla Lavery (Lola Petticrew) in Trespasses.Photograph: Peter Marley/Channel 4By contrast, Gina is a sour, curtain-twitching black hole, destroying herself through alcoholism. Anderson uses the supporting part to lethally exude repression, shame and judgment: qualities of despair atmospheric to that time and place. She orders her children to observe the status quo and appease the British. When she learns that her son Eamonn’s wife is five months pregnant, she leaves the dinner table in jealous rage. “Her ma was probably told the second Eamonn pulled out of her,” she spits.Miraculously, she also brings humour to it. “Are you a love addict?” she scornfully demands of her daughter, after reading a quiz in a magazine. The show has an unexpected dryness, notably in the Father Ted-esque figure of Father Slattery – an intense priest at Cushla’s school, who terrifies the children with inappropriate stories of sectarian violence. It leavens a story that could become heavy.Trespasses takes on a heartbreaking moral force as it travels. It’s an illustration of how political dogma creeps and hardens, infecting communities. It condemns the fact that in our world, love – and even simple acts of kindness – can be met with violence. It’s not sentimental about romance, either. The crusading, handsome Michael is older and married. He likes female company, a lot. Does that change how we feel? It would be hard to argue that he’s not still a good man.There is a subtle idea submerged in Trespasses: that obstacles supply oxygen to the wildfire of young love. Obstacles make lovers a team against the world. It’s uncomfortable to admit that sometimes we need unfairness, bad timing, intrusive pasts. If our view is unobstructed, we see more clearly how our beloveds are far from heroic, maybe even not good, a lot of the time. Romeo and Juliet has a similar wisdom, deep inside it.This is a handsome drama, full of painful beauty. We can’t help but root for Michael and Cushla, who can’t give up their furtive passion. They’re seeking private, humanising joy at a time when acts of betrayal between neighbours were as commonplace as slices of soda bread. It hurts to remember the real context is our recent history. If you liked The Celebrity Traitors, they ain’t got nothing on this lot.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Doing it because you watchedThe Big Lebowskiis probably even worse. But as I faced up to what would be my eighth year in an IT role, I watched Jeff Bridges meandering his way through the chaos of life in a dressing gown. And I found myself thinking: maybe the Dude had it figured out.For most of my working life, my identity has been strongly bolstered by work: doing well career-wise felt like evidence of my utility and respectability (despite the fact no one ever really understood what my job was anyway). And, like most millennials, I’d felt exceptionally lucky to eventually get a grad job out of university at all, especially one that paid more than a “living wage”. On top of that, as a second generation immigrant, I’d been repeatedly told from a young age that being jobless is a terrible state of affairs.I had been unhappy for some time, but leaving without a new role to go to had always seemed totally unthinkable. But life has a funny way of telling you when you’re no longer where you should be; against my will, I was moved to another department, with a nightmare boss. I then got another role where the colleagues were lovely, but the job felt deeply uncreative and uninteresting. Shortly after, senior leadership began talking about job cuts – it was clear we were expected to do just as much with even less.There was something deeply philosophical about my sudden affection for the filmWhen two years earlier I’d watched the Coen Brothers’ 1998 classic The Big Lebowski, I’d spent much of it scrolling on my phone and then stupidly wondering why I wasn’t finding the film particularly interesting. But this summer, facing a dreaded project that I had almost no passion for, and with little else to distract me, I watched it properly for the first time. I was completely captivated. I watched it every day for a week, read bits of the script and scoured the internet for any half-decent podcasts about it, so I could figure out why a film that seemed so ridiculous also meant so much to me.A lot of people have described encountering “Dude-ism” as a quasi-religious experience, and there was certainly something philosophical about my sudden affection for the film. The attitude of Jeff Bridges’s bowling-obsessed slacker the Dude is to “take it easy” in a chaotic world that is constantly trying to push him into urgency and action. One of his antagonists, the philanthropist known as “the Big Lebowski”, represents the absurdity of modern, capitalist life, screaming “get a job sir!” and “the bums will always lose!” The Dude is treated by most as an unemployed waster against the backdrop of the 90s economic boom. But by the end of the film it’s difficult not to believe that the Dude is the one who’s really rich in life. He keeps his inner tranquility, despite all the madness around him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The final straw came in a meeting with a manager, where I was being encouraged to learn more skills for a role from which I was already mentally checking out. “What would the Dude do?” I asked myself. I already had my answer.Not everyone initially thought it was a great idea. “But what if your boiler broke down?” my mum exclaimed, having anxiously predicted any little thing that could go awry. Still, my mind was made up. I handed in my notice with nothing in particular lined up and an acceptance that life is full of “strikes and gutters”.One of the most strikingly beautiful aspects of The Big Lebowski is the bowling alley the Dude goes to, a space of habitual calm and simplicity. Since leaving I’ve reimmersed myself more in those small rituals of peace, repetition and community; cooking a meal from scratch in peace and quiet, grabbing a coffee with a friend to talk about nothing much at all. Outside the demands of full-time work, I’ve been able to remember what’s really important in life.I’m not exactly living like the Dude; after all I still have a mortgage to pay. For now, I’m living off the savings I built up from my old job, a small income from the media and education platform I’m continuing to fundraise for, and bits of journalism work on the side.I know much of that is a privilege – but I’m grateful to have the choice to live at a slower pace, on my own terms. And if you still think my decision to be jobless was a bad idea, well that’s just, like, your opinion, man.Share your experienceShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

They rushed away the cupboards and chairs, his shirts and socks. Ragpickers took the rusted appliances. A young woman, the guitar. I remember my father practising Greensleeves over and over. Or did I make that up? It was raining, but my eyes stayed dry. No time for tears – that’s how fast an empire is dismantled. Another landscape gone.I was already writing about loneliness, about Sonia and Sunny, who meet on the night train to their respective grandparents’ homes, journeying into their past – the past being a kind of home to us all. I was already sensing the restorative depth of their bond, as well as its fragility.Sonia and Sunny’s relationship unfolds over years and continents – across the United States, Italy, Mexico, India. As they meet and part, negotiating a world without a centre, I wrote about the rifts between nations, between races, genders, religions, all as a kind of loneliness. I wrote about the spaces where news stories disconcertingly changed form, where people made unknowable creatures of themselves. And about shadowlands occupied by phantoms and nightmares that anticipated that a dark undercurrent of history might at any moment explode into renewed violence. I wrote about longing for the vanishing natural world, the magical creatures that forests and oceans once concealed. But I was also interested in loneliness shifting shape into a quiet that is peace after the war is over. A sought-out solitude during a time of transformation. An exquisite artistic loneliness. A discovery of the dignity and privacy of one’s individual being.Everything I experienced during the years of writing was swept into the river of this book – diaries, newspaper articles – and, at one point, my book lay in pieces and I struggled to hold it together. Wherever I went, my ungainly tome came along, weighing down my luggage. I lugged it in market bags, to be mailed from various locations to my home in New York City, which was filling up with paper.Then a wondrous coincidence happened (in my experience life always gives you what you need to write your book). The Italian artist, Francesco Clemente, who has worked in India for decades, asked me to write an introduction to an exhibition of his paintings, a meditative and mystical series that powerfully conjured India. His watercolours were in constant flux, suspended between wakefulness and dream. As a gift, he sent me one of his paintings, a demon god without a face. It might have come out of a primeval forest. In this faceless, eyeless deity that I kept beside my writing table, I found the visual symbol I needed to unite the many stories, to think of them in terms of who is in whose purview, who is captured and controlled by whose gaze – when it comes to the power divides I mentioned, when it comes to journalism, when it comes to art, when it comes to love. The unseen world, the shadow world, together with the plot of Sonia and Sunny’s long unresolved romance, together became The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny.Ben MarkovitsThe Rest of Our LivesView image in fullscreenIt started with the opening lines, about a man whose wife had an affair when the kids were small. I was working on something else at the time, but I wrote the first few pages one afternoon and then put them aside. Maybe a year later, I had another look. My own kids were getting older and I wanted to write about a certain period of family life coming to an end. Those opening pages seemed like a way in: a guy drops his daughter at university and instead of going home afterward, keeps driving.There were other things about the idea that interested me. The fact that it wasn’t the man who had the affair; also, his feeling that, I haven’t done anything wrong, and yet here I am. The last sentence I’d written said something like: even when things smoothed over, the best I could claim was a C- marriage, which makes it hard to score much higher than a B overall on the rest of your life. This seems reasonable enough but also clearly the wrong way of thinking about it, and I thought that tension might make a good basis for a novel.By the time I finished the first draft, both Tom, my narrator, and I knew what we had, and I was going through chemoMeanwhile, odd medical stuff had started happening to me: sudden exhaustion while jogging, random head rushes, a swollen face in the morning. My GP couldn’t find anything, but I put these symptoms in the book as another symbol of middle age, the gradual decline that you can’t quite understand. By the time I finished the first draft, both Tom, my narrator, and I knew what we had, and I was going through chemo. Obviously this shaped the book – not just the plot but how I felt about the story. My original idea was to leave Tom completely abandoned at the end, but the more I wrote, and the sicker I got, the less that made sense. Being sick focuses a lot of attention on you; it also changes how people feel about you, if only temporarily.One of the problems of road trip novels is that your hero is usually running away from the source of the story: in this case, an unhappy marriage. But it occurred to me that I often find it easier to talk to other people in my head when they’re not around – you keep the conversation going, sometimes more honestly and lovingly than you can in their presence. In other words, even though Tom was driving away from his wife, this could still be a novel about reconciling themselves, if not to each other then to the next stage of their lives, which in one way or another they both have to face.Susan ChoiFlashlightView image in fullscreenI recently saw Eleanor Catton ask Sarah Moss, of her latest work: “What is the earliest ancestor of this book?” I thought this was such a great question because it gets at how the genesis of a book can sometimes take place long before any actual writing, or even recognition that there might one day be writing, takes place. The earliest, prehistoric, fish-that-still-hasn’t-grown-legs ancestor of this book is a childhood trip I took to Japan with my parents in the late 1970s. I had never been out of the US, and Japan at that time was hardly westernised as it is now, so the culture shock was profound. I never forgot that trip, and a long time later when I’d started writing I wished I could write about it, but although the trip had been life-changing for me, nothing had happened that would seize the interest of a reader.Jump forward two decades, and I’m leaning against the kitchen counter in my first New York City apartment, reading my housemate’s New York Times. “Defector’s tale reminds Japan of a lost girl” catches my eye. I still haven’t published my first book, let alone learned any writerly habits such as paying attention to possible ideas or even making note of them.The articlekept my attention from start to finish. It was about a Japanese schoolgirl who had vanished into thin air while walking home from badminton practice. Her disappearance had taken place the year before my family’s time in Japan, and she’d been just a handful of years older than me. These weren’t particularly remarkable coincidences, but they kept her in my mind.Jump forward another two decades plus, and I’m sitting on my back deck gazing into the unusually clear spring sky, reading Dickens, which seems very fitting somehow for the terrifying pandemic that has upended life around the globe, and trying to work out whether my idea – to write about that dreamily recalled Japan of my childhood, but from the point of view of a very different child, one subjected to catastrophe – could possibly work. Whether out of perversity or as a sort of warding-off of misfortune, I often find myself imagining something familiar – like my own childhood journey – fed through a fantasy machine of worst-case scenarios, so that the old familiar material comes out the other side warped beyond recognition. Could I hurl thunderbolts of the extraordinary on to a childhood landscape of the ordinary? The actual thunderbolt I was considering seemed almost too thunderous for fiction, and I got stuck again. “This is too outlandish,” I discouraged myself. I decided to cheat, and write about my young protagonistpost-thunderbolt, without owning up to what the thunderbolt had been. (This is a great hack for when you’re stuck while writing fiction: skip ahead.) The resulting short story, Flashlight, came out in late 2020. After that, I was committed – I really had no choice but to go through with the thunderbolt, the result being Flashlight the book.Andrew MillerThe Land in WinterView image in fullscreenThe origins of a novel are quickly covered over. Rule of thumb says it started months or even years before you think it did. The new idea, prodded, looks a lot like an older idea you liked but didn’t know what to do with. Perhaps it was weather that came first, something visual, a landscape blurred by snowfall. Then, around that image, or rising out of it, a time and place: 1962, a village outside Bristol, the village never named but reconstructed from my memories of where I spent the first years of my life. And somewhere inside this welling up of images and possibilities, inhabiting them as a kind of armature, an anecdote of my mother’s, a very bare story about the day she and my doctor father ran across the field to an emergency at the farmhouse on the other side.Pretty much from the off, I had a good feeling about the book, about the writing. The previous novel had been an anxious struggle. Now, with The Land in Winter, I felt suddenly liberated. I didn’t worry much about themes. As long as there was a good forward energy, I was happy just to follow it. One of my guiding intentions – a central one – was to let my four main characters have the freedom to see out their parts in whatever way was right for them. No one was going to be shoved around by plot. As ever, there were moments of doubt – a book without a crisis is one I’d start to worry about – but the writing was often joyful and there are no bite marks in the manuscript (there are in some).I wanted the book to keep a certain wildness, even a certain oddness. You cannot write if you do not trust your intuitionIn the summer of 2023 I sent it off. I thought I was finished, more or less, but my editor, with a cooler eye, could see there was still much to be done. Things I’d believed were present in the manuscript had not been visible to him at all. So began a year of intensive rewrites. Not to tidy up – I wanted the book to keep a certain wildness, even a certain oddness – but to make it a little more shapely, and perhaps just to understand it better, its preoccupation with how big our lives might be, and what a bigger life might mean, the consequences of that. Handing it over a second time, I had the snow-blindness most writers experience at the end of a long project. It’s hard to know any more what you’ve made. The affirmations of this spring and summer have been deeply reassuring because they tell me that what I felt about the work – that freedom and that joy – was not delusional. You cannot write if you do not trust your intuition.Katie KitamuraAuditionView image in fullscreenAudition has a simple premise. The narrator is an actress in rehearsal for a difficult new play. She is successful, happily married, and settled in her life. Then, a young man approaches her and tells her that he believes he is her son. From that point, two narratives unfurl – two versions of events, two distinct realities. In one, the young man is a stranger. In the other, he is in fact her son.I can pinpoint the origins of the novel quite precisely. Some years ago, I came upon a headline, reading: “A stranger told me he was my son.” I immediately knew this was material I wanted to work with in some way. I was careful not to click on the link and read the article, in part because I wanted to sit with the strangeness of the headline. On the one hand, I was fascinated by the idea that a single encounter could change everything you understand about yourself and your place in the world.But I was also interested in the illogical nature of the headline. The two terms, “a stranger” and “my son”, seemed diametrically opposed, even mutually exclusive. I didn’t want the mystery of that opposition to be resolved. The article would, I felt sure, contain a perfectly plausible explanation for the mysterious headline. Perhaps the author of the article had placed a child into adoption. Or perhaps the stranger in question had a mental health disorder.Neither of those options felt particularly satisfying to me as a novelist. In them, all the wonderful mystery of the headline seemed to drain away. Some time later, I went for a walk with a friend and I told her about the headline – about how beguiling I found it, and how I wasn’t entirely sure how to enter into the world that I could sense hovering just behind the headline. She asked me to repeat the sentence, and then she said: “But that’s just parenting. Every time my son comes home from college, it’s like a stranger has walked into the apartment.”After that conversation with my friend, I had a sense of what I wanted to try to do in the novel. I wanted to write about how many universal experiences – of love, of motherhood – can feel like two mutually exclusive things at the time. I never clicked on that headline, but now I wonder if the story behind it was not a story about adoption, or about delusion, or about a hoax of some kind – all ideas that I had pondered and played around with. I wonder if instead it told a very human and very simple story about the long process through which a child must necessarily grow up to become a stranger to their own parents – about both the satisfactions and the devastations of that experience.David SzalayFleshView image in fullscreenFlesh was conceived in the shadow of failure. In the autumn of 2020 I abandoned a novel I had been working on for nearly four years. This was obviously not an easy decision. It represented the writing-off of a huge investment of time, hope, energy and emotion. A lot of work had been done. I had written over 100,000 words. But by that autumn I had long had the sense that the thing wasn’t working. The struggle to make it work was becoming anguished. It was with a feeling of exhausted relief, more than anything else, that I finally just binned it, resolving to have a good night’s sleep, and start again the next morning with a blank sheet of paper, or at least a new Word document.At that point I was about a year away from the date by which my publishers and I had agreed that I would deliver a new book. I had, in other words, one year or slightly less in which to write a novel from scratch. The pressure of that did get to me. After a few weeks of staring at a blank screen, at a blinking cursor, it was obvious that I would need to ask for more time, and I did.It wasn’t a problem.Still, I was dogged by self-doubt. Dogged by the feeling that while it might be sort of OK to abandon one half-finished novel, it would be disastrous – for me, psychologically – to abandon two in succession. I wasn’t sleeping well. I was becoming depressed. The greatest difficulty, in a way, was just deciding what to write about. What specific story to tell. Where to start. In a way, I wished that someone would tell me what to do, what to write about. There was no one to do that, though. I was on my own, in what felt quite a lot like an anxiety dream.I made myself start with a few simple ideas. (One of the main problems with my previous effort was that it had been too intricate, too fiddly.) I decided that I would write something that was partly English and partly Hungarian. And that the story would somehow express the feeling I had that our existence is a physical experience before it is anything else, that all of its other aspects proceed from that physicality, and of course finally return to it too when we ourselves return to being what Auden memorably called “irresponsible matter”.Those two ideas, if they can even be called that, were the fixed points with which I started the new work. They were the seed from which it grew.The Booker prize will be announced on 10 November. Buy all six Booker prize-shortlisted books for £75, saving over £28, atguardianbookshop.com.

The play begins in a pub where Jones (Simon Holland Roberts) is hiding out after escaping from prison. He is holding drinkers rapt with stories of his “heroic” past and it is clear that he knows how to self-mythologise. But is he speaking the truth? And is he a common criminal or an incendiary force of rebellion?Because of the tonal uncertainly of this play – a comedy-cum-farce that flips to darkness moments before the end – you do not feel invested enough to be pulled in by these central puzzles.Jones might have carried shades of Rooster, the charismatic rogue fromJez Butterworth’s Jerusalem, but is too broadly, flatly drawn: a growlingly mischievous figure of fun like a barefootFalstaffwhose motivations are unclear.Under the direction of Dan Jones, the comedy and characterisation is too generic. Reginald Jones-Bateman (Qasim Mahmood) is the haughty Englishman and tyrant landowner in pursuit of Jones, with a police officer (Rhys ap Trefor) who is so ineffectual that he seems to have arisen out of a saggy 1970s sitcom.View image in fullscreenOutlandish … from left: Mia Khan, Theo Woolford and Simon Holland Roberts.Photograph: Kirsten McternanThe plot wanders into the outlandish and incredible: Reginald’s party has a gun but fail to apprehend Jones. The police officer is assaulted and beaten after being mistaken for a badger in a sack (why doesn’t he cry out to make them stop?). A giant cauldron is heaved on to the stage by Jones which he says he has carried across the Irish seas (what is the point of that?). Perhaps it is there to feed the blurred lines between reality and myth but instead it seems far-fetched and distracting.Cross-class and illicit romances are touched on, but seem like cogs to the plot, and intrigues are given away by characters too soon, so that any tension which might have grown is aborted. Poverty and war are mentioned but untethered to the story.Designer Mark Bailey’s period pub is evocative with its spare wood sparseness. There are rumbles of the approaching Great War as well as friction closer to home. Reginald mentions his time in India as part of the Raj, and there are unspoken parallels to the colonisation of Wales. Like Rooster, Jones is connected to this land which has been “invaded” by English aristocracy. But this theme is diluted by the busy plot and humour.The tragedy and climactic segue into the realm of myth – is Jones real or the spirit of thenative, ancient Prince of Wales? – does not have the impact it should. There is a powerful play about outsider spirit, rebellion and the slippery nature of storytelling within this one, emerging in glimmers.AtTheatr Clwyd, Mold, until 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreTheatr ClwydreviewsShareReuse this content"

However, it omitted a section of the speech where Trump urged the crowd “to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard”.In an interview with the Telegraph, Leavitt said: “This purposefully dishonest, selectively edited clip by the BBC is further evidence that they are total, 100% fake news that should no longer be worth the time on the television screens of the great people of the United Kingdom.“Every time I travel to the United Kingdom with President Trump and am forced to watch the BBC in our hotel rooms, it ruins my day listening to their blatant propaganda and lies about the president of the United States and all that he’s doing to make America better and the world a safer place.”The newspaper said its reporting was based on a memo written by Michael Prescott, a former adviser to the BBC’s editorial guidelines and standards committee. Prescott left his role earlier this year and has not commented on the document, understood to have been leaked by a whistleblower.It published an extract that read: “It was completely misleading toedit the clipin the way Panorama aired it. The fact that he did not explicitly exhort supporters to go down and fight at Capitol Hill was one of the reasons there were no federal charges for incitement to riot.”The memo reportedly added that Prescott, a communications consultant and former political journalist, had raised concerns about the way BBC Arabic covered the war in Gaza.BBC accused of selectively editing Trump clip from day of Capitol attackRead moreThe Telegraph said Prescott alleged there were “systemic problems”, which had not been addressed by senior management, claiming there were “stark differences” between the coverage of the war on BBC Arabic and on the main BBC website. One issue Prescott is said to have highlighted is the repeated use of commentators who were antisemitic or pro-Hamas.The 19-page dossier is also reported to have criticised the BBC’s coverage of transgender issues, saying the broadcaster had been “captured by a small group of [staff] promoting the Stonewall view” of gender identity issues and that its LGBT desk would “decline to cover any stories raising difficult questions”.It is said to have alleged that stories raising complex questions about trans issues were suppressed, with a “constant drip-feed of one-sided stories celebrating the trans experience without adequate balance or objectivity”.In response, the BBC said: “While we don’t comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback it takes it seriously and considers it carefully.“Michael Prescott is a former adviser to a board committee where differing views and opinions of our coverage are routinely discussed and debated.”Explore more on these topicsBBCDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

I found a lump a few weeks ago. It came and went but then I was working on The Masked Singer and Lorraine, the TV show, and Lorraine Kelly had put signs on the backs of all the doors saying ‘check your breasts’ and every time I went for a wee I did that.“It was still there, and then one morning I saw myself in the mirror and thought: ‘I’m going to get that looked at.’“I had a biopsy. I found out it was indeed breast cancer and I had it taken out in a lumpectomy nearly three weeks ago.”McCall added: “It was very, very small, so I got it very, very early, which is incredibly lucky. But I am so relieved to have had it removed and to know that it hasn’t spread.“My lymph nodes were clear, I didn’t have any removed, and all I’m going to do now is have five days of radiotherapy in January as kind of an insurance policy.”In her post, McCall, 58, paid tribute to medical staff, her family and her partner, the hairdresser Michael Douglas.She said: “I just want to say a massive thank you to everybody at the Royal Marsden [hospital] … all the nurses, doctors who have helped me, thank you for your support.“Thanks to my family, to my brilliant kids, and an extra special thanks to Michael. It’s been a lot. I was very angry when I found out, but I let go of that and I feel in a much more positive place now.”She added: “I think my message is, get checked if you’re worried, check yourself regularly. If you are due a mammogram, then get it done. And I have dense breasts, and I had a mammogram in August, and I was postponing the ultrasound. I just couldn’t find time to do it. Don’t do that.”Last November, thepresenter had surgeryfor a “very rare” tumour. The benign brain tumour, known as a colloid cyst, was found after she was offered a health checkup as part of her menopause advocacy work.‘I wasn’t terrified of dying, but I didn’t want to leave my kids’: Davina McCall on addiction, reality TV and the brain tumour that nearly killed herRead moreIn a tearful interview earlier this year, McCall said the craniotomy, which entailed removing a portion of her skull to extract the tumour, was “the hardest thing” she had endured. In April, she said her benign brain tumour was“not coming back”.The former Big Brother host has long advocated on women’s health issues and has presented documentaries on contraception and menopause.

It’s a fairytale city, not only because of the hilltop castle that overlooks its cobbled streets and half-timbered houses, but also because this is where the Grimm brothers once lived and studied, starting the collection of folklore stories that would eventually become their famous anthology of fairytales. Throughout the city, sculptures – some perched in improbable places – pay homage to this past, forming a mile-long route known as theGrimm Path. It’s very much like a treasure hunt.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But on my visit to Marburg, I had a different type of treasure hunt in mind and, once done with enchanted mirrors and kissy-lipped frogs, headed straight for theSecondHand by DRK(Deutsches Rotes Kreuz – the German Red Cross) to scout for pre-owned items.Whereas once there was a stigma to buying secondhand, nowadays it’s on trend. “Thrifted” has been tagged more than 7m times on Instagram, and accounts such as@charity_shop_lifeand@my.thrifted.abodehave tens of thousands of followers. According toBooking.com’s 2025 travel predictions, “Thrift shopping and vintage stores are becoming a core part of the travel experience, with 73% of travellers having already purchased secondhand items while abroad”. Google data also shows that searches for destination-specific secondhand shopping – “thrifting in Berlin” or “vintage markets in Stockholm”, for example – have skyrocketed.View image in fullscreenRita Brocante et Cantine, a restaurant-cum-thrift store in Marseille.Photograph: Image Broker/AlamyGuides and tour operators haven’t been slow to jump on board either – for £200,Fashion Tours Londonwill guide you around the capital’s secondhand stores for a whole day, whileRed Shed Vintage ToursandGold Crestwill set you loose on a variety of Frenchbrocantes(flea markets).But while curated tours suit some, for me it would dampen the thrill of exploring on my own. There is bounty almost everywhere, of course, but I’ve found France great for rustic kitchen and homewares, Madrid a good hunting ground for vintage designer accessories, while in Venice it’s glassware (there’s a tiny charity shop attached to a church where I almost always find genuine pre-loved Murano glass).The appeal of a tour also depends on how you feel about rummaging with others in tow. For me, it’s a bit like skiing: you don’t want to stop others from having a good time, but nor do you wantthemto affectyourgood time. Personally, when I’m in treasure-hunting mode, I prefer being alone, without someone sighing at my shoulder. I’ll just meet you at the bar later and reveal my finds, OK? “You’re a bit like Oscar the Grouch in the Muppets,” observed one friend. “Happiest alone in the bin.” Well, quite.‘You’re a bit like Oscar the Grouch in the Muppets,’ a friend observed. ‘Happiest alone in the bin’Whatever your MO, it always helps to do some research before you go – get acquainted with the names of the charity shops at your destination; look for Instagram accounts specialising in vintage. Use Google to search for pop-ups such as kilo sales, and in France usebrocabrac.frto look for brocantes calendars in the area you’re visiting – they generally move from location to location each weekend. This worked nicely for me in the summer, when the brass swans I’d been eyeing up one Sunday were still available the following week on the same stall – but in the next town.Google Lens can be helpful, too, in determining whether the item you’ve found is genuine or worth the price being asked. Towns with an ageing population, such as Kraków and Léon, tend to have the best bargains, while capital cities and those with a university will probably have higher prices, due to the number of avid shoppers. And generally speaking, the farther out of town you travel, the better the bargains will be. I also wander the streets surrounding weekend markets as residents often capitalise on the passing footfall to set up their own little garage sales.View image in fullscreenThorvaldsen Plads antique market in Copenhagen.Photograph: HelloWorld Images/AlamyI’ve been buying secondhand since my early teens and it still gives me a dopamine hit: in Germany I stumbled across an ostrich leather handbag for €2, right next to a synthetic Primark one tagged €3.50; in Romania I unearthed a silk Hermès scarf in a bin full of polyester ones; and in Greece I sifted through shelves of books to find a volume of beautiful botanical drawings. An angry rooster jug I picked up for 100 krone (£12) at a market in Copenhagen remains one of my most beloved purchases. Only recently did I discover he was made in Czechoslovakia in the 1930s and that others like him have sold for close to £200 on Etsy (although there’s no way I’m ever selling mine).One of the great delights of buying secondhand abroad is that you’ll uncover items not readily found at home and they make the best souvenirs. The vintage stoneware escargot dishes I nabbed in a market near Biarritz, for example, that now sit on my dresser holding my rings, remind me of that trip daily. I love, also, the interactions that such purchases spark. People on market stalls or in small shops tend to be far more engaging than staff in big chains and this often leads to interesting chats and fun exchanges.Honestly, who could leave a perfect, €10 cashmere coat or Italian leather boots that actually fit?“Non, non, ce n’est pas pour toi!” shrieked a woman, laughingly, at a flea market in Nantes, as I peered closely (too closely, in retrospect) at a small statue, trying to make sense of it, before realising it graphically depicted a sex act. “German,” scoffed the man on the stall in Copenhagen, as I examined a mustard pot in the form of a boy squatting with his pants down (the mustard was dispensed via his bottom).Of course, it’s very easy to get carried away, and you need to be mindful of what you can pack and carry. On a girls’ weekend in Lisbon a few years ago, theHumanasecondhand stores were so full of gems that some serious sitting on suitcases was required for the return journey – but, honestly, who in their right mind would leave an utterly perfect, €10 camel cashmere coat behind? Or a pair of Italian leather boots that actually fit?View image in fullscreenA flea market in central Athens.Photograph: Mario Guti/Getty ImagesThe really impossible items – furniture, huge mirrors and ornate frames – make me sad because even I have to admit there’s no way that chaise longue or antique dressing table can be squeezed into my bag (and where shipping is available, it tends to be from slicker operations with consequently higher prices). It may well be time for a driving holiday – in a lorry. And I doubt I’m the only one with such ideas: on a recent stay at a campsite in France, the noticeboard listed a week’s worth of local brocantes andvides-greniers(“empty attics” or car boot sales).As for the DRK in Marburg? Well, I didn’t strike gold on my own behalf – but I did for someone else. A few years ago, while travelling, I met an Australian woman as keen on secondhand shopping as I am. We’ve stayed in touch and she mentioned recently how much she likes Boden prints. Guess what was hiding on the rails? A blouse in a vibrant green pattern, tick; silk, tick; size, tick; one parcel winging its way to Oz, tick. Proof that thrifting isn’t just good for the planet and addictively fun – it’s a great way to make friends, too.Explore more on these topicsShopping tripsEurope holidaysVintage fashionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Delivery companies charge restaurants obscenely high rates, destroying profit margins, and add even more charges and cost to the consumer. Yes, they’re convenient (itself part of the problem), but I’d rather cook dinner myself and save my cash to eat out once in a while.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.One way I stopped ordering so many takeaways – post-pandemic, during which I orderedfartoo many – was to tell myself that it’s quicker and cheaper to cook something simple, rather than order in. Sometimes, however, we all want something we haven’t cooked ourselves, right? And that’s where curry kits come in. They’re very quick to make up with the simple addition of a few veggies, a can of beans and/or some prawns or chicken from the freezer. OK, there’s still a little washing-up, but that’s a small price to pay.I set out to test tikka masala curry kits, but there weren’t enough on the market, so I ended up working my way through a range of kits instead, including balti and butter chicken. I tried to keep things consistent by making only chicken curries, though of course all these kits can be adapted to be vegetarian or to include seafood or other meat, and I made each one strictly according to the manufacturer’s instructions, without adding any of my own optional extras. Yes, part of the fun of a curry kit is that you can bung in a few ingredients of your own choosing, but some of these kits called for the inclusion of more than two additional ingredients (often expensive ones such as cream), or for odd quantities such as half a pepper (why not just add the whole pepper?). I marked products down a point when these requirements felt excessive.None of the products list any details about the quality or origin of the ingredients, and few brands share sustainability credentials; also, I could not find any organic products in this range. But the overall quality was exceptional, minimally processed and great value – just about every product was restaurant quality, from takeaway to the best on the high street.The best curry kitsBestoverall:The Spice Tailor balti curry kitView image in fullscreen£3.75 for 300g at Morrisons (£1.25/100g)£3.85 for 300g at Tesco (£1.28/100g)★★★★★Three packets (dried spices, including whole dried chilli; curry base; and balti sauce) combine to produce a thick, glossy, brown curry with notable depth and flavour, with cumin, fenugreek and bay standing out.

But since that was published in 2018, I have had a baby,a breakdown, travelled back to Thailand and eaten more massaman curries, all events that have contributed to this new recipe. The old dish is delicious, but in 2025 I didn’t want to make a paste from scratch. Instead, I wanted the funk and soul that a ready-made curry paste could give me and to use that as a springboard to fly into dinner time. A shortcut on time and ingredients, yes, but not on fun and flavour.Massaman tofu and potato curry with rainbow chardNot all vegan fish sauces are equal:Thai Tastemakes a good one.Prep15 minCook45 minServes4Rapeseed oil450g extra-firm tofu, torn into bite-sized pieces4 round shallots(140g), peeled and quartered4 tbsp red curry paste(I useThai Taste)1 tsp ground cumin1 tsp ground cinnamon2 lemongrass stalks, bashed2400ml tinscoconut milk2 tbsp crunchy peanut butter3 large maris piper potatoes(600g), peeled and cut into 4cm x 4cm pieces200g rainbow chard, stalks cut into 2cm pieces, leaves cut into 4cm-wide strips1 tbsp vegan fish sauce, plus extra to serveSliced mild red chillies, to serve (discard the seeds and pith if you prefer less heat)Cooked jasmine rice, to servePut two tablespoons of oil in a large pot on a medium to high heat and, when it’s hot, add the torn tofu and fry it for eight minutes, turning the pieces every now and then, until they’re golden on all sides. Transfer to a plate.Pour three more tablespoons of oil into the same pan and, when that’s hot, add the shallots and fry, stirring, for five minutes, until they soften and take on some colour. Stir in the red curry paste, cumin, cinnamon and lemongrass, and fry, stirring often, for three minutes, to release the aromatics.Pour in the coconut milk, add the peanut butter and potatoes, then bring the mix to a simmer and cook gently for 15 minutes, until the potatoes are tender. Return the fried tofu to the pan, stir in and simmer for five minutes more.Put a couple of tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a medium heat until the oil is shimmering hot. Add all the chard, stir-fry for five minutes until the leaves wilt, then stir through the fish sauce.Pour a few tablespoons of fish sauce into a small bowl and add the sliced chilli.Serve the curry with rice in shallow bowls, with the chard mix spooned over the top and with the bowl of fish sauce and chilli alongside.Join Meera Sodha at aspecial eventcelebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted byNish Kumarand alongside writersStuart HeritageandTim Dowling, withGeorgina LawtonhostingYou Be The Judgelive.
