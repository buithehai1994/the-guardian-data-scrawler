It holds a unique position among member states due to its political, economic and military weight. Which is why the forces that dominate American politics – and who is in the White House – are such decisive factors. Thepresidential election in November 2016was therefore not only important to the US, but also to all of Nato.For the first six months of 2016,Hillary Clinton was ahead in every poll. By autumn, election experts were predicting her victory. I, too, had a gut feeling this would be the outcome. On election night, my wife Ingrid and I arranged a party with friends and colleagues at the residence in Brussels. We rigged up a large television in the living room, and hamburgers were served. A long day lay ahead, so I turned in before midnight.I woke at five and checked my phone.Donald Trump had taken Pennsylvania and Ohio. It still wasn’t 100% certain, but CNN had reported he was going to win. When I came down to our election breakfast at six o’clock, the others were clearly just as surprised as me.I was anxious about what would happen next, because I had noticed how critical ofNatoTrump had been during his election campaign. In a television interview towards the end of March, he had said “Nato is obsolete” – a view that undermined American foreign policy of the past 70 years. Trump received pushback from a number of Republican heavyweights, but it seemed to glance off him. At around the same time, he was asked who he would consult when he needed foreign policy advice. “I’m speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain,” he replied.The American people had elected Trump, and we had to respect that. I wanted Nato to establish a good working relationship with him as quickly as possible, in order to get him and his administration to take a more positive view of the alliance. Within Nato, self-discipline would be necessary. I made it clear exasperated groaning at internal meetings was unacceptable. There would be no eye-rolling at Trump’s tweets or public appearances; no mocking laughter over videos; no jokes about golfing or his mannerisms. Zero tolerance was crucial. Just a small group of individuals poking fun can spread through an organisation and trickle out. And should it reach Washington that Nato staff were sitting around laughing atDonald Trump, it would be ruinous.On Friday 18 November, I got Trump on the line for the first time. “I’m a big, big, big fan of Nato! Great to speak with you, looking forward to working with you,” he said. During our conversation, I was a little shocked that we mostly seemed to agree on the crucial matters. Trump believed the European member states needed to spend more on defence. “On that I completely agree with you,” I said. Fairer burden sharing and increasing defence spending were what I had spent most of my time working on since taking office. Nato needed to be better prepared in the fight against terror, Trump said. “On that I completely agree with you,” I replied again.He also wanted to hear my thoughts on the individuals he was considering for key positions. I was surprised, but I didn’t contradict him.Rex Tillersonfor secretary of state? I knew him a little from the oil industry and from energy conferences in the 90s. “A good choice,” I said.Jim Mattis for secretary of defense? The truth was, the little I knew about him came from the HBO seriesGeneration Killabout the Iraq war, which I had watched with my son: Mattis is portrayed as a mythic figure, a general both feared and admired, who goes by the call sign Chaos. There was a slightly embarrassing pause before TorgeirLarsen, who, as director of my private office, was listening in on the conversation, handed me a note. It said:Jim Mattis is great. He knows Nato.“Jim Mattis is great. He knows Nato ,” I told Trump.After that first conversation, I felt things looked brighter. Like many others, I disagreed with Trump’s views on climate change, abortion rights and trade policy, but the substance of what he had said about Nato in our conversation was something I could work with.Shortly after the election,Barack Obamainvited the incoming president to the White House. It was a conciliatory affair. Trump thanked him for his efforts; Obama said everything an outgoing president should.This, too, I found encouraging. Things are going to calm down, I thought: now the election was over, Trump would be shaped by his new role and its responsibilities. With competent people around him, Trump would become more like his predecessors in the White House.That was the second incorrect assessment I made of Donald Trump.In mid-April 2017, I was at the White House, ready to meet Donald Trump for the first time. I had prepared a few pleasantries about the election victory andMelania, the first lady. The door opened to his office, but no president stood there waiting. Trump lounged casually in a chair.“Come on in, guys,” he said, smiling.When Trump had greeted Japanese prime ministerShinzo Abea few weeks earlier, the handshake lasted 15 seconds, and was so hard Abe winced. Canadian prime ministerJustin Trudeauwas subjected to similar treatment. A little later, French presidentEmmanuel Macronchose to grip so hard, his knuckles turned white. All this had been muchreported on, with some commentators believing Trump was trying to assert his superiority through his handshake and others pointing out he was concerned with his masculine image. Not long before my visit, he had metGerman chancellor Angela Merkel, and refused to shake her hand in front of the photographers. Much was written about that, too.When Trump got up, hand outstretched, I was a little apprehensive. But his grip turned out to be almost disappointingly normal, neither hard nor loose.View image in fullscreenThat handshake: Donald Trump and French president Emmanuel Macron get to grips at a Nato meeting in 2017 …View image in fullscreen… and again, watched by German chancellor Angela Merkel, at a G20 meeting. Photographs: AFP/Getty ImagesWhen the conversation began, however, it quickly became apparent this was going to be extremely loose. We jumped from one topic to the next. Talking about Russia, Trump suddenly exclaimed, “But why can’t you guys in Nato join us in Korea? They’re developing nuclear weapons, and that’s something we can’t accept.”A couple of months earlier, North Korea’s leader,Kim Jong-un, had declared thatpreparations for the testing of an intercontinental nuclear missilewere now in their final stage; this announcement was followed bythe firing of medium-range missiles, which landed in the Sea of Japan. So Trump bringing up North Korea wasn’t completely out of the blue. But I was unsure as to what he meant. Did he want Nato to intervene in North Korea?“Mr President, all the allies are concerned about the nuclear weapons, but I don’t think there will be any support for bombing North Korea,” I said.“But you’rein Afghanistan. Why can’t you be in North Korea?” he replied, before the conversation swiftly moved on. We touched on terrorism and Islamic State, of course, with Trump declaring, “We have to kill them, we have to bomb them, they’re really evil people.”Soon our conversation returned to Russia, and I repeated the points I had been keen to make since taking office in Nato . “We must be strong and predictable, but be open to maintaining a dialogue with Russia. Russia is here to stay. It’s a neighbouring country, not a terrorist organisation that needs to be eradicated, like IS,” I said.Then, as I had done in many other conversations, I referenced Norway’s experiences. “You know, Mr President, as former prime minister of Norway, I know that it’s possible to speak with the Russians.”Trump cast a questioning look. “Are you Norwegian?”I understood why he was asking – over the years I’ve received many heads of organisations myself, and it isn’t always easy to remember where each comes from. I smiled. “Yes, I’m Norwegian.”“Do you know Celina Midelfart?”“Yes, I’ve met her several times. She’s a well-known person in Norway,” I replied.“Nice girl. What they wrote about us in the Norwegian papers – was it good or bad?”I remembered seeing newspaper images of Trump and the Norwegian cosmetics heiress and investor at some sporting event or other, but more than that I couldn’t recall. I had no idea what the papers had said.“Oh yes, the reporting was positive. She’s married to a rich Norwegian now,” I said.“He’s not rich.”So the president of the United States clearly knew who investor Tor Olav Trøim was. But were you rich if you had a few billion kroner to your name? Possibly not, in Donald Trump’s eyes.To the script from which Trump was reading, a few words had been added in thick black marker: ‘MUST PAY’ and ‘NOT FAIR’After about 20 minutes, our private conversation was over. Trump’s advisers and several members of my delegation joined us. I noticed my colleagues looking on anxiously as Trump and I shook hands once more for the photographers. But everyone was cheated out of a potentially amusing anecdote.For Trump, the most important issue was Nato members’ defence spending. I wanted him to take a more positive view of the alliance and had brought along a graph that illustrated spending was increasing. Trump was most concerned with the fact that only five member states had achieved the goal of spending 2% of GDP on defence. I pointed out that several countries were close, and six or seven set to reach the target in the near future. Then there was Iceland: it has no armed forces, so would never spend 2% of its GDP on defence. It was therefore actually five out of 27 countries who had achieved the goal, rather than five out of 28, I said, thinking I may be coming across as rather nerdy with all these figures.But this caught Trump’s interest, if not in the way I had intended. “Then what do we want with Iceland?”Before I could say anything further, Jim Mattis came to my aid, explaining how important Nato’s bases there were for the alliance’s submarines, ships and planes: “Mr President, they’re good to have if you want to track down Russian subs.” Trump thought for a moment. “Well, then we’ll let Iceland stay a member,” he said.In Nato, we never roll out the red carpet – we roll out a blue one. On Thursday 25 May 2017, we rolled out an extra-long, extra-wide bright blue carpet, all the way from the main entrance to the road leading to Nato HQ. The blue was reflected in the colour of our flag, which symbolises the Atlantic Ocean, around which the alliance is gathered. Everything was ready for a grand ceremony with Nato heads of state and government in attendance.On this day, President Trump would make his first appearance at a Nato summit, and we would also be inaugurating the alliance’s new headquarters. While I was looking forward to leading the proceedings, I also felt somewhat apprehensive. Following our meeting in the White House some weeks earlier, uncertainty as to how Trump really viewed Nato had arisen again.Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treatyis Nato’s collective defence clause and represents the very core of the alliance: one for all and all for one. Trump had refused to offer a clear “yes” to the question of whether the US continued to stand behind this assurance, despite persistent questioning by the press. “Why should we protect countries that aren’t willing to pay for their own security?” Trump had said. This made many of the allies uneasy. The way they saw it, Trump was reducing Nato to little more than a protection racket.After exchanging a few pleasantries, the plan was to take Trump to a place where the text of Article 5 is carved into the wall, so photographs of the two of us could be taken in front of it. I had intended to offer Trump a few facts about the new building and Nato, but his constant questions kept cutting me off. “Do you really need such a big headquarters?” he asked. “What do you need all these people for?”I replied that while the organisation itself isn’t that large, member states’ delegations also use the building – it makes it easy to meet with security measures in place, and everyone uses the same cafeteria. I told Trump who had designedthe headquarters: architects Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, who also designed theTrump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago.“I know those people. They’re extremely expensive,” Trump exclaimed. “I don’t understand why you chose those expensive architects. Extremely expensive!”In front of the main entrance, a small avenue of newly planted trees had been constructed, with lawns on either side. On one of these stood a twisted steel girder from the Twin Towers in New York; on the other, a couple of segments of the Berlin Wall. Two testaments to some of the most momentous events in Nato’s history. I introduced Angela Merkel as a speaker by reminding everyone that she had been living in Berlin not only when the wall waserected in 1961but also when it wastorn down in 1989and Europe changed for ever.“Each day, all those who enter this building will pass this memorial. They will understand that freedom will never be defeated. And Nato will always defend the values on which our alliance is founded,” I said. Merkel expressed her gratitude for Nato’s presence during the cold war and said the fall of the wall symbolised that democracy wins out, even after many years of struggle.View image in fullscreen‘All the leaders wore grave expressions. Everyone understood things were on the brink of collapse’: the 2018 Nato summit.Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesThen it was Trump’s turn, standing before a piece of the mangled remains of the Twin Towers. The memorial’s full name is the9/11 and Article 5 Memorial, to emphasise how it symbolises the solidarity within Nato. I introduced Trump by stressing this unity. “Nato’s greatest strength is the enduring bond between North America and Europe. We saw the strength of that bond after the9/11 attacksagainst the United States,” I said.“And President Trump,” I continued, “those attacks struck at the heart of your own home town, New York. And for the first time, Nato invoked our collective defence clause, Article 5. One for all, and all for one.”I had teed up the shot for him. All Trump needed to do was highlight Nato ’s efforts when the United States was attacked, and reassure everyone present that the same would apply to them should they ever need help.Trump began by speaking at length about the threat of terrorism. This wasn’t so strange – just three days earlier, on 22 May, a suicide bomber hadattacked the city of Manchesterin the United Kingdom. Trump condemned the attack, which had killed 22 people and injured hundreds. After this, he touched on the threat represented by Russia.But then came the accounting accusations. “Twenty-three of the 28 Nato nations are still not paying what they should for their defence,” Trump said. “This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States.”On the previous day, we had privately been handed a copy of the speech the president would give. It was excellent, with all the important points covered, including the Article 5 obligations. But somewhere along the way, Trump must have chosen to give a different speech than the one that had been prepared.As I stood beside him, I was able to glance down at the script from which he was reading. A few words had been added in thick black marker: “MUST PAY”, “NOT FAIR” and “2% is the absolute minimum!” He had clearly crossed out certain things and added others, to amplify the message. Here he was, dedicating the 9/11 and Article 5 Memorial, yet he hadn’t said a word about Article 5.One Friday in the summer of 2018, a couple of weeks before the Nato summit in Brussels, I was due to speak with Trump by telephone. It was a call he had requested, and as we had recently met in Washington, it wasn’t clear why he had asked to speak to me again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The economy was running in high gear, despite the fact that he’d been handed a country in ruins. But he hadn’t called me to brag. Defence spending, and the sharing of the financial burden between Nato ’s member states, was what he really wanted to talk about.“Germany is paying 1%! It’s shocking.” According to him, Merkel was in trouble.I told Trump she was working to increase Germany’s defence budget, but as leader of a coalition government, it wasn’t always easy to reach a consensus. Trump cut me off. “Migration is the big problem. It was a terrible decision.” He was referring to all the refugees that had fled to Germany during Europe’s refugee crisis.Then he returned to the defence budgets. Spain was spending less than 1% of GDP on defence. King of Spain Felipe VI had just made a state visit to Washington, and been received at the White House.“They were here and they said, ‘Thank you for the military protection.’ But Spain’s economy is good. This is very unfair.”Trump had recently met with Merkel, too, and told her things simply couldn’t carry on the way they were. “I said, ‘Angela, you have to cough up. You need to spend 2%.’ She said, ‘Maybe in 2030’ – and she laughed as she said it … She laughed!”He said the United States was spending 4% of GDP on defence, and covered 80-90% of Nato’s expenses. “And we’re not doing it any more. We’re gonna pay what Germany pays.”By the end of the call there was no mistaking Trump’s warning: “Look, if we leave, we leave. You need Nato, desperately. We don’t need Nato.”If the United States withdrew, the alliance would be dead. Trump had made me responsible for its possible dissolution. He wanted me to set things straight before the summit. And the summit was 12 days away.“Nato is important, but it’s way more important for Europe than the United States,” Trump said when the summit convened in Brussels on 12 July 2018. “American presidents have come here and said this for years. Then they’ve gone home and nothing has happened. It’s only gotten worse. I have great respect for Angela. My father was born in Germany. My mother was born in Scotland. So in a way I’m part of the EU. But this has to stop.”Some of the things he said were clear warnings. “The US doesn’t need Nato. Why should I continue to pay for this organisation when I don’t need it?”There was silence around the table. Trump continued to talk at length about the trade imbalance with the EU, another hobby-horse. “The EU sends its BMWs and Mercedes into the United States, almost tariff-free. It can’t go on like this. It won’t go on like this.”Then came more criticism of Europe. “The borders you have are terrible. Angela has said many of the people streaming in are young men. That doesn’t sound good. They might be enemies,” Trump said. “I have great respect for Europe. I have great respect for the secretary general, who has managed to bring in more money. But it’s very little compared to what we need … You have to pay your share. Angela could pay 2% today, if she wanted to! Instead she says 1.5% by 2025!”‘We have to talk about this now,’ Trump reiterated. ‘Otherwise – you know, otherwise, we’re not going to be friends’Trump then moved on to the other allies. “I don’t want people leaving this meeting saying everyone was happy. I am not happy. You could have made me happy. When a rich country doesn’t pay, it’s because they’re trying to trick us, the way they tricked every single president since Reagan. You have to pay. Two per cent is so little. It’s a joke! You need to aim for 4% if you want proper protection. Either you pay 2% immediately, or by January 1st. Otherwise, we’re going to ... do our own thing. We have no choice. And as you already know, I really disagree with this building. Three billion dollars for a building like this! It’s ridiculous! The United States is paying! It’s a beautiful building, but a single shot from a tank and this building will collapse.”When Trump finished speaking,Angela Merkelstood up, came around the large meeting table and leaned over me. “We have to respond to this,” she whispered. “We can’t just let it pass.” It was clear she feared the meeting might end up spiralling out of control. I nodded.We took a break of a few minutes. I conferred with Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Dutch prime ministerMark Ruttein a corner, while Trump sat close by, his arms crossed, speaking with his security adviserJohn Boltonand secretary of stateMike Pompeo. We agreed it was out of the question to change the 2% goal, but discussed how we could best handle the situation and pacify the president. My staff were also in contact with colleagues, trying to establish a way forward.When the meeting resumed, Trump reiterated his demand for immediate promises of increased spending. “We have to talk about this now. Otherwise – you know, otherwise, we’re not going to be friends,” he said.Then, finally, it came, the moment I had feared since our conversation 12 days earlier, when Trump had said the United States would only continue to be a member of Nato if Germany and the United States paid the same.“I’m leaving this meeting. There’s no reason for me to be here any more,” Trump said.Now everything’s going to fall apart, I thought. I looked around the room. All the leaders wore grave expressions. Everyone understood things were on the brink of collapse – the entire summit, all the declarations of agreement. If an American president says he no longer wishes to defend the other allies and leaves a Nato summit in protest, then the Nato treaty and its security guarantee aren’t worth very much.This might be the meeting at which Nato is ruined, I thought. And it’s happening on my watch. The alliance had managed to operate successfully for 70 years – but not after 12 July 2018.Angela Merkel expressed what many were thinking. “We have to take this back to our parliaments and national assemblies,” she said. “We aren’t able to make the decisions here. I will fight hard to meet the 2% target in 2024. But I simply don’t have the majority for anything more than that right now.”View image in fullscreenTrump and Stoltenberg at a Nato working dinner  in 2017.Photograph: Matt Dunham/AFP/Getty ImagesThen Trump did something that rarely happened at such meetings. He interrupted another head of government. “That’s too long,” he said. “Way too long.”But Merkel kept speaking, using an expression we often heard from Trump. “I have to say that I don’t feel I’m being treated fairly here. You speak frankly, Donald, so I will do the same. Germany is the second largest contributor of forces to Nato. 9/11 and Afghanistan are the only time Article 5 has ever been invoked. This has contributed to protecting the United States, despite intense opposition in my country, where many asked what Afghanistan has to do with us. Germany can do more, and we can probably do things better. But now we must stick to the commitments we have made.”Everyone agreed the member states would increase their defence budgets to 2% of gross domestic product. But the problem was that Trump insisted on it happening this year. The other nations set the goal of achieving the target in 2024, something that had also been adopted in the summit declaration the previous day.Trump took the floor again, rattling off how much each member state spent on defence as a percentage of GDP as if he were announcing the Eurovision song contest results. “Belgium: 0.9. That’s less than 1%. Croatia – oh, I’m so disappointed in you, I can’t believe it: 1.26%. You must feel rotten,” he said, searching for the relevant leader with his eyes. “Estonia: 2%. Thank you! France: 1.79. Not bad, Emmanuel. Not bad for you. You haven’t been president long enough, it’ll probably go down. Germany: 1.2. Come on, Angela! Come on!”He went on. Until finally: “United Kingdom: 2.1. Thank you. That’s very good. United States: 4.2% of the biggest gross domestic product of all. So you may as well call us idiots. But I haven’t been at this party very long. How stupid is this? That’s all.”He leaned over towards British prime ministerTheresa Mayand said something. Then he turned toRecep Tayyip Erdoğan, the president of Turkey, who was sitting on his other side, and high-fived him.Several other leaders spoke. Some sympathised with Trump’s demand for immediate increases in spending, while others were as reserved as Merkel and Macron.Then I gave the floor to Mark Rutte. This was no accident. He and I had met for lunch in The Hague a week before the summit, where we had discussed how we could get Trump to support Nato, including by pointing to the fact that defence spending had increased by $33bn.“Mr President, you have urged us to spend more, and I agree with you,” Rutte said. “And that is exactly what we are doing. Last year, we spent $33bn more on defence because of your leadership. So this is good news for you.”Trump liked this.Thirty-three billion.He nodded.After a while, he took out the thick black marker he always used, jotted something on a sheet of paper, then handed it to me. His handwriting was neat and rather attractive. The note said: “Secretary general, if you can say the Nato allies have significantly increased their defence spending thanks to me, I think we can agree.”I finally glimpsed an opportunity to bring the meeting home. I took the floor myself.“At the press conference after the meeting, I will state that the Nato allies have significantly increased their defence spending thanks to President Trump’s leadership and clear messaging,” I said, practically reading straight from his note. Then I added, “And at the same time, that all member nations remain committed to Nato and to Article 5 of the treaty.”‘He has trouble completing a thought’: bizarre public appearances again cast doubt on Trump’s mental acuityRead moreI hoped against hope this would be enough to bring the meeting to a close in a way that was acceptable to everyone. The problem was there were still 12 leaders remaining on the list of speakers. If I allowed the debate to start up again, it seemed extremely likely that at least one of them would say something that irritated Trump, causing the fragile consensus to be broken. I therefore looked pleadingly around the table, at Merkel, Macron, May, Trudeau, Erdoğan and all the others, and suggested something highly unusual – that we move to stop the discussion now, with everyone in support of my proposed conclusion. “Can we agree?” I asked.There were nods around the table, and for a moment I thought both the day and Nato were saved. But no. Lars Løkke Rasmussen, prime minister of Denmark, raised his hand and made it known that he was not going to withdraw his name from the list of speakers.Løkke Rasmussen, a cheerful and down-to-earth Dane whom I liked very much, began cautiously, saying something about the importance of us standing united in difficult times, and agreeing it was important to share the financial burden fairly. Then he fixed his gaze on Trump and paused. “But sharing the burden isn’t just about money, Mr President. It’s about blood and sacrifice. Denmark is a country of only five million people, and we have lost 45 soldiers in Afghanistan, in a response to an attack on the United States.”He had clearly had enough. His voice shook as he said, “By population, Denmark has lost more soldiers in Afghanistan than the United States.” He refused to look their families in the eye and say their loved ones’ lives mattered less because Denmark hadn’t met the 2% target.The episode reminded me of a scene inLove Actually, where Hugh Grant, playing the British prime minister, stands up to the American president. But this was no movie – it was reality. I realised it was right that Løkke Rasmussen had been permitted to speak. Still, I held my breath when he was done.Trump stayed quiet. Everyone understood they were at a historic meeting, and several leaders now wished to become part of the story by taking the floor, but I wasn’t going to allow them to speak. The meeting was over.Trump held his press conferenceimmediately after. “The United States’ commitment to Nato is very strong, remains very strong, but primarily because everyone – the spirit they have, the amount of money they’re willing to spend, the additional money they will be putting up has been really, really amazing to see it. To see the level of spirit in that room is incredible,” he said.He also brought up the $33bn. “The allies will spend at least $33bn more, in addition to what we previously agreed. We are more united than ever. No problem.”To this day, I remain surprised at how Trump accepted the summit’s conclusion. Had he made good on his threat to leave in protest, we would have been left to pick up the pieces of a shattered Nato. I think he realised he was banging his head against a wall with his demands of immediate budget increases, but at the same time, he departed Brussels convinced he would have more money by the new year.When I met him at the UN headquarters in New York a few weeks later, he smiled, satisfied. “Is the money still coming in, secretary general?” he asked.“Mr President, the money is flowing in,” I replied.This is an edited extract from On My Watch: Leading Nato in a Time of War by Jens Stoltenberg, published by William Collins on 23 October at £25.

Would you make a good spy?I honestly believe I would be a total disaster, because I do love to gossip. I would be going: “You know that guy? I think he’s working for the Russians.” I went to Russia in 1990 to make this wonderful film, The Assassin of the Tsar, and it was still very closed, even though it was glasnost and Gorbachev was in power. I was driving with my wife to the next location to Vladimir, which is an old capital of Russia, and we went past these missile silos. I turned to my wife and said: “If we’d have been doing this a year ago, we’d have been shot for seeing this. I think they’re all pointed at America.”It has been suggested by conspiracy theoriststhat Stanley Kubrick directed the moon landings. Are you disappointed that he cast Neil Armstrong instead of you?No. I’d be better off playing Louis Armstrong! It’s been put about that he directed the moon landings, which … well, we now live in a world of fake news. It’s so incredible, the bullshit. The AI on YouTube is mindboggling, isn’t it? I suppose it could have been anyone in that spacesuit. One of my favourite Kubrick movies is2001. It’s a masterpiece. It’s one of those films that, when you first see it, you think: what the hell was that? It’s very poetic. Stanley could control the astronauts because they’re hidden in spacesuits. He could get away with anything because he hated ceding power to an actor.William Dalrymple: ‘If I ever want to show off to a nephew, I tell them about being shot at’Read moreWho is your favourite other Malcolm?There aren’t many others. It’s strange. I’m quite pleased it’s not too common, but I do like [Canadian journalist and author] Malcolm Gladwell.How did you get Rupert Murdoch’s Aussie accent right when you played him in 2019’sBombshell?By listening to the gentleman many times. It’s interesting because he’s an Aussie via London landing up in New York, so he’s got a bit of everything. I don’t usually copy somebody, but I had to on this. They even gave me the same great jowls as him. It was fun doing it, even though I’m only in it at the end. It’s really powerful, because you are all waiting for Murdoch.View image in fullscreenMalcolm McDowell as Rupert Murdoch (centre) with Ben and Josh Lawson as Lachlan and James Murdoch in Bombshell.Photograph: Lionsgate/Hilary Bronwyn Gayle/AllstarWould you rather die at the bottom of the ocean or deep out into space?The choices are really not that marvellous, are they? I think I’ll go for space.You’re a big fan of antique shops. What’s been your best and worst purchase?Worst – Jesus, there’s too many of those. I’ve been lucky on occasion. I bought a gilt tin eagle out of the back of a car. Massive thing. The wingspan was four and a half feet. There had been a pair of them on top of the governor’s mansion in Sacramento, where Nancy Reagan and Ronald Reagan had lived. I bought it for US$3,000. An antiques dealer came in and said: it’s worth $350,000. But it’s only worth it if you sell it. It’s in my living room. It ain’t going anywhere.Do you have a party trick?No. I’m not a party guy, really. The dinner party culture that we had in London is the one thing I really miss. We’d have wonderful dinner parties where you discuss movies, politics, whatever, and it could be quite forceful and passionate. Everything is in a car in the US, so you tend not to do that and say: “I’ll meet you at this restaurant.” When you are out in public, you’ve got to behave to a certain extent. You can’t have a screaming row: “Don’t be ridiculous. Where the hell do you get that idea? I mean, your brains are up your ass” or whatever. You can’t do that, which you can when you’re in somebody’s house.Do you have a nemesis?I don’t think so. It’s funny though, when you start off, who is your competition. In my case, it was [fellow English actor] Michael York. Somebody would go: “You know he got $200,000 for that.” “What? I’m getting paid £90 a week!” Then in my late 30s, early 40s, I’d bump into him: “Ah! Michael. Hello! How are you? What are you doing? Nice to see you.” And you’re affable. When you’re over 80, it’s: “Jesus! Michael! We survived, darling! How great! You’d be great in that part. Why don’t you play it?”What’s the most out-of-date item in your fridge?Well, my wife’s been in Mexico and I’ve got three sons. There are things going many shades of green at the back of my fridge, which I don’t even look in. I take out stuff that’s been shoved in, and if you actually look inside, it’s probably slightly moving.What’s been your most cringeworthy run-in with another celebrity?I sat next to, what’s her name – at a Peet’s Coffee, and kept thinking: “God, I vaguely know this woman.” She kept looking at me and smiling. I thought: “Young girls don’t do that to me that often. Not any more.” She’s in that huge English thing with Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Her name is in the title.Bridget Jones!Thank you.So Renée Zellweger.Yes. I thought: “Jesus. That’s weird.” I didn’t even put together who it was until I got home with my coffee and thought: “Oh my God, it was Bridget Jones. How stupid of me.” She smiled a few times, obviously looking for a way in to start a conversation. She’s a brilliant actress. I think she’s wonderful. I felt such an idiot.The Partisan is out in UK cinemas now, with Australia and US release dates to be announcedExplore more on these topicsMalcolm McDowell10 Chaotic QuestionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maria Ressa, joint winner of the Nobel peace prize, is a Filipino and American journalist who co-founded the news website Rappler. And Rory Stewart is a British academic and former Conservative MP, writer and co-host of The Rest Is Politics podcast. Their conversation ranged over the rise of AI, the crisis in democracy and the prospect of a Trump-Putin wedding, but began by considering a question central to all of their work: how to live a good life in an increasingly fragmented and fragile world?YNHPeople have been arguing about this for thousands of years. The main contribution of modern liberalism and democracy was to try to agree to disagree; that different people can have very different concepts of what a good life is, and they can still live together in the same society, agreeing on some very basic rules of conduct. And the challenge was always that people who think they have the absolute answer to what is a good life try to impose it on others, partly because, unfortunately for many ideologies, an inherent part of the good life is attempting to make everybody live it. And even more unfortunately, in many cases, it seems that it is easier to impose it on others than to do it ourselves. If we take the original crusade in medieval Christian Europe, you have all these people who can’t live a Christian life of modesty and compassion and love your neighbour, but they are able to travel thousands of kilometres to kill people and try to force them to live according to these principles. And what we are witnessing in the world right now is more of the same.RSAt the heart of that observation is this extraordinary idea, which, broadly speaking, is called liberalism. It is an idea that became very powerful, particularly by the 19th century, and found a new form after the second world war. We’re the heirs of that: it assumed things like a rules-based international order; an idea that we would agree how we behaved, state to state; it had an idea of democracy at its heart. And of course, that idea of democracy has a lot of the ingredients that Yuval is talking about, which is tolerance, human rights – how you protect the minority from the views of the majority. And there was an extraordinary period that probably lasted until the mid-2000s where it really seemed possible that this was the natural destination of humanity. And then things began to come off the rails. Now we find ourselves in a world where almost every bit of the model has entered its shadow form. So instead of focusing on democracy, we’re in a world dominated by authoritarian populism. Instead of a world of free trade, we’re in one that’s increasingly about protection and tariffs. Instead of a rules-based international order, we’re in a world of isolation: the strong do what they can, the weak must suffer what they must. And all this, of course, is then reinforced by social media and increasingly by AI.We are now creating a superintelligence, and there is every reason to think that it will be super deludedYuval Noah HarariMRThe biggest question we have today is whether impunity will reign, because it’s clear from what is happening in the physical and virtual world that an international rules-based order is not working. How do you live a good life when big tech is using surveillance for profit, to manipulate us in order to keep making more money? Now we’re individually targeted by technology that can go to the cellular level of every democracy.All five major world religions say that the battle that matters in order to live a good life is the battle inside yourself: your better self versus your worst self. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you; it’s a simple thing. But how do we maintain these values when the very way we connect with each other is corrupted?YNHWhat is new in the current situation is that we now have the technology to hack human beings and manipulate the inner battle in a way that was simply impossible in the middle ages or even in the 20th century. Big corporations, and anybody wielding this new technology, can both decipher and also manipulate human desires and thoughts in a way that is unprecedented. And liberal democracy, as it was constituted in the 18th and 19th century, really doesn’t know how to deal with it.RSThere’s also the possibility that technology begins to overshadow us. If you think about civilisation, a lot of it traditionally was about these great figures, these role models, these heroes. And what is a hero? Somebody who stretches the limits of what it means to be human. We believe we are this extraordinary species who can do things in science or poetry or drama that no other species can do. The risk of artificial general intelligence is that suddenly it is quite literally superhuman. At that point, if it can effortlessly write a poem better than I can, create a play better than I can, suddenly we are diminished.View image in fullscreenYuval Noah Harari.Photograph: David Vintiner/The GuardianMRIt would be great if the technology that is enabling this transformation is actually 100% accurate. It is not. But because we’ve grown up with integrity of information, it’s much easier to fool us, because when you see it in writing, you expect it to be right. The way AI has been pushed in our society is completely separate from facts. And I know Yuval in his book says information is not about facts, it’s about the stories we tell, but facts anchor our shared reality.A question I would like to ask you guys: do you think people are fundamentally good or fundamentally evil? I sound super religious in this conversation, but really that makes a difference, because what we’re doing now in the public information ecosystem, part of the breakdown of democracy, part of our ability to elect illiberal leaders democratically, is because we’ve muted the goodness of humanity. I’ve covered the crappiness of humanity, of people killing each other, I’ve been in war zones, but I’ve also been in these areas where a natural disaster happens and people are incredibly generous. We would not have survived the six-year presidency of Rodrigo Duterte if there were not people who gave not just of themselves, but gave money to Rappler. So I think this is what’s at stake.I’ve been in war zones. But I’ve also been where a disaster has happened and people are incredibly generousMaria RessaYNHOne of the most important observations is that goodness is not closely related to intelligence. Artificial intelligence is the most important technology of the era; it has been forgotten that intelligence is no guarantee of goodness or even of wisdom, that when you look at the grand span of human history, you don’t see a clear correlation between intelligence and compassion, or even a clear-sighted view of reality. Homo sapiens is by far the most intelligent species on the planet, and it simultaneously is the most deluded species: humans believe the kind of nonsense that no chimpanzee or elephant or rat would ever believe. We are now creating a superintelligence, and there is every reason to think that it will be super deluded.RSYuval is unusual because he is capable of considering the possibility of where we might be in 200 years. But let’s try 20 for a second. When we think about the world, often we think about it from Silicon Valley, and we imagine that really the future is Star Trek, and Elon Musk is off to Mars. For most, perhaps half of humanity, over the next decades to come, hundreds of millions will be living on incomes of under $2 a day, and billions under $5 a day.The next thing is that conflict is changing. We can see with what’s happening in Gaza and to some extent in Ukraine, the way in which wealthy countries with technology can inflict astonishing damage on their neighbours and take very little risk themselves. Added to that, there is a push towards an arms race happening all over the world. So if we look at Europe, we’re now increasing our spending on defence to 5% of GDP. That will literally suck hundreds of billions of euros every year out of our health systems, our education systems, our welfare systems, at exactly the moment that our economies are flatlining and our populations are getting older, so there’s every likelihood that over the next 10-20 years, at the same time as AI is developing, much of the world will begin to feel like a shabbier, poorer version of the current world, that median incomes will stagnate and that conflict will rise.View image in fullscreenMaria Ressa.MRI completely agree with what Rory said, but I’m more pessimistic. I don’t think it’ll take 20 years. The Philippines gets an average of 20 typhoons every year. We’re watching islands sink, and yet the west is debating whether climate change even exists.I think the death of journalism is around the corner within six months to a year. The internet is getting worse by the day, and there are absolutely no guardrails put in place, even as news organisations are being forced to pay for that, and our content is exploited. It is a very predatory online world, and that has translated to the world we live in.YNHIf I had to characterise the emotional tone of what I have been doing for quite a number of years, I would say that I was in the business of anxiety – that I’m creating more anxiety around AI, climate change, whatever. Now we need to switch to a different project, which is to rebuild trust, because when there is too much anxiety and you can’t trust anybody or anything, you can’t do anything. The most important thing is to rebuild trust in human institutions, in the media, in government, elsewhere. The big question is, how do we do that?Government is much worse than I could ever have imagined – the whole thing has become a gameRory StewartRSI would say that that involves rebuilding those human institutions. My experience as a politician is that government is much worse than I could ever have imagined. Liz Truss, my boss and colleague, who became prime minister in the United Kingdom, basically thought that her job was Instagram and campaigning, and she dedicated very little time to any serious consideration of policy, and in fact was derogatory of people who worried too much about the real-life impacts of what she was doing. The whole thing has become a game.MRHow long will we pretend that there is integrity of elections as the world falls off the cliff? Part of what made the international rules-based system work was that we had a powerful anchor for it: that we did what was for the greater good. We expected leaders to pull back from their greed. And if they didn’t, journalists would expose these things. Now that the US doesn’t seem to care about any other country but itself, what will that mean? Does that mean that we throw away every value system that was built into the international organisations? If the most powerful only work for themselves, is it every person for themselves?View image in fullscreenRory Stewart.Photograph: Christopher Owens/The GuardianYNHYou see a re-emergence, in a strange way, of monarchist ideas: the leaders that are rising now are quite different from the 20th-century dictators. It’s not a coincidence that, in the US, one of the movements against Donald Trump is “No Kings”, because he is reviving something really medieval. One of the most amazing moments of the last year was the meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy in the White House. One of the things that emerged very clearly was that Trump does not think about politics as being an interaction between states or between people, in the sense of the American people, the Russian people, the Ukrainian people. He thinks about it as an interaction between persons, monarchs, dynasties. When people told him that Putin had broken previous agreements, Trump said, “Well, he broke an agreement with Biden, he broke an agreement with Obama, not with me.” And the implication is, the agreement is not between Russia and the US, the agreement is between two people, and if I make an agreement with Putin, I will make sure he sticks by it, but it only holds as long as I’m president. If you then replace me with someone else, that’s the end of the agreement. You see the return of the concept of politics as a dynastic affair between families. This is a bit crazy, but not too crazy, to think, for instance, of a solution to the Ukraine war where Barron Trump would marry Putin’s granddaughter, and they would get Crimea and Donbas as their kingdom.If you want the truth, and you want reality to win, each of us has to do some of the hard work ourselvesYuval Noah HarariLet me just say one more thing about this monarchical idea: in the 20th century, dictators served an ideology which, in a way, limited them, because if you’re, say, a communist dictator, you have to promote a communist ideology. You can’t really do what you want. With the new leaders like Trump, there is no ideology there. When you look at somebody like Trump or like Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, the amazing thing is how much freedom of action these people have.RSOne thing that is so striking about the modern age is that we’ve lost an ethical vocabulary in engaging with leaders. I mean, fundamentally, what is Donald Trump? He is shameless. It would be very difficult for Aristotle or Cicero or a Renaissance theorist of politics, or indeed the writers of the American constitution, to imagine this degree of shamelessness, this degree of contempt for constitutions, contempt for minorities, contempt for the truth, the open performance of immorality. And very difficult also to imagine that we would have entered a world where we, at some level, are so tempted to just enjoy the spectacle, and have just lost the ability to be shocked that every day he does three or four things which in the old world would have shocked us to our core.MRWith Zelenskyy at the White House, it was shocking that the breaking news reporters just kept repeating what President Trump said, which was a lie. They could instead have used what is known as a truth sandwich: “Russia invaded Ukraine, President Trump says this, Russia invaded Ukraine.” In journalism, we have to shift: we can no longer stand behind “he said, she said”. Now we actually have to pull up and say, “This guy is lying.” Because those are the facts. So our reporting shifts. On the technology, we cannot live under surveillance for profit, we cannot keep getting manipulated in this way, because it encourages the worst of who we are. [At Rappler] we began to build a chat app two years ago. Our vision is for a global information ecosystem, but we anchor our news organisations with our communities. So this is how we move forward: we embrace the technology. We call it out where it is wrong. We look back at our history, and regardless of all of the problems of democracies, we still haven’t found a better system than this. Of course, it could all end soon, but we keep fighting.YNHI think that more people need to realise that we have to do the hard work ourselves. There is a tendency to assume that we can rely on reality to do the job for us. That if there are people who talk nonsense, who support illogical policies, who ignore the facts, sooner or later, reality will wreak vengeance on them. And this is not the way that history works.So if you want the truth, and you want reality to win, each of us has to do some of the hard work ourselves: choose one thing and focus on that and hope that other people will also do their share. That way we avoid the extremes of despair.Explore more on these topicsBooksPhilosophy booksPolitics booksSociety booksClimate crisisSocial mediaYuval Noah HararifeaturesShareReuse this content"

With premium products from the best small producers, you do often gain traceability to the farm, speciality bean varieties and a complexity that rivals that of the finest wines. However,much like coffee, dark chocolate also has a strong mid-range of well-certified products that also deliver on taste. That’s why supermarket own-brand speciality ranges are my usual go-tos, especially when the packaging states origin and ethical certification.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.We’re pretty fanatical about chocolate in our house, so much so that I had to hide this week’s set of samples to stop us eating them all before I’d finished the tasting. Considering our steady diet of dark chocolate, I take comfort inrecent studies published in Naturethat found that flavonoid-rich foods – including dark chocolate, berries and tea – may support a longer, healthier life. For this reason, I usually eat 80-100%-cocoa dark chocolate, because it hits the spot without triggering sugar cravings; for most people, however, a 70% cocoa content provides the perfect balance between sweetness and intensity.I run chocolate meditation workshops and tastings to explore the importance of terroir and biodiversity in single-origin chocolates, not least because the biodiversity and growing conditions of cacao profoundly affect its flavour, nutrition, aroma and even appearance. While genetics play a role, fermentation and drying techniques, along with each region’s soil, climate and altitude, also contribute to distinct regional flavours. For these tastings, I pinch my nose initially to focus on texture, then release it and let the chocolate melt and fill my mouth with flavour. This meditative approach helps highlight the nuanced terroir that distinguishes truly great chocolate.Most chocolate is made from cocoa mass, or processed cocoa beans, ready to beconchedand tempered. High-value bean-to-bar chocolate is different, though: the beans are roasted and processed entirely in-house, which gives the chocolatier full control and often produces a more distinctive product. Personally, I dislike too much vanilla in my chocolate, especially when it’s an artificial flavouring, because I find it can overpower the natural aromas. Some dark chocolates also contain emulsifiers such as sunflower or soya lecithins to improve texture and prevent separation. They’re generally safe, but I do think they interfere with the chocolate’s natural flavour and texture.The overriding question, though, is, can you really taste the difference between a £2.10 bar and a £3.99 one?

Windsor Great Park announced an exclusion zone of about 60 hectares (150 acres) of previously publicly accessible land to accommodate the latest home of the Prince and Princess of Wales and their three children.View image in fullscreenThe Prince and Princess of Wales with (from left) Louis, Charlotte, and George on December 2024 in Sandringham, Norfolk.Photograph: Victoria Jones/Rex/Shutterstock“Due to the pending designation of part of the Great Park as a Socpa (Serious Organised Crime and Police Act exclusion area), access via Cranbourne Gate will permanently cease on Monday 29 September 2025. As a result, Cranbourne car park will be permanently closed from 7pm on Sunday 28 September 2025,” the park management announced.Inan interviewthis week with the Canadian actor Eugene Levy at Windsor Castle for the Apple TV+ series The Reluctant Traveler, William spoke of his desire to protect his family from the press intrusion that he and his brother had experienced as children. Prince George, 12, Princess Charlotte, 10, and Prince Louis, seven, did not have mobile phones, he said.William said of the “insatiable” media he experienced growing up: “They wanted every bit of detail they could absorb and they were in everything, literally everywhere. They would know things, they’d be everywhere.“And if you let that creep in, the damage it can do to your family life is something that I vowed would never happen to my family.”Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroomed Grade II-listed Georgian mansion, has been chosen by the couple as their “forever home”. Not all locals are happy, especially those who regularly use the area now closed off by a 2.3-mile perimeter no-go zone.map of Windsor“To the people who lose it, it’s a big loss. There are so many houses they could have chosen, why choose one where the public has to lose such a big chunk of the park for their private benefit,” said Tina, who declined to give her surname. “I am very upset.”She added: “I do think it’s outrageous, the way it was done. I think it’s a selfish act.”There is a lot of deference to the royal family in these parts. Some, indeed, believed the royal family owned the Great Park, Tina said. Today about half of the land is private and half publicly accessible.View image in fullscreenThe Grade II-listed Forest Lodge in Windsor Great Park during restoration work in 2001.Photograph: John Stillwell/PARoyal links stretch back to approximately 1070 to William the Conqueror, who used the area as a hunting ground and built a residence here.

The park, and Forest Lodge, is now owned by the crown estate, a public body whose revenues go to the Treasury. “Which means it belongs to you and me,” said Tina.The Waleses are relocating from four-bedroomed Adelaide Cottage four miles away. They also have 10-bedroomed Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate, 21-roomed Apartment IA in Kensington Palace, London, and Tam-Na-Ghar cottage at Balmoral which was given to the prince by the Queen Mother.Kensington Palace and the Home Office declined to comment when approached by the Guardian, on the grounds they never discuss security matters. A royal sourcehas previously saidthat in recent years the couple have lived through “some really difficult times” at Adelaide Cottage. With Catherine in remission after her cancer diagnosis, the move would afford them a “fresh start and a new chapter” and allow them “to leave some of the more unhappy memories behind”.While some people in Windsor, including on Facebook, have expressed their frustration, others are more sanguine. One dog walker, Tom Bunn, a mechanical engineer who walks his dog in the park about twice a month,told the Sun: “I completely understand the safety of William, Kate and their family is paramount so we should make sure they can live happily here.”Windsor Great Park has said parking will remain available at Ranger’s Gate car park, “located just down the road”. But for dog walkers it is not the same, as the route crosses roads and a village and would mean dogs being on and off lead. “At the moment I can walk off the lead all around the Cranbourne Gate, that’s the joy of it,” said Tina.View image in fullscreenThe Prince of Wales being interviewed in Windsor by the actor Eugene Levy.Photograph: Ian Gavan/AppleTV+/PAA spokesperson for Windsor Great Park said: “A security boundary is being introduced by the Home Office and Thames Valley police in a small area of Windsor Great Park to support enhanced protective measures.

We sort of had it before this happened, but now even more – on average we are about £15,000 less than a UK boarding school and our students get their own rooms. There is a market and it is getting bigger by the month.”The school, which is a nonprofit, charges fees for day pupils ranging from €12,500 a year for early learning to secondary school fees of up to €18,700 a year. The cost with boarding included is advertised at under €49,000 (about £42,000) for the first year.“This academic year, British parents are even more interested,” Perfect added. “Traditional boarding school fairs are now looking to invite more European schools because they have been asked: ‘are there alternatives?’ These are fairs that would normally be completely British.”The addition of VAT to school fees was a Labour party manifesto commitment at the 2024 general electionfirst. Ministers said the revenue would be used in part to recruit an additional 6,500 teachers for state schools.The move was met with a wave of legal challenges,though they were overruled by the high courtthis summer.Many private schools initially cut fees slightly to shield parents from the immediate rise, but on average they have risen by 22.6% compared with last year, according to analysis by the Independent Schools Council (ISC). The average fee per term for a UK day school stood at £7,382 in January, the ISC found, compared with £6,021 last year, meaning about £22,100 for a year’s fees.Some parents tried to avoid the VAT charge by paying fees before the increase, buttax experts have said that money could be clawed back by HMRC.Perfect said: “We are mainly hearing from the ‘lower tier’ parents who were struggling with the costs, who are now looking for affordable alternatives with the same price if they had a scholarship.”View image in fullscreenThe International School of Bremen in Germany is more competitive in terms of fees in a growing European market.Photograph: imageBROKER/ShutterstockTom Shennan-Barker, the senior head of admissions at St George’s International school inSwitzerland, said rises in fees were adding to a growing wave of interest among wealthy British parents looking to educate their children abroad.“In the last two years, we’ve seen more families actually taking the leap and moving into the area, either on the shores of Lake Geneva or to nearby mountain villages,” he said.St George’s fees for its senior school range from 31,400 Swiss francs (£29,319) to 48,250 francs (£45,056) a year for day students.“We’ve also seen students transferring out of top, well-known UK schools to become boarding students, trying to achieve a balance between a world-class education and the exceptional opportunities that the Swiss outdoors has to offer,” Shennan-Barker said.Growth in the market for international education is drawing in huge investors: this week, the private equity group CVC struck a deal to buy a 20% stake in an international schools group that valued it at €7bn.The International Schools Partnership (ISP), which operates more than 100 schools in 25 countries, is worth more than three times what it was four years ago, according to the Financial Times, which first reported on the deal.Meanwhile, Brighton College, one of the leading private schools in the UK, is preparing to open schools in Spain and Italy as it seeks to cater to affluent families leaving the country.The independent school, which, following the introduction of VAT, charges its senior school day students in the UK up to £12,647 a term, is opening schools in Madrid, Rome and Lisbon from September 2027 for boys and girls aged 13-18, with admissions opening from January 2026.It has also said that it was considering a school in Milan, a popular destination for former UK residents who have claimed non-dom status. In the city, they can opt to pay a flat tax rate of €200,000 (£174,558) to avoid Italian tax on overseas earnings.The number of Italian children at British private schools with parents living in the UK fell 11% from 1,372 in January 2024 to 1,223 in January this year, according to a census carried out by the Independent Schools Council. The number of Spanish students fell by 13% from 1,402 to 1,220.However, the number of US pupils with parents living in the UK increased from 4,367 to 4,728 over the same period. Those from China grew from 4,551 to 4,701.Eva Ghewij,the director of admissions at Beau Soleil, an international boarding school in Switzerland, added that the introduction of VAT on private school fees in the UK had prompted many parents to reassess the value they were getting from Britain’s educational system.“It has made parents think about any other options – they get inspired by other countries and think: why not elsewhere?” she said.“Legacy-wise, people were just automatically sending their children to the same school they went to but now there is a bit more variety out there.”Beau Soleil charges annual fees for boarding and tuition of 132,390 Swiss francs (£123,644) for its grades 6 to 10 (11- to 16-year-olds), rising to 143,390 francs (£133,925) for its grades 11 and 12 (16- to 18-year-olds).“We have just over 300 students and 62 nationalities, and each year we see movement, with some countries are a bit more active than others,” Ghewij added.“This has just planted a seed in people’s minds there are other options out there as well.”Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Our concentration should be on keeping people safe at a time when the country is on heightened alert from a terrorist attack. And instead officers are being drawn in to facilitate these relentless protests.View image in fullscreenPolice move a protester.Photograph: Anna Gordon/The Guardian“And we are coming under attack for doing so. How can this be right?“She added: “There aren’t enough of us. Hard-working police officers are continually having days off cancelled, working longer shifts and being moved from other areas to facilitate these protests.“We are emotionally and physically exhausted. What are politicians and senior police officers going to do about it?”The organisers, Defend Our Juries, previously said they expected the turnout to be higher than previous protests, with more than 1,500 people planning to attend, potentially beating an arrest record set at the 1961 anti-nuclear demonstration, which was held at the same London location.The demonstration went ahead despite Keir Starmer calling on protesters to call it off to“respect the grief of British Jews”, while Jewish figures called the action“phenomenally tone deaf”after Thursday’s killing of two people in the terror attack on a Manchester synagogue.In Manchester a demonstration by GM Friends of Palestine to mark the second anniversary of the start of the conflict saw hundreds of people gather.View image in fullscreenManchester for Palestine co-organiser John Nicholson.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianJohn Nicholson, a campaigner for the group, said increased tensions since the fatal attack on a synagogue in the city had led to some choosing to stay at home.“The genocide hasn’t stopped, so why should we?” he said. “If the bombings had stopped for a week, if food and medicine had been allowed to go into Gaza for a week, we may have taken a week off. But they haven’t, so we won’t.”Nicholson denied the claim that the march was a way of intimidating Manchester’s Jewish population, saying that Jewish people regularly attend the weekly meetings, and that the marches are meant to target policies and governments, not individuals.“We are not targeting any member of our community, least of all our Jewish community. It is targeted at Trump, at Starmer and at Netanyahu, who are war criminals and who must be held accountable,” he said.The demonstration ended outside the central library where it joined another group of Palestine activists who were reading the names of all the people killed in the past two years in Gaza. The reading, which was done in order of the ages of the deceased from youngest to oldest, began at 7am and, by the time the march reached it at about 1.45pm, still had not finished the names of toddlers.View image in fullscreenA vigil for the children killed in the conflict in Gaza outside Manchester central library.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianIn London, one protester, Trudy Warner, a retired social worker from London, was holding a sign reading “Police find your love, find your conscience.”She said she was focusing on the police because they were able to take action as individual officers and not participate in the mass arrests.“I would love to think they could learn from us about the power of collective action and walk away instead of doing this because it’s unconscionable. It’s actually unconscionable.”A Buckinghamshire couple, Larry and Sue, were holding a sign with a tweaked message in support of “Plasticine Action”.“About eight policemen came and they read me my rights and said I was being arrested under the Terrorism Act and they were about to take me away so I sat on the floor. And when they were bending down to take me away one of them noticed that it says something else and they had to let me go.”During the interview with the Guardian, a police officer approached them.“Sir, can I take your sign please?” the officer said, before realising it did not express support for Palestine Action. “I’m dyslexic!” she added.“I’m totally fed up with what is happening in Gaza,” said Larry. “Everybody that is not raising their voice to this is somehow slightly complicit in letting our government support this.”View image in fullscreenLarry from Buckinghamshire.Photograph: Anna Gordon/The GuardianThe Metropolitan police also said officers arrested six people in connection with a banner draped on Westminster Bridge in support of Palestine Action.The force said: “Officers were quickly on scene, the banner had been removed and the six people involved have been arrested for supporting a proscribed organisation.”Responding to Keir Starmer’s suggestion that the action should not go ahead, a Defend Our Juries supporter, Zoe Cohen, who was arrested at the August action and is Jewish, said: “Those who have used the attack on the Jewish community in Manchester to call for today’s vigil to be cancelled are wrongly conflating the actions of the Israeli state with all Jews. Jewish people around the world are not responsible for Israel’s crimes and there are many Jewish people who do not support the actions of the Israeli state. Cancelling today’s vigil would have perpetuated this dangerous narrative which fuels antisemitism.”She said if there was a strain on policing resources on Saturday, the blame lay with the government. If the protest had been cancelled, it would have been “letting terror win”.Cohen added: “When I was brought up learning about the Holocaust and we said ‘never again’, I learned that this means ‘never again’ for anyone.”Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Italians and Spaniards marched in Rome, Barcelona and Madrid against Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in a massive show of growing international anger over the two-year war.The protests on Saturday in Spain were planned weeks ago while those in Italy followedanger over Israel intercepting a humanitarian aid flotilla.Explore more on these topicsProtestMetropolitan policePoliceLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The proposed “removals force” will be tasked with deporting 150,000 people a year in a move to tackle illegal immigration.Badenoch will say that the taskforce would be given £1.6bn and “sweeping new powers” if the Conservatives win the next election. This would include the ability to use facial recognition technology without warning to help identify those eligible for removal from the UK.Under the plans, the taskforce would be expected to “work closely” with the police. Officers would be required to conduct immigration checks on everyone they stop or arrest, Badenoch is expected to add.The Guardian view on Conservative party conference: Kemi Badenoch’s last shot at relevance | EditorialRead moreBadenoch will say that the Ice model has proved to be a “successful approach” in removing migrants who have illegally entered the US. Ice removed nearly 200,000 people in the first seven months of Trump’s second presidency, US media reported. However, it has also facedwidespread criticism, both for arresting legal migrants and allegedly targeting people on the grounds of their race.Immigration is expected to be a key theme of this year’sConservative conference, which begins on Sunday. The removals force is understood to be a cornerstone of a new “borders plan”, which Badenoch will announce to delegates in Manchester.Analysis of Home Office figures by the PA news agency shows 34,401 people havecrossed the Channel in small boatsso far this year. This means 2025 is on course to break records for the most arrivals in a single year.Badenoch will say: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders. That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”She is also expected to announce a radical overhaul of the asylum system as part of her borders plan. She will propose granting refugee status only to those who have been directly threatened by a foreign government. Those who have escaped conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion and sexuality will be excluded, Badenoch will say, adding that “few” people would qualify for asylum under the tightened rules.She also wants to abolish immigration tribunals, with decisions instead taken directly by the Home Office. There would be limited rights of appeal, which would apply only in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority, it is understood.The plans would also deny legal aid to those fighting immigration cases. Badenoch is expected to say that lawyers have “defrauded” the UK by “coaching” applicants. Badenoch will argue there is “no need for lawyers” as people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The identity of the flags are unknown.In an email sent by the Swedish foreign ministry to people close to Thunberg, and seen by the Guardian, an official who has visited the activist in prison said she claimed she was detained in a cell infested with bedbugs, with too little food and water.“The embassy has been able to meet with Greta,” reads the email. “She informed of dehydration. She has received insufficient amounts of both water and food. She also stated that she had developed rashes which she suspects were caused by bedbugs. She spoke of harsh treatment and said she had been sitting for long periods on hard surfaces.”“Another detainee reportedly told another embassy that they had seen her [Thunberg] being forced to hold flags while pictures were taken. She wondered whether images of her had been distributed,” the Swedish ministry’s official added.The allegation was corroborated by at least two other members of the flotilla who had been detained by Israeli forces and released on Saturday.“They dragged little Greta [Thunberg] by her hair before our eyes, beat her, and forced her to kiss the Israeli flag. They did everything imaginable to her, as a warning to others,” the Turkish activist ErsinÇelik, a participant in the Sumud flotilla, told Anadolu news agency.Lorenzo D’Agostino, a journalist and another flotilla participant, said after returning to Istanbul that Thunberg was “wrapped in the Israeli flag and paraded like a trophy” – a scene described with disbelief and anger by those who witnessed it.Thunberg is among 437 activists, parliamentarians and lawyers who were part of the Global Sumud flotilla, a coalition of more than 40 vessels carrying humanitarian aid whose goal was to breach Israel’s 16-year maritime blockade ofGaza.Between Thursday and Friday, Israeli forces intercepted all the boats and arrested every crew member onboard. Most of them are being held at Ketziot, also known as Ansar III, a high-security prison in the Negev desert used primarily to detain Palestinian security prisoners, many of whom Israel accuses of involvement in militant or terrorist activities.In the past, activists detained by Israel were not criminally prosecuted and instead their presence was treated as an immigration matter.According to lawyers from the NGO Adalah, the rights of the crew members have been “systematically violated”, activists denied water, sanitation, medication and immediate access to their legal representatives “in clear breach of their fundamental rights to due process, impartial trial and legal representation”.The Italian legal team representing the flotilla confirmed those detained were left “for hours without food or water – until late last night”, with the exception of “a packet of crisps handed to Greta and shown to the cameras”. Lawyers also reported instances of verbal and physical abuse.During a visit to Ashdod on Thursday night, Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was filmed calling the activists “terrorists” as he stood in front of them.“These are the terrorists of the flotilla,” he said, speaking in Hebrew and pointing at dozens of people sitting on the ground. His spokesperson confirmed the video was filmed at Ashdod port on Thursday night.Some activists were heard shouting: “FreePalestine.”Ben-Gvir has previously called for the activists to be jailed rather than deported.After their arrest, the flotilla’s legal team expressed concern over the treatment the crew members might face, particularly those who had previously been detained by Israeli authorities after attempts to break Gaza’s naval blockade. This marks the second time Thunberg has been arrested alongside other flotilla members, after a similar attempt earlier this yearended with the activists’ arrest and deportation.Baptiste André, a French doctor who was on one of the boats of the flotilla in June,told reportersupon his return to France that he witnessed Israeli border agents mock and deliberately deprive passengers of sleep, in particular Thunberg.The Swedish official said in the email that Thunberg was asked by Israeli authorities to sign a document.“She expressed uncertainty about what the document meant and did not want to sign anything she did not understand,” reads the email. The Swedish ministry’s official wrote that Thunberg has had access to legal counsel.Adalah said in an earlier statement about the legal process that although Israeli authorities would have a record of repeat participants in aid flotillas, activists, such as Thunberg, were generally treated in the same way as first-time participants, subject to short-term detention and deportation.The Guardian contacted the Israel Prison Service, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israeli ministry for foreign affairs but none have yet responded to a request for comment.The Swedish foreign ministry said its embassy officials had visited nine detained Swedes on Friday: “The Swedish embassy in Tel Aviv remains in contact with Israeli authorities to stress the importance of swift processing and the possibility of returning home toSweden. Based on discussions with detained individuals, the importance of addressing individual medical needs was also emphasised.“Moreover, the embassy stressed that food and clean water must be provided immediately, and that all detainees must be given access to Israeli legal counsel, if desired.”The Israeli embassy said the allegations were “complete lies”. “All detainees from the Hamas-Sumud provocation were given access to water, food and toilets; they were not denied access to legal counsel, and all their legal rights, including access to medical care, were fully upheld.“Israel is and will remain a state governed by the rule of law, committed to upholding the rights and dignity of all individuals in accordance with international standards,” it said.Explore more on these topicsGaza flotillaGreta ThunbergIsraelGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaSwedennewsShareReuse this content"

Army radio reported that operations in Gaza would be reduced to “the minimum” with troops meant only to carry out defensive strikes.The orders came as the US president, Donald Trump,demanded Israel stop bombing Gazalate on Friday night after welcoming Hamas’s part-acceptance of his proposal to end the nearly two-year war in Gaza.Despite Trump’s demands, Israel continued striking theGazaStrip and besieging Gaza City on Saturday.View image in fullscreenPalestinians set off northwards from Nuseirat camp on Saturday.Photograph: APA Images/ShutterstockAt least six Palestinian civilians, including two children, were killed in Israeli strikes on a house in Gaza City and a tent housing displaced people in al-Mawasi. Drones also targeted a gathering of people near a bakery in central Gaza City, killing “dozens” of people, according to Wafa, the Palestinian news agency.Israeli military Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned residents not to return to northern Gaza or Gaza City, where Israeli troops are still operating, in a post on X on Saturday morning.What’s in Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza?Read moreHamas agreed to release all 48 remaining hostages and surrender governing power of the Gaza Strip, while calling fornegotiations on other parts of the proposal. Trump said that based on Hamas’s response, it was ready for peace.The office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Friday that Israel was committed to ending the war in Gaza. After Trump’s approval of Hamas’s acceptance, the prime minister will face pressure to implement the plan, which met withwidespread approval internationallyand in Israel.View image in fullscreenPeople inspect the damage in a residential neighbourhood of Gaza City on Saturday.Photograph: Ebrahim Hajjaj/ReutersIsraeli opposition politician Yair Lapid said on Friday night that the Trump plan was a “genuine opportunity to release the hostages and end the war” and that he would back Netanyahu politically to engage in further negotiations to finalise the deal.Israeli negotiating teams have been instructed to prepare to resume talks today to implement the first part of Trump’s plan, according to Israeli media.While many details of the plan and its final implementation remained unclear, momentum seemed to be building towards reaching a deal. The positive statements by bothHamasand Trump indicated that the possibility of an end to the war in Gaza was closer than in recent months, though previous ceasefire efforts have collapsed in the negotiation phase even with significant momentum behind them.A senior Hamas official told Agence France-Presse on Saturday that Egypt was organising a conference for Palestinian factions to decide on the postwar future of the Gaza Strip, which Hamas had outlined as the way forward on the Trump plan.Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a hardline militant group aligned with Hamas, said it was onboard with Hamas’s response to the Trump plan. In a statement, PIJ said Hamas’s reply “represents the position of the Palestinian resistance factions”.The support of PIJ, which holds Israeli hostages, is a key signal that Hamas has the backing of other militant groups within Gaza to move forward with the Trump plan.Trump’s 20-point plan calls for an immediate end to fighting in Gaza; the release of the remaining 48 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza within 72 hours in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian political prisoners; the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza; the disarmament of Hamas and a transitional authority of the strip led by Trump himself.The plan also called for a surge of aid to Gaza, parts of which are undergoing famine due to an Israeli blockade on the territory, and the reconstruction of the devastated strip.View image in fullscreenPeople line up for food at Nuseirat camp. Parts of Gaza are experiencing famine.Photograph: APAImages/ShutterstockHamas’s reply to the Trump plan notably did not mention anything about laying down arms, an issue that presumably will have to be resolved in future negotiations.The Trump plan is largely seen as unfavourable to Hamas. Israel, in turn, has to give few concessions. However, Palestinians in Gaza are desperate for an end to fighting after nearly two years of devastating bombing, hunger and displacement.Israel’s war in Gaza has killed at least 67,074 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000 according to the Gaza health authority, which says the majority of those killed were civilians. Israel launched the war after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.A UN commission of inquiry, as well as the world’s leading association of scholars on genocide, have concluded that Israeli has committed genocide in Gaza. Israel denies the claim, saying it has only acted in self-defence.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineIsraelHamasMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

He is expected to put the country on a course away from supporting Ukraine and towards Hungary and Slovakia, who have taken a pro-Russian path.With the votes from almost 98% of polling stations counted by the Czech statistics office, Babiš’s ANO (YES) party captured 35% of the vote, followed by the pro-western coalition of the prime minister, Petr Fiala, with 23.0%.The coalition defeated Babiš in the 2021 election.The two-day election filled 200 seats in the lower house of the Czech parliament. A group of mayors known as STAN, also a member of Fiala’s government, received 11.1% of the vote, with another ally of Fiala, the Pirates party, getting an 8.7% share.Babiš, a self-proclaimed “Trumpist”, was all smiles and hailed the “historic result” as “the absolute peak” of his political career. Voter turnout for this election was high, at almost 69%.As Babiš’s ANO did not win the overall majority, the 71-year-old is expected to be invited to lead talks in forming a new coalition. He has already ruled out cooperation with any of the parties that have been in the government after the 2021 election.His potential partners include the fringe parties Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD), an anti-immigration party that won 7.9% of the vote, and a rightwing group called the Motorists, which received 6.8%.He may need to form an alliance with both parties to be able to hold the overall majority. “We will definitely lead talks with the SPD and the Motorists and seek a single-party government led by ANO,” Babiš said.During its election campaign, ANO advocated for increased welfare spending and a reduction in foreign aid, including donations to Ukraine. It also promised higher wages and pensions, and lower taxes and tax discounts for students and young families – all in hope of ending austerity.An ally of the Hungarian leader, Viktor Orbán, Babiš has teamed up with a number of far-right parties in the Patriots forEuropegroup in the European parliament to challenge the mainstream direction of Europe’s policies, including decarbonisation.Explore more on these topicsCzech RepublicEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

This is terrorism, which the world has no right to ignore,” Zelenskyy wrote.Moscow has stepped up its airstrikes on Ukraine’s railway infrastructure, hitting it almost every day over the last two months.Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in its war in Ukraine, although many thousands have been killed by its military.In a video interview from a train en route to the strike site, the CEO of Ukraine’s state rail company Oleksandr Pertsovskyi told Reuters the drones had targeted locomotives, but had also damaged the carriages attached to them.“In essence, they are hunting for locomotives,” he said, adding that Russia was increasingly deploying this tactic.He said the trains hit had been a local commuter service and another train headed to the capital, Kyiv.The rail boss said there was only civilian traffic at the station. He said he believed this was an attempt to make areas like Shostka, about 50km (30 miles) from the Russian border, unsafe for passenger traffic.“They are doing everything to make frontline and border areas uninhabitable, so that people are afraid to go there, afraid to board trains, afraid to gather at markets, and so that students are afraid to return home.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Together with John Phelan, a Trump mega-donor who was confirmed as navy secretary in March, Harrison had reportedly sought to limit the influence of the navy undersecretary, who typically has a key role in managing that military branch’s budget.The Pentagon confirmed Harrison’s departure in a statementto Politico, which first reported it.Veterans react to Hegseth’s ‘insulting’ address to generals and admiralsRead more“He will no longer serve as Chief of Staff to the Secretary of the Navy,” it said. “We are grateful for his service to the Department.”Harrison’s firing comes days after Hung Cao, a former naval officer who ran for Senate as a Republican last year,was confirmedas navy undersecretary.Politicopreviously reportedthat Harrison and Phelan, who had no prior military experience before being appointed, had reassigned several top aides who were supposed to help Cao adjust to his role. According to Politico, that move was intended to reduce the influence of the undersecretary’s role.Harrison’s departure comes after months of upheaval under Hegseth.In May, he ordered the military to cut 20% of its four-star generals and admirals, while Hegseth and Trump have fired more than half a dozen top generalssince January.

The parent company has provided financial backing to several controversial Chinese technology firms including Sense Time, a pioneering facial recognition startup.In 2018, Investcorp International announced its “debut” investment inChina, pledging up to $150m (£112m) to the China Everbright new economy fund. The fund was designed to support the Chinese technology sector and promised “huge opportunities” for investors in the advent of AI. The China Everbright Group is an asset manager that is ultimately controlled by the Chinese government.One beneficiary was Sense Time, whose surveillance technology is used by the Chinese police. Investcorp International is understood to retain a small financial stake in the company.Human rights groups have accused China of carrying out mass surveillance on the Uyghur population in its northwestern Xinjiang province. More than a millionUyghursare believed to have been detained in a large network of “re-education” camps. In 2019, Sense Time filed a patent for a facial recognition device that it said had the ability to pick Uyghur Muslims out of a crowd.Although the company denied that the technology was used to discriminate against Uyghurs, the US imposed sanctions on Sense Time in 2021. The Biden administration said it was banning American investment in the firm because it was developing programmes that could “determine a target’s ethnicity, with a particular focus on identifying Uyghurs”.Earlier that year, British MPs voted to declare that the Chinese government was committing genocide against the Uyghur population, although Nigel Adams, the then Asia minister, said the government’s position was that it was a matter for the courts to determine. Beijing condemned the declaration and said MPs had “cooked up” the motion to discredit China.Fuller, the MP for North Bedfordshire, has held several roles at Investcorp Securities, some pre-dating his first election to parliament in 2010. However, he was only expected to consult Acoba when he wanted to rejoin the firm after leaving government.His current post earns him £25,000 a year on top of his parliamentary salary, according to the public register of MPs’ financial interests.Fuller said in a statement: “I returned as an adviser to the venture capital business in April 2023 following approval from the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. This was included in my register of interests in the usual way.“The venture capital group I advise is part of a much wider group, Investcorp. The funds I advise are solely focused on investments in European technology businesses.“At no time have I played any role at, or had any dealings with, either the China Everbright new economy fund or their portfolio company Sense Time.”Acoba is being wound down and will be disbanded this month after criticisms that it is “toothless”. Its functions will be transferred to a range of other government regulators.It is understood Acoba was not normally tasked with investigating the wider business activities of companies for which former ministers planned to work. It was supposed to consider whether a post-ministerial appointment could give rise to “public concern”.Acoba’s response to Fuller did not mention the Investcorp group’s documented links to Sense Time or suggest it had considered this when advising on the appointment.Its letter acknowledged a “risk” that Fuller’s “network and influence” could be used to assist Investcorp Securities unfairly. It added that in his government role Fuller may have had “access to general sensitive information which could benefit a range of organisations”.However, it said that these risks could be appropriately mitigated by a range of factors, including the fact Fuller’s time in the Treasury was brief. It noted that Fuller had not met with Investcorp Securities while in government. It advised Fuller he could take up the post on the condition that he did not use privileged information he had accessed or lobby the government on the company’s behalf for two years.A government spokesperson said: “We are committed to establishing the right structures to uphold the highest standards in public life. In July we announced a series of reforms, including forthcoming changes to the business appointments system.”A Sense Time spokesperson said the company “strongly opposes the unfounded designations and accusations made against it” by the US government and “regrets being caught in the midst of the geopolitical landscape”.The Investcorp group declined to comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Many railway lines and roads were closed and ferry services were disrupted amid high winds with gusts of more than 100mph recorded in some exposed areas.View image in fullscreenPart of the M77 was flooded in Kilmarnock, Scotland, on Friday amid Storm Amy.Photograph: Jeff Holmes JSHPIX/ShutterstockIn London, all eight of the city’s royal parks, including Hyde Park and Richmond Park, were closed on Saturday because of strong winds. A statement on the royal parks website said: “Due to severe wind gusts caused by Storm Amy, all of the royal parks, plus Brompton Cemetery and Victoria Tower Gardens, will be closed on Saturday 4 October.“This closure includes all park roads and cycleways, cafes and kiosks, park sports venues, the Serpentine lido and boating lake, and the royal parks shop.” It said opening times on Sunday would be delayed because of safety inspections.Storm Amy is expected to cause more problems for Scotland on Sunday after travel disruption, power cuts and floods.The north of Scotland will face a new amber warning for damaging winds with gusts of more than 90mph in some areas.Most of Scotland, apart from the east coast, will be covered by a yellow warning for rain while a yellow wind alert will be in place across the UK.A new record for the deepest area of low pressure in the UK for October has also been set. Storm Amy showed central pressure of 947.9 hectopascal (hPa) at Baltasound, Shetland. The previous record was 950.9hPa in 1988.Further travel disruption is likely to follow after several flights, rail and ferry services were cancelled.A building collapsed in Glasgow on Friday, falling on to a car, and leading to road closures in the city centre.Power cuts were also reported in the Highlands and a number of islands – the areas facing some of the worst weather.Fraser Wilson, from the Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks, spoke on BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme, where he said the network was working to restore power on Saturday morning.He said that 100mph winds had affected power, and while some people had their power restored there were still thousands without.He said: “Work will continue this morning to get 62,000 people reconnected. We expect, because of the extent of damage to the network and conditions we are still going to be facing today, that this will take some time, [but] this storm is not over by any means.”View image in fullscreenA car drives through a flooded park next to the sea on Friday during Storm Amy.Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/ReutersRoad closures also affected drivers and the Forth Road Bridge was shut to all traffic.The Tay Road Bridge reopened early on Saturday with a 30mph speed restriction but remained closed to high-sided vehicles, as were the Skye Bridge, Queensferry Crossing and Clackmannanshire Bridge.Scotland’s CalMac ferry operator said it expected many services to be disrupted over the weekend, with many routes cancelled.The Scottish government urged people to delay travel if they could and to check ahead if heading out.On Sunday, the north, north-east, Orkney and Shetlands islands will also continue to fall under a yellow warning for wind until 9am that morning.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But have crowds always been badly behaved, or is antisocial behaviour getting worse?Rory CarrollSat 4 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Oct 2025 05.05 EDTShareTheabusehurled at Europe’s golfers in the Ryder Cup elicited gasps and dismay on both sides of the Atlantic. The crowd at the Bethpage Black course in New York graduated from boos and heckles to homophobic slurs and insults aimed at players’ wives. The first-tee master of ceremonies set the tone by leading a chant of “fuck you, Rory!”, putting Rory McIlroy firmly in the crosshairs – along with his wife, who was hit with a beer cup.After initially playing it down, American golf officialsapologisedand said some fan behaviour had “crossed the line”, but the affair has left a nagging sense of unease. What if the line has in fact moved? What if accepted codes of crowd behaviour have changed?It is a question social scientists and event managers have been asking in recent years and spans several countries and types of spectacle, obviating any sense that the issue is confined to US golf fans.View image in fullscreenNew York state park police watch the crowd at the Ryder Cup tournament on the Bethpage Black golf course.Photograph: Lindsey Wasson/APTaunting banners brandished at football terraces, gum spat at tennis players, objects hurled on to concert stages, heckles during concerts – an apparently never-ending litany of boorish, loutish behaviour fills news feeds.“It’s undeniable that in all aspects of public life a growing number of people are becoming more belligerent,” saidKirsty Sedgman, a University of Bristol cultural studies scholar.“It’s not just that people are becoming more badly behaved, it’s that when they’re called out, instead of simmering down they’re much more likely to turn against those making the complaint.”Last week the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Communications and Theatre union (Bectu)published a surveythat showed 34% of those working in live events in the UK had experienced antisocial behaviour, violence, aggression or harassment from audience members in the past 12 months, with that figure rising to 77% for front-of-house staff.PGA of America president belatedly admits US Ryder Cup fans ‘crossed line’ with abuseRead moreSome theorists of crowd psychology attribute aggression to “deindividuation”, whereby a sense of anonymity and sensory overload untether people from their sense of individual identity and they do things they ordinarily would not.Other theorists posit “convergence”, in which the crowd dynamic uncorks individuals’ inner beliefs and values.Either way, the results can be ugly. “Faggot!” some US fans screamed at McIlroy. “Wanker!” shouted others. Many commentators have linked such invective to toxic social media feeds and the climate of political polarisation, which suggests a modern phenomenon.But there is nothing new in sports fans or theatre audiences behaving badly. In ancient Athens, Plato complained about spectators becoming mobs, arguably making him the first theorist of crowd behaviour.Any gathering of humans, in fact, can cause upset. Thomas Hardy took the title of his novel Far From the Madding Crowd from Thomas Gray’s 1751 poem,Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, that railed against the “ignoble strife” of those who disrupt “sacred calm”.Today’s anxiety over the coarsening of crowd behaviour can be overdone and is to some extent “moral panic”, said Sedgman. “Each society has golden-age thinking – looking back to a time when everyone was kind and courteous.”View image in fullscreenPlastic beer cups lie on the pitch after the Uefa Euro 2024 match between Croatia and Italy in Leipzig.Photograph: Dan Mullan/GettySome Scottish boxing fans still squirm over memories of a crowd booing Muhammad Ali during an exhibition bout at Paisley in 1965. “All booing must stop when the king’s in the ring,” he exhorted in vain.Eric Cantona took more direct action in 1995 when a Crystal Palace fan shouted “fuck off back to France you French motherfucker” by leaping over the barrier todeliver a kung fu kick.Some experts question whether modern manners really have degraded. “The headlines tend to come from high-profile incidents: disorder at Wembley, gate-rushing at the Copa América final,” said Anne Marie Chebib, the managing director of the UK Crowd Management Association (UKCMA). “Yet the data tells us these are exceptions. The overwhelming majority of events take place safely and securely, with no disruption, but those stories rarely make the news.”In a 2023 poll of the association’s members, 93% reported deteriorating behaviour but the following year 57% reported no change or only a slight worsening, a pattern replicated in aGlobal Crowd Management Alliancereport. “Many practitioners now see behaviour as broadly stable,” said Chebib.View image in fullscreenDiogenes the Cynic (c412-404BC to 323BC) challenges Plato in the academy at Athens.Photograph: AlamyStephen Reicher, a University of St Andrews psychology professor and an authority on crowd behaviour, said there were perennial fears about the rowdiness and danger of crowds but that violence was extremely rare.Of 49 million attendances at British football matches last year, there were 1,963 arrests, of which half were disorder, he said. “You would likely get far more arrests if that many people of that demographic were in town of a Saturday afternoon. So you could argue that people are less likely to be disorderly and violent in a football crowd.”However, crowds make news only when there are disturbances, said Reicher. “You can have hundreds of games on a Saturday afternoon and violence at one. So which will be reported? And if we only see crowds when crowds are violent we get a highly distorted view of crowds as characteristically violent.”The Ryder Cup’s history and uniqueness suggest other reasons not to extrapolate too much from the scenes at Bethpage Black. The 1999 contest at Brookline, Massachusetts, was marred by abuse likened to a bear pit. McIlroy asked security officials to expel a particularly obnoxious heckler at Hazeltine in Minnesota in 2016.View image in fullscreenEric Cantona delivers a kung fu kick to a Crystal Palace fan in 1995.Photograph: Action ImagesThe tournament is structured around the US versus Europe at a time that Donald Trump is reconfiguring the meaning of Americanism, said Reicher.“It affirms the new world against the old. It is about triumphalism, about domination, about success by any means necessary. It rejects a rule-based order. It celebrates masculinity, domination excess.“The Ryder Cup shows the traction it is getting among at least some Americans. We cannot suppose from that it is relevant to all sports or even all golf.”Mark Breen, the strategic director ofSafe Events Global, a company that advises on security, said swift action can shape crowd behaviour.“It’s about knocking bad norms on the head early, or establishing good ones,” he said.“Normal, decent people will get caught up in some behaviours so maybe you throw out the first hecklers, make an example of the worst offenders. But you don’t want to sterilise the sport, take the passion out of it.”View image in fullscreenFans watch Wet Leg play the Other stage at Glastonbury. ‘You don’t want to take the passion out,’ say crowd security experts.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockAdding concerts and other events as adjuncts to sporting occasions complicates the balance, said Breen. “When you’re building a festival vibe, it’s harder to manage social norms. You just have to work as hard as you can to avoid boorishness.”John Drury, a social psychology professor at the University of Sussex, said music event organisers had reported deteriorating audience behaviour since the Covid pandemic, to the point it was now normalised.One possible explanation was that lockdown restrictions stunted socialisation, said Drury. “You’ve got a cohort of people that weren’t socialised by older generations when they’re going out, so they’re not used to it, and so perhaps don’t know what the norms are. What they’re doing feels right to them, but to other people it doesn’t feel right.”Another possible factor was audience members doing stunts to get attention on social media. In most cases it was just a tiny minority causing disruption, said Drury. “But these dramatic events are then presented as a kind of trend in audiences.”Sedgman has a more ominous analysis. Audience behaviour is a bellwether of wider societal trends and the apparent growth in loutishness, or lack of consideration, shows a fraying in the social contract, of the agreed norms that bind a society, she said.“An increasing number of people think they don’t need to follow these norms, that only mugs do so. It’s the canary in the coalmine.”"

On Tuesday, the ADL deleted its entire Glossary of Extremism, a flagship project which contained more than 1,000 entries on groups and movements with connections to hateful ideologies. The move failed to quell the backlash.The fury against the ADL this week has placed the 112-year-old organization in a difficult position. It has faced years of internal turmoil as well as accusations it has attempted to appease theTrump administrationand Musk at the expense of its core values. Now it finds itself targeted by some of the same conservative powers it once praised.How did the ADL backlash begin?Over the weekend, several influential rightwing accounts began posting screenshots of the ADL’s page onTurning Point USA(TPUSA), attacking the organization for including Kirk’s group in its Glossary of Extremism. One of the first posts, from a self-described “Twitter troll”, accused the ADL of having “blood on their hands”.The ADL did not actually list TPUSA as an extremist organization, but instead documented incidents where its leadership and affiliated activists had either aligned with extremists or made “racist or bigoted comments”. Other rightwing activists soon followed the troll with more posts about the ADL. Some spread a screenshot of the ADL’s page on the Christian Identity movement – an extremist ideology that espouses a racial holy war against Jews and other minorities – to allege that the ADL was biased against Christians as a whole.The online campaign against the ADL gained more momentum and exposure on Sunday night after Musk, who owns X and boasts over 220 million followers on the platform, began responding to posts about the non-profit and joining in on the attacks.“The ADL hates Christians, therefore it is is [sic] a hate group,” Musk responded on Sunday night to an X account that usually tweets anti-immigrant content. In another post, Musk suggested that the ADL’s operations encouraged murder.After days of rightwing outrage – that included Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican congresswoman – accusing the ADL of “creating a targeted hate campaign against Christians”, the organization announced on Tuesday that it had eliminated its entireglossary of extremismfrom its website – a database it touted in 2022 as “the most comprehensive and intuitive resource on extremist speech currently available to the public”. The ADL framed the decision to delete as a way to “explore new strategies and creative approaches to deliver our data and present our research more effectively”.The ADL has weathered similar pressure campaigns from rightwing activists in the past, including from Chaya Raichik of the influential Libs of TikTok account in 2023, though these campaigns did not result in drastic deletion.Failure to halt the backlashDespite the ADL’s apparent capitulation to Musk and others, the rightwing campaign against the group continued. Less than 24-hours later, Kash Patel, the FBI director, posted on X that his agency would end its partnership with the ADL, accused the organization of spying on conservative groups, and denounced former FBI directorJames Comey’spraise of the group. The ADL hadlong partneredwith law enforcement to hold workshops on antisemitism, conduct Holocaust education and provide information on extremist groups.“James Comey wrote ‘love letters’ to the ADL and embedded FBI agents with them – a group that ran disgraceful ops spying on Americans,” Patel posted on X. “That era is OVER. This FBI won’t partner with political fronts masquerading as watchdogs”.The ADL hasn’t received any formal communications from theTrump administrationabout its relationship with the FBI and is working to learn more, the organization said in a press release on Thursday.“ADL has deep respect for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and law enforcement officers at all levels across the country who work tirelessly every single day to protect all Americans regardless of their ancestry, religion, ethnicity, faith, political affiliation or any other point of difference,” the press release reads.The campaign against the ADL has taken place against the backdrop of aconservative movementthat has sought to punish people and organizations that have been critical of Kirk. Conservative activists have claimed to have targeted tens of thousands of people who have allegedly criticized Kirk or celebrated the activist’s death, withone group proclaiming: “We will reshape the rank-and-file of America’s institutions.”After the ADL removed its glossary of extremism, Musk and other right wing influencers began shifting their focus to the Southern Poverty Law Center – another prominent civil rights and anti-extremism organization. Musk called for the SPLC, which also documented Kirk’s group’s links to far-right extremism, an “evil organization” that “needs to be shut down”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ADL has at times criticized Musk and his companies for incidents such as his Grok chatbot promoting pro-Nazi ideology and calling itself “MechaHitler”; however, it also defended Musk when he faced allegations of antisemitism.Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL’s CEO, praised Musk in 2023 for saying he would block use of thepro-Palestinian slogan“from the river to the sea” on X. Only days before, though, Musk had endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X that claimed Jewish communities pushed hatred against white people. Greenblatt’s praise caused an uproar within the organization, and one of itstop executives resignedafter the incident.The ADL went to bat for Musk once again earlier this year, after Jewish lawmakers and civil society groups condemned what they described as Musk’s fascist-style salutes on stage during a speech after Trump’s re-election. The ADL posted: “It seems thatElon Muskmade an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute.”Carrying water for Musk yet again led to further turmoil within the organization, withNew York Magazinereporting that confused staffers had flooded the group’s Slack channels with messages and longtime liberal donors had rescinded promised gifts.Musk has not publicly returned the praise. His clash this week is the most extreme episode in a longstanding feud that has included him amplifying calls to disband the organization andthreateningto sue it over its work documenting the rise of antisemitism on X – something he claimed led to lost advertising revenue for the platform.A turning point for the ADLWhile the ADL has been cast into the spotlight on X this week, it has been a tumultuous few years in general for the organization. In addition to internal criticism over its defense of Musk, staffers and other extremism researchers have accused the group ofprioritizing pro-Israel policiesabove a broader commitment to protecting civil rights and fighting antisemitism.At least 17 staffers, donors and other affiliates of the organization have quit or otherwise parted ways in recent years as the organization’s priorities have shifted, according toNew York Magazine. Yet the ADL remains one of the most well-resourced and influential civil society groups in the US, with around $163m in revenue last year alone.Much of the controversy has focused on Greenblatt, who has publicly backed the Trump administration’s clampdown on pro-Palestinian speech and campus protests. Greenblattpraised Trumplast year for withholding $400m in grants to Columbia University after campus protests and the ADL complimented Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s illegal arrest of pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil.“We appreciate the Trump Administration’s broad, bold set of efforts to counter campus antisemitism – and this action further illustrates that resolve by holding alleged perpetrators responsible for their actions,” the ADL posted above a tweet about Khalil’s arrest.The incident reflected a concern from some staffers and other Jewish organizations that the ADL has undermined its legitimacy as it sought to collaborate with the administration, with former ADL extremism researcher Vegas Tenold writing at the time: “By carrying the administration’s water, the ADL lends its voice and credibility to Trump’s efforts to dehumanize and criminalize dissent.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskAntisemitismDonald TrumpCharlie Kirk shootingFar right (US)Trump administrationexplainersShareReuse this content"

Rise of Katie Lam reflects rightward shift on migrationShadow Home Office minister who tweets in language of hard-right populism  is talked of as future of conservatismPeter WalkerSenior political correspondentSat 4 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Oct 2025 12.36 EDTSharePictured on herofficial websitesmiling on a country walk with her golden retriever, Katie Lam looks every inch the traditional Conservative MP. But make no mistake: this is a very modern breed of Tory, and one whose rise gives a clue to the current direction of UK politics.Still only 34 and in parliament for little over a year, Lam is named almost ubiquitously by fellowConservativesas a likely future leader – even, some venture, a direct replacement for Kemi Badenoch.Lam does have the sort of CV almost designed to impress Tory constituency associations, with its route from state school to Cambridge, Goldman Sachs, then stints as an aide in Downing Street and the Home Office.It is when you look at Lam’sX accountthat the picture become more complicated. Just about every single message is about migration or grooming gangs, with a heavy focus on crimes committed by asylum seekers. “We already have British sex criminals,”one messagereads. “We don’t need any more!”Although this is in part her brief – Lam is a shadow Home Office minister as well as a whip – the sheer intensity of the focus on problems supposedly caused by migrants or people from minority ethnic communities is striking, while the language is often of a sort that only a few years ago would have been the preserve of hard-right populism.It is a striking trajectory for someone whose socialist great-great-grandfather fled the Nazis in Germany, whose grandparents met while delivering leaflets for the Labour party, and who was herself a deputy chief of staff to Boris Johnson, now so reviled by right-leaning Tories for his relaxed approach to migration.One senior Conservative who recalls Lam from her time in Johnson’s No 10 says that while her job was more administrative than policy-focused, she showed no signs then of anti-migration zeal.“When she did weigh in on policy, it was standard, middle-of-the-road Tory stuff,” they said. “There was no evidence of her thinking that before. But people can change their minds.”Allies of Lam insist the idea of a Damascene conversion is unfair and that as a Brexit supporter she has always supported a more robust approach to borders and legal sovereignty.This was seemingly the case by the time Lam worked as an aide to the then home secretary, Suella Braverman. One contemporary recalls that while Lam’s primary focus was national security, she was known to support the UK leaving the European convention on human rights.And as another former colleague noted, even if Lam has changed her mind, she is far from alone in the party. “You are hearing all sorts of people saying all sorts of things you wouldn’t have heard before, like Kemi saying some cultures are inferior to others. And Robert Jenrick has certainly been on a journey. But that’s also part of a vibe shift in the country as a whole,” the ex-colleague said.View image in fullscreenKatie Lam speaking in the House of Commons.Photograph: House of CommonsThere is more consensus about Lam herself, with even those unimpressed with some of her views agreeing she is dedicated, clever and a fun colleague, as well as being quietly but intensely ambitious.“She laughs a lot, and she’s a warm character, but you piece it all together – president of the Cambridge Union, Goldman Sachs, No 10 – you realise that she’s very, very driven,” one former colleague said.It seems this has always been the case. Growing up, Lam’s Surrey comprehensive did not offer Latin or Greek so she studied independently and went on to take classics at Cambridge.Aside from politics, she is an accomplished lyricist and scriptwriter, co-writing five musicals with a childhood friend, including a well-reviewed recent version of The Railway Children.A fellow Conservative MP calls Lam “super-impressive” and the ideal fit for what they argue is a party and a country moving decisively to the right on migration.“Katie is a good messenger – she’s obviously not a rightwing skinhead. But she is genuine,” they said. “She doesn’t come to this from an old-school rightwing head space. She is responding to what is happening.”Others are more sceptical. “It’s a sign of the party’s difficulties that she’s being talked about as a potential leader after just 15 months,” one senior Tory said. “There’s no doubt that she’s personable and clever, but from what I’ve seen she hasn’t really set things on fire.”In this fast-changing Tory world, Lam potentially faces another barrier to advancement given her close links to what one Conservative called “the old regime” of Johnson, now so comprehensively rejected by the party.There is, of course, another element to this, one often forgotten when Conservatives discuss future leaders: the world beyond the party.A Liberal Democrat source said traditional Tory voters in so-called “blue wall” seats, dozens of which were won by Ed Davey’s party at the election, would be “bewildered” by the idea of Lam being touted as the future of conservatism.“The fact rising stars in the Conservative party believe they can win back the blue wall with a Nigel Farage tribute act on social media shows how dramatically out of touch they have become,” they said.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

A midnight kiss confirmed a deeper connectionFind more stories fromThe moment I knew seriesAs told toIsabella LeeSat 4 Oct 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Oct 2025 18.01 EDTShareIt makes sense that Jarred and my story began among handstanding nude performers. It was 2009, I had just wrapped up a dance performance at Melbourne fringe festival and I was unwinding in the artists’ bar when circus performers began doing outrageous naked tricks. Over the crack of whips, my eyes found Jarred in the audience. He was absolutely gorgeous.Wasting no time, my friend Amy introduced us. Jarred told me he was studying circus arts; I was a contemporary dancer, so we bonded over a love of movement. His beauty drew me in but his passion for his craft held me captive. The world is a complicated place, but it was clear we both believed in making life fun through our work.After connecting on Facebook, I’d often stay up late at night to see when Jarred was active and time my messages accordingly.By the end of the year we were hanging out in Melbourne regularly, slowly getting to know each other, nerding out over Xena: Warrior Princess and horror films. We really liked and admired each other, so we didn’t want to rush into things.View image in fullscreenJames and Jarred at the beginning of their relationship in Melbourne in 2010On New Year’s Eve, we headed to a house party in Carlton North. It was teeming with noise and bodies. We quietly slipped away on to the balcony to be alone. It dawned on me that life felt infinitely better since meeting Jarred.As our friends’ countdown shouts reached a crescendo, something instinctive pulled us together. The countdown entered single digits. On one, we turned to each other and kissed. In that kiss we both recognised the same thing: it wasn’t just the beginning of a new year, but something bigger.View image in fullscreenJames and Jarred in Berlin in 2015Afterwards we were officially an item. Jarred was working for circus company Circa, and I was on the road with my own shows as a dancer and drag queen, so we knew we’d have to spend months apart. Long distance can wear you down and make you feel as though you’re frozen in time – I wouldn’t have endured it for just anyone.The moment I knew: he hugged me and I didn’t want to let goRead moreThe decision to commit to each other long distance meant we were able to take up many amazing (and sometimes chaotic) career opportunities.Jarred and I occasionally perform together, he makes costumes for my shows and we influence each other a lot artistically. I’ve helped him join the shinier, draggier side of life and he has made me more circusy.View image in fullscreenJames Websley as Valerie Hex and Jarred Dewey at the Medea awards in Melbourne in 2025In 2019, after a decade of mostly touring and living apart, we finally found ourselves on the same continent, though in a less-than-ideal circumstance. Jarred had ruptured his bicep on tour in Austria and was flown back to Australia for surgery. I sat waiting nervously throughout the long operation; when Jarred finally awoke he looked me in the eye groggily and made a whoosh-whoosh sucking sound – his way of communicating he wanted a drink of water from a straw. Always the clown!Jarred was out of action for a year. During that time we moved in together, and as it coincided with Covid lockdowns, I took my cabaret acts online.Although domestic life was bliss, Jarred’s injury threw off my proposal plans. Instead of postcard-perfect Salzburg, I settled on Brunswick Heads. As we sat together on the beach, the ring was already in my hand when I realised I hadn’t thought about what I was going to say. I managed this: “Will you give me a kiss? Will you give me a pat? And finally, will you marry my bum?” Jarred laughed and said yes.View image in fullscreenJames and Jarred doing a trick in a pool at Koh Chang, Thailand in 2024A year later Jarred proposed to me too. I was confused but then delighted because of course when you have a contract, both people usually sign it. Due to Covid we didn’t plan a wedding and instead put that money towards a house. “Fiance” is more fun to say than “husband” anyway.I love how patient and measured Jarred is. He balances me out when my impulsivity gets the better of me. But above all else, he always makes me laugh.James Welsby and Jarred Dewey perform inDecadence: 10 Years of Yummyat Melbourne fringe festival until 18 OctoberShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

As well as browsing the exhibits that are on show, visitors have the option to choose up to five via the“order an object” serviceand have them delivered to a study room for a private viewing. (That’s if they’re movable – if not, you go to them.)We asked visitors for their highlights – here are some of them.‘An amazing surprise’Backdrop for theBallets Russesproduction of Le Train Bleu,1924View image in fullscreenA young couple enjoy Picasso’s Le Train Bleu.Photograph: Olive Burnside/Guardian CommunityLe Train Bleu, the Picasso backcloth for Ballets Russes, was an amazing surprise. The scale of the piece was huge, in a space of its own, after all the racks and floors of interesting objects. The only other people were a young couple struggling to take a selfie that did it justice. When I offered to hold their phone they immediately struck the pose. They were so wonderful I had to take another picture for myself. I loved lots of the objects on display, but this one trumped them all.Olive Burnside, Glasgow‘Architecture preserved and installed in such a creative way’View image in fullscreenA two-storey section of Robin Hood Gardens in Bermondsey, south-east London.Photograph: David Parry/PAFacade from Robin Hood GardensThe exhibit that I liked the best was theRobin Hood Gardens facade. It was unexpected to find part of a Brutalist building in the V&A collection. The reason it resonates with me is that I lived in a tower block – Addy House in Bermondsey – for seven years, after I graduated in London. Back then it was deemed “hard to let”. We were seven floors up in a 60s concrete block that was in some disrepair. Despite this, we loved living there. The flat itself was spacious, with brilliant views, floor to ceiling windows and beautifully tiled floors. We lived alongside residents who had moved in when the block was first built. They spoke of brass panels and handles on the doors that they would polish regularly, and the joy they had at living in a newly built home that everyone looked after.I loved the fact that this huge section of architecture has been preserved and installed in such a creative way. On each level of the Storehouse, behind the facade we learned more about it. Level one: the moving film introduced us to some of the residents. Level two: the interior of the building shown through the front doors and entrance halls of two flats. And on level three, images of residents inside their homes. So much more than a facade, it preserves memories along with the architecture.Helen Rose,St Leonards-on-Sea‘A tutu with unusual wings’Le Bal theatre costumeView image in fullscreenA Giorgio de Chirico costume for one of the four sylphs in Le Bal (1929), choreographed by George Balanchine for Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes.Photograph: Richard Davis/Courtesy of the V&AMy recent master’s dissertation focused on the care of historic classical ballet tutus. My favourite object was one I ordered via the “order an object” service: a tutu worn by Alice Marks. It was acostume for a sylph by Georgio de Chirico– a Romantic tutu with unusual wings and decoration. The design was unusual and powerful. The toughness of the material is at odds with our usual impressions of sylph delicacy. The massive sculptural wings suggest a sort of exoskeleton or armour rather than the usual whimsy and fragility. The woman in this dress is strong, tough and mysterious. De Chirico’s design is both referential and extremely modern in its style.Lara F Martyn, Cumbria‘Like time-travelling to 1930s Pittsburgh’Frank Lloyd Wright’s officeView image in fullscreenFrank Lloyd Wright’s office.Photograph: Kemka Ajoku/Courtesy of the V&AFrank Lloyd Wright’s office was my personal highlight. It might be an obvious choice because it is one of the larger items on display, but there is something magical about being able to stand somewhere that once belonged in a different time and place – like time-travelling to 1930s Pittsburgh. The art deco room itself is beautiful, a real icon of its time. The deceptively simple patterns on the wood panel walls were a particular highlight. Little details like the bust of Nefertiti and the stainless steel ashtray stand made it feel as though the room could have been in use yesterday. It was also amazing to see it from the outside, to see the notes to the people who had to move it, piece by piece. It gave me a new appreciation of how difficult it must be to move larger objects around a collection.Emma Thomas, 31, Croydon‘A cross between a provincial museum and Ikea’Assorted piecesView image in fullscreenA 1950s television, a medieval altar piece and a modern chairI love the juxtaposition of objects and the “organised chaos” of the place. One of the standouts was this combination on the end of a row: a 50s television and medieval altar piece and a simple chair. This display was a great demonstration of the range of artefacts on show. I’d describe the whole experience as a cross between a provincial museum and Ikea. Just brilliant!Stephen Buddle, Guildford‘Not something I would expect to see at a traditional museum’Mannequin dummiesView image in fullscreenThe dummies are designed to be covered but are ‘beautiful in their own right’These mannequin dummies (pictured) were a highlight. Though initially simple, they provoked a variety of thoughts. Five female body shapes that stood out to me due to their starkness, like a feminine show of strength. I also thought the mannequins represented what was “typical” body shape from different periods of history, so ideas of what was desirable have changed through time, in particular waist and hip shape and proportions. I thought how important mannequins are in fashion and dressmaking. They are designed to be covered but are beautiful and individual in their own right. Mannequins are not something I would expect to see at a traditional museum, so they reflected the very eclectic collection of items that resonate in different ways to different people.Lynn, Welwyn Garden City‘A cabinet of curiosity’Cabinet designed by Charles Rennie MackintoshView image in fullscreenThe hall cupboard by Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928).Photograph: Courtesy of the V&AOn my visit I requested an eclectic mix of items, ranging from a tiny pair of lotus shoes to a large Mackintosh hall cupboard. Being able to handle [some] items that were only previously seen behind glass, such as the 19th-century kimono and intricately decorated gold dragonflyinro(a small, decorative case which hangs from the belt), was very special. I have lived in Japan and have an interest in traditional Japanese clothing. The opportunity to select items which pertain to your personal interests, however varied, from one of the world’s most important collections is such a joy.Beckie, York‘Visitors could really investigate close up’The Frankfurt kitchenView image in fullscreenThe Frankfurt Kitchen: ‘practical and efficient’.Photograph: Courtesy of the V&AMy favourite piece on my visit in July was the Frankfurt Kitchen, because it was something tangible that visitors could really investigate close up – without touching, of course. It’s a great example of a research-based design, done by a female architect who apparently didn’t actually cook. It’s a practical, efficient kitchen which would meet the needs of ordinary people, and has influenced kitchen design today. An awful lot was crammed into a small space, but she managed to display clean lines with no feeling of clutter. Though the kitchen dates from the 1900s, I’d be happy to cook in such a kitchen today. There are some lovely refinements such as the double sink, a raised drainage shelf, aluminium storage drawers, plentiful other storage, and good workspace. Many elements are still sought-after in today’s fitted kitchens. It just shows there’s nothing new under the sun!Karen Davies, 67, FranceExplore more on these topicsMuseumsV&AArchitectureLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Still we need to try to bring these players in. If the result would have been better today with a draw or a win then we would have had a great start to the season if you take into account everything that happened in the summer in Liverpool.”Slot, who had to rejig his defence after Ibrahima Konaté went off with a thigh injury in the second half, defended Salah’s wayward finishing. “What I like is that we brought him many times in the position he would like to be in,” the Dutchman said. “And I would like him to be in because he’s shown in his career and since I’m here that in those positions he can score goals.“He had many opportunities to do what he’s done so often. He’s a human being and it’s not like every chance he gets is always a goal. We feel sometimes it is because of what he’s done last season.”Liverpool host Manchester United after the international break and Slot believes better finishing would have stopped his side from losing atChelseaand Crystal Palace. “In both games we’ve created more chances than the team we have faced but the truth is that we have only scored once in both games and our opponent has scored twice,” he said.Chelsea led through Moisés Caicedo’s early goal and it seemed they would have to settle for a point when Cody Gakpo equalised. But Enzo Maresca’s side moved up to sixth when Estêvão Willian, the Brazilian teenager, popped up in the 95th minute to score his first goal in English football.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Declan Rice also had to be withdrawn in the second half with a back injury after he opened the scoring against his former club, with the England midfielder a doubt for the games against Wales on Thursday and Latvia a week on Tuesday.Bukayo Saka seals Arsenal’s stroll past West Ham in Mikel Arteta’s 300th gameRead moreBut it was the condition of Ødegaard – who became the first player in Premier League history to be substituted in three successive matches before half-time, having previously been withdrawn against Leeds and Nottingham Forest because of a shoulder injury – that is worrying theArsenalmanager the most.“He had a clash knee-to-knee, and immediately he was uncomfortable,” said Arteta, who marked his 300th game in charge with a comfortable victory. “I just spoke to him, he’s not positive about it, he’s got a brace on. We’ll have to wait and see from the doctors.“We haven’t had him since the start of the season for one reason or the other, the shoulder twice and then this injury. We’ll find solutions, but obviously he’s our captain and is a player that gives us a completely different dimension with the things that he can do, especially in attacking. Let’s wait, and hopefully it’s not that bad.”On Rice, he added: “He’s not all right because he asked me to come off, so that’s a shame. He had pain in his back and he could not carry on, which is something very unusual for Declan, so we’ll have to assess him and see how he is.”View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Declan Rice with Mikel Arteta after being substituted due to pain in his back.Photograph: Tony O’Brien/ReutersArsenal had lost their two previous meetings with West Ham at the Emirates but Bukayo Saka, who scored a penalty in the second half to make the points safe on his 200th Premier League appearance, said they were determined to make up for that. “It showed the progress we have made,” he said. “The last two seasons we slipped up at home against West Ham and we wanted to put that right today. We know the quality we have at the top end of the pitch and we know if we keep a clean sheet it is more than likely we will win the game.”Nuno Espírito Santo was taking charge of his second match for West Ham since succeeding Graham Potter and the east London club remain in the relegation zone after this defeat. The former Forest manager acknowledged that there is plenty of work to do over the international break.“This week has been a lot of new challenges, new things, a lot of changes,” he said. “I think the international break is going to be very useful in terms of settling down the mind and focus, but all the aspects of the game we have to address.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetaWest Ham UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

The head coach witnessed a rare comfortable victory against Sunderland to alleviate the pressure on him for a fortnight at least.Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko scored their first homePremier Leaguegoals for the club, although, having joined two years apart, that indicates some of the problems Amorim has been dealing with. Apart from a brief scare on a penalty that never was, life was straightforward for United as they secured a third win and first clean sheet of the season amid downpours and gales but, like the Old Trafford roof, the hosts did their job.Manchester United are ‘100% behind’ Ruben Amorim, insists Mason MountRead moreAmorim has spent much of his tenure being criticised for an unwillingness to change his 3-4-3 formation. He led a passionate defence of his style and system athis Friday press conference, claiming it is not the issue. The same cannot be said of the personnel, leading to five changes fromlosing at Brentford, including a debut for the goalkeeper Senne Lammens, who was untroubled throughout.When Bertrand Traoré failed to convert a simple chance in the opening minutes, there was concern that United were facing another very unpleasant afternoon. Good news came Amorim’s way in the ninth minute when one of his changes paid off. Bryan Mbeumo chipped the ball into the box, where Mount was waiting, taking a touch before carefully placing a shot into the corner. The Old Trafford nerves were calmed.Mount is one of Amorim’s most trusted players thanks to intelligence and work rate. He often dropped deeper to help out Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in central midfield whenSunderlandhad possession as United overwhelmed the visitors in a key area of the pitch.View image in fullscreenMason Mount puts Manchester United ahead.Photograph: Phil Oldham/ShutterstockAmid a deluge there was the rare sense that United were enjoying themselves. A second was sought, focusing on play down the right. The former Sunderland loanee Amad Diallo and Mbeumo tested Robin Roefs with almost identical curling shots.Little was learned about Lemmens but he looked calm and assured when required. At the other end, Roefs was proving once again why he is one of the signings of the summer. Fernandes took precise aim for the top corner and expected to be celebrating a split second later, only for a stunning fingertip save on to the bar from the Sunderland goalkeeper.It was a simple set piece that did the trick. A long Diogo Dalot throw-in was flicked on by a Sunderland defender and Sesko was alert to net his second in as many games, allowing him to embrace the Old Trafford adulation. “This [scoring at Old Trafford] has been the moment I’ve dreamed about as a kid, because the atmosphere here is unbelievable,” Sesko said.The Black Cats carried out an impromptu investigation on where it had all gone wrong. There was plenty of finger-pointing but it did not improve the defending as the same almost happened again soon after. Things were going so badly for Sunderland, Régis Le Bris brought off Simon Adingra in the 37th minute, replacing the winger with the centre-back Dan Ballard, in an attempt to interrupt United’s dominance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The intensity and cohesion Amorim desires on a weekly basis was on show. Mbeumo and Diallo repeatedly combined down the United right, to give hope of a blossoming relationship, while Mount had arguably his best game for the club. Lemmens was even given a huge cheer for making his first catch of the match, to give him a confidence boost.View image in fullscreenBoth teams line up for a minute’s silence in a mark of respect to those killed in the Manchester synagogue attack. ‘ACityUnited,’ says the scoreboard.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAThe two-goal lead felt comfortable but that did not completely remove the jeopardy. Stuart Attwell awarded a first-half stoppage-time penalty, believing Sesko had kicked Trai Hume in the head while attempting to clear a throw-in. The referee was wrong – although it was strange the striker thought it sensible to have his boot so high – and overturned his original decision on review.Scares and opportunities were rare after the break, as United showed resilience and control, even if the excitement levels dipped. United’s players will now disperse for international duty and Amorim will be hoping the prospect of building momentum does not leave with them. When they return, United face a trip to the champions Liverpool, ensuring the prospect of first-back-to-back wins under Amorim will be difficult but he can plan for that task in peace.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedSunderlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Verstappen backed off his final lap, waving in indignation at having lost downforce in the final corners behind the slow-movingMcLarenof Norris, who was on an in-lap.Singapore Grand Prix F1 qualifying: George Russell powers to pole position – liveRead moreThe two drivers are good friends, but in the sweltering heat of Singapore the bromance cooled as Verstappen took aim at Norris. “That is what happens when there is a car in front of you and that is noted and will be remembered as well,” he said.“Sometimes it happens on the street circuit that people are bored, make mistakes. You need every kind of clean air that you can have on a Q3 lap, especially because you’re fully on the limit with braking and everything. I lost a bit of downforce with that, so I went straight on.”Verstappen said he would not be speaking to Norris about the incident but insisted what had happened was not “not nice”. Norris, it should be noted, did nothing against the regulations, but, in Verstappen’s opinion, had been too slow in returning to the pits. The Briton was having none of it. “They always complain, they complain about everything, that’s Red Bull,” he said. “I didn’t even know, I was like three seconds ahead or something.”Whether the defending world champion would have matched Russell remains moot, however. He had been almost two-tenths off Russell on his first hot lap and with Russell going even quicker on the decisive runs. Verstappen had not looked like beating him before he aborted his lap.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen in action during qualifying.Photograph: Vincent Thian/APRussell’s pole was all the more notable for outpacing both title contenders.Oscar Piastriand Norris finished third and fifth respectively, unable to match Russell or Verstappen throughout the session. Both McLaren drivers were disappointed, admitting they did not quite have the pace, but it is Piastri, with a 25-point lead, who has the advantage on Sunday.Russell’s performance could not be faulted. His first run in Q3, even given he brushed the wall, was still a striking piece of precision driving and when he kept his rubber clear of the barriers on his second attempt, he went seven-thousandths quicker. Mercedes’ upgrade to the front wing is paying off.For the 27-year-old, it was a major statement as speculation around his future at Mercedes continues. His contract is up at the end of this season and demonstrations like this can only strengthen his hand. Moreover, he did it while still recovering from the respiratory illness that struck him at the last round in Baku.Russell has yet to win in Singapore, but neither has Verstappen, and the pair’s relationship has been feisty in the past. The run and entry to turn one on Sunday will be compelling stuff indeed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One person had been stabbed, while another sustained separate injuries.Sanchez was taken to a nearby hospital in critical condition, according toTMZ Sports. The circumstances surrounding the attack remain unclear. The suspect involved has been detained, according to WTHR.The broadcaster had earlier confirmed he was “recovering in the hospital in stable condition” on Saturday without elaborating on the cause or nature of his injuries or the arrest.“The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office will make the final charging decision,” the statement added, noting that an arrest “is merely an accusation and Sanchez should be considered innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law”.Sanchez, 38, was in Indianapolis before Sunday’s Colts v Raiders matchup at Lucas Oil stadium, which he was set to call for Fox Sports. He joined Fox in 2021 as anNFLbroadcaster and also contributes to FS1 studio programming.Before his broadcasting career, Sanchez played 10 seasons in the NFL with several teams, including the New York Jets, Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys. He retired in July 2019 and soon after began working with ESPN’s college football coverage before transitioning to Fox.Off the field, Sanchez married his wife, Perry, in 2023.

After this patchy victory against Argentina, owing everything to their scrum dominance, two pressing questions emerged. When will they get the chance to make it three? And would it even be two if this match had been played in Argentina?To address the first, despite the most thrilling edition in years, there will be no Rugby Championship in 2026 with South Africa instead hosting New Zealand in what is being billed as the “Greatest Rivalry”. There will probably be a truncated version in 2027 before the World Cup, but what happens thereafter is uncertain.All-powerful All Blacks banish brave Wallabies to 11th straight Bledisloe lossRead moreAccording to the latest reports, if it survives as a competition it may even move to February and run concurrently with the Six Nations. “Maybe this is the last Rugby Championship,” said Erasmus, South Africa’s head coach. “I’m not 100% sure how it will work in the future. So it meant a hell of a lot.”In many ways, that brings us to the second question. It was a financial decision by Argentina to come to Twickenham, no doubt in part because there is no tournament next year. Precisely what Argentina and Australia do is unclear so the bottom line was all the more important.Such was South Africa’s superiority at scrum-time here that it did not feel like a match that merited such a small winning margin, but Erasmus, with tongue pressed into cheek, admitted his side were “fortunate that we didn’t play them in Argentina”. No doubt the All Blacks, who settle for second place on points difference, would agree. “They were bloody tough here, but there’s no doubt that they’re tougher in Argentina,” said Erasmus.He is stating the obvious because in a crowd of more than 70,000, swamped by a sea of green, only a few pockets of Pumas fans were visible. This was a “home” match for Argentina, but they gave up any advantage. Twickenham is fast becoming a second home for the Springboks. This was a fifth straight win here and a third victory in three years in matches in which England were not involved.Quick GuideArgentina 27-29 South Africa teams and scorersShowArgentinaS Carreras; Delguy, Piccardo, Chocobares, Mallia; Prisciantelli (Isgro 65), Benitez Cruz (Moyano 71); Vivas, Montoya (capt; Ruiz 73), Coria Marchetti (Rapetti 55), Petti (Molina 54), Rubiolo, Matera (Gonzalez 48), Kremer, Grondona (Oviedo 48).TriesDelguy 2, Isgro.ConsCarreras 2.PensCarreras 2.Sin-binVivas 43.South AfricaWillemse; Kolbe, Moodie (Kriel 50), De Allende; Hooker; Feinberg-Mngomezulu (Libbok 68), Reinach (Williams 68); Nche (Wessels 50), Marx (Mbonambi 61), T Du Toit (Louw 50), Etzebeth (Snyman 48), Nortje, Kolisi (capt; Smith 60), PS Du Toit, Wiese.TriesReinach 2, Marx 2.ConsFeinberg-Mngomezulu 3.PensFeinberg-Mngomezulu.Sin-binMoodie 2.RefereeAndrea Piardi (It).Attendance70,360.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.They will not return in November, but there was a reminder of the set piece standards the world’s No 1 side can set. No one needs telling South Africa can scrummage, but it was an awesome flex of the muscles with the hooker, Malcolm Marx, in particularly destructive form.South Africa began the tournament bythrowing away a 22-0 leadat home to Australia, a performance described by Erasmus as uncomplimentary, graphic terms. There were times here when, in some facets of their game, they were not a great deal better, but such were the heights they hit with arecord victory in Wellingtonand last Saturday’s67-30 win against Argentina, they deserve their title. It has been an exhilarating tournament because of how competitive it has been, but South Africa have at times found a gear beyond their rivals.View image in fullscreenMalcolm Marx scores his second try, helped by Cobus Reinach, giving South Africa too big a lead for Argentina to overcome.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHere they rode their luck – Canan Moodie really ought to have been shown a second yellow card and therefore a red in the first half – and Erasmus admitted as much. Argentina, for their part, could not quite match their record of exacting revenge victories against all three opponents. If they had half a scrum they might have and credit the Pumas for fighting until the end. Rodrigo Isgró’s try was scored with the game already up, however.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu – scorer of 37 points last week – got the Boks on the board with a penalty but two for Santiago Carreras gave Argentina a fully deserved 13-3 lead. Moodie then escaped a second yellow for slapping down Mallía’s pass and to rub salt in the wounds another knock-on was missed in the buildup to Cobus Reinach’s first try shortly before half-time.View image in fullscreenSiya Kolisi takes a selfie as he celebrates victory with fans at Twickenham.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe writing was on the wall for Argentina when Mayco Vivas was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle on Eben Etzebeth early in the second half and Marx was almost immediately over from a driving lineout. Close-range finishes from Reinach and the irrepressible Marx hinted at a procession – Feinberg-Mngomezulu was enjoying himself by this stage, flinging backdoor offloads – but Argentina hung in the fight.Delguy had his second after an interception before Carreras struck the upright with a 77th-minute penalty that would have set up a grandstand finish.

The £55m summer signing had not found the net in nine games but his deflected 57th-minute shot sealed an impressive win.Kudus also provided the assist for the opener by Mathys Tel, who notched his first of the campaign, but Noah Okafor levelled for Leeds before Kudus’s strike proved decisive.Mohammed Kudus keeps his cool as Tottenham show steel to hold off LeedsRead more“I’m pleased for Mo to get his goal and it was about time, and I’m so happy for Mathys as well,” said Frank. “The character he has shown as a young man from day one has really impressed me after the setback of not being in the Champions League squad. He trains well and was ready today.”Victory lifted Spurs up to second before the remainder of Saturday’s other Premier League matches after they began the day in fifth and continued their impressive start under the former Brentford manager, this their fourth league win under Frank.Tottenham might well have buckled in this kind of game last season, when they endured their worst Premier League campaign, resulting inAnge Postecoglou’s sacking. Spurs have won three of their opening four away Premier League games this season, which is as many as in their final 13 away league games of last season under the Australian.Frank added: “I’m extremely happy with the win. If you want to build any successful team, you need mentality, character, cohesion and togetherness no matter if you play like Inter or Barcelona. Whatever the style of play, you need that willingness to do everything to win and I think we’re building that more and more in the team.“We created two goals and other very dangerous situations and chances, so of course I’m delighted with the start we’ve made. Fourteen points in seven games – averaging two points per game – is very good and I’m extremely happy that on the road we have won three and drawn one. It’s a good start, but we need to continue.”View image in fullscreen‘If you want to build any successful team, you need mentality, character, cohesion and togetherness,’ said Thomas Frank.Photograph: Chloe Knott/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockHis Leeds counterpart, Daniel Farke, cut a frustrated figure as his side lost at home in the league for the first time in more than a year. But the German also took the positives, especially as Spurs were left hanging on at the end with Guglielmo Vicario’s fine save denying Joël Piroe a stoppage-time equaliser.“We have to take our chances and hope the goalkeeper is not the man of the match, but we should have hit the target with a few of our chances,” Farke said. “Still, we played one of the country’s top sides and were the better side. That’s encouraging and I’m proud of how far we have come.”Leeds fans were angry at referee Thomas Bramall’s officiating, but Farke insisted: “I have to be a bit careful, I don’t like to comment in public. I leave it with others to comment on the referee, I comment on what I can influence.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurLeeds UnitedThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

This changes the shape and narrative of Sunday’s Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe.“Proper soft and it’s going to take a lot of getting,” was the verdict of Dylan Browne McMonagle after his win on Tennessee Stud in the opening Prix Chaudenay. That was echoed by Tom Marquand, the Cadran winner aboard George Scott’s Caballo De Mar. “It’s very soft but not heavy,” he said. “It would be an injustice to call it heavy because they’ve done a really good job of having us on the nicest part of the track and tomorrow it will open out again to freshen it up, but it’s testing.”Raiders of the Arc: Japan hopes to end elusive 50-year quest in ParisRead moreFor good or ill, the prospects of all 17 runners have been affected by the abrupt softening of the ground, but the most obvious losers are the three runners from Japan, bidding to succeed where 33 compatriots have failed over the past 56 years.A week ago, Byzantine Dream, Alohi Alii and Croix Du Nord were priced up between 8-1 and 16-1, the good-to-soft ground had survived well beyond its usual mid-September cut-off point and there was even talk of Byzantine Dream edging towards the top of the market as punters latched on to the booking of Oisin Murphy to ride.The three horses were heading into the Arc off the back of a win in a recognised trial, an unprecedented degree of strength in depth for a Japanese challenge. But Thursday’s draw for starting positions left Byzantine Dream and Croix Du Nord marooned in wide stalls and the rain has added to the scale of their task. All three are now available at 14-1 or bigger.That does not mean they can not win, but they will go to post with their chance significantly reduced. Japanese racing is conducted almost exclusively on good ground or faster so the stallions and mares in its breeding programme are fast-ground horses. It normally requires a career-best performance to win an Arc and the trio are unlikely to run up to their very best form on the rain-softened ground or from a wide stall.The balance has tipped appreciably towards the Europeans and runners from France, Ireland and England now fill the top six slots in the betting for what remains an unusually competitive renewal of the continent’s showpiece event.View image in fullscreenAndré Fabre is seeking a ninth victory in the Arc and will fancy his chances with Sosie, a 9-1 shot, and Cualificar, at around 12-1.Photograph: John Walton/PAAidan O’Brien’s Minnie Hauk, unbeaten in four starts this seasonincluding the Oaksand Irish Oaks, is a narrow favourite from the Prix Vermeille winner, Aventure, who was a length and a quarter behindBluestocking in second 12 months ago.Sosie, the beaten favourite when fourth last year, is a 9-1 shot to give André Fabre a record-extending ninth Arc, while Daryz, a close second to Croix Du Nord over 10 furlongs here in their trial last month, is a 12-1 chance alongside Kalapana, the King George runner-up, and another Fabre-trained runner, Cualificar.All six have plenty to recommend them, but with the odd question about their chance too. Minnie Hauk has a tricky draw against the rail in stall one, which has not housed the Arc winner since 2008, while Aventure won a Vermeille when the favourite, Whirl, clearly failed to run anywhere close to form. Kalapana was a long way short of her King George form in her Arc warm-up at Kempton last month and Sosie has not obviously improved as a four-year-old .That leaves Daryz and Cualificar as interesting options, not least because they are also the most likely contenders to take a big step forward on the day that matters most.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His trainer’s record in the race speaks for itself – Fabre has won twice as many Arcs as any other trainer in its 105-year history – and he has plotted a careful path towards Longchamp with his latest three-year-old contender.Cualificar was a comfortable winner of the Prix Niel – the launch-pad for Fabre’s six previous three-year-old Arc winners – and while he has something to find with Minnie Hauk and Aventure on ratings looks almost certain to improve significantly on that form.William Buick will also have plenty of options from an ideal draw in stall eight and at around 12-1 with British bookmakers, Cualificar is an excellent bet to give France’s greatest trainer yet another win in his country’s most famous race.Explore more on these topicsPrix de l'Arc de TriompheHorse racing tipsHorse racingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We need that backSat 4 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Oct 2025 08.33 EDTShareYom Kippur isthe holiest dayin the Jewish year, a day of repentance, prayer, fasting; and now – for two Jewish families in Manchester – also a day of mourning. It is also, increasingly, a day when terrorists visit their local synagogue to murder the Jews inside.Six years ago, that terrorist was Stephan Balliet,a German neo-Nazi, and the synagogue was in Halle, Germany. Yesterday it wasJihad Al-Shamie, at the Heaton Park Synagogue in Manchester. Both attacks left two people dead; both were thwarted from further atrocities by the simple act of closing the front door.Anti-Jewish terrorism has been around for a very long time. In the early 1960s an arson campaign by theNational Socialist Movementhit 34 synagogues, schools and other Jewish buildings across London, one of which resulted in the death of a 19-year-old student (although no charges were ever brought for his murder). In the late 1960s Palestinian nationalist terrorism arrived from the Middle East, bringing a wave of bombings and shootings that continued into the 1990s. Since then, the baton of anti-Jewish terrorism has been taken up by Jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda and Isis and the state terror of Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah. And more recently, the social media-driven phenomenon of individual terrorists – not trained or directed by any group but produced and encouraged by online subcultures of hatred and extremism – comes in neo-Nazi, jihadist and extreme leftwing varieties. And they all have one thing in common: they target Jews.This is why synagogues have reinforced doors and windows, cameras, gates and guards. It is why Jewish primary schoolchildren practise active shooter drills. And it is why Jewish communities across the worldspend millions of pounds every yearsimply for the basic right of being Jewish without getting killed.The impact this has had on Jewish life is both extraordinary and banal. Visit any Jewish community building, anywhere in the world, and you are likely to have to pass through an eye-popping level of security. This is not the result of paranoia but a reaction to reality. Most Jews take it for granted, a normal part of what is required to live a free and safe Jewish life. But it shouldn’t be normal at all.This all long predates the rise in global antisemitism since the 7 October attacks, but there is no doubt this threat to Jews has become much more acute since then. British Jews have watched in horror as our fellow Jews wereshot in the US,stabbed in France,murdered in the UAE. There have been more than 150 terrorist attacks, plots and acts of extreme violence targeting Jewish communities in more than 40 countries during the past two years. Synagogues have been burnt on five continents: no other hatred operates in such a synchronised global fashion. That it took so long to happen here has more to do with the efforts of counter-terrorist police and the security services than any lack of would-be terrorists.This wave of anti-Jewish violence sits atop an ocean of incitement and hatred, none of which is new, much of which currently swirls around the topics of Israel and Gaza. People turn to government and police to tackle this phenomenon, and understandably so. There is likely to be much more policing for Jewish communities, more investment in security equipment and guards, more effort to extend the security blanket that is already wrapped tightly around Jewish life in this country. This will be expected and welcomed by many British Jews, but it only addresses the symptoms of this problem. It cannot tackle the cause.Here, there are difficult questions for everyone else. Antisemitism has been allowed to rise in an unacceptable way for far too long. Last year’s official hate-crime statistics showed that a Jewish person in Britain was12 times more likely to be the victim of a religious hate crimethan someone from any other faith background. Calls for violence against Jews, or Israelis, or Zionists, online and on our streets, have become normalised in parts of our politics. And the stark truth is that, while the hard protection provided by government funding and police deployments is ideologically agnostic – a locked door can stop a jihadist terrorist just as easily as a neo-Nazi – the same cannot be said for civil society. When Jews are attacked by the far right, solidarity and sympathy flows easily from the anti-racist ecosystem that exists to protest and campaign against prejudice and hatred. But when Jews are murdered by jihadists? Not so much.There are plenty of reasons for this, but they all amount to the reality that large swathes of the anti-racist movement that stood alongside Jews when they faced neo-Nazis in the 1960s abandoned Britain’s Jewish community a generation ago. The instinctive support that progressives show for other minorities, the sense that they are naturally on their side, has evaporated when it comes to Jews. This has to change. Support from this sector may not be able to stop the deadly threat of anti-Jewish terror. But it would certainly help British Jews feel less alone when it happens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were wrong about her; they could also be about StarmerSat 4 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Oct 2025 11.45 EDTShareParty conference time is when British politics goes berserk. Leaders soar and crash in a morass of cliches. Polls go mad and cataclysm always delivers the best copy.Thus, back in 1981, Margaret Thatcher was at her Blackpool conference, two years into office.Brixton was rioting,inflation was 11%and the Tories werepolling at 23%. The Labour opposition was faring as badly, also at 23%. Meanwhile, a third force, the Social Democratic party (SDP), in alliance with the Liberals, wasrunning at more than 50%and dominating the news.Conference talk that year was unanimous. Thatcher would be gone by Christmas. Her conference speech was awful, receiving the “shortest standing ovation” any leader had received for years,according to Charles Moore’s biography. Rivals roamed fringe meetings, publicly manoeuvring for her job. The Guardian’s Peter Jenkinswrote that “a brief political obituary of Thatcherism [was] now in order”. All bets were on the SDP leader Roy Jenkins becoming prime minister – and soon.Whenever I recall 1981, I wonder how commentators got it so wrong. The answer: hysteria. Conferences are when the Westminster club steps down to flirt with the mob and usually loses its way. That year, Blackpool’s vipers’ nest was so vicious it seemed as if Thatcher could not dare return to Downing Street. Yet, she not only returned, but by the time of the Falklands war the following spring, she was on her way to total command of her party and to two more election victories.Labour just doesn’t get it: workers feel poorer than ever. Is it any wonder Reform is rising? | Sharon GrahamRead moreThe chief difference between today and 1981 is the relative weakness of Reform. Its poll share of27% in the most recent YouGov pollis only half that of the SDP in 1981. The peculiarities of first past the post can be shown to give Reform a majority, but the slightest shift in other party support could put its majority far out of reach.What matters in both cases is the performance of a divided opposition. In 1981, Thatcher felt she could relax electorally as long asLabourwas split down the middle. The SDP went briefly wild but, like Reform, it did not establish a substantive hierarchy or presence. It dwindled in the polls before a general election could test its electoral strength. All it did was stop Labour under Michael Foot from making headway. Thatcher’s Tories were also split, but the division was internal, between “wets” and “dries”. Thatcher shrewdly kept them in balance.So long as the Tory party does not shut up shop, and so long as Reform sticks around, there is no reason why Keir Starmer should not recover to win again in 2029. His relentless bigging up of Reform and its leader,Nigel Farage, is tactically astute. What he has to do over the next two years is ensure that Reform’s support stays more of a threat to the Tories than to Labour. But it must not so devastate the Tories as to lead them to get rid of Kemi Badenoch. She is Keir Starmer’s Michael Foot, and he needs her badly to stay in place.View image in fullscreenMargaret Thatcher acknowledges the audience at the end of her conference speech, Blackpool, 16 October 1981.Photograph: Bill Cross/Daily Mail/Rex FIf history is any guide, Reform is a classic third party. It is internally chaotic and shows no sign of maturing into a lasting electoral force. But it is unlikely to fade sufficiently to allow the Tory party a repaired Commons majority. The Tories’ best hope is that theGreens under Zack Polanskido well enough to seriously split the left-of-centre vote – at which point all bets on a winner are off.Every pundit with whom I discuss 1981 dismisses it as “past history” and says that “things are now different”. The day of populism is at hand. Voters are fluid. Reform is the new politics. I can only conclude that Armageddon has the best tunes, and never more so than at conference time.Starmer’s past year has seemed like one long Downing Street apprenticeship. Every past prime minister reflects on how they wish they could have their first year over again. Starmer had everything going for him, not least one of the biggest Commons majorities in modern times. At least for two years, he could be doing almost anything.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He reshuffles his cabinet. He changes his mind on winter fuel payments, benefits, Angela Rayner and Peter Mandelson. He infuriates small businesses, farmers and non-doms for trivial sums of money. He claims to want more houses, yet he leaves it to the property market to choose where to put them.Meanwhile, Britain is stuck in the mire of “small boats”, to which there is only one remotely plausible answer – win French collaboration. That involves Britain seeking to join the EU initiative to stem the migrant flow out of Asia and Africa. It means embarking on a serious reversal of Brexit. The bravest thing Starmer could do to curb migration and boost his growth agenda is to read the polls telling him that is what people want. Yet he does not dare.As for Reform, I stick to 1981. It will be polling below 25% by the end of next year and Starmer will be in Downing Street for the duration. And conference time will still be pandemonium.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabour conference 2025OpinionKeir StarmerLabourReform UKNigel FarageConservativesMargaret ThatchercommentShareReuse this content"

And every nine minutes that ‘someone’ is a child, according to statistics collated by the anti-sexual violence non-profit Rainn.Instead of sendingallegedsex offenders to court, the Trump administration seems moreinterestedin putting them inpositions of power. Less than 4% of reported rapes, sexual assaults and child sexual abuse allegations in certain cities across the country ever lead to a sex crime conviction,an NBC News investigationfrom earlier this year found. To reiterate: that’sreportedassaults. Bysome counts, nearly 80% of rapes and sexual assaults go unreported.Don’t be too hard on the justice system, though. After all, police and prosecutors have got far more important things to think about than rapists. Namely: locking up pregnant women. According tonew researchby Pregnancy Justice, prosecutors in 16 states charged 412 people with pregnancy-related crimes in the first two years after the US supreme court overturnedRoe v Wade.What, you may be wondering, is a pregnancy-related crime? Good question! Most of the cases included in the new report involved low-income women and allegations of substance use during pregnancy. In one casedescribed to the Guardian, a woman was arrested for felony child neglect after giving birth when a drug test came back positive for marijuana. The woman in that case had a medical marijuana card. While substance use during pregnancy is obviously a serious issue that can result in long-term harm to the baby, researchsuggeststhat criminalization actuallyworsenshealth outcomes.Hundreds of US women charged with pregnancy-related crimes since fall of RoeRead moreWhat is most worrying about this post-Roe trend of “pregnancy-related crimes”, however, is that the laws used in most of these prosecutions are meant to protect children rather than fetuses. What we are seeing here is a growing acceptance of the idea of “fetal personhood”, which grants fetuses and embryos the full rights of a legal person. According to Pregnancy Justice, at least 24 states include language around “fetal rights” in laws regulating orprohibiting abortion care.You can see where this is going, right? We’re headed towards the increased surveillance of pregnant people and the criminalization of any behaviour the Trump administration might unilaterally consider “dangerous”. TakingTylenolduring pregnancy, for example. “What our work has proven is that, unfortunately, anything is possible when it comes to policing pregnancy,” a spokesperson from Pregnancy Justice said.For a terrifying glimpse of America’s future, look to El Salvador, which an increasing number of expertsare warningcould serve as a model for the US. Ever since 1998, there has been a total abortion ban in El Salvador, even when the life of the mother is at risk. Pregnancy is aggressively policed and there is whatAmnesty Internationalhas termed a “guilty until proven innocent” approach when it comes to women who suffer pregnancy-related complications. Although having a miscarriage or a stillbirth is not technically illegal, a recent investigation by the journalistMaria Hinojosafound El Salvadorian prisons are full of women who lost their babies. One woman who was incarcerated for a miscarriage told Hinojosa that she estimates “90% of the women who are in prison in El Salvador are in prison for this”. While that’s obviously an observation rather than hard data, it’s still frightening.Donald Trump has made his admiration for El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, the self-described “coolest dictator in the world”, and his repressive regimevery clear. Increasingly, the two countries seem to be in lockstep. While there’s been a global trend towards liberalizing abortion laws, for example,only four countrieshave bucked this trend and rolled backabortion rights in the past 25 years: the US, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Poland. The arc of the moral universe, as we all know, is long. But in an increasingly authoritarian and misogynistic US, it does not seem to be bending anywhere near justice.Spain seeks to make abortion a constitutional rightOn Friday Spain’s leftist governmentsaid it was planningon following France’s lead and making abortion rights constitutional. “With this government, there will be no backtracking on social rights,” Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on X.Conservatives rush to explain how being pro-death penalty is pro-life“Someone who says I’m against abortion but is in favor of the death penalty is not really pro-life,” Chicago-born Pope Leo XIVsaid this week. “And someone who says I’m against abortion but I’m in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States, I don’t know if that’s pro-life.” The rightwing political commentator Matt Walsh immediately rushed to explain that, actually, the pope’s argument is “moral madness” and the “death penalty is pro-life”. So many mental gymnastics going on there, he deserves a medal.Megachurch pastor pleads guilty to child sexual abuseRobert Morris, who joined the White House spiritual advisory committee during the first Trump presidency,pleaded guiltyto sexually abusing a 12-year-old girl in Oklahoma in the 1980s.Women dominate the World Cheese CompetitionFinally, some gouda news: the Philadelphia cheesemonger Emilia D’Albero and teammate Courtney Johnson recently won first place at theMondial du Fromagein France, a competition sometimes known as the “Cheesemonger Olympics”. “My teammate … and I are the first all-female team USA,” D’Albero said. “They had never sent two girls before.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As with anything that makes me think of my mad little cat, Mackerel, they were a cocktail of guilt, bafflement and love.Let’s start with guilt. The charity Cats Protection has warned against the use of harnesses – as in, leads – because of how they cause cats undue stress by suppressing their flight response and making them feel trapped. I did not know this when I bought a harness for Mackerel, though I worked it out soon enough by her reaction, which was to play dead the second you put her in it. Now, I didn’t buy a harness without reservations, although rather shallowly it was my personal image that ultimately caused me to ditch it. Here is what I wrote in 2020 (from my book The Year of the Cat, which was all about how I adopted Mackerel during an intense period ofmaternal broodinessand pandemic-induced isolation):“Sometimes I see myself from the outside: a childless, thirtysomething freelancer with a cat on a lead that won’t cooperate, and I can’t help but note that this is not how I pictured my life turning out.”They have a way of humbling you, cats, although admittedly Mackerel has always been an oddball. She drinks coffee, for instance, and once watched the whole of Saltburn (about the appropriate target-audience level for that film, in my opinion). But let’s not get sidetracked. The reason I felt bafflement when I read about the one in six cat owners using harnesses is because it made me wonder: just who are all these cooperative, compliant cats that obediently trot down the pavement alongside their humans? I see them on the streets sometimes and always shake my head in disbelief. It’s the same feeling I have whenever I see a photo of a cat wearing a silly little costume: namely, how does its person still have their eyeballs?In my case, it’s really not an unreasonable question. When my son was still a baby, I had to go to Moorfields eye hospital because Mackerel had scratched my sclera while I was trying to nap. She had seen my rare moment of repose as an opportunity to hunt my flickering eyelid. Considering what she’s capable of when I am lying down, one can only imagine her reaction if you tried todress her up as the pope. So, I have long accepted my lack of dominion over her.Much likeCatsProtection, I do have strong opinions about the rights of cats to self-determination. Raised in the countryside, I used to be strongly opposed to even the concept of an indoor cat, let alone the ridiculous idea of a cat on a lead. It seemed to me that it went against nature. Then I met Mackerel, who – after a too-early separation from her mother and an alarming visit to a vet for spaying whereupon he discovered that she didn’t actually have a uterus – simply refused to go outside. This despite being given ample opportunity. The lead was our attempt to acclimatise her to the great outdoors. Almost six years later, she is yet to cross the threshold of her own volition.These days, for that reason, I try hard not to judge other cat people. Cat people love to judge one another, perhaps even more than parents do. More and more humans seem to be treating their pets as if they are their actual offspring (not helped by the vets who call you “Mum” and, hilariously, insist on giving them your surname). On a few occasions when out and about I have stared into a bassinet expecting to see a baby only to find, with a start, a cat or a small dog staring back. Worse, the other day my husband and I were crossing the road and he gestured towards a bloke wearing one of those infant carriers. “What a hideous baby!” he said. I was about to rebuke him when I looked closer and saw that the sling contained not a baby, but a small ginger cat.I am as guilty as anyone of treating my cat as a surrogate child. Yet I do wonder if, just as children have less freedom than they used to, the same is becoming true of some cats. A part of me was relieved when Mackerel decided to be an indoor cat. The hazards facing cats – traffic, foxes, thieves, XL bullies, poison – haven’t changed, but perhaps our protectiveness has. Humans want to keep their precious “fur babies” safe. To lose a cat is, after all, real grief.Nevertheless, as the saying goes, when you love something, you have to set it free. Even against your better judgment, it’s easier said than done. God knows, I’ve bloody tried.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How they achieve that varies: the largest, such as tether and USD Coin, are effectively banks. They hold large reserves in cash, liquid assets, and other investments, and simply use those reserves to maintain a stable price.Others, known as \"algorithmic stablecoins\", attempt to do the same thing but without any reserves. They have been criticised as effectively being backed by Ponzi schemes, since they require continuous inflows of cash to ensure they don't collapse.Stablecoins are an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They provide a safer place for investors to store capital without going through the hassle of cashing out entirely, and allow assets to be denominated in conventional currency, rather than other extremely volatile tokens.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.So, like it or not, many and varied digital currencies are coming, bamboozling all but a minority of the population with impenetrable jargon and an impossibly long list of options.As with all financial services, the urge to prey on customers’ fear and greed is irresistible when it means the provider can get its hands on someone’s savings and turn it into something more exciting, more profitable, and with the risk of default passed back to the customer (sorry, you’ve lost all your money) or the taxpayer (sorry, my bank is bust, can you bail it out).A government that backed a central bank digital currency (CBDC) would be justifiably saying to the finance industry, we need to control this thing because we are on the hook when it goes wrong.The argument in favour of privatisation rests on the moral hazard created by an explicit promise by the public sector to bail out the losers. Much better to keep up the pretence that financial services companies, when caught in a collective tailspin, will be allowed to crash.Rachel Reeves is one of many who want to go down the private route, attracting more and bigger finance companies to the UK.There could be some immediate and practical benefits. Costs will also be lower, we are told, because without a bank standing in between the customer and the seller, charges on credit transactions could fall from 1.5%-3% towards 0.1%. Weekend payments would not have to wait until Monday to be reconciled.Donald Trump is the architect of the most extreme version of private digital money.A well-known crypto currency supporter, he has also pushed for a financial services regime that supports dollar-backed stablecoins.Congress has yet to fill in the vast gaps in the Genius Act, which was passed in the summer with bi-partisan backing, so it is difficult to know exactly how risky US stablecoins will be.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Such a move, in contrast with China’s newly-minted, state-run stablecoin, tells us that the US will truly be the wild west of the world’s digital currencies.As the economics professor and Nobel prize winner Simon Johnson told the Guardian: “We have been here before. I couldn’t tell you when the [stablecoin] crash will come or how severe it will be, but you know it’s coming.”Health warning: Nigel Farage would favour the Trumpian free-for-all.For the UK, following mainland Europe was an option. It has already committed itself to a CBDC and has nine European banks in a consortium lining up a stablecoin for launch next year.While the UK has rejected the US model, it must be legitimate to fear the knock-on effects from Trump’s recklessness when so many US banks have outposts in London, along with many of the world’s shadiest financial firms.In 2021, when former deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe kicked off the stablecoin debate in a series of speeches, the message was clear: however tight the regulation, it would be too cumbersome and too slow to prevent risky behaviour from quickly becoming a systemic problem and even a full-blown banking crisis.At the time, it looked like the UK and the EU would move in lockstep. In the years since, London’s stance has moved westwards, to a mid-Atlantic spot that is supposed to capture the safety Brussels seeks with the competitive spirit that underpins the US model.Maybe the UK central bank is clever enough to develop a system both safe and competitive. It’s a tall order.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesOpinionBitcoinInternetBank of EnglandFinancial sectorAndrew BaileyDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

My prang highlights the neoliberal folly of false economiesSat 4 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Oct 2025 09.40 EDTShareIwas lucky. Last week, I was cycling downhill when I hit a pothole. The front wheel folded into an infinity symbol. I went over the handlebars and, with no time to put my hands out, landed on my face. My helmet and glasses took most of the impact. I emerged, remarkably, with just a few cuts and bruises.My glasses were banjaxed, my bike needed major repairs and my clothes were torn. Altogether, that pothole has cost me about £450. Again, I’m lucky – I can afford it. But the point is this: fixing apotholecosts us between£45 and £90. Not fixing it costs us far more. God knows how many other people have pranged their bikes or wrecked their car tyres in the same hole. Between us, we may have paid hundreds of times the cost of its repair. If people have suffered significant injuries, so must the NHS. One of my correspondents tells me: “I’m three months into recovery from a cycling accident with a pothole that left me being airlifted to hospital with potentially life-threatening injuries. As well as a brain haemorrhage (despite a helmet), I had numerous broken bones and can’t yet walk without crutches.” The cost to the health service must be huge; the cost to him incalculable.Austerity – which leaves our potholes, alongside many other gaps in public provision, unfilled – does not save money. On the contrary, it costs us a fortune. What the rich might save in taxes, the rest must pay over and over again.False economies abound. For example, the government may at last be persuaded to remove the Tories’ vicious, Malthusiantwo-child benefit cap. But what many people have failed to grasp is that behind it stands another brick wall: thehousehold benefits cap. If families now receive money for a third child, it could push them past the household limit, and they’ll be scarcely better off than before. This household cap has extreme and perverse consequences. It ensures that rents, even in the social sector, are almost everywhere unaffordable to thefamilies affected, most of which are headed by lone parents. The result is that they are thrown into temporary accommodation, which local authorities must provide at far greater expense: roughly£2.3bn a year. Being forced into temporary accommodation also curtails adults’ employment opportunities and children’s performance at school, and generates great suffering, which can translate into physical and mental health problems, which of course means further economic impacts.In 2019, aparliamentary committeecalled on the government to “conduct a full cost benefit analysis of the benefit cap”. The governmentrejectedthe call, but said it would explore the possibility in future. I checked with the Department for Work and Pensions – it still hasn’t happened.Keeping people in poverty is an expensive luxury. Poverty persists in rich countries because governments have made a political choice to keep people poor. This choice is driven by two imperatives. The first is a deep, ancient andirrational beliefthat poverty is a vice that must be punished. The second is the bosses’ need to keep us in a state of fear, so that people continue to perform stressful and demeaning work for lousy pay.Or take adult social care. Around 2 million elderly people arenot receivingthe care they need. Many younger adults who could work if they had sufficient care are unable to do so. Some 2.6 million people, mostly women, havegiven up paid workto care for family members, as there are no good alternatives. They lose anaverageof £5,800 in annual earnings, a vast aggregate cost to the country.Insufficient care drives many people into the arms of the NHS: at any one time, 13% of NHS beds are occupied by people waiting forsocial care support. Proper funding would provide a major economic boost, as good care requires a large workforce. According to theFuture Social Care Coalition,for every £1 invested in social care work, £1.75 is generated in the wider economy. But, as aparliamentary inquiryfound, evidence of the costs of failing to provide sufficient care “is scandalously scant or even absent from decision making”. The government counts the costs of provision, but not the costs of non-provision.The shortfall in government funding for social care has caused afinancial crisisin almost every local authority. Other services are being cut to the bone. The potholes crisis, in other words, is a direct result of the social care crisis. In any exploration of the costs and benefits of social care spending, you could include the price of people being airlifted to hospital because the roads are falling apart.Of course, we should be wary of reducing everything to a cost-benefit analysis: many forms of necessary spending will carry a net cost to the exchequer, which is the price we pay for living in a kind and decent society. But this should not prevent us from remarking on the utter perversity of counting only the costs of state spending, while ignoring the benefits.The government, using a definition that means nothing to people falling into potholes, or into temporary accommodation, or into debt, insists austerity has ended, as there has been a slight, albeittemporaryrise in public spending as a percentage of GDP. But when it leaves so many essential services underfunded, the technical definition becomes a sophisticated lie. A more honest definition of austerity is a decline in services caused by a shortfall in funding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that’s neither necessary nor inevitable. If Labour chose, next month’s budget could put us on an entirely different course, one in which we need not suffer smashed glasses, mangled bikes, broken bones, evictions, poverty and neglect, to allow the ultra-rich their private jets, powerboats, beauty spas and second, third or fourth homes. Either they carry the cost, through income tax, wealth tax and a much fairer council tax orproperty tax banding system, or everyone else carries a much higher one.There would be a cost – a political cost – for the government in confronting the massive infrastructure of persuasion the very rich have built, and ending our 14-year sentence of austerity.

Ever since the birth of this nation, its citizens and leaders haveechoed Benjamin Franklin’s admonitionthat “we must all hang together, or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.”InDonald Trump’s America, hanging separately seems to be the order of the day. This seems especially true when it comes to his treatment of this country’s millions of non-citizen residents.From the start of his political career, demonizing immigrantshas been Trump’s stock in trade. Since his return to office, he hasbeen unusually aggressivein his campaign to round up, detain and deport people whose citizenship status is questionable, and, in some cases, citizens have been caught up in the dragnet.The administration has repeatedly violated the constitution bytargetingpeople because of how they look or the sound of their accents. It has even singled them out because of what they have said or written.James Comey’s real ‘crime’? Daring to put the law before loyalty to Trump | Lawrence DouglasRead moreOn 30 September, Judge William Young of the United States district court of Massachusettsmade clearthat when it comes to freedom of speech, the constitutiondoes not distinguishbetween people born in the United States and those who have come here as immigrants. His decision in American Association of University Professors v Rubio offers both a stirring civics lesson and an unusually personal rebuke against the Trump administration. The court found that the Trump administration had violated the right to free speech in its push to detain and deport pro-Palestinian foreign scholars.In his opinion, the judge went beyond the usual bounds of a judicial decision to note that the president “ignores everything … The Constitution, our civil laws, regulations, mores, customs, practices, courtesies – all of it; the President simply ignores it all when he takes it into his head to act”. Young added: “While the President naturally seeks warm cheering and gladsome, welcoming acceptance of his views, in the real world he’ll settle for sullen silence and obedience. What he will not countenance is dissent or disagreement.”The judge also accused the president of “bullying”.Legal purists who might applaud the judge’s reading of the constitution will be offended by seeing that kind of language in a judicial opinion. But what he did helps frame the danger Trump poses to the rights of immigrants in a way that connects them to the rest of us.Bravo, Judge Young.Recallthe case of Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder and graduate of Columbia University. He was arrested anddetainedin March for participating in pro-Palestinian protests on the Columbia University campus. Hewas heldfor more than a hundred days in Louisiana.As his lawyersaidon Democracy Now: “If free speech means anything in this country,” he noted, it means “government agents can’t pick you up off the street and throw you into jail because of what you’ve said.” But that is exactly what the administration did, hoping to make an example out of Khalil and send a chilling message to other immigrants.Or how about Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University graduate student,arrested by masked Ice agentsforwriting an op-edcalling on Tufts to do something to protect human rights in Gaza? As a Washington Post storynotes, “Ozturk had committed no crime, yet her detention was a priority for the new Trump administration. US officials used the immigration system in unprecedented ways to covertly research and detain noncitizen students, relying on an investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security whose work traditionally has focused on crimes such as drug smuggling and human trafficking.”“The effort to deport pro-Palestinian student activists,” the Post reports, “represented the Trump administration’s first major challenge to free-speech norms in the United States.” It had to know that what it was doing violated the First Amendment but went ahead anyway under the pretext that it was acting to prevent or punish terrorist activities.This is not the first time that immigrantshave been punishedfor saying or doing things that an administration labelled dangerous. But since the middle of the 20th century, the supreme courthas heldthat the government cannot deport people because of their views or what they say.At that time, Justice William Douglas explained that “freedom of speech and of the press is accorded aliens residing in this country” and that “the utterances made by … [them] were entitled to that protection”. Justice Frank Murphy joined him and stated: “Once an alien lawfully enters and resides in this country he becomes invested with the rights guaranteed by the Constitution to all people within our borders.”Young cited those views in his own opinion. “Noncitizens’ speech rights are,”he said, “identical to those of citizens.” He argued: “Political speech is not, on its own, a facially legitimate reason for expelling persons from this country.”After laying out in great detail all the things the Trump administration has done to violate that principle, including its mistreatment of Khalil and Öztürk, he called out Trump for ignoring the constitution and acting as if “the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech applies to American citizens alone”.Young called the case he was deciding “perhaps the most important ever to fall within the jurisdiction of this district court”.Citing the language of the first amendment – “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech” – the judge insisted: “‘No law’ means ‘no law.’ The First Amendment does not draw President Trump’s invidious distinction” between citizens and non-citizens, “and it is not to be found in our history”, Young wrote.That reference to “our history” suggests that Trump’s treatment of non-citizens is un-American. But Young was not finished.He added: “Triumphalism is the very essence of the Trump brand. Often this is naught but hollow bragging: ‘my perfect administration,’ wearing a red baseball cap in the presidential oval office emblazoned ‘Trump Was Right About Everything,’ or most recently depicting himself as an officer in the First Cavalry Division.”The US government is facing a crisis of legitimacy | Daniel MendiolaRead moreHe criticized Trump for his “triumphal, transactional, imperative, bellicose, and coarse” language that “seeks to persuade – not through marshaling data driven evidence, science, or moral suasion, but through power”.Near the end of his opinion, Young quotes former president Ronald Reagan. “Freedom,” Reagan said, “is a fragile thing and it’s never more than one generation away from extinction. It is not ours by way of inheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation, for it comes only once to a people …”Returning to Trump, the judge goes on to say: “I’ve come to believe that President Trump truly understands and appreciates the full import of President Reagan’s inspiring message – yet I fear he has drawn from it a darker, more cynical message … [and that he] believes the American people are so divided that today they will not stand up, fight for, and defend our most precious constitutional values so long as they are lulled into thinking their own personal interests are not affected.”By going beyond the precise issue in this case, the free speech rights of immigrants, and going after Trump, Young’s opinion helps frame threats to the rights of immigrants in a way that connects them to the rest of us. He hopes to rekindle the spirit of Reagan and inspire Americans to prove Trump wrong by showing that they will “stand up, fight for, and defend our most precious constitutional values”.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsUS constitution and civil libertiesOpinionUS immigrationDonald TrumpLaw (US)US politicsUS justice systemTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

So why isn’t Keir Starmer using them?Enver SolomonLabour’s incoherent asylum policies are vilifying refugees. A better and more compassionate route is possibleSat 4 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Oct 2025 07.05 EDTShareJust 24 hours after he described providing asylum as the “mark of a decent, compassionate country”,Keir Starmersaid the UK had been too “generous” towards refugees, and announced a plan to end what he described as the asylum “golden ticket,” which allows people to resettle their families in Britain. For a refugee who has pulled the body of their child from the rubble of their bombed-out home, or made a perilous journey alone as a young adult having lost their family, it certainly doesn’t feel this way.The government believes that to deter refugees from crossing the Channel in small boats, it must restrict their ability to reunite in Britain with their immediate family. It must also make it impossible for them to achieve settled status if they have ever claimed benefits or received a criminal record.Labour may think that appearing tough on asylum seekers will win plaudits with those who might otherwise vote Reform. But to combat the rise of Reform, the government needs to do two things. It needs to demonstrate competence on controlling Britain’s borders at the same time as upholding British values of fairness, decency and compassion. This latest asylum announcement signals failure on both fronts.The idea of restricting refugees’ rights to deter small boat crossings is not new.The previous Conservative government did exactly this; it had no real impact on small boat crossings. This is hardly surprising. After all,refugees don’t follow developments in immigration policy. They don’t study the nuances in the family reunion policies of different European countries when deciding where to head.Asmall proportion of refugees in Europe come to the UK. Those that do come here do so because they have existing links with the UK. They may already have family here, or know of long-standing diaspora communities, or have linguistic and cultural links from the Commonwealth. Changing rules that nobody knows about will not change their decision-making.The government is grasping at failed policies. This is concerning to say the least. There are ways to reduce the number of people risking their lives in the Channel: the “one in, one out” deal with France could be a step in the right direction if it’s implemented with the right safeguards and protections. The government should be focusing on getting this right while considering other legal routes, instead of policies that will only lead to more broken promises and push ever more exasperated voters closer towards Reform.Reducing boat crossings is complex. It will take time. In the meantime, there are meaningful ways that the government can demonstrate competence and control immediately. The key is closing the hotels, which are the most visible symbol of a broken system. TheRefugee Council has published a proposalshowing how the government could end hotel use within a year by introducing a one-off scheme to give people from countries where they are almost certain to be recognised as refugees permission to stay for a limited period, subject to rigorous security checks.Closing hotels and scaling up the deal with the French in a way that respects the rights of asylum seekers and treats them with dignity could have a significant impact. It could also restore public confidence. But taking away the right to be reunited with family members and erecting numerous barriers to settlement simply vilifies refugees. Under the government’s plans, a widowed refugee would be prevented from ever becoming a British citizen, for which settled status is a prerequisite, because it is almost certain that she will not have immediately found a job that would allow her to rent a home without receiving a top-up of housing benefit.It doesn’t matter if that woman works two jobs, attends evening classes, studies for a degree and raises British children who become hard-working, tax-paying members of society. It will never be enough. She will never be considered permanent. She will never be able to become a proud British citizen. This is not decent or fair. It does not reward hard work or entrepreneurialism. It is punitive, and it smacks of a desperate attempt to counter Reform.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At that moment, I loved the entire American administration. Only at that moment, of course,” he said with a grin in a Vilnius cafe, his hair still cropped from prison.View image in fullscreenFormer political prisoner Mikola Dziadok.Photograph: Dziyana PinchukDziadok, 37, was among 52 political prisonersreleasedand deported to exile in neighbouring Lithuania earlier this month – one of the largest such pardons in Belarus’s post-Soviet history, and the latest ploy by Lukashenko, the shrewd authoritarian who has ruled Belarus for decades and close ally of Vladimir Putin, in his effort to improve relations with the Trump administration.But the prison release, which followed earlier ones, including that of the opposition leader Syarhei Tsikhanouski in June, has come with strings attached. And Lukashenko’s prisons remain packed, with 1,168 political detainees still behind bars, according to the human rights group Viasna – a number that includes its founder, the Nobel peace prize laureate Ales Bialiatski.Through a series of diplomatic overtures, Lukashenko has nudged Belarus out of years of western isolation that followed hiscrackdownsat home and support for Russia’s war in Ukraine. Washington’s decision to ease its first sanctions in response to the prisoner release, along with Trump’s hint of a possible meeting with Lukashenko, marked a tangible victory for a leader long treated as a pariah in the west.But critics now say Lukashenko is wielding political prisoners as bargaining chips – trading their freedom for international concessions while continuing repression at home.While welcoming Trump’s efforts, several of those released said they were acutely aware of the trade-off.“The most important thing is not to substitute the liberation of the country [from Lukashenko] with the release of political prisoners,” said Sergei Sparysh, a 39-year-old activist from the Narodnaya Hramada party freed in the same deal.View image in fullscreenFormer political prisoner Sergei Sparysh stands beside a poster showing him before his imprisonment.Photograph: Pjotr SauerIn an interview in Vilnius, he stressed that the Belarusian authorities had no intention of easing their clampdown on dissent. “Fifty people were freed, but then about 50 new people were imprisoned. What is the point of this? They release us now, and then Trump will bargain over these 50 new people,” he shrugged.The more than 1,000 political detainees also include Maria Kolesnikova, the musician turned opposition leader who rejected exile by tearing up her passport at the border. Observers say freeing them all at once would strip Lukashenko of leverage.The repression that filled those cells began during the widely disputed presidential election of August 2020, whenhundreds of thousands of Belarusians took to the streetsto demand Lukashenko’s exit.Dziadok and Sparysh were swept up in that wave of arrests, alongside journalists, activists and ordinary citizens accused of “extremism” for a like, a donation or a critical comment online.On a rare visit by western reporters to Minsk, the Guardian last week attended the trial of Ihar Ilyash, a journalist arrested in October 2024.His wife, fellow reporter Katsiaryna Bakhvalava, is already serving an eight-year sentence for “high treason” after covering the 2020 protests. Standing motionless inside a glass cage, Ilyash was sentenced to four years on extremism charges for articles critical of Lukashenko.Freed prisoners say they need no imagination to picture his fate: long years of isolation and inhuman conditions in what many call a prison system more brutal than Russia’s.“Belarus is a testing ground for repression. First it happens here … then Putin does it a few years later,” said Dziadok. He described gruelling conditions inside Belarus’s prisons, where guards had devised their own chilling vocabulary for torture.“There is the ‘disco’ – when they beat you with a stun gun while you are cuffed,” he said. “The ‘quick charge’ is a full-power shock. And the ‘lawyer’ is when guards beat you with batons. You say, ‘I want a lawyer’. They reply, ‘here’s your lawyer’.”Survivors of the system said the torment was as much psychological as physical. “It’s impossible to truly understand it unless you have been through it,” said Sparysh, nervously turning a pen in his hands as he spoke. Midway through the interview, he paused, seeming too unwell to continue before insisting he would.Sparysh recalled how political inmates were routinely thrown intoshizo– tiny solitary punishment cells – for trivial offences such as an unbuttoned shirt or unpolished shoes.Much of the cruelty, however, was outsourced. A system rooted in Soviet penal traditions set violent criminals against political detainees. “Ordinary criminals are used to bully political prisoners,” Dziadok said.It is also used to isolate them, former prisoners said. Ordinary inmates were ordered not to speak to political prisoners, and those who did risked swift punishment. “It’s surreal … imagine being in a barracks with 60 people and not one dares to say a word to you,” said Dziadok.Inmates also face medical neglect. “They don’t treat you until you collapse,” he said of Hrodna prison in western Belarus, where he spent most of his sentence.He added that the message from the guards was clear: “The more of you die here, the better the situation in the country will be.”He said: “In my jail alone, four prisoners died. Two from illnesses that could have been prevented. One hanged himself. And one was beaten to death by another prisoner.”View image in fullscreenAles Pushkin was detained in 1999 after he brought a wheelbarrow filled with manure and dumped it in front of Lukashenko’s office.Photograph: APAmong them was the 57-year-old artist Ales Pushkin, acartoonistwho once dumped a cart of manure outside the president’s office. “I was sitting in a nearby cell, and heard how it happened,” Dziadok said of Pushkin, who died in 2023 as a result of illness.Some of the more grim accounts from those recently released describe how inmates with politically charged tattoos were targeted – forced to remove them themselves or held down while guards did it for them.Lukashenko says Belarus treats inmates “normally”, adding that “prison is not a resort”.Dziadok and Sparysh are now adjusting to life abroad. Their Belarusian passports were confiscated by the government as part of the release, leaving them without documents.Staying politically relevant from outside the country, they admit, may prove difficult.For others, exile was never an option. When the bus came to pick up the freed prisoners from the Lithuanian border, one person was missing.Mikalai Statkevich, 69, a veteran opposition figure and former general repeatedly jailed for challenging Lukashenko, was brought to the border with the others. But unlike them, he refused to step across. Security footage showed him standing silently for a long moment in no man’s land between Belarus and Lithuania, before turning back to his homeland.“He had long ago decided never to leave Belarus … A true leader must remain in the country,” said Sparysh, a longtime friend and political ally, holding up the bag of clothes Statkevich left behind when he walked back into Belarusian custody.Statkevich has not been heard from since and is believed to be back behind bars.His decision to remain in Belarus underscored the complex choices behind the mass releases: a moment of relief for freed prisoners and their families, but one that many say leaves the machinery of repression intact.Still, Dziadok said he remained thankful for the US diplomacy that had secured their freedom.“Regardless of whether I approve of Trump’s views or not, I am truly grateful that thanks to him efforts are being made to free people,” Dziadok said.But he cautioned that the west should not be “fooled or deceived” by Lukashenko’s tactics, urging Trump to push for a full halt of political repression in Belarus.“The most important thing right now is saving people, because people are really dying.”Explore more on these topicsBelarusAlexander LukashenkoEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what they are not entirely used to – yet – is the sight of a robot pulling up to their front door. The co-founder ofSkype, Ahti Heinla, believes his new venture is about to change that.Heinla is the chief executive of Starship Technologies, a startup that, he claimed, is able to operate deliveries run by trundling robots at a small profit – and cheaper than a human delivery driver, even in small towns and villages where delivery has not previously been viable.“We’ve solved everything that there is to solve,” Heinla said over lunch at a London hotel. “You could count how many years this is or how many months this is. But it will happen. It’s very clear it will happen.”Residents of Manchester, Leeds, Cambridge andMilton Keynes in the UK, across Finland, and in Heinla and Starship’s home country of Estonia have all received food and groceries from the robots. They are becoming increasingly mainstream: they made an appearance at a 10 Downing Street garden party, andin an episodeofThe Bear, the hit US restaurant drama. Starship has made 8m deliveries with only 200 employees, but the company wants that number to rocket.Heinla has already made a lot of money by co-creating software that became a verb:to Skype.In 2000, Heinla was a video game developer who was hired by Skype co-founders Niklas Zennström and Jaan Tallinn, a fellow Estonian, to write some new code quickly. That became thefilesharing programme Kazaa, and then, using similar tech, Skype. The six-strong founding team ended upselling to the online auction site eBay for $3.1bn (£2.3bn) in 2005.That was an age ago in tech time – Skype closed this year, and Heinla says of that time”: “It’s almost like a different me.” Heinla would not reveal how much he made, but he could, he said, do the ex-tech boss thing flying in private jets if he wanted to.View image in fullscreenAhti Heinla says robotics could ‘touch everybody’s lives’ through autonomous deliveries.Photograph: noneBut he does not want to. “I do see a lot of people in the world just trying to pursue money for money’s sake, even if they have enough,” the Estonian said. “I’m not like that. I’m sure I’m not interested in money or making money.“I don’t need more. Why should I need it? Why do I have a palace? Why? What’s the point?”Instead, Heinla said that making a success of autonomous delivery is one of the quickest ways that robotics could “touch everybody’s lives”.After Skype, Heinla founded various businesses, including a shortlived social network effort. In 2014, he decided to enter a competition run by the US space agency Nasa to design a cheap Mars rover. Nasa did not choose the design, but what was good enough to cover extraterrestrial terrain could also handle wonky paving on urban roads. Radars, cameras, and ultrasound sensors watched out for obstacles, while the system learned from experience.By 2017, the robots were driving in Estonia without an accompanying “safety walker” – which Heinla claimed were the first unsupervised robots driving autonomously in public. In 2018, the company launched its pilot commercial service onMilton Keynes’s predictable grid of streets. It is working with fellow Estonian tech company Bolt, the UK’s Co-op supermarket chain and the US food delivery company Grubhub, among others.View image in fullscreenA Starship Technologies robot making grocery deliveries in Milton Keynes, England.Photograph: Justin Long/AlamyStarship may well have the largest fleet of autonomous vehicles in the world. However, it will face competition as autonomous technology improves. Rivals include US startups Serve Robotics and Nuro, plus Saudi Arabia-backed Noon. There could also be a challenge from the host of companies developing autonomous cars, ranging from the US’s Tesla to China’s Baidu.Perhaps the most eye-catching rivals are those that have slipped the bonds of earth: the Dublin startupManna Aero is already delivering coffeesand pizzas using flying drones, whileAmazonand Google sister company Wing have also tried out drone services.A common complaint from many of these companies is that they are being held back by inconsistent rules. Starship has had to negotiate with each individual council in the UK, holding back its rollout. In contrast, the company is making 1m deliveries a year in Finland – where the government introduced national legislation on what robots were allowed on pavements – to a population of 5.6 million; in the UK far fewer robots serve 69 million people.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we could have more, we could have much more.”He cited the example of a potential customer in the UK that has delivery in 200 sites, but wants to add it in 800 more, including those outside big towns and cities.View image in fullscreenA Starship Technologies robot crosses a road during tests in Northampton, UK.Photograph: Brian Tomlinson/Starship Technologies“That is a unique part that robots could be doing,” said Heinla. “And we want to do that. We want to bring delivery to the small towns in the UK as well. We’re ready to invest in scale.”Many economists and futurists have longwarned that the rise of robotswilltake human jobs. Heinla argued that Starship’s robots are not stealing jobs, but rather will address the burgeoning demand for deliveries, while humans focus on longer and more complicated jobs. He also argued that robots will help smaller stores “to thrive economically and compete with the larger, more central operations”. “Giving more capabilities to people is useful,” he added.Starship has raised just over €200m (£175m), with the last funding round led by Plural Partners in London and other venture capitalists primarily in Europe. That is far less than the billions raised in recent years by rapid delivery companies reliant on humans. However, many of those companies –Getir,GorillasandWeezy, among others – flamed out after raising huge sums.Robots have an upfront cost – several thousand pounds, but below €10,000, said Heinla – but overall costs per delivery are “comparable to what it costs with people, but it’s less”, he said, while declining to share precise figures. He said that Starship deliveries generate cash.“We are not a fully profitable business yet, but I’m sure we will be,” he said.Some retailers are sceptical that robots can be more efficient than human riders offered by the likes of Deliveroo and Uber Eats. However, Heinla argued that robots can work for restaurants and retailers in less densely populated urban areas because they do not need to be paid for idle time.“Almost every company that does delivery will need this,” he said. “At some point it will be not even a choice, because it will just be so much cheaper to do it by robot.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryRobotsSkypeEntrepreneursTechnology sectorTechnology startupsCouriers/delivery industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The force said after a short pursuit, police temporarily lost sight of it. Officers then drove on to The Roundway and found the vehicle had been involved in a collision with another vehicle.A Met spokesperson said: “Police were on patrol at around 00.52hrs when they attempted to stop a vehicle of interest on Pretoria Road, N18.“After pursuing the vehicle for around 60 seconds, police temporarily lost sight before locating the vehicle on the Roundway, N17, where it had been involved in a collision.“Officers were supported by the London ambulance service and the London air ambulance, and a 19-year-old man was taken to hospital where he sadly died.“He has since been named as Marcus Fakana from Tottenham. His next of kin are aware and continue to be supported by specialist officers. They wish for their privacy to be respected at this difficult time.“The driver arrested close to the scene of the collision has since been charged with multiple offences.”Fakana, who was 18 at the time of the relationship,received a royal pardon from Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum,in July after being sentenced to a year in prison.Radha Stirling, the chief executive of campaign group Detained in Dubai, said she was “heartbroken” to share the news.She said: “Marcus spent the majority of this year in a Dubai prison which no doubt caused him long-lasting mental anguish.“It’s sad that of all of 2025, he was only free for the three months from the 3rd of July until the 3rd of October.”Stirling added: “Mr [Fakana’s] loss is a painful reminder of how precious life is and how unnecessary imprisonment robs people of time they can never regain.Raphaella Stirling, the crisis manager at Detained in Dubai,saidin a post on X: “Marcus had only been released from prison earlier this year. Despite everything he endured, he was grateful for the kindness of the British public, and he embraced his freedom with renewed faith, joy, and hope for the future.“His loss is a painful reminder of how precious life is and how unnecessary imprisonment robs people of time they can never regain. Every day of freedom matters. Rest in peace Marcus.”Tributes were paid to Fakana on social media. One person expressed their condolences and said: “I fought for you to be released from prison in Dubai, I did my best and this is how it ended.”Fakana had been with his parents in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from the end of August 2024 when a “holiday romance blossomed” with another Londoner, who has since turned 18, Detained in Dubai previously said. She wasreportedlyone month from turning 18.After returning to the UK and seeing pictures and messages, the girl’s mother reported the relationship to Dubai police, who then arrested Fakana at his hotel, it was alleged.Fakana previously said the pair had kept their “holiday romance” secret from the girl’s family “because they were strict”, and they had hoped to continue seeing each other back in the UK. Detained in Dubai said he felt frightened when police officers arrested him.In Dubai, if an adult has a sexual relationship with a person under 18, they can be prosecuted for having a sexual relationship with a minor. In the UK, the age of consent is 16.Police said Marwaan Mohamed Huseen, of Tottenham, had been charged with causing death by dangerous driving, driving without insurance, driving without a licence and failing to stop. He was due to appear at Highbury corner magistrates’ court on Saturday. The Met’s directorate of professional standards was informed about the incident along with the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

For the previous three years the business also appears to have been late publishing its confirmation statement, which provides details of a company’s shareholders.All four of the delayed filings aretechnically criminal offences, albeit ones that are very rarely pursued. In the three previous years the compulsory strike off action was discontinued after the filings were made. The company, which has no directors, also appears to have a county court judgment against it for £497.A business with a similar name, Mansfield Carpets Limited, was registered by the politician last year, although he resigned as a director of the company after the local elections in May. Gail Barton is now its sole director.Three further flooring businesses containing the word “Mansfield” in the company name have previously been registered with Gail Barton as a director – all of which have now been dissolved.Mick Barton’s LinkedIn profile, which does not appear to have been updated since he becameleader of Nottinghamshire council in May, states: “I’ve been self-employed since I left British Coal in 1992, after 10 years underground. I then became a sales director of a worldwide vehicle supply company for 10 years, before starting my own flooring supply and fitting company.“This, my wife still runs today, as local government takes up most of my time. I’m still involved with the company, doing the estimating and surveying and overlooking the contract side.”The council leader attracted national media attention aftersaying in Augustthat he would no longer deal with the Nottingham Post, its online edition and a team of BBC-funded local democracy journalists that it manages, while alsopreventing the titles from receiving updates and press releases.Last month, the publisher of the Nottingham Post warned of an “increasingly Trumpian approach” to the media creeping into British politics.David Higgerson, the chief content officer for Reach, the owner of the Daily Mirror and a series of local titles including the Nottingham Post, said it was part of a trend that went wider than Reform.He said: “When journalists are blocked from doing their job, it’s not just a concern for the media – it’s a concern for the public. Over the last few years we’ve seen this increasingly Trumpian approach creep in – and not only from Reform politicians – where legitimate questions are met with hostility or silence.”The paper said this week itplans to take legal action, arguing the ban is a breach of its right to free expression. The council said on Thursday that it will nowprovide the Post with press releases and invite it to council events.Barton said he would not comment on his family’s business. Gail Barton did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNottinghamshireLocal politicsLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

The judgment came just minutes after Combs had pleaded with Judge Arun Subramanian that he took full “accountability and responsibility” for his actions, and stating that he was a changed man who would, if released, devote himself to his family and community.Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sentenced to more than four years in prison on prostitution-related chargesRead moreThe sentence down came with barely a noise in the courtroom. Combs’ family members and supporters had been warned by a court clerk to keep any expression of their feelings in check.After the sentence was delivered, Combs appeared surprised to find two court marshals behind him, ready to lead him back to Metropolitan detention center in Brooklyn, where he has been incarcerated since his arrest 13 months ago.Outside the courtroom, there was a palpable sense of deflation as neither prosecutors nor Combs’s defense had got the result they wanted. A trial that had heard graphic accounts of sexual abuse, which the defendant had claimed was consensual, ended in a kind of whimper. The sentence handed down – four years, two months - was 10 months less than a sentencing panel recommended and less than half of the 135 months, or 11 years, prosecutors requested.Combs is likely to spend only three more years behind bars, with time he has already served subtracted. But the sentence was also, clearly, far longer than Combs and his supporters had wanted, and perhaps even expected.Combs was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage prostitution in July, charges stemming from forcing girlfriends to engage in elaborate “freak-offs” involving male prostitutes. But on the more serious charges – of running a mafia-like conspiracy that prosecutors claimed were designed on to fulfill a need for power and control – he was found not guilty.“No matter what anybody says, I know that I’m truly sorry,” he told Subramanian. “I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego. Because of my decisions, I lost my freedom. I beg your honor for mercy.”Combs’s lawyer had spent much of the day arguing that his client was a devoted family man who had lost control of his life after surgery in 2000 that left him addicted to painkillers as his life spiralled out of control. Combs’s six adult children spoke on his behalf.But the judge was unmoved by the defense arguments that Combs should be released, effectively, on time served. They left no stone unturned in that effort, making arguments based on racial justice, childhood trauma, and his former position as a business and Black community leader.Subramanian appeared unpersuaded by Combs’s testimony that he was a reformed man, pointing out that he had engaged in an abusive “freak-off” with “Jane”, a witness in the trial, even after he posted an Instagram apology following the release of video showing him beating another former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura.The judge pointed to testimony offered by Jane, an influencer, in which Combs had directed her to “take this fucking pill, get out there, suck his dick [referring to an escort]. You’re not going to ruin my night.”“You abused them, physically, emotionally and psychologically,” Subramanian told Combs. “Why did it happen for so long? Because you had the power and resources to keep it going, and because you didn’t get caught.”He lavished praise on Ventura and Jane for coming forward, calling them “strong women”.“Nothing about this case is good,” the judge lamented, “except for the victims who came forward.”But even in its denouement, the trial of Sean Combs had an air of a carnival. In court, family members came dressed elaborately, while outside federal court in lower Manhattan supporters and influencers each seemed to shout more loudly than the next into live-streaming phones, each propelled by excitement induced by proximity to Combs’s celebrity.However Combs’s trial will be remembered – as an overreach by prosecutors who bet on turning a sex-trafficking case into a mafia-like conspiracy, or as an episode in long story about brutal coercion involving money, sex and power – Diddy himself may have said it best: he told the hearing his behavior had been “disgusting, shameful and sick”.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsnewsShareReuse this content"

They’re in very old trees. They can’t be rehabilitated or brought back at the pace that the Baudin’s needs them to be.”The state’s Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) recently opened up Alcoa’s proposals for community consultation; the first time the public has had a chance to scrutinise the company’s operations in the area in 60 years.It received more than 59,000 submissions – the highest number ever through a consultation process. Almost 90% were template responses, pre-written as part of an organised campaign, and the EPA said the record volume of responses highlighted the public’s interest in the assessment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The authority would then deliver a report with its recommendations to the state’s environment minister, he said.From blackening skies to barely casting a shadow – the Carnaby’s cockatoo faces a bleak futureRead moreAn Alcoa spokesperson said the company believed environmental factors should be “purposefully considered and responsibly managed in conjunction with development activities necessary to produce the aluminium required to meet growing global demand, largely driven by requirements for decarbonisation”.“In both our current mining areas, and in future mining areas before the WA EPA – a proposal which involves clearing less than a 1 per cent additional area of the Northern Jarrah Forest over the next 20 years – we have avoidance measures in place to protect areas of high conservation value,” they said.“Our environmental review documentation outlines the mitigation measures that Alcoa considers will ensure there are no significant impacts to threatened species including black cockatoos.”The spokesperson said proposed mitigation measures included avoiding known and potential black cockatoo nesting trees and having buffer zones around them.Henryon said Baudin’s were so familiar to Western Australians, “we almost take them for granted”.“We have these birds flying around; they are part of the south-west’s identity. Are we happy for them to just fade away?” he said.“If we want to protect them, we need to look after their homes.

This compared with 27% for Reform, 16% for Labour, 15% for the Liberal Democrats, and the Conservatives’ total of 14%.When answers from just London were taken, the Greens came top, with 27% of the first-preference choices, against 20% forLabour, 16% Reform, 15% Conservatives and 14% Lib Dems.The difference was even more notable among voters aged 18 to 24, with 36% putting the Greens as their most-favoured choice. Next were Labour on 24%, then 14% for the Lib Dems and just 6% each for the Conservatives and Reform.In a sign of how the Greens under Polanski could take support from former Labour voters, another breakdown of the polling showed nearly a quarter of people who voted for Keir Starmer last year now ranked the Greens as their favourite party.Speaking to the Guardian at the conference, Polanski, whowon the electionto lead the Greens in England and Wales a month ago, reiterated the pledge in his speech to the gathering that the party was aiming for Labour.“I think it’s already happening,” he said. “It’s happening at defection level. Just last month in Barking and Dagenham, we welcome three new councillors to the party. It’s also happening right across England and Wales.This is the Green party’s moment – not Farage’s. As leader, I’ll offer real solutions to Britain’s problems | Zack PolanskiRead more“At local council elections, there was a stunning victory recently in Brighton, where the Labour vote completely collapsed and the Green vote rocketed. Reform are still a worry, yes, and the fact that they’re polling even reasonably in London is a real threat, I think, to anyone who’s a progressive voice.“But absolutely, the plan has always been to replace Labour at the electoral level, starting at the local level, and I think we’re on track to do that.”Labour MPs and strategists are deeply worried about how the party will fare next May in elections for the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, and for a series of councils across England.In London, where about 1,800 council seats across 32 boroughs are being contested, there is concern in Labour, which won nearly 44% of the seats when they were last contested in 2022, that there could be heavy losses to Reform UK in more suburban outer boroughs and to the Greens in more central areas.In his speech on Friday, Polanski warned against what he called the “managed decline” of the Labour government, predicting that unless he changed course, Starmer would “hand this country on a plate” to Reform.Polanski said the Greens would be pushing for “seats right across London”, adding: “What I’m excited about is … that [support is] pretty evenly spread, and that [we] will be campaigning in places that we haven’t traditionally campaigned in before.”Explore more on these topicsGreen partyZack PolanskiOpinion pollsLabourReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

He later splashed down on the Tiber in Rome to national acclaim, having flown via Asia to Australia and back over seven months, taking off and landing in water 80 times.Aviation has been marked by stop-start journeys on hitherto uncharted courses to unlikely, if not unreachable, destinations. Today’s collective act of faith – amidmuch scepticism– is in following an uncertainpath to sustainability, through green fuelsthat are yet to be widely produced.Most in the aviation industry, even if only through self-interest, are on board with the theory. Of the identified emissions cuts needed for carbon neutrality, 70% rely on sustainable aviation fuels, or SAF. “Without it,” says Tim Alderslade, of Airlines UK, “we cannot get anywhere near net zero by 2050.”This year, the first steps were imposed by mandate in the EU and the UK, requiring 2% of jet fuel to be sustainable – by 2030, that reaches 6% in the EU and 10% in Britain.However, airlines have questioned whether supplies will be available and at what price. A fissure is developing between those that have secured sources of SAF and invested in technologies, and others with a ferocious eye on the bottom line.Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, dismisses SAF as nonsense. He says: “It is all gradually dying a death, which is what it deserves to do. We have just about met our 2% mandate. There is no possibility of meeting 6% by 2030; 10%, not a hope in hell. We’re not going to get to net zero by 2050.”View image in fullscreenRyanair chief Michael O’Leary claims SAF is ‘gradually dying a death’.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersMore measured voices among SAF’s champions also have concerns. Willie Walsh, director general of the worldwide airline trade body Iata, had pushed for fuel tanks to contain 5% SAF by 2030. He admitted last week to disappointment in progress, adding he did “not believe that target can be achieved given where we are in terms of SAF production”.At least, he said, the case for SAF had been proved: “We now need to turn what we know is technically possible into something that’s commercially possible and commercially viable for the industry.”The UK is trying to create the framework with a revenue certainty mechanism. A bill currently going through parliament will guarantee a price for SAF, to encourage investment in production. The Department for Transport in July allocated £63m to 17 companies looking to make SAF in Britain. A spokesperson said there were “encouraging early signs towards meeting the mandate”. But only Phillips 66 in Humberside is making SAF at scale, with the five plants promised under Boris Johnson’s “jet zero” strategy yet to appear.Carrots and sticks are needed, with big oil companies having ever less incentive to go green when invited to drill for easy profit.Shell’s decision to stop construction of a Rotterdam biofuel plant, expected to be one of Europe’s biggest converters of waste to jet fuel, will make SAF rarer and dearer. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill” slashes US incentives for SAF production introduced by Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act – although, in a concession to American crop farmers, some subsidies on homegrown SAF feedstocks will continue for two more years.Philip New, a former BP alternative energy executive and government adviser on SAF, says: “I’m very pessimistic about SAF in the US. There’s no mandate or regulations or reason to use it.”Beyond the US, geopolitics could weigh on supplies in various ways, he says. Tariffs could divert more Chinese cooking oil for SAF in Europe; meanwhile, Asian countries introducing their own mandates and quotas may not want to export.New still believes SAF will come but warns: “It is going to be a lumpy transition.”View image in fullscreenVirgin Atlantic’s flight 100, the first commercial airplane to be making a transatlantic flight with 100% alternative fuels, at Heathrow airport in 2023.Photograph: Virgin Atlantic/EPACurrent UK and EU mandates can be met entirely with HEFA (hydrotreated esters and fatty acid) based SAF, made from sources such as recycled cooking oil – though itsprovenance has been questioned. The bigger hurdles come as governments demand second generation (2G) SAF, made of feedstocks such as household rubbish.Alderslade says production of 2G is “the great unknown”. Missing the mandate, he says, will bring financial penalties “which inevitably will be passed through to passengers”.New says: “In theory this is a really great way of getting rid of our waste.” The challenge is getting the right level of support to back up the very high-risk first generations of these technologies.” Even with government backing, the 2G targets for 2030 are unlikely to be met, he adds.Despite the risks, investors see the long-term value. One global asset manager, who declined to be named, said the US was an outlier in abandoning net zero, with mandates coming to Asia as well as Europe. “For oil majors, SAF is lower priority, it’s hard – some people are giving up. But airlines can’t abandon it. It’s going to be bumpy – but is it all coming down? No.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

IAG says there will be enough SAF to meet EU and UK mandates until 2030. But a spokesperson added: “Second and third generation SAFs do require more investment and development [and] support … Mandates are one lever to stimulate demand but investment in production is key.”Green shootsare still appearing: a Belfast company, Catagen, last month launched patented modular technology which it said could produce SAF at quantities needed in the vicinity of smaller airports, a development endorsed by Ryanair.For BA’s home airport, the debate has particular urgency: if the sustainable aviation roadmap crumbles, Heathrow’s third runway becomes ever more politically difficult.View image in fullscreenThe director of carbon strategy at Heathrow says the airport is already leading globally sustainable aviation fuel use, with 17% of the world’s SAF in 2024 being used there.Photograph: Jack Taylor/ReutersMatt Gorman, director of carbon strategy at Heathrow, insists: “SAF is not hypothetical. Heathrow is already leading globally in SAF use, 17% of the world’s SAF in 2024 was used here. This is real progress, not a future promise.”Some environmental campaigners, while remaining firmly against Heathrow expansion, have shifted on SAF, accepting it as a potential route to future decarbonisation – even if many fear it acts as a fig leaf to deflect environmental concerns today. But plenty of campaigners and scientists still question the fundamental premise of SAF and its calculations of carbon reductions.Planes will continue to emit CO2 as usual at the tailpipe – and in the broader context, will still be depleting resources. Matt Finch, in a report for the Aviation Environment Federation, said: “The blunt truth is that there is not a single SAF feedstock that can’t be used in another sector where it would bring a desirable environmental outcome. And in some cases, that outcome is already what a large proportion of the waste is used for. “That caveat applies even for the gold standard fuel, third generation, or e-SAF, created via CO2 capture and renewable electricity. It has been synthesised in small quantities, and tested in a Swiss “solar fuel” flight this July. But e-SAF requires green hydrogen, supplies of which, Walsh says, are “very limited, and also extremely expensive”. Investors in e-SAF right now, according to the City insider, “will probably lose their money”.Where the technology goes is unclear, history suggests. De Pinedo was to die eight years after his seaplane feats, in a conventional plane taking off from a runway in New York in 1933. Flying boats were superseded by the advent of jet aircraft during the second world war.“Predicting the future will always involve some uncertainty,” Gorman says. “But what we’re doing is not guesswork.

Children walking alongside elderly people are guided by members of Múuch’ Xíinbal, a Maya land rights organisation. The placards they carry declare: “Water is not for sale.” A heavy chant accompanies the march: “It’s not a drought – it’s plunder!”At a rallying point in the city, protesters read from a manifesto and accuse the government of prioritising profit over water, health and land. They denounce a wave of mega-projects imposed without their consent, fromindustrial-scale pig farmsto thecontroversial Maya Traintourist expansion. But they reserve their greatest anger for the Heineken brewery in Kanasín, near Mérida, which wasannounced in June.To many of Yucatán’s Maya people, the plans for the Heineken factory are seen not as a promising development, but as a continuation of a deeper problem: of government-backed industrial developments that threaten water supplies and human rights, leaving local communities caught in an uneven conflict to protect their cultural and environmental survival.View image in fullscreenHeineken’s chief executive, Oriol Bonaclocha, announcing the brewery plans at the National Palace in June next to Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum.Photograph: Raquel Cunha/ReutersAs part of a $2.75bn (£2.05bn) investment plan, the Heineken brewery is expected to generate2,500 jobs, directly and indirectly, including300 permanent positions. Indigenous communities havecriticised a lack of community consent– disputing the company’s claim that consultations took placelast December– and raising concerns about its environmental impacts, particularly the effects of its water use on local communities.Beer is primarily water.

Heineken says the Mérida brewery’s water usage will follow the principles of ‘reduce, re-use and replenish’.Photograph: José Luis González/ReutersHeineken says it will produce 400m litres(100m US gallons) of beer a year, and plans to limit water use to two litres for every litre of beer.But one estimatesuggests this could mean losing 1bn litres of water at the current rate of 2.6 litres for every litre of beer.Activists say this isenough water to support 28,000 familiesin a region where about 121,000 peoplelacked access to drinking water in 2020, and water availability has fallen by more than 50% since 2003. TheDialogues on Alcohol Forumhas also noted that in some rural areas of Mexico, alcohol is more readily available than drinking water.The company also saysits new brewery will reduce its water consumption with “circular economy practices that ensure water re-use through cutting-edge treatment systems” and aims to minimise waste and operate using renewable energy.View image in fullscreenAcenotenear large pig and poultry farms in Muna, Yucatán.Photograph: Héctor Vivas/GettyBut Adrian Forrester, founder of the Mexican craft brewery Cerveceria Bóruma, says this is not enough. Most of the water used to clean production tanks can be recycled, he says, but the enormous volume of Heineken’s production inevitably makes it water-intensive.“Beer is primarily water; they are still taking a lot out tomake the product. That’s millions of litres a day,” he says. The pressure on water supply, Forrester says, is “less about the water recycling, and more about the raw extraction of groundwater to produce at that scale”.These companies have a history of claiming they will treat the wastewater using the latest technology to prevent contamination, but then they do notPedro Uc Be, activistCommunities are also concerned about pollution. Large-scalebreweries are required by law to treat wastewaterproduced during beer manufacturing, as it contains high levels of chemicals and organic compounds that can harm soils and contaminate groundwater.Uc Be worries about compliance. “Unfortunately, these companies have a history of claiming they will treat the wastewater using the latest technology to prevent contamination, but then they do not.”He mentions the huge pig farms, which were accused ofpolluting the Cenote Ringwith untreated wastewater. Allegations were made against the Modelo brewery in Hunucmá in 2018 after thediscovery of carcinogenic agrochemicalsin the drinking water of 40 Yucatán municipalities. Ananalysis of state recordspublished in July found that only 3% of the state’s wastewater was being treated, which it attributes to a lack of operational plants.View image in fullscreenIndustrial pig farms in Opichen, Mexico. Some Indigenous communities have called for a moratorium on such megafarms.Photograph: Héctor Vivas/Getty ImagesHeineken says it conducted a free, prior and informed consultation with assistance from the Kanasín state government, in which “communities approved the project and agreements for shared benefits were signed”.‘You can’t even wash your hands’: is a global industrial hub responsible for the destruction of Mexico’s Atoyac River?Read moreThe company also says it carried out a water-feasibility study before investing in the project, that its water usage follows the principles “reduce, re-use and replenish”, and that it aims for the new brewery to exceed the water consumption efficiency of its Meoqui plant in the state of Chihuahua – 1.7 litres of water for every litre of beer.Indigenous groups say they are often excluded from decisions that affect their land and water. Mexico has signed aninternational treatythat requires “free and informed consent” from Indigenous peoples before activities that could affect them are undertaken, but the Maya feel that right is systematically ignored.Maya groupsandUN expertshave criticised consultations around the vastMaya Trainrail project as exclusionary and inadequate.

A global study by 18 researchers has found that large industrial projects often causesevere social and environmental impactsif they are not developed with the full support of local groups.“The problem with such large-scale projects,” says the research lead, Arnim Scheidel, “is that they significantly change not only social relations, but also the local environment, which is often closely tied to cultural landscapes, sense of place and traditional ecological knowledge.”Uc Be is concerned about cultural erasure caused by the surge of mega-projects across the region. “The Heineken project will bring gentrification and instability. The jobs it creates will be filled by outsiders who don’t understand our cultural situation.”Alarmed by the experiences of counterparts along the Maya Train route, he also fears the influx of outsiders could increase his community’s vulnerability to opportunistic organised crime groups. Residents of various municipalities there have reporteda rise in the drug trade, substance abuse, sexual harassment and violence.View image in fullscreenConstruction of the Maya Train cuts through the jungle in Yucatán. Maya groups and UN experts said there was too little consultation around the project.Photograph: Rodrigo Oropeza/AFP/GettyWith limited political inclusion, some Maya groups have turned to the courts for support. In June 2024, 21 communities demanded a moratorium on new industrialised pig megafarms; although the request failed, parallel legal actions resulted inthe closure of one farmand fines for26 others.Last year, in a case that is still pending, the conservation group Guardians of the Cenotes filed a lawsuit against the stateto secure legal personhoodfor the underground lakes.View image in fullscreenPedro Uc Be admits he does not know how to stop Heineken.Photograph: Haizel De la CruzBut legal action is expensive and can take years to resolve. By the timecourts upheld Indigenous requeststo halt work on two sections of the Maya Train in January, the tracks had already been constructed.Uc Be says he does not know what Múuch’ Xíinbal will do next. “We don’t have a way to stop the project right now. It’s a huge challenge,” he says.However, they are not admitting defeat. While their resources are dwarfed by the scale of the brewery’s investment and its government backing, the Maya believe their strength depends on staying united.“We act because we do not consent to our own murder. Only by recognising ourselves as one body, one life, can we continue as a Maya culture,” he says. “Just surviving is an act of resistance.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanMexicoAmericasWaterAccess to waterBeerIndigenous peoplesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She said: “Women who choose to swim at the ladies’ pond rather than the mixed pond are choosing a female-only environment for a variety of personal reasons, including privacy and dignity. Allowing men with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment to enter means that it is no longer a female-only environment.”Trans people called the campaigners “cruel and judgemental” and said they had been using the space for decades with no issues.On social media, they also argued that it was not always easy to tell what gender someone had been assigned at birth and that the measures could result in a transgender man, who had undergone gender-affirming surgery and was taking testosterone, using facilities for women.They said it could create complications where people were being challenged on their eligibility to use the space based on physical characteristics such as their height or the shape of their jaw.Announcing the consultation Chris Hayward, the chair of policy at the CLC, said: “We recognise the sensitivity surrounding this issue. Our consultation will help ensure that everyone’s voice is heard, and that decisions are made in a fair, respectful and transparent way, in line with the law.“While the consultation will be an important source of insight, it is not the only factor. The views we receive will sit alongside our wider responsibilities – including meeting legal requirements, assessing equality impacts, ensuring safeguarding, and considering how any decisions could be implemented in practice.”Explore more on these topicsTransgenderLondonSwimmingShareReuse this content"

The BBC hopes to reach an agreement before the budget in November.Photograph: Heritage Image Partnership/AlamyBBC World ServiceBBC bosses want defence budget to help pay for the World ServiceExclusive: Executives at corporation say media monitoring and anti-disinformation are vital to national securityKiran StaceyandMichael SavageSat 4 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTShareBBC bosses are lobbying to use the UK’s defence budget to help pay for the embattled World Service, arguing that aspects of the service should qualify as vital for national security.Senior executives at the corporation are in talks with officials over whether parts of the service, such as media monitoring and anti-disinformation, should count towards Britain’s security, as they attempt to avoid cuts of tens of millions of pounds.The Guardianrevealed in Maythat the government had asked the BBC to draw up budget plans up to £70m lower than what the service believes it needs, partly as a result of Keir Starmer’s decision to cut the aid budget.Jonathan Munro, the head of the World Service, told an event at the Labour conference last week that he was looking to “spread the burden” of its funding across Whitehall.“There are quite difficult rules about what counts as defence spending, but things that count as stability and conflict spending are now also built into that space,” he said.Those close to the talks say the BBC is specifically asking for money from the defence budget, which has been raised in order to meet the prime minister’s promise of spending 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2027.A BBC spokesperson said: “TheBBC World Servicedelivers unparalleled UK cultural influence around the world, and as well as bringing economic benefits to the UK, plays an important role in national security and global stability.“We are making the case to the Foreign Office about our funding and will continue our discussions with the government about the long-term future for the BBC World Service.”The government pays for about a third of the World Service’s £400m funding, which comes from the Foreign Office budget, and 80% of which qualifies as overseas aid.Having risked my life in war zones for the BBC, I know this: cuts to the World Service will be disastrous | Martin BellRead moreStarmer’s decision to cut the aid budget in halfearlier this yearhas put much of that funding at risk, however, with ministers asking the World Service to draw up plans for cuts of up to 2% in cash terms per year.BBC executives are hoping to ease the burden on the stretched Foreign Office budget by classifying some of its spending as national security. That would probably include its efforts to monitor foreign media and to put out information to counter propaganda from other countries.The corporation is hoping to reach an agreement before the budget in November.The World Service has already announced 130 job cuts earlier this year, as part of existing plans to save £6m.The BBC is under acute financial pressure as the value of the licence fee has not kept pace with the dramatically rising costs of making television.With Donald Trumpdefunding international media outletslike Voice of America, however, and Russia and China spending billions on their own external media operations, senior BBC executiveswant to seea huge expansion in the World Service’s audience.Tim Davie, the broadcaster’s director general, has talked about doubling its audience to a billion people, rather than managing decline.BBC executives want the government’s contribution to the service to increase to near £200m in the next settlement, as they continue to sell it as a weapon in the fight against misinformation. Both China and Russia have been targeting territories they see as open to an anti-west message.In the settlement for 2025-26, government funding did increase, but only to £137m.At a recent conference in Cambridge, Davie warned that “a lot seems at stake” in an increasingly dangerous and unpredictable world. He said: “What is the place of the UK on the world stage? Are western democracies able to deliver in the modern world?”In the longer term, senior BBC figures have been seeking to reopen the decision arrived at in 2014 that saw the corporation take on the costs of the World Service. It was one of the measures made as part of the coalition government’s austerity drive.That conversation is part of the wider talks about the renewal of the BBC’s charter, which is set to include a discussion about reforming the licence fee.Such a reversal over the World Service’s funding seems unlikely, given the challenges the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, faces amid a worsening picture for the public finances.Explore more on these topicsBBC World ServiceBBCForeign policyDefence policynewsShareReuse this content"

China’s then ambassador, Liu Xiaoming, expressed hopes that the deal would “write a new chapter for a China-UK golden era”.But over the seven years that followed, this controversial “super-embassy” plan – staunchly opposed by local residents, human rights campaigners and backbench MPs – was plunged into the deep freeze.Its troubles began in December 2022, when Tower Hamletsunexpectedly refused to grant permission for the project, citing concerns about its impact on the area and its residents.Frustrated with the quagmire of the English planning system, Chinese officials wanted the UK central government to intervene. But Conservative ministers, under pressure from their hawkish backbenchers, refused to get involved. So did the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.The plans seemed doomed until July 2024 when, days afterLabourcame to power, China resubmitted its application for planning permission to Tower Hamlets council. China’s president, Xi Jinping, raised the matter directly with Keir Starmer in their first phone call on 23 August 2024.Soon afterwards Angela Rayner, then housing secretary, used her powers to take the decision out of the council’s hands and into her own. This triggered a planning inquiry, which concluded on 10 June 2025, when its recommendation landed on Rayner’s desk. She has since been replaced in her role by Steve Reed, a close ally of the prime minister who is tasked with making the final decision.View image in fullscreenThe proposed site of the new Chinese embassy at Old Royal Mint Court in London.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAThis is no run-of-the-mill planning matter for the government. The fate of the super-embassy has become a test of good faith for Beijingin its relations with London.But green-lighting the plans will draw a backlash from opponents, including residents who are already exploring the possibility of a judicial review. Critics say the site’s proximity to the City of Londonpresents a security risk, while pro-democracy Hongkongers living in the UK say the super-embassy will become a tool for the Chinese Communist party to harass and even detain its political opponents.Ministers havepushed back the deadlinefor taking a decision to 21 October after China refused their request to send unredacted drawings of its plans. Ahead of the government verdict, the Guardian can disclose details of Beijing’s behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign to overturn the block on its proposals – before Labour ministers stepped in.The decision by Tower Hamlets council to block the super-embassy proposal in 2022 came as a surprise to everyone, not least Beijing.The council’s planning officers had recommended that the project go ahead. But elected councillors, who had received representations from residents, including Hongkongers who had moved to the area to escape Beijing’s oppression, felt otherwise. Tower Hamlets is home to the largest Muslim population of any borough in England, and China’s treatment of the Uyghurs in Xinjiangwas a matter of community concern.China began exploring ways to challenge the councillors’ decision. Over the coming months and years Chinese embassy officials in London would hold a succession of meetings with influential community figures in Tower Hamlets as they looked for a way through.These private discussions centred on ways for the Chinese embassy to improve engagement with the Tower Hamlets community in an effort toovercome local opposition to the plans. They also touched on the avenues open to overturn the decision, whether via legal challenge or government intervention.In late December 2022 and early January 2023 Chinese embassy officials held their first two meetings with two Tower Hamlets community figures at an address on Welbeck Street in Soho, where a company called the UK International Innovation Centre (UKIIC) is based.View image in fullscreenManzila Pola Uddin pictured in 2019.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyPresent at the first of these meetings was Yang Xiaoguang, then minister-counsellor at the Chinese embassy in London. The second meeting was attended by Xia Yuzi, the more junior official in charge of the embassy application.Others attending included Yu Xiong, a professor in business analytics at the University of Surrey and former director at the UKIIC, who had heldleadership rolesin groups connected to the Chinese Communist party, and Manzila Pola Uddin, a non-affiliated member of the House of Lords who is a former Labour councillor in Tower Hamlets and haspublicly expressed supportfor the embassy plans.In early March 2023 Xiong asked one of the community figures invited to the meetings to produce a business proposal – including costs and timeframes – for advising the embassy on how to challenge the council’s decision. There were two formal routes for doing so: submitting an amended application seeking to address the council’s concerns or escalating the matter by seeking a judicial review.Xiong said he never passed this proposal on to the Chinese embassy and strongly denied acting as an interlocutor between the embassy and other parties.Meanwhile, China used the Royal Mint Court site to host cultural events, including traditional live music performances anddance workshops. Beijing began to raise the matter of the stalled planning application with UK politicians and officials as it sought a high-level intervention from the government.In February 2023 Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, declined to step in. Faced with questions about whether they would intervene, Conservative ministers stalled for months. When the deadline to appeal against the council’s planning decision finally expired in August, the Chinese embassy issued a statement accusing the UK of failing to meet its diplomatic obligations.View image in fullscreenThe current Chinese embassy, in Portland Place, central London.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersAfter this point China’s only avenue to reviving the plan was to submit a fresh application to the council, butBeijing wanted assurancesthat this time ministers would step in to progress it. None was forthcoming. To the public eye, this impasse appeared to have killed off the plans.Behind the scenes, Chinese officials resumed their meetings with Tower Hamlets community figures as they tried to engineer a breakthrough.In October 2023 Uddin sent a WhatsApp message discussing the need to “sit alongside Professor Yu Xiong with regards to the Chinese embassy”. Uddin, who denied ever advising the embassy on its plans or raising the matter with Tower Hamlets council, said through her lawyer that this message may have related to the embassy’s community impact. She and Xiong attended a buffet lunch with Chinese officials at Royal Mint Court on 20 December 2023. The pair of them travelled to China and Bangladesh together in the months that followed.On 20 February 2024, after another meeting, a Chinese embassy official, Dingkun Zhu, emailed a third party saying: “Thank you for the meeting yesterday, that was very helpful for us. Please find attached some detailed information about the new embassy project for your reference.” He included documents related to the application, including details of the Chinese embassy’s efforts to engage with the local community by distributing more than 23,000 flyers and organising public exhibitions.On 11 March a lunch meeting with Chinese officials was held at the Cinnamon Club, a restaurant in Westminster, with Xiong and Uddin both present. Zhu messaged the third party afterwards and said he would organise a meeting with a planning consultant.The intended meeting never happened: it was superseded by events. Four months later Labour had won a landslide election victory; China quietly resubmitted its application to the council, and ministers responded to Beijing’s requests to intervene. Starmer told Xi on the margins of the G20 summit in Brazilin November 2024: “You raised the Chinese embassy building in London when we spoke on the telephone. We have since taken action by calling in that application.”The super-embassy’s opponents claim that Labour ministers must have privately given China assurances that they would approve it, otherwise it would not have re-submitted an application to the council. This argument – and Starmer’s on-camera suggestion that he intervened after being urged to by Xi – could form the basis for a judicial review if ministers give the embassy the go-ahead.Whichever way the government jumps, this saga is far from over.Explore more on these topicsChinaPlanning policyLondonForeign policyLabourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We found answers then which are not the ones we want to find this time. Let’s learn from that history.”Crick has composed the score for a new work commissioned byBradford opera festivaltelling parallel stories of AI and the luddites. With a libretto by Kamal Kaan, it will premiere in venues around Yorkshire in November.As we grapple with difficult questions around AI we should look back to the luddites, said Crick, who was born in Huddersfield and has early 90s memories of being taught about them at school.“I remember being marched into a hall and teachers wheeling a television in for us all to watch a mockumentary,” he said. “I remember us being taken to the Tolson Museum in Huddersfield where they have the hammers from Marsden they used.”People had misconceptions about the luddites, said Crick. They often remember them only as violent machine-smashers. Today, calling someone a “luddite” often means they are thought of as being anti-progress and anti-technology.View image in fullscreen‘What [the luddites] were trying to do was stop the monopoly of the wealth that technology created being in the hands of a few people.’Photograph: Mary Evans Picture Library/Alamy“The luddites knew technology was coming,” said Crick. “They knew they couldn’t stop it. “First of all they petitioned parliament. Then they asked the mill owners to set up a poor fund that would support the people forced out by this technology.“Ultimately they said: ‘We only want to prevent the implementation of technology as it is harmful, as it is injurious to the working man.’ So they weren’t trying to stop technology. What they were trying to do was stop the monopoly of the wealth that technology created being in the hands of a few people. There was this massive divide in society with mill owners, unbelievably wealthy and the populace starving.“This idea that they’re just backward-thinking people that tried to stop the inevitable march of progress is nonsense. It’s not right. They tried every other avenue. When that didn’t work, some of them ultimately did turn to violence. But my argument is that if we address those concerns before that point, we can stop the descent to violence. It could have been stopped.“We are approaching a pinch point now, I personally feel, where we need to ask similar questions.”Crick said the opera may not have all the answers, but it asks important questions including: will progress be humanity’s salvation or its downfall?Like many artists Crick is concerned about what AI may mean for him and his peers. Will it be writing operas audiences want to see? “AI is here,” he said. “We can’t stop it. We shouldn’t want to stop it.“But I am worried. I know that I, as a composer, I’m fully aware of what Bach did and what Mozart did and what Brahms did and Britten and Stravinsky and that all brings us creatively to a point where we create something.“A great part of our work is an amalgamation of previous generations and that’s what AI is doing. So as it only gets better over the next 100 years, 150 years, it is doing the same process that the human artists are doing.”One aim of the opera and the festival is to entice new audiences to the art form. Crick firmly believes opera should be topical, that “it should be creating works that are relevant, not trying to repurpose works from the past all the time”.The opera will tell two parallel stories: one set in 2030 focusing on a tech entrepreneur who has created a humanoid AI, the other set in 1813 telling the story of the luddite leader, George Mellor, as he faces the gallows.The Last Machine Breaker, AnOperaon Luddites, AI and Revolution, runs from 10-16 NovemberExplore more on these topicsCultureOperaArtificial intelligence (AI)YorkshireNorth of EnglandWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

That evidence included statements by variousTrump administrationofficials and the timeline of the charges being filed.Trump administration to offer unaccompanied minors $2,500 to self-deport, memo revealsRead moreThe Departments of Justice and Homeland Security did not immediately respond to inquiries about the case on Saturday.In his 16-page ruling, Crenshaw said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern”, but one stood out.That statement, by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, on a Fox News program after Ábrego was charged in June, seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged him because he won his wrongful deportation case, Crenshaw wrote.Blanche’s ”remarkable statements could directly establish that the motivations for Ábrego’s criminal charges stem from his exercise of his constitutional and statutory rights” to sue over his deportation “rather than a genuine desire to prosecute him for alleged criminal misconduct”, Crenshaw wrote.Likewise, Crenshaw noted that the Department of Homeland Security reopened an investigation into Ábrego days after the US supreme court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring him back.Ábrego was indicted on 21 May and charged on 6 June, the day the US returned him from a prison in El Salvador. He pleaded not guilty and is now being held in Pennsylvania.If convicted in the Tennessee case, Ábrego will be deported, federal officials have said. AUS immigrationjudge has denied Ábrego’s bid for asylum, although he can appeal.The Salvadorian national has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the United States illegally as a teenager.In 2019, he was arrested by immigration agents. He requested asylum but was not eligible because he had been in the US for more than a year. But the judge ruled he could not be deported to El Salvador, where he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family.The human-smuggling charges in Tennessee stem from a 2022 traffic stop. He was not charged at the time.Trump administration officials have waged a relentless public relations campaign against Ábrego, repeatedly referring to him as a member of the MS-13 gang, among other things, despite the fact he has not been convicted of any crimes.Ábrego’s attorneys have denounced the criminal charges and the deportation efforts, saying they are an attempt to punish him for standing up to the administration.Ábrego contends that, while imprisoned in El Salvador, he suffered beatings, sleep deprivation and psychological torture. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, has denied those allegations.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Ever since, he has been busily renovating the property before he and his partner, Gabriele Prinzessin zu Leiningen, move in this winter.The eight-room house, referred to locally as the Paschinger Schlössl, was home from 1919 to 1934 to the writerStefan Zweig, who described it as “romantic and impractical”. Among its charms, he wrote, was that it was “inaccessible to cars” and could “only be reached by climbing more than a hundred steps”.View image in fullscreenWolfgang Porsche bought the 17th-century villa as a second home in 2019 for about €9m.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamySuch an idyll has seemed remote in recent years. Rüggeberg, a counsellor, says the building work has been so loud that she has sometimes not been able to hear herself think.But trying as the past years have been, Rüggeberg fears it could be just the start. Porsche last month secured permission from Salzburg authorities for a plan to build an estimated €10m private access road from a municipal car park in the historic city centre through the rugged limestone hill. The 82-year-old’s vision is that the 500-metre road will lead to a subterranean garage next to the villa where he will be able to park eight cars.Porsche has spoken of how he likes to take his cars on early morning spins on the sharp bends up of the Großglockner, Austria’s highest mountain peak, about 120 miles (190km) to the south. His original idea had been for a personal lift to be built to take him up to his home. When that was rejected, he submitted plans for the road.Even in Salzburg, which is used to the foibles of the rich and famous who gather in the city every year for the renowned opera festival, and which appreciates the financial contribution these wealthy guests make, this is seen by some as a step too far.View image in fullscreenStefan Zweig with his wife, Friderike, in front of the villa in 1922. The Jewish writer was forced to flee in 1934.Photograph: ullstein bild/Getty“Porsche has done a lot for the local economy,” Rüggeberg said. “But in this case, the city has failed to negotiate properly. All men are equal but some are more equal than others.” At the very least, she said, she would have liked the city to have insisted the road be accessible to emergency vehicles, rubbish collection and other residents.Porsche received initial permission in early 2024 from Salzburg’s former mayor, a member of the conservative Austrian People’s party, to dig out “theAutohöhle” (car cave). Soon after, the council was taken over by a leftwing contingent, a Social Democrat mayor and his deputy from the Communist party amid concerns the rich were pricing ordinary Salzburgers out of their own city.The new mayor, Bernhard Auinger, worked for Porsche for 27 years and used to sit on the board of its holding company as a former labour representative. He has admitted “the optics could be better”, but has said he has little influence over a project he “inherited”.“No one will have to see the tunnel or even be aware it’s there,” Auinger told Salzburg media. “Whether the tunnel is in keeping with the times and morally justifiable is for others to judge.”Ingeborg Haller, the head of the Greens on the city council, has led opposition to the project and kept the topic in the public domain. “What has appalled people is that a private person is being allowed to hollow out the mountain for his own gain,” she said.View image in fullscreenPorsche has secured permission from Salzburg authorities to build a private access road through a limestone hill.Photograph: Helena Lea Manhartsberger/The GuardianShe has also been critical of the €48,000 fee Porsche paid the council for permission to cut through land that belongs to the city. An independent expert called in by Auinger after the fee was queried concluded Porsche had overpaid by several thousand euros.Salzburg’s city planning committee, which approved the road in early September,said the project was in the public interest because as long as Porsche’s cars were in the tunnel they would not be emitting exhaust fumes,taking up room or causing accidents.This, say critics, is absurd. “These are wildly amusing arguments, on top of many others we’ve heard, like the fact the parking lots already at the house are apparently insufficient,” the communist deputy mayor, Kay-Michael Dankl, told the Guardian.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A group of environmentalists, calling itself the Porsche Tunnel festival, has hung banners from the Kapuzinerberg reading: “And Porsche said, let there be a hole.”Despite the anger, the project , having gained the approval of the planning committee, is almost certain to go ahead. A vote by the state of Salzburg is considered a formality and work is expected to begin soon.Apart from any environmental or ethicalconcerns raised by a billionaire’s plans to bore into a hill, there is an additional dimension that makes it particularly problematic for some. The villa was Zweig’s home for a quarter of his life, before the Jewish writer fled in 1934, fearing the impact the rise of fascism in Austria would have on his life after a politically motivated police raid on his home.It was here that Zweig, a humanist and pacifist whose memoirs inspired the 2014 Wes AndersonfilmThe Grand Budapest Hotel, entertained literati such as Thomas Mann, James Joyce and the composer Richard Strauss. (Long before Zweig, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s sister, Nannerl, also gave piano lessons here.)View image in fullscreenBrassstolpersteinein front of the villa commemorate Stefan Zweig, his wife, Friderike, and her two daughters.Photograph: Helena Lea Manhartsberger/The GuardianIt jars with some locally and beyond that the city did not buy the house from its previous owners and keep it as a memorial to Zweig. In front of the house, brassstolpersteine– or stumbling stones – commemorate Zweig, his wife, Friderike Zweig-Winternitz, and her two daughters, all of whom lived there.Instead, the house was bought by Porsche, who, as the German magazine Stern noted, is “the son of an SS man … the grandson of Hitler’s best carmaker”. Ferdinand Porsche, who founded the business, designed the Volkswagen Beetle for the Nazi leader.A spokesperson for the Porsche family said: “As it is a private matter, no comment will be made.”Explore more on these topicsAustriaPorscheEuropeCommunitiesSecond world warInequalityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He said Russia’s recent drone incursions against several EU countries were well-calculated and an attempt to “move the red lines”.“I’m sure Putin gets emotional if not physical satisfaction humiliating the west by showing what he perceives as his super-strength,” Kyslytsya said, adding that the Russian president’s reckless actions risked antagonising a White House that appeared to be cooling on him. “It’s a boomerang thing,” Kyslytsya said.What Russia does next depends on whether Europe and theTrump administrationshow collective resolve, he suggested. Without a decisive transatlantic response, Putin would “escalate escalating”, he predicted, with more actions designed to disrupt and paralyse the continent.View image in fullscreenDanish police officers scour and area after Copenhagen airport was closed due to drone reports.Photograph: Steven Knap/ReutersIn recent weeks Russia has sent decoy drones across the border into Poland and dispatched fighter jets that violated Estonia’s airspace. Incidents involving drones that restricted flights at Munich and Copenhagen airports have raised fears of Russian involvement. Moscow has denied responsibility.Kyslytsya claimed Russia had infiltrated EU countries with “agents and moles” he said were responsible for drone flights over airports in Denmark and Germany, as well as in allied military bases. He described them askonservy– literally tin cans in Ukrainian – who could be activated or “opened” by Moscow when needed.This week, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, met EU leaders at a summit in Copenhagen, where the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Europe faced its most difficult and dangerous situation since the end of the second world war and thatall countries were affected by the “Russian hybrid war”.View image in fullscreenThe Danish PM, Mette Frederiksen, talks to Germany’s Friedrich Merz and France’s Emmanuel Macron on Thursday.Photograph: Mads Claus Rasmussen/EPAKyslytsya said he believed European leaders have generally woken up to the threat but added that many others – including experts and professionals in western Europe – had yet to grasp it. Greater education was needed to spread the message, in the face of a ruthless and “unscrupulous adversary”, he said.“Many politicians are still keeping in their heads in the patterns and algorithms of the last century, where a war means boots on the ground and tanks moving in,” Kyslytsya said.“In the 21st century you don’t need tanks to put technologically advanced countries on their knees. Cyberwar is a reality. Howitzers are not necessary to paralyse the banking system. By using drones in a smart way you can achieve your goals better than with a nuclear bomb.”Speaking at the foreign ministry in Kyiv, Kyslytsya said Ukraine’s relations with the US administration had improved since spring, when Donald Trump berated Zelenskyy during the two leaders’ meeting in the Oval Office in February. Washington’s attitude towards the war was “moving”, with a greater understanding that Putin was the main obstacle to peace, Kyslytsya said.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy meets Donald Trump on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York.Photograph: Press Service Of The President Of UkraineIn recent months Ukraine has carried out an increasingly successful campaign to cripple Russia’s oil production, via long-range strikes using homemade drones. According to the Wall Street Journal, the US this week agreed to share intelligence to help Kyiv coordinate attacks on targets deep inside Russia.Overall, however, Trump has taken few concrete steps to pressure Moscow. Asked whether the US president’s threats were rhetorical rather than real, Kyslystya said: “Trump is holding a big stick. That’s already an achievement. We should not undervalue that. People forget where we were six months ago.”The deputy foreign minister suggested the war was turning in Ukraine’s favour, despite the fact Russian troops continue to advance – albeit slowly – in several parts of the battlefield. He cited positive changes in Washington, “more serious” discussions in Europe and Russia’s failure to achieve a military breakthrough in its summer offensive.View image in fullscreenSergiy Kyslytsya holds the UN charter as he addresses an emergency special session of the general assembly on Russia’s invasion in March 2022.Photograph: Eduardo Muñoz/ReutersKyslystya is one of the Ukrainian government’s most effective communicators, known for his lively social media posts.

New York mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared with firefighters. When producer Lorne Michaels asked: “Can we be funny?”, Giuliani replied: “Why start now?”It was September 2001 and, just 18 days after the worst terrorist attack in US history, Saturday Night Live’s blend of satire, silliness and live music was back on the air. “In bad times, people turn to the show,”Michaels told Rolling Stone magazine20 years later.SNLturns 50 this monthand must once again try to meet the moment. This time, the crisis is not external but taking place in late-night TV comedy itself. In recent weeks, the genre has become the canary in the coal mine of US democracy.Over the summer, CBSannounced the cancellationof The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ostensibly for financial reasons, though notably Colbert is a longtime Trump critic and CBS owner Paramount had been seeking government approval of an $8bn merger with Skydance.On 17 September, ABCsuspended Jimmy Kimmel’s showover comments he made after the assassination of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk. Hours before the suspension, the Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, warned that local broadcasters who aired Kimmel could face fines or loss of licences and said: “It’s time for them to step up.”The move prompted an outcry over freedom of speech. ABC parent Disney faced pressure from Kimmel’s fans, some of whom cancelled subscriptions to the company’s streaming services Disney+ and Hulu.Kimmel returned to the airsix days later and mocked Trump: “He tried his best to cancel me and instead he forced millions of people to watch this show.”Now the spotlight shifts from CBS and ABC to America’s other major network: NBC. WhenSNL returns on 4 October, Bad Bunny will host with Doja Cat as the musical guest and five new featured players following several cast departures. But no moment will matter more than the “cold open” in how it deals with the current climate.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny backstage as he prepares to host Saturday Night Live.Photograph: Rosalind O’Connor/AP“This would be one of the biggest, most important cold openings in the 50-year history of the show,” saysStephen Farnsworth, a co-author of Late Night With Trump: Political Humor and the American Presidency. “But in the past, when Saturday Night Live has faced a major challenge, like they did in the wake of 9/11, they’ve risen to the occasion.”SNL’s mockery of Trump has at times earned the wrath of his supporters and the president himself, but Farnsworth advised against pulling punches, saying: “Saturday Night Live will face charges that it isn’t going far enough or that it went too far pretty much no matter what they do, so there’s no reason not to be all in.”Farnsworth, the director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, adds: “It’s striking that a man who desires the spotlight as much as the president does, who wants to be a public figure as badly as he has over the years, doesn’t understand that criticism is part of the package that comes with power.”Launched a yearafter the Watergate scandal toppled Richard Nixon, SNL features sketches and live musical performances. But it is also known for covering politics and featuring politicians. The weekend update segment provides ongoing commentary while cast members often parody presidents, candidates and other figures.The most famous include Gerald Ford (Chevy Chase), George HW Bush (Dana Carvey), Bill Clinton (Darrell Hammond), George W Bush (Will Ferrell), Sarah Palin (Tina Fey), Donald Trump (Alec Baldwin) and Joe Biden (various cast and guest actors). Trump is now portrayed with aplomb byJames Austin Johnson.Susan Morrison, author ofLorne, a biography of Michaels, recalls: “When Alec Baldwin was doing him, Trump was furiously tweeting right about SNL: it wasn’t funny, FCC should investigate, Lorne was over. Watching Alec Baldwin do his thing, it almost felt like bear baiting. It was so fun to watch the back and forth, and don’t anticipate that they’re going to pull back.”Politicians have also appeared as hosts or in cameos. Al Gore, John McCain, Jesse Jackson and Sarah Palin have all featured. Trump hosted in 2004 and, more controversially, in 2015 during his presidential run. Hillary Clinton appeared multiple times, including alongside her impersonator, Kate McKinnon, andKamala Harris took partbefore last year’s election.The show picked up 12 Emmys recently for its 50th season and anniversary programming, including an award for outstanding variety special. Saturday’s episode will be scrutinised closely for how it deals with Trump’s attack on comedy, free expression and democracy – and whether it can make a serious point in a funny, unsanctimonious way.View image in fullscreenLorne Michaels and Colin Jost in the press room with Emmy awards this year.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesMorrison continues: “Lorne and his very smart writers will come up with some clever but on-the-nose way of dealing with this. The thing that it’s important to remember about Lorne is he’s been doing this for so many decades. He’s outlasted so many slates of executives. He’s a survivor. As Conan [O’Brien] told me, in the Game of Thrones of show business, Lorne would be the last man standing.“That isn’t to say that he’s going to cave but he will figure out a way to address this and stay on the air. I also don’t think the people at NBC or Comcast or the FCC are going to mess with him. He’s too much of a statesman in the TV business. But he’s going to come up with a way of dealing with it and addressing it and he’ll be funny about it.”Conservatives have long accused SNL of bias, arguing that the show disproportionately lampoons right-leaning figures while going easier on Democrats. Former head writer Tina Fey openly acknowledged a “liberal bias”in a 2003 interview, fueling the narrative. But Michaels insists that it is nonpartisan and willing to mock both sides.Morrison adds: “It isn’t to say he would ever be an apologist for the Trump regime; nobody could have expected that politics would jump the shark in quite this way. But he certainly would not hesitate to make fun of Democrats even now if they merit it and that’s part of it.“To quoteJim Downey, one of the show’s longtime writers, you never want the show to seem like it’s the comedy division of the DNC [Democratic National Committee]. Lorne is committed to that and that will help here as well.”David Litt, aformer speechwriter for Barack Obama dubbed “the comic muse for the president” for his work onWhite House Correspondents’ Association dinnermonologues, acknowledges that he has been on the receiving end.“I was in the audience at SNL when their cold open was about the Obamacare website crashing,” he said. “I was working at the White House at the time and I remember thinking, I’m not having fun. Everyone else in the audience seemed be having a better time than I was.”Writing comic material under time pressure is tough, Litt says, and that will be the SNL team’s top priority for the new season. He said: “This is a show that rises to a pretty intense challenge every week and I assume they’re going to be thinking about rising to the exact same challenge, which is, how do we turn around a show that is good and funny because that’s hard enough without having the president of the United States breathing down your neck.“That’s part of what infuriates Trump so much about comedians. It’s not that they’re making fun of him, it’s that the audience is laughing. It’s connecting. If Kimmel or Colbert or weekend update was making a joke about Trump and the audience was rejecting that joke, I don’t think Trump would care. It’s the fact that it exposes him as still, despite everything, a fundamentally laughable person, or at least a human person.”Litt, whose new book,It’s Only Drowning, is about his unlikely friendship with a Joe Rogan fan, adds: “I can’t imagine that people are going to be sitting around a writers’ room saying, how do we address this as though they were journalists. I think they’re saying, how do we do funny stuff? Because doing funny stuff is really hard.”SNL has already used up one potential Trump gag. Its cold open on 9 November last year, the first weekend after Trump won the presidential election, was entitled SNL for Trump and had cast members sarcastically trying to get on Trump’s good side, singing: “We will, whatever you want.” The sketch was a satirical take on the public figures and institutions that had shifted their stances or expressed deference to Trump for political or personal gain.Bill Carter, author of the book The Late Shift and executive producer of the CNN docuseries The Story of Late Night, says: “The gauntlet has been thrown now and, if they don’t do something, they will disappoint people. People will be expecting their take and their take won’t be the most obvious one. It’ll be some creative way of approaching it. They have a very good Trump right now so they ought to use him.”Saturday Night Live: the 10 best sketches from the 50th seasonRead moreTrump has frequently railed against SNL over the years and is likely to be watching its return with fingers poised for a hot take on the cold open. But like Morrison, Carter thinks it unlikely that SNL will suffer the same fate as Colbert or Kimmel.“Unlike those shows, Trump cannot say this has terrible ratings and does not make money,” he says. “Saturday Night Live does not have terrible ratings. In fact, with the right host, it will often be among the most watched shows on television. And it has the best demographics on any show on television except for sports.“The idea that they would abandon that show is nuts, because if they did, some streaming service would say, we’ll put on Saturday Night Live. It’s 50 years that show’s been on. It’s had an audience all those times of a new generation of viewers. It continues to do that so it’s a tremendously valuable franchise. NBC is not walking away from that show. I don’t care what pressure they put on it.”Explore more on these topicsSaturday Night LiveTV comedyComedyTelevisionUS televisionUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But is it believable?Rachel AroestiSat 4 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareI’m not sure where Aimee Lou Wood – the Stockport-born star of Sex Education andThe White Lotus– got the idea for Film Club (Tuesday 7 October, 10pm, BBC Three), the new drama she has created with fellow actor Ralph Davis, but I’d be amazed if it’s drawn from her own life. Not because the fearlessly outspoken global celebrity plays a woman too scared to set foot outside her mum’s house in Manchester following a nervous breakdown, her only respite being a weekly movie night with uni friends in the garage. No. It’s the garage itself.Each week, unemployed, agoraphobic Evie somehow finds the wherewithal to transform her garage into a spectacular film set. For a screening of Alien, this one-woman Secret Cinema wallpapers it with tinfoil and hazard tape and fills it with smoke, strip lights and acres of aluminium ducting. For The Wizard of Oz, it’s floor-to-ceiling emerald gauze, gingham curtains and dozens of human head-sized flowers. For The Shawshank Redemption, bars, laundry and personalised prison-style posters line the walls. I simply refuse to believe such breathtakingly wasteful party decor would ever appear in an actual British household. America,maybe. Britain? Not. A. Chance.Evie lives with her sister Izzie (Liv Hill) and mother Suz (Suranne Jones), who is excruciatingly try-hard, desperate to keep both the mood and appearances up, up, up, lest her first-born backslide psychologically. When Evie’s best friend and most reliable film club companion Noa (Nabhaan Rizwan) reveals he’s moving to Bristol for work, Suz panics, fearing Evie will lose her raison d’être. She decides to put a manically positive spin on the news by hastily arranging a prosecco toast to Noa, during which she reads out a depressing poem Evie wrote about being a ghost when she was eight. Is this meant to raise her daughter’s spirits? Or force her to flee the house in embarrassment, thereby curing herself? Either way, it provides Jones with another opportunity to slip into the twitchily anxious mum mode she long ago perfected.Film Club has the vibe of a romcom but not the substance. Evie and Noa clearly have a connection: their conversation is composed almost entirely of movie quotes, and it’s a small miracle they’ve both found someone willing to tolerate this mode of communication. But elsewhere, their chemistry seems patchy. Rizwan plays Noa in his trademark understated style, which means little detectable emotion, while Wood is all aquiver with feeling – though she seems more irritated by Noa than consumed by lust. Besides, she’s smitten with her boyfriend Josh (Wood’s real-life partner Adam Long), who seems too good to be true. He is, as we later discover in a bizarre subplot.View image in fullscreenJust like the movies … Wood with Nabhann Rizwan as Noa in Film Club.Photograph: BBC/Gaumont/Ben Blackall/PAInstead, the most believable bonds are located within the family unit. An early scene in which Izzie is alarmed by the size of her sister’s tampons (Evie: “Fine Izzie, I’ve got massive, wizened 28-year-old flaps”) has echoes of Such Brave Girls, Kat Sadler’s mercilessly funny sitcom about a ferociously dysfunctional mother-daughter-daughter trio. But that’s a red herring. Evie, Izzie and Suz do bicker, but Film Club turns out to be a far soppier affair.All the moping around the house – which Evie does in a miniskirt and leather blazer, for some reason – plus a perpetually wittering matriarch reminds me of Mike Leigh’s Life Is Sweet. Yet while that film’s cosy awkwardness eventually gives way to bracing emotional depth, Film Club retreats into sentimentality. We never get much insight into Evie’s condition: as she confirms to a cheeky local lad (Adolescence’s Owen Cooper), she just “malfunctioned” and “lost the plot”. Her movie night obsession isn’t even a symptom of her unhappiness; in flashback, we see that she took it just as seriously at university seven years ago.So Film Club isn’t actually about mental illness. It’s not really a love story, either. It’s not even about film buffs: the movies referenced here are all route-one classics. At the end of the day, it’s about a garage in Manchester, and what one woman unBritishly sticks on its walls.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherAimee Lou WoodTelevisionSuranne JonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So it’s no surprise that his new film, about a school bus trying to flee the epically destructive 2018 Camp Fire in California, is a tense, thick-of-the-action thriller – one that may have you checking your hair for singeing by the end. Matthew McConaughey (at the frazzled end of his handsome spectrum) is driver Kevin McKay, who picks up a bunch of kids, plus teacher Mary Ludwig (America Ferrera), as an inferno surges towards the town of Paradise. Greengrass keeps a vice-like grip on the plot, and our emotions, as the temperature rises and their options narrow.Simon WardellPlay Dirty, out now, Prime VideoNovelist Richard Stark’s ruthless thief character Parker has been seen in many films under many names (the best being Point Blank), and now director Shane Black takes his turn in this zippy caper. Mark Walhberg plays the professional robber, who is double-crossed on a bank heist by Latin American revolutionary Zen (Rosa Salazar). But he then joins her on an even bigger job, which raises the ire of the Outfit, a criminal concern he has history with.

Here we have the imminent closure of a branch railway line, which inspires local characters such as the young squire Gordon (John Gregson), train-mad vicar Sam (George Relph) and sozzled financial backer Valentine (Stanley Holloway) to try to preserve it as a volunteer-run service.

In a double-bill inspired by the cycle of myths about the cursed Oedipus (Frank Blake), his wife, Jocasta (Eileen Walsh), and their children, Marina Carr expands on herearlier reckonings with Greek tragedy.Drawing here on the Theban plays of Sophocles andEuripides, Carr gives her characters freedom to expand beyond those sources, testing the limits of received ideas about morality, punishment and above all, the existence of powers – god or gods – beyond this world.Lavishly produced with a cast of 16, the majestic scale of the staging by director Caitríona McLaughlin and set designer Cordelia Chisholm does justice to Carr’s ambition. Shimmering silver curtains reveal a raised stone slab and a suspended ceiling, demarcating the palace of Thebes and the gods’ realm, with mirrored projections creating a dual perspective. Rippling lighting (Jane Cox) and video design (Dick Straker), ethereal vocals and thrumming depth-charges of music and sound (Carl Kennedy) add ominous tones.View image in fullscreenExpansive … The Boy at the Abbey, Dublin.Photograph: Ros KavanaghJocasta is the protagonist here, alternately wittily acerbic and anguished in Walsh’s magnetic performance. The queen who gives away her baby son, Oedipus, only to marry him years later is portrayed as a woman who rails against anyone who tries to control her, whether gods, “the shower above”, or men. The central drama of The Boy focuses on the shocked realisation by Jocasta and Oedipus that in trying to thwart the prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother, Oedipus has fulfilled it.“You are my husband,” Jocasta says, in a riveting scene, raw in its sexual and emotional charge, as they try to understand how much they had already guessed about each other. In the second play, The God and His Daughter, Jocasta follows the now blind Oedipus into exile at Colonos, the tension between them curdling into mutual accusation and recrimination, closer to marital bickering than the obsessive passion that went before.View image in fullscreenTense … Éilish McLaughlin and Frank Blake in The God and His Daughter.Photograph: Ros KavanaghWith the dramatic momentum stalling, part two offers a commentary on the action and its violent aftermath in Thebes, with snatches of other Greek myths narrated, unpicked and questioned. While underlining Carr’s point that there is no definitive version of a myth, with every retelling a creative act in itself, there is a sense of treading water. In the next generation, even the much-dramatised confrontation between the couple’s daughter, Antigone, and her uncle, Creon, seems sketchy, with Antigone (Éilish McLaughlin) motivated by her ambition to be queen rather than considerations of divine rites and conscience.While The Shee (Olwen Fouéré), a steely messenger from the gods, warns this cursed family they will not escape their fate, her fellow immortals seem far less interested in “the clodhoppers”. Played with delicious comedy by Catherine Walsh, Amy Conroy and Jolly Abraham in absurd puffed-up costumes, these gods are portrayed as decadent, pampered creatures, having difficulty keeping track of events on earth. With Carr’s ironic humour making a welcome return, they slyly remind us that figures of fun can wield frightening amounts of power – even if nobody believes in them.At theAbbey, Dublin, until 1 November.Dublin theatre festivalcontinues until 12 October.Explore more on these topicsTheatreMarina CarrSophoclesEuripidesIrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

He’s not joking. Richie, 76, is touring here in Budapest, and he’s on rock’n’roll (well, legendary soul balladeer) time. The singer-songwriter, who has sold more than 100m records over his six decades in the business, has just got up. “That bed was saying to me, ‘Stay here, Lionel, you’re lookinggoooood.’”He introduces me to his girlfriend, Lisa Parigi, a Swiss entrepreneur. Parigi is in her mid-30s, gorgeous, friendly, and young enough to be his daughter – or granddaughter at a push. To be fair, though, Richie looks fabulous. As a young man, he was all chin and tache. Now he’s just regular handsome, surprisingly tall, with a bearing that verges on the military. Parigi leaves us to chat.Richie is famous for his bonhomie. He doesn’t simply invite you to the party, he leaves you feeling that he’s hosted it for you, and you alone. Within seconds of learning I’m from Manchester, he’s telling me stories of his times there. “Everyone prepared three days earlier to come to the concert in Manchester. They went to the pub on the first day, then on the second day they went to the pub, and on the third day they said, ‘Now we’re going to the concert.’ At one point I thought, they don’t know it’s me on stage. I mean they’re havingtheirparty. They take over the show, then do the soccer chants, then in between the soccer chants they go back and sing Three Times a Lady again. And, wait a minute, I’m not singing Three Times a Lady now. Oh my God, I have great stories.”View image in fullscreen‘What I loved about where I grew up is that failure was not an option’I know he has. I’ve just read his memoir and it’s rammed with them. He has worked with everyone – there’s Marvin and Stevie, and Quincy and Michael. One moment, he’s getting advice from Sammy Davis Jr that transformed his career, the next he’s taking Nelson Mandela clothes shopping in LA.But even more important is the role of his family, growing up on a black American university campus in the deep south. He knows it’s an atypical story for a person of colour born in the 1940s, and it’s one he says the media has often resisted because it didn’t conform to their idea of what his narrative should be. It really is a fascinating tale. Richie has a Zelig-like quality; there for all the big moments in music and civil rights history, whether as an active participant, a passive bystander or hanging on the coat-tails of girlfriends. He is a man we associate with relentless positivity, but there have also been terrible lows.The story starts in Tuskegee, a tiny campus city just 38 miles from Montgomery, Alabama, and what many regard as the birthplace of the civil rights movement. Tuskegee was a black middle-class enclave. Everybody there was so proud of their education and the city’s political history, Richie says. From a young age he was taught about Booker T Washington (founder of the Tuskegee Institute and advocate for African American economic self‑sufficiency through vocational education), and scientist George Washington Carver (who revolutionised southern agriculture and championed sustainable farming). Richie’s mother, Alberta, was a school principal and his father, Lyonel Sr, was a systems analyst for the US army. Meanwhile, his maternal grandmother Adelaide Mary Foster, a classically trained pianist, was the grandchild of an enslaved woman called Mariah and the plantation owner Dr Morgan Brown. In his will, Brown stipulated that Mariah and her son John Lewis Brown be given their freedom, and John went on to become the head of a black fraternal order promoting education. Richie and the family grew up in his grandparents’ beautiful home, which had been the institute’s faculty house, and was given to them by its original owner and close friend Booker T. History was rich and ever present in the family.View image in fullscreenLionel Richie with his parents, Alberta and Lyonel Sr, and his sister, Deborah.Photograph: Alan Silfen“The level of education was so heavy that you couldn’t help but just let it rub off on you. What I loved about Tuskegee is that failure was not an option. With the airmen there, the academics there, my grandmother, her generation, I grew up with these extremely bourgeois, aristocratic black folk.”Richie tells me his young self could not have been less cool – hopeless at sport, invisible to girls. “A lot of time people see artists and go, ‘Well, he must have been a jock or he must have been the ladies’ man.’ I wasnothing. I was the shyest, almost broken kid.’” He was a frightened little boy in awe of his tough, high-achieving father who passed on so much wisdom to him. Lyonel Sr taught him that it was normal to be frightened. “My dad had a great line,” he says. “‘What’s the similarity between a hero and a coward?”I say I know the answer from the book.“Can you tell me?”“Both are equally scared. But the coward takes a step back, while the hero takes a step forward,” I respond on cue.“That’s it!” he says, delighted. He looks at his manager Bruce Eskowitz, who’s sitting in with us. “Bruce, give him an A for this course. Give himtwostars.”A hotel waiter comes to take our order.Richie orders a cappuccino. I go for a flat white and double espresso. I’ve just flown in to Hungary, and am feeling it.“Ooooh!In that case, I’ll double him by having one more of these. Hahaha! If he’s going to up the stakes, I gotta stay with my man. He read the book! So I’ve got to be at my sharpest.”Richie says he realised when he was writing it he had endless anecdotes to tell. The publishers loved them, but asked where the meat was. He told them he was the meat – his journey of self-discovery, how he got to where he is today. The story he tells is a profound one; of his own inner dialogue with his blackness. How black does he have to be? Who defines that? What are the constraints of being black? And, again, who makes that decision?At the age of eight, he had a life-changing experience on a shopping trip with his father to Montgomery. Richie was unknowingly drinking from a whites-only fountain. Lyonel Sr was approached by a group of angry white men who were repeatedly using the N-word and demanding, “Can’t you read?” Richie waited for his father to “kick some ass”, but Lyonel Sr quietly told him to get in the car, and they drove off. Richie was ashamed of his father’s reaction and couldn’t bring himself to ask about it. Five years later, he brought it up at the dinner table. Lyonel Sr replied, “I had a choicethat day – whether to be your father or be a man. I chose to be your father, because I wanted to be here to see you grow up.”There was a Tuskegee anger – some of the smartest people in America were stymied and siloed by racismMajor civil rights landmarks run through Richie’s life, almost by happenstance. He remembers leaders such as Martin Luther King and Malcolm X passing through town. He was a member of Jack and Jill, the organisation that fostered leadership potential in black college-bound kids. At the age of 10, he fell in love with a girl called Cynthia whom he met through Jack and Jill. Cynthia was clever, with “a grace and a smile that were breathtaking”. Every time he saw her he froze in her presence. Then she disappeared. Many years later, in 1977, he saw her picture on a TV screen, looking just as he remembered her. The news was reporting on a Ku Klux Klan member who had been convicted for the 16th Street Baptist church bombing in 1963 that claimed the lives of four young African American girls. Cynthia Wesley, 14, was one of them. Richie knew all about the church bombing and says it marked the end of innocence for him, but until then he had no idea that Cynthia was one of its victims.In 1966, aged 17, he learned of the murder of 21-year-old Tuskegee voting rights activist Sammy Younge. After helping register 40 black voters in one day, Younge had stopped at a gas station to use the restroom. When the white attendant told him to use the hole “where Negroes go”, Younge replied that the segregation of bathrooms was illegal. The attendant drew a gun, fired and missed, and Younge drove off looking for police protection, to no avail. He returned to the gas station to argue his rights. Later that night, Younge was found dead behind the gas station from a single bullet to the head. The attendant claimed self-defence at trial and was acquitted. Yet another wake-up call for Richie.After Luther King’s assassination in 1968, he writes, “a heaviness hung over everything”. He started to follow the Black Panthers, “who I thought were the greatest. If Stokely Carmichael had something to say, I wanted to hear it.” Richie was living in Harlem, and was by then a member of the Commodores and dating a teacher called Sharon Williams – “sweet, pretty and a deep thinker”. She joined the Black Panthers, explained the struggle to Richie, and headed off to California for the revolution. Years later, Richie heard that Williams had been involved in a shootout with the police. “I think she died in the shootout. Again, I was on the outskirts.”View image in fullscreenRichie, second left, with the Commodores.Photograph: Echoes/RedfernsHad he realised before writing the book how personal his connections to the civil rights movement were? “What I didn’t realise was that it made up the core of who I was. At the time I didn’t realise because our parents made a point of keeping a lot of that edge away from us [his sister Deborah, a librarian, is two years younger than him]. We were in the bubble.” In 1965, when MLK had marched to Montgomery, his parents told 15-year-old Lionel that he was too young to get involved.Had he wanted to be part of it? “I waslongingto be part of it. And my parents kept telling me it was dangerous.” How did he feel about that? “I was angry, because I thought they had left me out of some of the most significant history. My anger came when I realised what my grandmother and grandfather had gone through, what my mom and dad had gone through. I said to my folks, ‘Why did you not tell me? Why did you not involve us in this?’, and their answer was, ‘We didn’t want anything to limit you in your thinking of what the possibilities for your future could be. And if we had attached you to our anger then you would be stuck in our anger.’” He’s talking quietly, with immense passion. Was he aware of that anger? “You couldn’t miss it. Every day I was aware of the anger, because there was a Tuskegee anger.” That was the anger of some of the smartest people in America stymied and siloed by racism. Civil rights didn’t start in 1965, Richie says. He talks about the activists of 1936 who campaigned against school segregation, the challenge to interstate bus segregation in 1947. If he’d not opted for a career in music, you could see Richie as a professor of black history. As a child, he imagined being ordained as an episcopalian priest.In 1974, Richie graduated from the Tuskegee Institute with a degree in economics and business. But he’d known for a long time that he wasn’t destined to specialise in either. At college, Richie was invited to join a band called the Mystics by guitarist Thomas McClary. The Mystics, then got together with members from a more successful college band, the Jays, and they became the Commodores. The name was chosen by randomly opening a dictionary and going for the first word their eyes fell on. The word before Commodore was commode. Richie says he doubts the Commodes would have been as successful. By 1974, the Commodores had been playing for six years and were just about to release their first album, Machine Gun, on Motown. The title song, an instrumental, became a huge hit. Richie was a saxophonist who played by ear and sang three songs in their set.In concert with the Commodores in 1979.Photograph: Christian RoseDid the rest of the band come from a similar background? “No, I had to overcome one phrase from within the group for the longest time, ‘Lionel, you don’t know what it is like to be poor.’ And I said, ‘Guys, I don’twantto know what it’s like to be poor!’” But the comment touched a nerve. “I’d say, ‘Will you stop saying that? You’re pissing me off.’ But then I got the best lesson from them, because they taught me how to survive.”In the early days on the road he did find out what it was like to be poor. “I’d be like, ‘I’m hungry, it’s time to eat,’ because I was used to three meals a day. ‘Well, we don’t have enough money to eat, Lionel – get a jar of orange juice and sip on it slowly, OK.’ Next thing is, ‘You’re going to eat this.’ Well, what the hell is it? ‘It’s chitlins and pickled pig feet.’Pig feet? My grandmother never had pickled pig feet in the house. It was the best education, because it gave me the opportunity to go down to ground floor.”The newly radicalised Richie was determined to play the tough guy. He admits he was naive. “I remember the day this guy called me the N-word.” The Commodores were booked to play a prom at a white high school, and they arrived 45 minutes late. Three men greeted them and told them to get back in the van and get straight out of town. All three were using the N-word. “Instead of running I said, ‘Oh my God!’, and the guys were going, ‘Lionel get back in the van!’’, and I was like, ‘Nononono, I’m in the civil rights movement now.’ And they’re like, ‘Lionel.Get. In. That. Van.’” When one of the men pulled out his Bowie knife, he gingerly stepped back into the van.After Machine Gun, Richie found himself playing less sax, taking over the vocals and writing the biggest hits. Their variety confounded critics, but Richie says it just reflected the range of music he grew up with. “When I got into the music business, I realised they had little holes for everything – ‘OK, now this is the R&B guy, you’re the black singer’, and I was like, ‘What’s going onhere?’ I didn’t know these categories. I was educated across the board from country music, classical music, classical pipe organ music, R&B, the blues, gospel.”Where did it all come from? “That one little town.” Tuskegee, he reckons, had a population of about 2,000 when he was growing up. “When I started writing, someone would say, ‘Where does Sail On come from, that’s a country song? Three Times a Lady, that’s a waltz? Where’s the funk coming from?’ Well, that’s all here at the house with the guys on the campus. It was so rich in culture.”One of the best bits of advice he received came early on, from Sammy Davis Jr. He told Richie that his career was about to go through the roof and that he would be approached by the biggest players in the industry who would offer him everything he’d dreamed of and more. Richie responded enthusiastically. Davis Jr told him it wasn’t anything to be enthusiastic about. He instructed Richie, “Your answer to everything they offer you is no.” When Richie asked why, Davis Jr said, “Because I said yes. And I don’t want you to make the same mistakes I made.” He was warning you off being owned? “That’s right. That alone saved me a hundred years of misery.”By the beginning of the 1980s, he was branching out. He wrote chart-topping songs for other artists – Lady for the country star Kenny Rogers and Endless Love for Diana Ross (her biggest hit, on which he duetted). In 1982, he went solo and for the next five years he was a constant in the US Top 10, with four No 1s. There were clubbing classics such as Dancing on the Ceiling and All Night Long, and there was schmaltz galore such as Say You, Say Me and Hello (with itscheesy-creepy videoof a drama teacher falling in love with his blind pupil).View image in fullscreenSinging Endless Love with Diana Ross, 1982.Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveMusic promoters and executives asked what Richie was playing at when he wrote for Rogers. They suggested he had become divorced from his roots. It infuriated him. “I bent myself into a pretzel to be black enough for R&B and accessible enough with pop promoters,” he writes. “Or as detractors in my own community later put it, ‘Lionel Richie crossed over and can’t get black’.”When Richie joined Motown, Berry Gordy’s soul label was thriving. He got to know all the greats. The Commodores’ first tour was supporting the Jackson 5 in 1971. Richie, then 22, was like an older brother to 12-year-old Michael. In 1985, he and Jackson wrote the song We Are the World, which was produced by Quincy Jones and sold more than 20m copies to raise money for famine victims in Ethiopia.He describes Jackson as “eccentric and extremely chaotic”. He says he would wear the same clothes till they disintegrated. “Quincy and I called Michael smelly.” He says Jackson would laugh because he knew he was being teased out of love. At one point, he was at Richie’s house and the stench was so strong that Richie presented him with a pair of his own jeans and a new pair of underpants, and told him to change into them. Later that day, Richie saw the discarded underwear and jeans in Jackson’s bedroom “lying there like roadkill”.Jackson was cleared of child molestation in 2005, though the allegations were revived more than a decade later in the documentaryLeaving Neverland.Richie’s daughter Nicole, who became famous in her own right as a reality TV star alongside Paris Hilton, was Jackson’s goddaughter. Nicole often slept in Jackson’s bedroom along with other children and has said she never witnessed anything inappropriate. “My parents would never put me in hands that they thought were dangerous. I never had any complaints, and, you know, I love him,” she said in 2003.View image in fullscreenWith Michael Jackson in 1985.Photograph: Polaris/eyevineRichie talks movingly about Jackson’s genius and his battles. “I watched him struggle. Before I got into the fame business, at least I had my friends from school and college. I had some experiences. I had the opportunity to hang out at a football game. I knew what a date was. I’d been jilted. He missed it all.He. Missed. It. All.I was there with him when he was going to that studio every day after school and he’d pull in like a machine at 3pm and stay there till six. Just imagine a kid like that and all you hear is, ‘Watch out the girls are coming! You can’t trust her, you can’t trust them!’ I saw it.”He claims many people were stealing from Jackson in one way or another. Was Richie in a position to advise him? He shakes his head. “No. When you’re in the war and you’re both ducking bullets it’s hard to give advice to the other soldier. The same crooks that were trying to take advantage of him were coming to take advantage of me.”At the same time, he made so many incredible friends. He could tell stories about them all day long. There’s the time Stevie Wonder told him to get in the passenger seat of his car, and reversed down the driveway at speed, terrifying the life out of him (“I lost it completely and screamed, ‘Stevie, what the fuck are you doing!?!’”). Then there’s the occasion he took Nelson and Winnie Mandela clothes shopping at Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue in preparation for a reception in honour of the South African leader. (“Young man, I want to thank you for your lyrics and your music,” Mandela told him. “Your songs got me through many years while I was in prison.”)View image in fullscreenRichie, centre, with Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson, performing at the 2022 American Music Awards.Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for dcpI ask who influenced him most as a songwriter. “Smokey Robinson, Norman Whitfield and Marvin Gaye. Each one in their own way would stop by and give me just a little thing. Marvin said to me, ‘What’s the most important note you’ll ever get, kid?’ I said I don’t know. And he said, ‘Hhhhhh-haaah.’ He inhales and exhales, Marvin-like. “Make sure they hear your breathing on the record. It’s not how hard you hit the note, it’s the storytelling.” What about Smokey? “Smokey is the lyricist of lyricists. But also what I love about him is he could have grown up in Tuskegee. He has that smooth way of teaching. It was always, ‘Little brother, let me teach you this, let me show you this, let me bring you in.’ When Smokey was with you in the room, you got nothing but knowledge.”Of all his mentors, it’s his father he most often returns to. He tells me of the day Lyonel Sr explained that life had not tested his son yet, and when it did there would be people glad to see him fall. His father told him that the test comes to any person in the form of “the five Ds” – divorce, disease, disaster, disgrace and death. “His line to me was, ‘A great fighter is not determined by how many punches he can throw, it’s how many punches he can take. And you haven’t been hit yet.’”Soon after, in June 1988, Richie was hit good and proper. He and his wife, former childhood sweetheart Brenda Harvey-Richie, had discreetly split up. Richie was dating Diane Alexander, who went on to become his second wife and the mother of his two younger children Sofia and Miles. When he was at Alexander’s house, there was a knock on the door. It was Brenda. She confronted Richie about the relationship and then physically attacked both Richie and Alexander. The police were called, Brenda was charged with corporal injury to a spouse, battery and resisting arrest, and the story became front-page news.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenWith his first wife, Brenda Harvey-Richie, and their daughter, Nicole (top); and his second wife, Diane Alexander, and their children, Sofia and Miles (above). Photographs: Darlene Hammond; Alan SilfenHow did he cope? Badly, he says. “Disaster and disgrace, that’s two of them, back to back. And you think, how do I maintain this dignified approach when the curtain has been pulled away and you have to survive that? All of Dad’s teachings came together at that central point of my life. He didn’t tell me what was going to happen, he just told me it’s going to happen, but when it does, don’t be shocked about it, just remember to do one thing.Get. Up. Off. The. Floor.”But that was easier said than done. Richie still wasn’t done with the Ds. In 1990, Lyonel Sr died, then one of his vocal cords haemorrhaged because of overuse and he was told he might never be able to sing again. (It took four operations to fix.) At his nadir, he retreated to Jamaica and spent five days drinking till he “damn near passed out”. He sat alone, on a deckchair at the ocean’s edge, polishing off bottles of Cristal champagne, oblivious to the fact that he was up to his waist in water. Later, when he was recovering, he spoke to Motown executive Skip Miller about it. “I said, ‘You know what, Skip, man, if I hadn’t quit the business I would have had a nervous breakdown.’ And he said, ‘Oh, you had a nervous breakdown all right, that’s why youdidquit the business.’”How long did he stop working for? Five years.Fiveyears.” He sounds as if he can’t quite believe it. Richie says it’s a tough industry, and he starts totting up its victims. “Who did we lose?Everybody. Marvin’s gone. You name it, they’re gone. Michael, Prince, Hendrix …”I ask what he thinks his parents would have made of today’s United States and Trump as president. He responds with a surge of raw emotion. “You know what, I’m glad my dad and that group is not here. It would be tough. I can’t even imagine.” He talks about the progress they witnessed through the civil rights movement, and how it is now being reversed. “And now we’re going back to eliminate it.” He looks at his manager. “Bruce can tell you, I’m having my worst moments because youcan’terase all of this progress. I made a statement in 1983 when we were talking about civil rights, and I said, ‘We still talk aboutthat?’, as if to say that’s behind us, we’re interested in the future. Now, here we are 42 years later and we’re still talking about the same thing. But it’s even worse. What I’m watching now is not only going backwards, but it is the erasing of history.”Is he scared for the US? “Always,” he says with a hint of desperation in his voice. Would he ever go into politics to challenge Trump? He laughs nervously, then answers definitively. “Never.” Then he remembers he’s Lionel Richie, the eternal optimist, the lover man, the great unifier, who brings the world together through music. He points out he’s not only African American, he’s also part Cherokee Native American on his grandmother’s side, with a splash of French-Canadian, English and Scottish thrown in for good measure. Of course, he was always going to bring people together. “If you’re waiting for Martin Luther Richie, he ain’t coming. But if you’re waiting for Lionel Richie, the bearer of love, you got me. Back in the day I was thinking politics is a great place. But I saw Malcolm, I saw Martin, I saw all the civil rights guys, and, guess what, they didn’t survive it. It’s not survivable. Politics is ugly, it’s nasty, and it’s got even worse now because they character assassinate you before you even get in. And I found an avenue that works well for me.”View image in fullscreenWith his partner, Lisa Parigi, in May.Photograph: Christopher Polk/Penske Media/Getty ImagesHe tells me of a Unesco meeting where he was invited to perform and talk about the power of music in bridging differences to a group of Middle East delegates from countries including Israel, Jordan and Egypt. When he asked why he’d been invited, they told him he was the only person everyone could agree on. “I can walk into a room. The room does not like each other. It’s suspicious of each other. I walk in and everybody starts smiling. That’s powerful.” Then he takes me to a typical gig back in the 60s. “ Right in the middle of all this craziness, on the third row there’s the guy from the Klan. Big fan. I can have a conversation with anybody and get the message out better than I can by standing on a podium, pounding my fist down and saying, ‘Follow me!’”In the end, he says, that message has to be love, and he’s thankful he’s surrounded by it in his own life – three children, three grandkids and his partner, Lisa. Is there any truth in the rumour that they’re thinking of tying the knot? He makes a shushing noise. “I don’t want to jinx it. Ilovethe rumour,” he says, giggling like a schoolboy. “Keep it like that.”As I prepare to leave, Bruce asks us not to mention Trump in the piece. Richie, though, says he’s fine with what he has said. But, yes, he’s sticking with love rather than politics. “I’m the pied piper of that whole thing, buddy. ‘I love you’: three corny words that the world needs to hear every day.Wantsto hear every day. Now I’d rather say that than, ‘Let’s go fight the revolution.’”Truly by Lionel Richie is published by William Collins, £25). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

When it’s quiet, my brain fills the gap with racing thoughts. It wasn’t until lockdown, when I was 27, that I was diagnosed with ADHD and autism, but looking back it made sense: the fidgety teenage nights, the late-night TV marathons, the constant need for background noise.As a kid, my insomnia was brutal. When I couldn’t sleep, all I wanted to do was get up and do something, but I shared a room with my sister so I just had to lie there, still and frustrated. I found our workaround: TV. My sister and I would put films on at night to soften the atmosphere and fill the silence.Our childhood home was quite unstable and we were left alone a lot, so TV became our bedtime white noise. By my teens, it had become routine: I would pick a film, then watch it night after night for a week or two until a new one took over. Films such as The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and The Breakfast Club were particular favourites. But they weren’t a fail-safe solution, and my sleeping issues persisted.I’ve watched it every night for 15 years. I often don’t make it past the opening credits without falling asleepThen, when I was about 15 or 16, my mum – a childminder at the time – put onRatatouillefor the kids she was looking after in our house. It was just after the film had come out. She intended it as a distraction for them, but I watched it too and loved it.I decided that day that it would be my sleep film for the night, and I instantly knew I’d struck gold. It’s hard to explain to anyone who hasn’t tried to fall asleep with a film playing, butRatatouillehas a remarkably consistent soundscape. It’s not about the volume – obviously you can set that as loud or quiet as you want – but the uniformity. There are no big explosions, no sudden jump scares; just the steady hum of kitchens, the occasional pan clatter.From that night on, I stopped swapping films – Ratatouille became my nightly ritual. I now watch it without fail every single night, and have done for 15 years. I have essentially trained myself to fall asleep to it. I own it on DVD, have it on my phone and iPad, and stream it when I travel. There is no universe in which I can’t access it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We’ve been together for eight years and live together, which means he’s probably seen the first five minutes of Ratatouille thousands of times – significantly more times than I have, since I often don’t make it past the opening credits before falling asleep. He usually waits until I’m out cold, switches it off, and puts something else on.People sometimes ask if I even like the film, since I never get to the end. The answer is yes, I love it. So much so that I sometimes resent how fast it knocks me out, because I’d like to watch it through properly. There are probably still whole chunks of it I haven’t seen, despite 15 years of nightly viewing. But I think my love for it is partly why it works: I trust it and feel comforted by it.Now, it has become a running joke among my friends. If I stay over at theirs, they’ll ask when I’m going to set up Ratatouille for the night. I’ve also talked it through with my therapist, who agrees that as far as coping mechanisms go, there are far worse ways to help with symptoms of ADHD and autism.I can’t imagine watching anything else at night now. The only thing that might possibly replace Ratatouille is the sequel, which is in the works. Until then, I’ll keep watching the original. Or at least the first five minutes.Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?

I’ve recommended many books to my sons over the years, but to my knowledge they have never read any of them. My wife also never reads the books I recommend, even though I always read the ones she recommends to me. Actual publishers sometimes ask me to provide blurbs for books, but at home my advice in these matters is both unsolicited and ignored. Until now.“Hmm,” I say, tapping my chin. “Let me think.”“I’m about to go out, so …”“The book I’m reading right now isn’t that good,” I say, “And the book I read before that was actually recommended to me by you.”“Death Comes for the Archbishop,” he says. “A banger.”“That’s not what I would write if I was asked to provide a blurb for a future edition,” I say. “But yes, it was good.”“My train goes in 12 minutes,” he says.“Wait here,” I say.I go to the living room and, with uncharacteristic luck, immediately locate a particular hardback.“Try this,” I say. “I read it when it came out. It’s like a period thing.”“Which period?” he says.“What am I, a historian?” I say. “Olden times.”“Huh,” he says, examining the cover.“Like a period thing, but funny, and good,” I say.He pulls his Kindle from his bag, taps in the title and hands the book back to me.“I’ll give it a go,” he says, heading for the front door.This feels like an important moment: the start of an era in which my counsel is both sought and heeded. I go in search of the middle one, thinking I might recommend Death Comes for the Archbishop to him, but he’s not home.I open the not-that-good book I am currently reading – which I have nearly finished – and think: what’s the point?Fifteen minutes later I receive a cryptic text from the oldest one. I read it over twice, but it makes no sense. Eventually it dawns on me that it must be a quotation from the book I recommended to him, an example of the olden times language employed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

After a few minutes I find the exact words from the text message, on page eight. But by then my mouth is hanging open in horror.“I remembered not one thing about it,” I tell my wife later. “Not one character, not one name, nothing.”“I never remember much about books I’ve read,” she says.“It’s not just that,” I say. “There was stuff I did remember about the first chapter that is absolutely not in there, that must be from a different book.”“It happens,” she says.“I’m going around recommending books to people,” I say. “Books I may as well not have read.”“You’re old,” my wife says. “Get over it.”But I can’t get over it. In bed that night I lie awake, staring at the spines of the books on my nightstand, trying to remember a single salient fact about any of them. I imagine a blurb on the back of a paperback that says, “Like a period thing, but funny, and good.” The cumulative knowledge, understanding and wisdom of all the books I have ever read has ceased to exist, I think, or at any rate does not abide in me.I open the not-that-good book I am currently reading – which I have nearly finished – and think: what’s the point?Four days later I am at the airport, sitting on a plastic chair near the Pret with my wife and three other couples. It is the shoulder season, when old people go on holiday together. Everyone at the airport is our age.Soon we discuss books: books we have read, or are reading, or might read, or might recommend.“It’s about this archbishop who dies, eventually,” I say. “Not much happens before that, but it’s good.”Fortunately no one is listening to me. Someone else mentions a title that strikes a faint chime in the hazy recesses of my brain.“Is that the blue one?” I say.“The cover is blue, yes,” she says.“Ah,” I say, reaching into my bag. “I am also reading the blue one.”Join Tim Dowlingat a specialGuardian Live eventon Wednesday 26 November.

OpenAI’s own terms of service for Sora as well asChatGPT’s image or text generation prohibit content that “promotes violence” or, more broadly, “causes harm”.In prompts and clips reviewed by the Guardian, Sora generated several videos of bomb and mass-shooting scares, with panicked people screaming and running across college campuses and in crowded places like New York’s Grand Central Station. Other prompts created scenes from war zones in Gaza and Myanmar, where children fabricated by AI spoke about their homes being burned. One video with the prompt “Ethiopia footage civil war news style” had a reporter in a bulletproof vest speaking into a microphone saying the government and rebel forces were exchanging fire in residential neighborhoods. Another video, created with only the prompt “Charlottesville rally”, showed a Black protester in a gas mask, helmet and goggles yelling: “You will not replace us” – a white supremacist slogan.LiveOpenAI Sora 2 generated video 1The video generator is invite-only and not yet available to the general public. Even still, in the three days since its limited release, it skyrocketed to the No 1 spot in Apple’s App Store, beating out OpenAI’s own ChapGPT.“It’s been epic to see what the collective creativity of humanity is capable of so far,” Bill Peebles, the head of Sora,posted on Xon Friday. “We’re sending more invite codes soon, I promise!”The Sora app gives a glimpse into a near future where separating truth from fiction could become increasingly difficult, should the videos spread widely beyond the AI-only feed, as they have begun to. Misinformation researchers say that such lifelike scenes could obfuscate the truth and create situations where these AI videos could be used for fraud, bullying and intimidation.“It has no fidelity to history, it has no relationship to the truth,” said Joan Donovan, an assistant professor at Boston University who studies media manipulation and misinformation. “When cruel people get their hands on tools like this, they will use them for hate, harassment and incitement.”Slop engine or ‘ChatGPT for creativity’?OpenAI’s CEOSam Altmandescribed the launch of Sora 2 as “really great”, saying in ablog postthat “this feels to many of us like the ‘ChatGPT for creativity’ moment, and it feels fun and new”.Altman admitted to “some trepidation”, acknowledging how social media can be addictive and used for bullying and that AI video generation can create what’s known as “slop”, a slew of repetitive, low-quality videos that can overwhelm a platform.“The team has put great care and thought into trying to figure out how to make a delightful product that doesn’t fall into that trap,” Altman wrote. He said OpenAI had also put in place mitigations on using someone’s likeness and safeguards for disturbing or illegal content. For example, the app refused to make a video of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin sharing cotton candy.0:10OpenAI Sora 2 generated video 2In the three days since Sora’s launch, however, many of these videos have already made their way elsewhere online. Drew Harwell, a reporter for the Washington Post,created a video of Altman himselfas a second world war military leader. Harwell also said he was able to make videos with “ragebait, fake crimes and women splattered with white goo”.Sora’s feed is full of videos of copyrighted characters from shows like SpongeBob SquarePants, South Park and Rick and Morty. The app had no trouble generating videos of Pikachu raising tariffs on China, stealing roses from the White House Rose Garden or participating in a Black Lives Matter protest alongside SpongeBob, who, in another video, declared and planned a war on the United States. In a video documented by 404 Media, SpongeBob wasdressed like Adolf Hitler.Paramount, Warner Bros and Pokémon Co did not return requests for comment.David Karpf, an associate professor at George Washington University’s School of Media and Public Affairs, said he had viewed videos of copyrighted characters promoting cryptocurrency scams. He said it’s clear OpenAI’s safeguards and mitigations for Sora aren’t working.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Varun Shetty, OpenAI’s head of media partnerships, said: “We’ll work with rights holders to block characters from Sora at their request and respond to takedown requests.”Emily Bender, a professor at the University of Washington andauthor of the book The AI Con, said Sora is creating a dangerous situation where it’s “harder to find trustworthy sources and harder to trust them once found”.“Synthetic media machines, whether designed to extrude text, images or video, are a scourge on our information ecosystem,” Bender said. “Their outputs function analogously to an oil spill, flowing through connections of technical and social infrastructure, weakening and breaking relationships of trust.”Nick Robins-Early contributed reporting‘My son genuinely believed it was real’: Parents are letting little kids play with AI.

By 2025, Ukraine andPolandtogether accounted for more than 15m kilograms, with Spain, Italy and other southern and eastern European countries also having increased their exports.Ukraine has provided the most eggs so far this year by weight at 8m kilograms, followed by almost 7m kilograms from Poland and 5m from Spain, according to data provided up to July this year.egg import chartImports of eggs for consumption rose sharply from about 3,500 consignments in 2023 to more than 10,000 in 2024. Although overall tonnage declined, fewer big shipments have been replaced by many small ones from regions where caged-hen systems remain widespread.Mark Williams, the chair of the British Egg Industry Council, said UK farmers were being placed at an unfair disadvantage. “Our farmers are asked to invest in ever-higher standards of hen welfare while the government leaves the back door open to eggs produced in a system that is banned in the UK. This is morally wrong and unfair, and the government should not be doing this,” he said.Williams said battery cages outlawed in the UK since 2012 were still commonplace in Ukraine, and that eggs linked to food safety issues in mainlandEuropecontinued to be traded.After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the country’s farms, factories and trade routes were badly hit. To help Ukraine’s economy survive, the UK and EU suspended tariffs on its goods, meaning products such as eggs could be exported without extra costs. Ministers argue this tariff suspension is a deliberate step to support Ukraine during wartime.Williams acknowledged the humanitarian case, but added: “Aid should not come at the expense of UK egg farmers – particularly when British retailers have already pledged to go cage-free by 2025. That promise is undermined if imports from countries with weaker welfare standards are allowed to fill the gap into the price-sensitive food service and processing sectors.”The UK currently produces about 88% of its own eggs, and imports the remaining 12%. Leading supermarkets only sell British Lion eggs in retail, following 2017FoodStandards Agency advice confirming they are safe to eat runny or raw. Imported eggs are more likely to be found in restaurants and food processing.“I am not worried about Ukrainian eggs entering retail,” Williams said. “But retail is only 65% of the market. The other two segments – food service (18%) and processing (17%) – are very price-competitive, which makes it attractive for Ukraine to sell eggs or egg products here.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

That’s why it’s so attractive right now to send eggs and egg products to the UK.”Ukraine has asked Britain to keep tariff suspensions in place until 2029. While the UK has agreed to extend tariff-free trade on most goods to that date, eggs and poultry are classed as “sensitive products” and have only been granted a shorter, two-year extension.A government spokesperson said: “We are backing our farmers with the largest nature-friendly budget in history to get more British food on our plates and we will always protect our farmers in trade deals.“We are making the supply chain fairer and are engaging with the egg industry to draft new regulations to ensure a level playing field for producers.”Explore more on these topicsEggsEuropeFarmingTrade policyUkrainePolandAnimal welfarenewsShareReuse this content"

Tip out on to a plate and sprinkle over the lime zest.Put two tablespoons of rapeseed oil in the same pan on a medium heat, then fry the tofu, turning occasionally, for 10 minutes, until crisp and golden. Tip out on to a second plate.Pour the beans and their liquid into a saucepan, add the remaining half-teaspoon each of cumin and paprika, the last quarter-teaspoon of garlic powder, two tablespoons of the lime juice and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, and warm through gently for five minutes, mashing a few beans as you go.In a small bowl, make a chipotle mayonnaise by mixing the mayonnaise with the remaining tablespoon each of lime juice and chipotle in adobo.Just before serving, peel, stone and slice the avocado, and warm the tortillas until they’re soft and pliable.To assemble, spread a tablespoon of mayo in a horizontal line down the centre of each tortilla. Following the same line, add a quarter of the avocado slices, spoon over a quarter of the beans and a quarter of the tofu, then sprinkle over a quarter of the toasted pumpkin seeds and coriander.Fold the left and right sides of the tortilla over the edges of the filling, then fold up the bottom of the tortilla and roll it away from you.

These were priced at between £190,000 and £197,500.View image in fullscreenThe 27-home development in Ince, Wigan.Photograph: Prima GroupRachael McCoy, a nurse who also works at a nearby beauty salon, says the scheme “came along at the perfect time”. It meant “we could secure a safe home by working for it rather than needing to save for a deposit”.“I’ve lived in Ince all my life, and my family are all local. We wanted to stay in the area because my daughter goes to school here, but we needed a three-bedroom home. Getting on the property ladder right now is really difficult, and the mortgage payments would have crippled us,” McCoy says.“Being involved in building my own home was amazing. It felt like we were building a community before we even got the keys.”Not all of the properties were sold through the equity arrangement, but where it was used, it was done on a shared-ownership basis: those taking part bought between 10% and 75% stakes in the properties, with the option to increase their stake while paying rent on the rest.The buyers – known as “home partners” – earned £10,000 towards their deposit by contributing 500 hours to the project. That works out at £20 an hour (the national living wage for those aged 21 and over is £12.21 an hour).Some donned hard hats, work boots and hi-vis jackets and worked on the site, while others helped with administrative tasks. Crucially, relatives and friends were able to chip in to help people hit their target – and many did.Those behind the development are now calling for more support for the model from the government and mortgage lenders so it can become a viable alternative to the bank of mum and dad.“We ended up with about 13 families who benefited from the sweat equity arrangement,” says John Ghader, the Prima Group chief executive.In terms of the work people had to do, there was “quite a bit of labouring”, he says, but adds: “We didn’t force anyone to do anything they were not good at.”Ghader suggests the model is a good alternative to parental financial help – something many people do not have the luxury of being able to access.“Instead of putting their hands in their pocket to help with a deposit – something not every parent can afford – some have got their hands on a shovel and contributed to their offspring’s on-site sweat equity hours,” he says.It was not all plain sailing. One couple came to the table late and were only able to complete 250 hours before all the work was done, so they earned £5,000 rather than the full amount.One big issue was that quite a few mortgage lenders struggled to get their heads around the concept. Prima Group says some lenders “wouldn’t touch it at all”. (The names of the lenders that said no and those that agreed to lend on this basis have not been disclosed.)“What we need now is greater understanding and flexibility from lenders about mortgage products like sweat equity so they can help more people,” says Ghader. His firm would like to see sweat equity formally recognised in mortgage applications.View image in fullscreen‘We didn’t force anyone to do anything they were not good at,’ says the CEO of Prima Group.Photograph: Rui Vieira/PAThis type of arrangement has been used in the UK before – for example, as part of a development in Toxteth, Liverpool, which was completed in 2019. And it has been used for decades in the US.While the Wigan scheme has generated a lot of interest, Prima Group has no firm plans yet to repeat the exercise. It is hoping the government will pick up this ball and run with it. “It hits a number of buttons of government policy,” says Ghader. “It raises aspirations. It’s got wider societal benefits, and it can be a catalyst to regenerate neighbourhoods and raise them up.”The scheme also offered a route to home ownership for Chloe Radcliffe, a single parent.“My family and myself were brought up here, and my two children attend [the local] primary school.I’ve been desperate to get on to the property ladder to provide security for my children,” says Radcliffe.“Me, my mum, dad and sister loved working on my home and building a great little community with other people who did the same.“Looking back at the pictures now, I think ‘Did we actually do that?’”She adds:“Getting £10,000 off my mortgage by doing 500 hours has helped me out massively.“Knowing you have actually worked on your house and then looking and thinking ‘It’s mine’… I can’t explain how good it feels.”Explore more on these topicsPropertyMortgagesShared ownershipConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a recent YouGov survey, people expressed a view that the party is “dishonest”, “only interested in themselves”, and “the same as the rest”. It’s no wonder that they are currently, terrifyingly,10 points behind Reform in the polls. They also, by a slightly different – you could say less data-driven – metric, have a different kind of image problem. They lack “hair certainty”, from the top down.The idea of “hair certainty” was coined by the writer Simon Doonan. Writing inthe buildup to the 2016 presidential electionthat would see Donald Trump first take office, he explained: “Presidential hair = hair with certainty … Hair-certainty describeshair that is what it appears to be. No illusions. No Greco-Roman fakery. Presidential hair can be thick or thin. Presidential hair can be messy. Presidential hair can be sparse, naff, and filled with dandruff. But, whatever it is, it just needs to have that certainty.”Back then, Doonan discounted Trump’s “iconic coiffure”, saying: “It’s Liberace’s candelabra. It’s Mick Jagger’s lips … But is it presidential? I am rather afraid not.”Speaking now, he explains: “I put him in the category of ‘not going to get elected’, because his hair is a bit of an enigma; overly complex and requiring salon maintenance.” Subsequently, Doonan realised “where his hair certainty lies. It’s in the idiom of the 50s pompadour. It’s Elvis. It’s Johnny Hallyday.” It is, he says, “attention seeking … a showbiz kind of do. I thought, ‘Oh, that’ll never fly in Washington’. But then, bingo, it did.” Keir Starmer’s, by contrast, is, “unnoteworthy”.View image in fullscreenHair today … Trump and Starmer go head to head.Photograph: Leon Neal/ReutersLast week afforded the perfect opportunity to see the contrast. As Trump and Starmer brandished their freshly signed tech prosperity deal at a joint press conference during Trump’s state visit to the UK, they also gave us a chance to see, side by side, their signature coifs. Trump’s wispy champagne top gave way, as usual, to a Mr Whippy swirl, in turn descending into a duck’s arse flip. Starmer’s, by contrast, was rigor mortised up into its usual stiff, baklava-like crest.While both of these coifs are “signatures” – recognisably their own – one is far larger than life than the other. Trump’s hair, variously described as “a decomposing ear of corn”, “an airboat skimming the Everglades” and a “complex superstructure”,takes centre stage in merchand on the blimp that hovered over anti-Trump protests. Like his bombastic written signature, it demands attention.View image in fullscreenPropelled by the hair? Kamala Harris.Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/APHair matters, according to Rachael Gibson, who goes byThe Hair Historian on Instagram: “There’s not many body parts which tell people about us … hair reflects anything from your status, your place in society, your religion.” None of which is new. “Since day one people have done strange things to their hair for the sake of wanting to be interpreted differently, or to pass a message about themselves.” (She points to Louis XIV’s “big brown curly wigs [as] showing wealth and status”.)View image in fullscreenLow-key certainty … Wes Streeting.Photograph: Jaimi Joy/ReutersFar from it being a nonsense to think about political hair, it is yet another lens through which we can scrutinise politicians and the prevailing political winds. “It’s another form of nonverbal communication,” says Washington DC-based image coach and style strategistLauren A Rothman. Consistency is all. “The language that I’ll use with my clients is ‘clothing, hair, makeup; your appearance that feels intentional, even if messy, creates trust’.”While Doonan stresses that hair certainty can’t get you elected, he thinks it can help. He takes Kamala Harris’s, which wasread by some as a symbol of black hair autonomy, as an example. Not to say her success wasn’t down to her capabilities (or to forget that she went on, of course, to lose), but, he says, her hair “played a role in propelling her forward”.It now feels like a salon’s worth of Republicans have hair certainty by the pound. Take the hair of newly minted “secretary of war” Pete Hegseth. While not a million miles from Starmer’s, it is different in ways that make it far more certain: it is extra stiff, extra pomaded; extra. Or the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, and her grey streak. “It’s like Mrs Robinson or Cruella de Vil, or Susan Sontag, that stripe … that seems to resonate with that theatricality the Republicans uninhibitedly embrace,” says Doonan.View image in fullscreenHair as discipline … Pete Hegseth.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersFor men in power in particular, having a healthy head of hair, according to Gibson, “suggests that you’re a healthy person, you’re virile, you’re strong, you’re in good shape … all things that we want from a leader”. It’s enmeshed with masculinity. Hegseth, a former national guard officer, makes a hair-based performance of his; his mop is unruffled by the winds of a chopper,or by a work out. (Proof of how important of all this is to him came earlier this year, when he passed new rules and regulations about “standards” of grooming and appearance for the US army.) “He’s using hair and appearance as a proxy for discipline, order and tradition,” says Rothman.Much of the hair certainty trend is a symptom of the glossy Maga aesthetic. “There’s a showbiz overlay that isn’t normally there in politics,” says Doonan, although US politics is consistently glossier than the UK’s. Hegseth is a former Fox News host, Trump is a former reality TV star.It also fits with the dominant politics of the day. As Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London,told the Guardian in 2023: “All politicians have a brand, but when you’re a populist politician, it has to be outsize, and outsize hair is part of that brand. It makes you recognisable to people who pay little attention to politics.”View image in fullscreen‘Like Mrs Robinson or Cruella de Vil’ … Tulsi Gabbard.Photograph: John McDonnell/APThere is a fine line between good grooming and looking as if you’re spending too much time in the salon, and too little in the Senate or the House – particularly for women, and particularly in the UK, where we saw fit to reward Boris Johnson, a man who appeared a stranger to a hairbrush, with the top job. British politicians, says Doonan, “have to be self-denying. You can’t seem like you’re spending all day agonising about your look.”While Doonan would argue that hair certainty is largely “an American phenomena”, he thinks that’s changing: “The media and social media has propelled all of us into this world where everything is about hair, basically.”Thankfully for us, whatever you think about Starmer’s cut, Nigel Farage’s hair is distinctly lacking too.Explore more on these topicsBeautyMen's hairWomen's hairDonald TrumpKeir StarmerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Everything is open again and the intense heat, which seems to ooze out of the walls and up from the pavements in summer, has mellowed to pleasantly warm. It’s the perfect temperature for languishing on a cafe terrace with the sun tickling your skin as afternoon slips into evening. Noise levels are back to normal, which means cacophonous.It feels like the entire population is out on the streets, catching up with their friends and chatting about all the things they want to do, the films they want to see, the new bars they’ve heard about and the restaurants they fancy trying over the next few months. If you could do with a boost, spend a few days in the Spanish capital this autumn.The dazzling light and clear blue skies lift your mood as soon as you arrive. Madrid being the highest major capital city in Europe may have something to do with that. It is a comparatively young capital too. Arabs from north Africa settled here in the ninth century, building a citadel where the royal palace and Almudena cathedral are now, but Madrid only really got going when Philip II moved his court here from Toledo in 1561, establishing the city as the new capital of Spain.View image in fullscreenPlaza Mayor, Madrid’s main public square, at dusk.Photograph: Jorg Greuel/Getty ImagesTo get a sense of the city’s history, walk from the Puerta del Sol – the centre not just of Madrid but the whole of Spain – to the 17th-century Plaza Mayor, which is framed by redbrick buildings with slate roofs and spindly spires. Then stroll along Cava Baja, the curving street that follows the course of the 12th-century city wall. Vestiges survive in the basements of several bars and restaurants that originated as inns and taverns for the merchants and travellers who arrived by stagecoach.In Madrid, you absorb the city’s heritage just by walking around. In the Barrio de las Letras, or literary quarter, the bar-lined streets are named after the great writers who lived there in the 16th and 17th centuries, such as Miguel de Cervantes, Francisco de Quevedo and Lope de Vega.Walk in, find yourself a place at the bar and you’ll wonder why you don’t live in MadridYou could spend weeks in the city’s big three museums –Prado,Thyssen-BornemiszaandReina Sofia– but try to fit in some others too. TheReal Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernandogets a fraction of the visitors, despite being just off the Puerta del Sol and having astounding collections that include Goya, El Greco, Picasso and Francisco de Zurbarán.This autumn I’m looking forward to theSuma Flamencafestival (14 Oct-2 Nov), where leading flamenco dancers, singers and musicians will be performing new work such asFlamenco Gospel by Juan Carmona. The main festival venue is theTeatros del Canal, an arts complex designed by Juan Navarro Baldeweg, one of Spain’s most renowned architects, who is also an artist (an exhibition of his work is on atCentro Centrountil 14 December). The Teatros del Canal is also a hub for theFestival de Otoño, (6-30 Nov), one of the cultural highlights of the year, with theatre, music and more by Spanish and international artists.The Chamberí district, where the Teatros del Canal is found, is in a less touristy area, just north of downtown. The most traditional and characterful areas of the city, considered the homes of a “pure” and distinctive Madrileño spirit, are calledbarrios castizos –and Chamberí certainly fits that description. Base yourself here for a more authentic feel – try the palatial and stylishOne Shot Fortunyhotel, which has doubles from around £160 room-only in October.As you explore, take in the flowers spilling over the wrought-iron balconies and the gleaming fruit and vegetables outside little shops (particularly the mushrooms at this time of year) and peer into the tiny, tiled bars where locals are having a quick coffee or beer. Walk in, find yourself a place at the bar and you’ll wonder why you don’t live in Madrid.View image in fullscreenThe Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando.Photograph: Wiskerke/AlamyTrafalgar, the part of Chamberí closest to the centre, is fast becoming one of the most fashionable parts of town, but still has a laid-back, family vibe. I’ve been meeting friends in the Plaza de Olavide for decades and seen it undergo umpteen makeovers.Eight streets flow into the square, bringing a constant stream of people searching for friends and dragging chairs to form messy configurations of all ages that change constantly as the night wears on. It’s normal to arrange to meet one friend here, and end up with a table of 10.New bars, restaurants, galleries and boutiques are opening in traditional premises here, but I love that the people behind them are keeping the original fixtures and fittings or hunting down zinc or steel counters and revamping old bar stools to recreate thecastizocharacter, while also adding their own contemporary vibe. Pop intoBar Trafalgarfor a cocktail – or maybe a vermouth and a smoked ham and cheese toasted sandwich – and you’ll get the idea. It’s the kind of place that works at any time of day or night. I love theOlavide Bar de Librostoo, both a bookshop and a cafe – browsing books and sipping a glass of wine are two of my favourite things.Also on my list this autumn isInternational Architecture Week(until 13 Oct, although some exhibitions run beyond that date). The programme includes an Álvaro Siza exhibition (until 9 Jan 2026) at the Colegio Oficial de Arquitectos de Madrid, a short stroll from the Plaza de Olavide. This is followed byMadrid Otra Mirada(16-19 Oct), when you can visit historic buildings and gardens that are not usually open to the public.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Madrid is all about going with the flow. Drift aroundParque del Buen Retirofor a couple of hours, taking in the startlingly vivid magenta and ochre tones of the oak, chestnut and willow trees. Exit the park on the east side, where Calle de Ibiza and the surrounding streets have become a gastronomic hotspot. I love tapas at the bar atLa CatapaorLa Taberna de Rox, although both also have tables if you want to rest tired feet.There’s a lot to see and do at this time of year, but don’t  pack your days with plans. Madrid is all about going with the flowFor more autumnal hues, it’s now a lot easier to visit the elegantCampo del Morogardens, which slope down from theroyal palaceto the Manzanares River. There used to be only one entrance, down by the river – which always felt like too much of a hike after traipsing around the palace. A lot of people weren’t aware that the gardens were open to visitors. Now, thank goodness, you can get in from the top end, from the Cuesta de San Vicente or the Cuesta de la Vega, which is really handy if you are going to theRoyal Collections Galleryas there is direct access.If you haven’t been to Madrid for a few years, this museum, which opened in 2023, is a must, with paintings by Bosch, Titian, Velázquez and Goya as well as a vast array of treasures collected by Spanish monarchs over the centuries, housed in a spectacular building designed by Emilio Tuñón and Luis Moreno Mansilla.View image in fullscreenPlaza de Olavide, Chamberi.Photograph: AlamyWalk down through the gardens – maybe stopping for a drink on thecafe terraceat the bottom – and cross the river to reach theCasa de Campo, the largest green space in Madrid. I rarely get beyond the lake, where there is a string of restaurants with tons of outdoor tables. A plate of garlic prawns with fried eggs atVilla Verbenainvariably seems like an excellent idea at this point. It’s worth going just for the view of the Madrid skyline.Back in the centre, head for Lavapiés, which is one of the mostcastizoneighbourhoods in Madrid but also the most international, with a huge range of places to eat and drink. Not that you need any excuse for a night out here, but theTapapiéstapas and music festival (16-26 October) is a particularly good time for a mooch around. More than 100 bars and restaurants are taking part and are offering a tapa and a beer for €3.50. There’s going to be live music, dancing, processions and kids’ activities too. If all that’s not a good enough reason to book a stay, I don’t know what is.Explore more on these topicsMadrid holidaysSpain holidaysCity breaksEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The street photographer lives in North Beach, an area she loves “for its diversity and old San Fran charm. The combination of colourful characters and old Victorian buildings with interesting architectural details makes this area something of a street photographer’s paradise. There’s no shortage of photo opportunities, and plenty of cute cats and dogs, too.”‘My cats are always grooming, chasing or cuddling’: Sagar Pavale’s best phone pictureRead moreThe ears of Lucky, her chihuahua and miniature pinscher mix, are pictured here, frozen at the sight of a sworn enemy. “I have no doubt this cat could take him down!” O’Donnell says. “We’ve seen him a few times, monitoring the neighbourhood from this window.”The image’s slanted sidewalk is very characteristic of hilly San Francisco. “I had to back up a bit and crouch down to get the shot,” O’Donnell says. “At first, I wanted to try to get his whole body in, but I decided I liked it better with just the back of his head and distinctive ears. I thought it made both the image and the story stronger. Sometimes less is more.”O’Donnell used her phone, along with Lightroom for some very minor edits. “I hope the photo makes people smile,” she says. “It makes me happy that such a random, spontaneous moment turned into a cute photo that tells a little story.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotArtDogsPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Oak acorns falling, overripe brambles decaying, glistening spiders’ webs, a sun-bleached field of dry grasses, dark umberangelicaumbels loaded with seeds.Last time we walked this path, dodging muddy puddles on a chilly March morning, we found whiteblackthorn blossom. Today, those bushes were laden with blue-black sloes, some already wrinkled. Thistledown, torn asunder by a charm ofgoldfinches, drifts over the wall as we wander down towards the river. The birds erupt and rise over our heads, a twittering flock of gold-barred wings against blue sky, wheeling this way and that, uncertain, wary, then settle again.View image in fullscreenAngelica seed heads and sun-bleached grassland.Photograph: Phil GatesAt the bottom of the hill, the footpath broadens into a patch of heathland, then meanders between head-highgorse bushes. There’s no wind, just perfect stillness. It’s so quiet that we can hear the crackle of gorse seed pods splitting, hurling out seeds that pitter-patter into the undergrowth.There aregreenbottleflies basking on yarrow flowers, devil’s-bit scabious inflorescences bending under the weight of comatose bumblebees, hoverflies settled on hawkweeds. Night temperatures are falling, so these may be the final days for lethargic insects visiting the few wild flowers still in bloom.Small copperbutterflies are nectaring on the last remaining ragwort. When I crouch to photograph one, it flits away, settles on another flower, and then another, leading me on a tantalising chase. When I’m about to give up, it lands among lichens on a drystone wall, spreading its wings towards the sun that’s already dipping towards the western horizon.Now I’m close enough to see summer’s wear and tear on the butterfly’s wings – ragged edges, worn patches. When bright sunlight strikes them at a certain angle, wing scales of freshly minted small coppers glow with fiery orange intensity, some scales reflecting green iridescent scintillas – the same mesmerising colours that make it so hard to leave the comfort of a blazing log fire on a dark winter evening. This butterfly’s wings are still exquisitely beautiful, but time has quenched their fire. Now they’re dying embers of a memorable butterfly summer.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsButterfliesCountry diaryRural affairsInsectsSummerAutumnPlantsWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Since getting married in 2013, Geedi had seen control over Moqokori change hands repeatedly.“Just like how the rain comes and goes, so does control over Moqokori, but this time it was different,” Geedi said.Since launching their offensive in February, al-Shabaab has swept through a swath of Somalia, taking back all the territory it lost to a coalition of government forces and allied tribal militias backed by US and Turkish air support in 2023, and adding more. In July, the fighting had reached within 40km (25 miles) of Mogadishu, the capital. Some observers predicted the capital might fall.“The fear was immense. Word started spreading that [al-Shabaab] were advancing. When the fear got too much to bear, I decided to leave,” said Geedi, who headed for the town of Buloburde, 90km away, with her husband and nine children.In recent weeks, frontlines have stabilised, though government security forces are still on the defensive. There is a construction boom in Mogadishu, and few now believe the capital will be seized by the militants.Though the US has intensified airstrikes against al-Shabaab and other militant groups in Somalia, Washington has signalled it will not send back the hundreds of special forces withdrawn during Donald Trump’s first term.Instead, countries such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Uganda have committed troops, training or air support over recent years, while theAfrican Union missioncontinues to field thousands of soldiers. Egypt is now sending a large contingent too.Without this support, government forces would collapse, analysts say.“It’s a strategic stalemate,” said Samira Gaid, regional security analyst withBalqiis, a Mogadishu-based thinktank. “Al-Shabaab are not interested in taking Mogadishu. They have a lot of smaller towns under their control and most of the rural areas. We have been stuck here for a while … and we will be stuck with it for as long as the government has the edge provided by foreign troops.”The success of the recent al-Shabaab offensive has dealt a significant blow to the morale of fragmented security forces and the government of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who pledged“total war”against the militants after taking power in 2022.“I’ve lost 20 friends [fellow soldiers] and have been wounded twice in battle,” said one 42-year-old Somalia National Army veteran in the city of Beledweyne.“I’ve fought in Beera Yabaal, Aboorey, Yasooman, Mabaax, Ceel Qooxle, Adan Yabaal, Masjid Cali Gaduud and Daaru Nicma. In the time since, all these areas have been recaptured by al-Shabaab,” he said. “[Al-Shabaab fighters] believe if they die, heaven awaits them, while most soldiers … want to collect their meagre salaries and return to their families.”The veteran said he was concerned by the rapid gains made by al-Shabaab in recent months but fears worse is to come if nothing is done now to stop the militant advance.“Now [al-Shabaab] are in a position where they can move fighters and supplies [around the country] as result of capturing strategic towns in Hiiraan. This puts many more areas in south and central Somalia at risk of falling. They are moving fast,” he said.Observers point to the government’s weakness as the main cause of the militants’ recent success.“The situation with al-Shabaab on the ground is always determined by the overall political and security environment and that is quite bad at the moment,” said Ahmed Soliman, an expert in eastAfricaat Chatham House in London.“There are really big divisions in the country and these make it very difficult for federal government, its forces and international forces to coordinate counter terrorist efforts. Al-Shabaab are taking advantage of a very fragmented political landscape at this time.”Further funding for the $160m a year African Union force in Somalia is also uncertain, which “has an impact on operations”, Soliman said.Three weeks after the fall of Moqokori,al-Shabaab seized the strategic town of Maxaas, which sent shock waves across the country.“With each day that passed more people started leaving. Homes had been abandoned, stores and markets left empty,” said Nimo Abdi Barre, 37.With her husband and six children, Nimo trekked to the outskirts of town, where they where able to hitchhike on a lorry heading towards the city of Beledweyne – the capital of Hirshabelle province.“My kids where vomiting and screaming. This was made worse by fears of IEDs and landmines on the road. My faith in God is what got me through,” she said.Nimo has remained in Beledweyne, which the government has so far successfully defended.“I’m here with family but at the same time nothing is worse then feeling like a refugee on your own soil,” she said. “I want to return home but only time will tell if I ever get the chance.”Explore more on these topicsSomaliaAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaAl-ShabaabnewsShareReuse this content"

Ishiba, a moderate whose election last year had angered the right of his party, said it was time to find a successor to lead a “new LDP”.Takaichi, 64, inherits a party that has enduredtwo bruising electionsin the past year as voters punished it over a funding scandal and its failure to address the cost of living crisis.Sanae Takaichi: the new leader of Japan’s Liberal Democratic party who cites Thatcher as an influenceRead more“Together with so many of you, we have carved a new era for the LDP,” Takaichi said moments after defeating Koizumi by 185 votes to 156. “Rather than feeling happy right now, I feel real challenges lie ahead. I am convinced that there is a mountain of work we must tackle together.“We must all pull together across all generations and work as one to rebuild the LDP. Everyone will have to work like a horse.”As expected, Takaichi won the first round of voting, securing 183 of 589 votes, with Koizumi in second place with 164 votes. Three other candidates were knocked out of the contest. The runoff, in which MPs’ votes were given greater weight than those of rank-and-file party members, theoretically favoured Koizumi, who was said to be more popular among lawmakers. But it was Takaichi who emerged the winner after the second, decisive round of voting.Although the LDP-led coalition no longer holds a majority of seats in parliament, Takaichi is widely expected to be approved as prime minister when MPs vote, with 15 October the most likely date.To deny her the prime ministership, opposition parties would have to unite behind their own candidate – a scenario observers agree is unthinkable.Her immediate task will be to unite her party and win back public support aftermore than a year of scandaland poor election results.She will also have to address public concern overimmigrationand mass tourism, and try to win over younger voters whoturned to populist minor parties such as Sanseitoin this summer’s upper house elections. Japan should “reconsider policies that allow in people with completely different cultures and backgrounds”, Takaichi said during the campaign.It is impossible to understate the symbolism of Takaichi’s victory in a country that hasfew female politiciansand business leaders, and consistently ranks poorly in global gender gap comparisons. She has, though, opposed policies that many voters believe would advance the cause of gender equality, such as allowing women to become reigning empresses and married couples to useseparate surnames.Japan’s next PM will face a problem that won’t go away with Shigeru Ishiba’s resignationRead moreSaturday’s vote had been described by analysts as a battle for the future of the LDP, which has governedJapanalmost uninterrupted for the past seven decades. Its electoral dominance has been badly shaken, however, by a long-running scandal involving dozens of MPs who were found to have siphoned unreported profits from the sale of tickets to party gatherings into slush funds.Takaichi, a foreign policy hawk, will also face a volatile security environment in east Asia, including the rise of a looseanti-western alliancecomprising China, Russia and North Korea, and the redrawing of economic ties with the US under Donald Trump, who will reportedly visit Japan towards the end of the month.Each of the LDP’s 295 lawmakers voted in the first round of Saturday’s vote, with an equal number of votes distributed based on the preferences of just over 1 million grassroots members who had already cast their votes.After none of the candidates secured an overall majority in the first round, Takaichi and Koizumi went head to head, with each of the LDP’s 295 lawmakers getting one vote and the membership’s share dropping to 47 votes, one for each of Japan’s prefectures.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Dozens of students remain unaccounted for and the death toll is expected to rise.Rescuers initially searched by hand for survivors after the building caved in on Monday. But with no more signs of life detected by Thursday, they turned to heavy excavators equipped with jackhammers to help them progress more rapidly.Crews worked in the hot sun on Friday to break up and remove large slabs of concrete, with the smell of decomposing bodies a grim reminder of what they would find underneath.By the evening, they had found nine bodies, bringing the confirmed death toll to 14, with nearly 50 students still unaccounted for.1:05Rescuers race to find survivors after school collapse in Indonesia – videoThe structure fell on top of hundreds of people on Monday in a prayer hall at the century-old Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school in Sidoarjo in East Java, about 780km (480 miles) east of Jakarta.The head of Indonesia’s National Disaster Mitigation Agency, Suharyanto, told reporters at the scene on Friday that the recovery efforts were expected to be complete by the end of Saturday.The students were mostly boys in grades seven to 12, between the ages of 12 and 19.

Police said the old building’s foundation apparently was unable to support the extra floors and collapsed during the pouring process.School officials have not yet commented.Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They’re in very old trees. They can’t be rehabilitated or brought back at the pace that the Baudin’s needs them to be.”The state’s Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) recently opened up Alcoa’s proposals for community consultation; the first time the public has had a chance to scrutinise the company’s operations in the area in 60 years.It received more than 59,000 submissions – the highest number ever through a consultation process. Almost 90% were template responses, pre-written as part of an organised campaign, and the EPA said the record volume of responses highlighted the public’s interest in the assessment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The authority would then deliver a report with its recommendations to the state’s environment minister, he said.From blackening skies to barely casting a shadow – the Carnaby’s cockatoo faces a bleak futureRead moreAn Alcoa spokesperson said the company believed environmental factors should be “purposefully considered and responsibly managed in conjunction with development activities necessary to produce the aluminium required to meet growing global demand, largely driven by requirements for decarbonisation”.“In both our current mining areas, and in future mining areas before the WA EPA – a proposal which involves clearing less than a 1 per cent additional area of the Northern Jarrah Forest over the next 20 years – we have avoidance measures in place to protect areas of high conservation value,” they said.“Our environmental review documentation outlines the mitigation measures that Alcoa considers will ensure there are no significant impacts to threatened species including black cockatoos.”The spokesperson said proposed mitigation measures included avoiding known and potential black cockatoo nesting trees and having buffer zones around them.Henryon said Baudin’s were so familiar to Western Australians, “we almost take them for granted”.“We have these birds flying around; they are part of the south-west’s identity. Are we happy for them to just fade away?” he said.“If we want to protect them, we need to look after their homes. If we’re fair dinkum about this, we actually have to do something.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian bird of the year 2025Australian bird of the yearWestern AustraliaBirdsWildlifeAnimalsConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

The federal government is yet to formally respond to the report.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe offer of “a guaranteed share of $1m in bonus bets” was only provided if the man copied one of Sportsbet’s suggested same-game multi bets.

If he bet up to $50, Sportsbet would increase his stake by up to 400% with $200 in bonus bets.He was subsequently sent four text messages over two days saying “TIME IS RUNNING OUT (…) your deposit match expires soon. Don’t miss out!”.Weeks later, after the offer had expired, Sportsbet sent him a more generous offer in a text message saying “EXCLUSIVE 600% DEPOSIT MATCH” with up to $300 in bonus bets.On the morning of the AFL grand final, the man was sent another text saying “TIME IS RUNNING OUT!”. Within 90 minutes, he received another text saying “copy any AFL GF SGM [grand final same-game multi] from the Feed and get guaranteed share of $1m in bonus bets”.The Feed is Sportsbet’s online portal that includes suggested bets from former players associated with the bookmaker.Shortly before the season began, Sportsbet pulled ads for same-game multis from free-to-air television after listening to “strong community sentiment”. But ads for the product weresplashed on the AFL’s official website a few months later.The independent MP Kate Chaney, who was a member of the parliamentary inquiry, criticised the use of inducements on grand final day.“Inducements encourage higher bets and more risk taking,” Chaney said. “The evidence shows a clear link between inducements and increased gambling harm, which is why our inquiry recommended an immediate ban.”The independent senator, David Pocock, said inducements including these text messages were “designed to encourage risky behaviours and research shows it’s working”.“Researchers from the ANU this week showed levels of risky gambling are reaching levels never seen before,” Pocock said. “The Murphy review recommended we put a ban on inducements, but to date the Albanese government has still not even responded to any of its 31 recommendations.”A Sportsbet spokesperson said the company “takes seriously its responsibility to be a leader in safer gambling culture and technology”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The OPP had previously declined to comment on the referrals.The director of public prosecutions is also considering whether to appeal against the sentence handed down to Patterson, the spokesperson said.Such appeals are rare, but can occur if the DPP considers a sentence to be manifestly inadequate.On 8 September, Patterson wassentenced to life imprisonmentwith a non-parole period of 33 years for the murders of Don and Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson, and the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson.The deadline for a DPP appeal relating to Patterson’s sentence is Monday, a shorter timeframe than the defence is allowed to appeal under new guidelines being trialled by the Victorian supreme court.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailNeither ARN Media, the owner of the station Kiis FM that broadcasts The Kyle and Jackie O Show, nor the producer of the serial killers event, responded to previous requests for comment.Separately, it wasrevealed this weekthat the Australian Communications and Media Authority was considering taking enforcement action against the Kiis network as The Kyle and Jackie O Show repeatedly aired “vulgar, sexually explicit and deeply offensive” content despite multiple warnings.In the Patterson case, Beale told the Victorian supreme court on 16 June in the absence of the jury: “This morning the presenters of the Kyle and Jackie O radio show commented on this case during a news segment on their show.“I have read a transcript of that commentary. I encourage all commentators to engage their brains before they open their mouths, as they may otherwise land themselves and their organisations in hot water. I will be referring this morning’s matter to the Office of Public Prosecutions for contempt proceedings.”Guardian Australia reviewed a podcast of the show, which was available online on the afternoon Beale made his comments.In the podcast, Sandilands said after a news item about the trial, which erroneously said the jury was expected to retire to consider its verdict that week, “Is this big lump still getting around, this big lump … miserable looking thing.“Did she do it or what?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The identity of the flags are unknown.In an email sent by the Swedish foreign ministry to people close to Thunberg, and seen by the Guardian, an official who has visited the activist in prison said she claimed she was detained in a cell infested with bedbugs, with too little food and water.“The embassy has been able to meet with Greta,” reads the email. “She informed of dehydration. She has received insufficient amounts of both water and food. She also stated that she had developed rashes which she suspects were caused by bedbugs. She spoke of harsh treatment and said she had been sitting for long periods on hard surfaces.”“Another detainee reportedly told another embassy that they had seen her [Thunberg] being forced to hold flags while pictures were taken. She wondered whether images of her had been distributed,” the Swedish ministry’s official added.The allegation was corroborated by at least two other members of the flotilla who had been detained by Israeli forces and released on Saturday.“They dragged little Greta [Thunberg] by her hair before our eyes, beat her, and forced her to kiss the Israeli flag. They did everything imaginable to her, as a warning to others,” the Turkish activist ErsinÇelik, a participant in the Sumud flotilla, told Anadolu news agency.Lorenzo D’Agostino, a journalist and another flotilla participant, said after returning to Istanbul that Thunberg was “wrapped in the Israeli flag and paraded like a trophy” – a scene described with disbelief and anger by those who witnessed it.Thunberg is among 437 activists, parliamentarians and lawyers who were part of the Global Sumud flotilla, a coalition of more than 40 vessels carrying humanitarian aid whose goal was to breach Israel’s 16-year maritime blockade ofGaza.Between Thursday and Friday, Israeli forces intercepted all the boats and arrested every crew member onboard. Most of them are being held at Ketziot, also known as Ansar III, a high-security prison in the Negev desert used primarily to detain Palestinian security prisoners, many of whom Israel accuses of involvement in militant or terrorist activities.In the past, activists detained by Israel were not criminally prosecuted and instead their presence was treated as an immigration matter.According to lawyers from the NGO Adalah, the rights of the crew members have been “systematically violated”, activists denied water, sanitation, medication and immediate access to their legal representatives “in clear breach of their fundamental rights to due process, impartial trial and legal representation”.The Italian legal team representing the flotilla confirmed those detained were left “for hours without food or water – until late last night”, with the exception of “a packet of crisps handed to Greta and shown to the cameras”. Lawyers also reported instances of verbal and physical abuse.During a visit to Ashdod on Thursday night, Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was filmed calling the activists “terrorists” as he stood in front of them.“These are the terrorists of the flotilla,” he said, speaking in Hebrew and pointing at dozens of people sitting on the ground. His spokesperson confirmed the video was filmed at Ashdod port on Thursday night.Some activists were heard shouting: “FreePalestine.”Ben-Gvir has previously called for the activists to be jailed rather than deported.After their arrest, the flotilla’s legal team expressed concern over the treatment the crew members might face, particularly those who had previously been detained by Israeli authorities after attempts to break Gaza’s naval blockade. This marks the second time Thunberg has been arrested alongside other flotilla members, after a similar attempt earlier this yearended with the activists’ arrest and deportation.Baptiste André, a French doctor who was on one of the boats of the flotilla in June,told reportersupon his return to France that he witnessed Israeli border agents mock and deliberately deprive passengers of sleep, in particular Thunberg.The Swedish official said in the email that Thunberg was asked by Israeli authorities to sign a document.“She expressed uncertainty about what the document meant and did not want to sign anything she did not understand,” reads the email. The Swedish ministry’s official wrote that Thunberg has had access to legal counsel.Adalah said in an earlier statement about the legal process that although Israeli authorities would have a record of repeat participants in aid flotillas, activists, such as Thunberg, were generally treated in the same way as first-time participants, subject to short-term detention and deportation.The Guardian contacted the Israel Prison Service, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israeli ministry for foreign affairs but none have yet responded to a request for comment.The Swedish foreign ministry said its embassy officials had visited nine detained Swedes on Friday: “The Swedish embassy in Tel Aviv remains in contact with Israeli authorities to stress the importance of swift processing and the possibility of returning home toSweden. Based on discussions with detained individuals, the importance of addressing individual medical needs was also emphasised.“Moreover, the embassy stressed that food and clean water must be provided immediately, and that all detainees must be given access to Israeli legal counsel, if desired.”The Israeli embassy said the allegations were “complete lies”. “All detainees from the Hamas-Sumud provocation were given access to water, food and toilets; they were not denied access to legal counsel, and all their legal rights, including access to medical care, were fully upheld.“Israel is and will remain a state governed by the rule of law, committed to upholding the rights and dignity of all individuals in accordance with international standards,” it said.Explore more on these topicsGaza flotillaGreta ThunbergIsraelGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaSwedennewsShareReuse this content"

He is expected to put the country on a course away from supporting Ukraine and towards Hungary and Slovakia, who have taken a pro-Russian path.With the votes from almost 98% of polling stations counted by the Czech statistics office, Babiš’s ANO (YES) party captured 35% of the vote, followed by the pro-western coalition of the prime minister, Petr Fiala, with 23.0%.The coalition defeated Babiš in the 2021 election.The two-day election filled 200 seats in the lower house of the Czech parliament. A group of mayors known as STAN, also a member of Fiala’s government, received 11.1% of the vote, with another ally of Fiala, the Pirates party, getting an 8.7% share.Babiš, a self-proclaimed “Trumpist”, was all smiles and hailed the “historic result” as “the absolute peak” of his political career. Voter turnout for this election was high, at almost 69%.As Babiš’s ANO did not win the overall majority, the 71-year-old is expected to be invited to lead talks in forming a new coalition. He has already ruled out cooperation with any of the parties that have been in the government after the 2021 election.His potential partners include the fringe parties Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD), an anti-immigration party that won 7.9% of the vote, and a rightwing group called the Motorists, which received 6.8%.He may need to form an alliance with both parties to be able to hold the overall majority. “We will definitely lead talks with the SPD and the Motorists and seek a single-party government led by ANO,” Babiš said.During its election campaign, ANO advocated for increased welfare spending and a reduction in foreign aid, including donations to Ukraine. It also promised higher wages and pensions, and lower taxes and tax discounts for students and young families – all in hope of ending austerity.An ally of the Hungarian leader, Viktor Orbán, Babiš has teamed up with a number of far-right parties in the Patriots forEuropegroup in the European parliament to challenge the mainstream direction of Europe’s policies, including decarbonisation.Explore more on these topicsCzech RepublicEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

This is terrorism, which the world has no right to ignore,” Zelenskyy wrote.Moscow has stepped up its airstrikes on Ukraine’s railway infrastructure, hitting it almost every day over the last two months.Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in its war in Ukraine, although many thousands have been killed by its military.In a video interview from a train en route to the strike site, the CEO of Ukraine’s state rail company Oleksandr Pertsovskyi told Reuters the drones had targeted locomotives, but had also damaged the carriages attached to them.“In essence, they are hunting for locomotives,” he said, adding that Russia was increasingly deploying this tactic.He said the trains hit had been a local commuter service and another train headed to the capital, Kyiv.The rail boss said there was only civilian traffic at the station. He said he believed this was an attempt to make areas like Shostka, about 50km (30 miles) from the Russian border, unsafe for passenger traffic.“They are doing everything to make frontline and border areas uninhabitable, so that people are afraid to go there, afraid to board trains, afraid to gather at markets, and so that students are afraid to return home.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

He said Russia’s recent drone incursions against several EU countries were well-calculated and an attempt to “move the red lines”.“I’m sure Putin gets emotional if not physical satisfaction humiliating the west by showing what he perceives as his super-strength,” Kyslytsya said, adding that the Russian president’s reckless actions risked antagonising a White House that appeared to be cooling on him. “It’s a boomerang thing,” Kyslytsya said.What Russia does next depends on whether Europe and theTrump administrationshow collective resolve, he suggested. Without a decisive transatlantic response, Putin would “escalate escalating”, he predicted, with more actions designed to disrupt and paralyse the continent.View image in fullscreenDanish police officers scour and area after Copenhagen airport was closed due to drone reports.Photograph: Steven Knap/ReutersIn recent weeks Russia has sent decoy drones across the border into Poland and dispatched fighter jets that violated Estonia’s airspace. Incidents involving drones that restricted flights at Munich and Copenhagen airports have raised fears of Russian involvement. Moscow has denied responsibility.Kyslytsya claimed Russia had infiltrated EU countries with “agents and moles” he said were responsible for drone flights over airports in Denmark and Germany, as well as in allied military bases. He described them askonservy– literally tin cans in Ukrainian – who could be activated or “opened” by Moscow when needed.This week, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, met EU leaders at a summit in Copenhagen, where the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Europe faced its most difficult and dangerous situation since the end of the second world war and thatall countries were affected by the “Russian hybrid war”.View image in fullscreenThe Danish PM, Mette Frederiksen, talks to Germany’s Friedrich Merz and France’s Emmanuel Macron on Thursday.Photograph: Mads Claus Rasmussen/EPAKyslytsya said he believed European leaders have generally woken up to the threat but added that many others – including experts and professionals in western Europe – had yet to grasp it. Greater education was needed to spread the message, in the face of a ruthless and “unscrupulous adversary”, he said.“Many politicians are still keeping in their heads in the patterns and algorithms of the last century, where a war means boots on the ground and tanks moving in,” Kyslytsya said.“In the 21st century you don’t need tanks to put technologically advanced countries on their knees. Cyberwar is a reality. Howitzers are not necessary to paralyse the banking system. By using drones in a smart way you can achieve your goals better than with a nuclear bomb.”Speaking at the foreign ministry in Kyiv, Kyslytsya said Ukraine’s relations with the US administration had improved since spring, when Donald Trump berated Zelenskyy during the two leaders’ meeting in the Oval Office in February. Washington’s attitude towards the war was “moving”, with a greater understanding that Putin was the main obstacle to peace, Kyslytsya said.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy meets Donald Trump on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York.Photograph: Press Service Of The President Of UkraineIn recent months Ukraine has carried out an increasingly successful campaign to cripple Russia’s oil production, via long-range strikes using homemade drones. According to the Wall Street Journal, the US this week agreed to share intelligence to help Kyiv coordinate attacks on targets deep inside Russia.Overall, however, Trump has taken few concrete steps to pressure Moscow. Asked whether the US president’s threats were rhetorical rather than real, Kyslystya said: “Trump is holding a big stick. That’s already an achievement. We should not undervalue that. People forget where we were six months ago.”The deputy foreign minister suggested the war was turning in Ukraine’s favour, despite the fact Russian troops continue to advance – albeit slowly – in several parts of the battlefield. He cited positive changes in Washington, “more serious” discussions in Europe and Russia’s failure to achieve a military breakthrough in its summer offensive.View image in fullscreenSergiy Kyslytsya holds the UN charter as he addresses an emergency special session of the general assembly on Russia’s invasion in March 2022.Photograph: Eduardo Muñoz/ReutersKyslystya is one of the Ukrainian government’s most effective communicators, known for his lively social media posts.

Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled a 20-point plan this week. Hamas has accepted part of the deal but ispushing to negotiateother aspects.The US president recounted a conversation he had with the Israeli prime minister as the proposal took place.“I said: ‘Bibi, this is your chance for victory.’ He was fine with it,” Trump told Axios. “He’s got to be fine with it. He has no choice. With me, you got to be fine.”On Friday, Trumpordered Israelto “immediately” stop bombing Gaza after Hamas agreed to release all hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. On Saturday, Israeli army radio reported that the Israeli military had been ordered to halt its campaign in Gaza City. However, Gaza’s civil defence agencysaidIsrael had continued to carry out dozens of airstrikes and artillery shelling on the area.Donald Trump orders Israel to ‘immediately’ stop bombing Gaza as Hamas agrees to free hostagesRead moreTrump told Axios: “We had great receptivity for our plan – every country of the world in favor.

The second thing she felt was an explosion. An Israeli aircraft had dropped a bomb close to her tent in Khan Younis, southern Gaza.Though it was luck that saved Farra from death, she took the attack as a bad omen for the prospects for peace inGaza.“I feel like we are in a trap. Whether Hamas agrees or not, we will not be safe … There has been no reduction in the intensity of attacks here, no Israeli aircraft has withdrawn from the sky,” said the 23-year-old English teacher who had been displaced to Khan Younis.Farra was not alone in her scepticism of Friday’s news thatHamas’s partial acceptanceof the US president’s plan would lead to an end to the nearly two-year war in Gaza.Hamas’s agreement to release all hostages and surrender power was hailed by Trump and much of the international community as a step towards peace on Friday.But the residents of Gaza have been here before.Trump has on several occasions promised a ceasefire was days away, only for negotiations to suddenly collapse. Israel broke a six-week ceasefire at the beginning of the year after it unilaterally decided to resume fighting in March and besiege the territory, creating famine in parts of Gaza, according to the world’s leading authority on food crises.“I have little hope in this deal, because every time we are on the verge of a ceasefire, something happens that changes the course of plans,” Farra explained.What’s in Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza?Read moreStill, others could not help but hope that this could finally lead to an end to the war that has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, wounded about 170,000 more and left most of Gaza destroyed.“I am hopeful and expect that this time the deal will be more serious than previous ones,” said Abu Faris, a 43-year-old video editor living in northern Gaza. “A breakthrough in the ceasefire deal would be a good thing. It would meet the demands of the Palestinian people and give civilians in northern Gaza a sense of hope and security.”If fully implemented, Trump’s plan to end the fighting in Gaza would be deeply unfavourable to Hamas and other Palestinian factions.Dr Ashraf Maghari, a 48-year-old professor at the Islamic University, said: “There is a sense of mistrust because this plan was drafted by American hands and the war itself has continued with clear American support … The plan clearly serves Israel’s interests and does not include any meaningful provisions for the Palestinians.”But to most exhausted residents of Gaza, neither politics nor the survival of Hamas were the priority.Faris said: “My priority now is to end the war completely. If Hamas has to sacrifice itself to achieve that, then it must bear the consequences of its actions.”He had already lost many of his close relatives to the war, and had been displaced four times, each time returning to find his home more damaged. He could lose much more if fighting did not end soon, as he was in northern Gaza, where Israeli bombardment is intense.A UN commission of inquiry, several human rights organisations and the world’s leading association of genocide scholars have concluded that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza. Israel denies the accusation and says it has only acted in self-defence. It initially launched the war on Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage in an attack on 7 October 2023.Neither Faris nor Farra believed that Israel would negotiate an end to the war in good faith, nor that it would lead to self-determination for Palestinians. For Farra, in particular, the prospect of disarmament was a worrying one.Nonetheless, if it led to an end to the almost relentless bombing of their homes, both said the deal would be worth it.“Ending the war for me is not about silencing our rights. It is about taking a deep breath, reorganising ourselves, our lives, our priorities and our thoughts,” Farra said.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineIsraelHamasDonald TrumpIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Army radio reported that operations in Gaza would be reduced to “the minimum” with troops meant only to carry out defensive strikes.The orders came as the US president, Donald Trump,demanded Israel stop bombing Gazalate on Friday night after welcoming Hamas’s part-acceptance of his proposal to end the nearly two-year war in Gaza.Despite Trump’s demands, Israel continued striking theGazaStrip and besieging Gaza City on Saturday.View image in fullscreenPalestinians set off northwards from Nuseirat camp on Saturday.Photograph: APA Images/ShutterstockAt least six Palestinian civilians, including two children, were killed in Israeli strikes on a house in Gaza City and a tent housing displaced people in al-Mawasi. Drones also targeted a gathering of people near a bakery in central Gaza City, killing “dozens” of people, according to Wafa, the Palestinian news agency.Israeli military Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned residents not to return to northern Gaza or Gaza City, where Israeli troops are still operating, in a post on X on Saturday morning.What’s in Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza?Read moreHamas agreed to release all 48 remaining hostages and surrender governing power of the Gaza Strip, while calling fornegotiations on other parts of the proposal. Trump said that based on Hamas’s response, it was ready for peace.The office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Friday that Israel was committed to ending the war in Gaza. After Trump’s approval of Hamas’s acceptance, the prime minister will face pressure to implement the plan, which met withwidespread approval internationallyand in Israel.View image in fullscreenPeople inspect the damage in a residential neighbourhood of Gaza City on Saturday.Photograph: Ebrahim Hajjaj/ReutersIsraeli opposition politician Yair Lapid said on Friday night that the Trump plan was a “genuine opportunity to release the hostages and end the war” and that he would back Netanyahu politically to engage in further negotiations to finalise the deal.Israeli negotiating teams have been instructed to prepare to resume talks today to implement the first part of Trump’s plan, according to Israeli media.While many details of the plan and its final implementation remained unclear, momentum seemed to be building towards reaching a deal. The positive statements by bothHamasand Trump indicated that the possibility of an end to the war in Gaza was closer than in recent months, though previous ceasefire efforts have collapsed in the negotiation phase even with significant momentum behind them.A senior Hamas official told Agence France-Presse on Saturday that Egypt was organising a conference for Palestinian factions to decide on the postwar future of the Gaza Strip, which Hamas had outlined as the way forward on the Trump plan.Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a hardline militant group aligned with Hamas, said it was onboard with Hamas’s response to the Trump plan. In a statement, PIJ said Hamas’s reply “represents the position of the Palestinian resistance factions”.The support of PIJ, which holds Israeli hostages, is a key signal that Hamas has the backing of other militant groups within Gaza to move forward with the Trump plan.Trump’s 20-point plan calls for an immediate end to fighting in Gaza; the release of the remaining 48 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza within 72 hours in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian political prisoners; the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza; the disarmament of Hamas and a transitional authority of the strip led by Trump himself.The plan also called for a surge of aid to Gaza, parts of which are undergoing famine due to an Israeli blockade on the territory, and the reconstruction of the devastated strip.View image in fullscreenPeople line up for food at Nuseirat camp. Parts of Gaza are experiencing famine.Photograph: APAImages/ShutterstockHamas’s reply to the Trump plan notably did not mention anything about laying down arms, an issue that presumably will have to be resolved in future negotiations.The Trump plan is largely seen as unfavourable to Hamas. Israel, in turn, has to give few concessions. However, Palestinians in Gaza are desperate for an end to fighting after nearly two years of devastating bombing, hunger and displacement.Israel’s war in Gaza has killed at least 67,074 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000 according to the Gaza health authority, which says the majority of those killed were civilians. Israel launched the war after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.A UN commission of inquiry, as well as the world’s leading association of scholars on genocide, have concluded that Israeli has committed genocide in Gaza.

What would Orwell think of us now?’Read moreDespite the qualified response byHamas, Trump said in a post on Truth Social: “Based on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE.“Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it’s far too dangerous to do that.“We are already in discussions on details to be worked out. This is not aboutGazaalone, this is about long sought PEACE in the Middle East.”In a brief video message posted separately Trump said it was a “very special day” and added that “Everybody will be treated fairly.”The unprecedented order from Trump underlined that Israel and Hamas are the closest they have been in two years to achieving an end to the war in Gaza.After the Hamas response, the office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, issued a statement cited by local media saying Israel was preparing for an “immediate implementation” of the first stage of the plan for the immediate release of all hostages.“We will continue to work in full cooperation with the president and his team to end the war in accordance with the principles laid out by Israel, which correspond with Trump’s vision for ending the war,” the statement said, making no mention of Trump’s demand that Israel stop bombing Gaza.Trump is widely seen as the only international leader with the power to compel Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire deal.Netanyahu later on Saturday vowed to disarm Hamas, either through the plan proposed by Trump or by military means, and said he hoped to bring home the hostages being held in Gaza in a matter of days.“Hamas will be disarmed … it will happen either diplomatically via Trump’s plan or militarily by us,” Netanyahu said.Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Saturday that Israel had carried out dozens of airstrikes and artillery shelling on Gaza City despite Trump’s appeal.View image in fullscreenPalestinians assist a woman wounded after an Israeli strike on a tent at al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, on Wednesday.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/Reuters“It was a very violent night, during which the [Israeli army] carried out dozens of airstrikes and artillery shelling on Gaza City and other areas in the strip, despite president Trump’s call to halt the bombing,” a civil defence spokesperson, Mahmud Bassal, told AFP. He said 20 homes were destroyed in the attacks.Gaza City’s Baptist hospital said it had received casualties from a strike on a home in the city’s Tuffah neighbourhood, including four dead and several wounded, while Nasser hospital in Khan Younis said two children were killed and eight people wounded in a drone strike on a tent in a camp for displaced people.In a statement earlier on Friday night, Hamas said it was giving its “approval of releasing all occupation prisoners – both living and remains – according to the exchange formula contained in president Trump’s proposal, with the necessary field conditions for implementing the exchange”.Hamas also said it was prepared to turn over “the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independent technocrats based on Palestinian national consensus and supported by Arab and Islamic backing”.However, the group said “other issues” in Trump’s proposal would need to be discussed further “within a unified Palestinian national framework”. The unspecified issues would probably include arms, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and international guarantees for a permanent ceasefire.A senior Hamas official told Al Jazeera that the group would not disarm before Israel’s occupation of the territory ends, comments that underscored the gap between the parties.Trump’s plan called for an immediate end to fighting in Gaza, an exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners within 72 hours of the deal’s signing, a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and a transitional authority led by Trump.The deal also stipulated an increase of aid to Gaza, parts of which areexperiencing famine, and the reconstruction to the mostly demolished strip.1:17Trump thanks countries involved in Gaza plan, says peace 'very close' – videoAn AFP journalist in the Gaza Strip’s coastal area of al-Mawasi said they heard celebratory cries of “Allahu Akbar!” (God is the greatest) rise from tents housing Palestinians as news of Hamas’s response filtered through.“The moment I read the news … my body trembled and shivered. A feeling came over me, like: ‘Oh Allah, at last relief has come to us,’” Samah al-Hu, a displaced Palestinian in al-Mawasi, said.The deal was largely seen as unfavourable to Hamas and, if agreed in full, would probably spell the group’s end as an armed Palestinian faction while demanding few concessions from Israel. International pressure on the group to accept the plan has been intense, with most regional and international powers welcoming the Trump initiative.The catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza, with Israel’s continued aid blockade and daily bombing, also puts pressure on the group to reach an agreement to end the war.Though Hamas did not immediately agree to disarm, its acceptance of a hostage handover will be seen as significant. The 48 hostages have been used as leverage throughout the war. Giving them up would leave the group with few bargaining chips.Israel’s war in Gaza has killed at least 66,288 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000, according to the Gaza health authority, mainly civilians. The figure does not include the thousands buried under the rubble or those killed by indirect consequences of the war.Egypt foreign minister urges Hamas to accept Trump Gaza plan and disarmRead moreA UN commission of inquiry and many human rights experts haveconcluded that Israel has committed genocidein Gaza. Netanyahu’s government says it has acted in self-defence.The war was launched by Israel in response to Hamas-led militants killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages in Israel on 7 October 2023.The Qatari ministry of foreign affairs also welcomed Hamas’s response, and said it had begun working with its fellow mediator Egypt to coordinate with the US on negotiations towards ending the war in Gaza.A spokesperson for the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he “urges all parties to seize the opportunity to bring the tragic conflict in Gaza to an end”, while the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, called for the Trump plan to be implemented “without delay”, saying Hamas’s acceptance of it was “a significant step forwards”.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, wrote on social media that “the release of all hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza are within reach!”, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said that “after almost two years, this is the best chance for peace”.With Reuters and AFPExplore more on these topicsGazaIsraelHamasDonald TrumpPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Our concentration should be on keeping people safe at a time when the country is on heightened alert from a terrorist attack. And instead officers are being drawn in to facilitate these relentless protests.View image in fullscreenPolice move a protester.Photograph: Anna Gordon/The Guardian“And we are coming under attack for doing so. How can this be right?“She added: “There aren’t enough of us. Hard-working police officers are continually having days off cancelled, working longer shifts and being moved from other areas to facilitate these protests.“We are emotionally and physically exhausted. What are politicians and senior police officers going to do about it?”The organisers, Defend Our Juries, previously said they expected the turnout to be higher than previous protests, with more than 1,500 people planning to attend, potentially beating an arrest record set at the 1961 anti-nuclear demonstration, which was held at the same London location.The demonstration went ahead despite Keir Starmer calling on protesters to call it off to“respect the grief of British Jews”, while Jewish figures called the action“phenomenally tone deaf”after Thursday’s killing of two people in the terror attack on a Manchester synagogue.In Manchester a demonstration by GM Friends of Palestine to mark the second anniversary of the start of the conflict saw hundreds of people gather.View image in fullscreenManchester for Palestine co-organiser John Nicholson.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianJohn Nicholson, a campaigner for the group, said increased tensions since the fatal attack on a synagogue in the city had led to some choosing to stay at home.“The genocide hasn’t stopped, so why should we?” he said. “If the bombings had stopped for a week, if food and medicine had been allowed to go into Gaza for a week, we may have taken a week off. But they haven’t, so we won’t.”Nicholson denied the claim that the march was a way of intimidating Manchester’s Jewish population, saying that Jewish people regularly attend the weekly meetings, and that the marches are meant to target policies and governments, not individuals.“We are not targeting any member of our community, least of all our Jewish community. It is targeted at Trump, at Starmer and at Netanyahu, who are war criminals and who must be held accountable,” he said.The demonstration ended outside the central library where it joined another group of Palestine activists who were reading the names of all the people killed in the past two years in Gaza. The reading, which was done in order of the ages of the deceased from youngest to oldest, began at 7am and, by the time the march reached it at about 1.45pm, still had not finished the names of toddlers.View image in fullscreenA vigil for the children killed in the conflict in Gaza outside Manchester central library.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianIn London, one protester, Trudy Warner, a retired social worker from London, was holding a sign reading “Police find your love, find your conscience.”She said she was focusing on the police because they were able to take action as individual officers and not participate in the mass arrests.“I would love to think they could learn from us about the power of collective action and walk away instead of doing this because it’s unconscionable. It’s actually unconscionable.”A Buckinghamshire couple, Larry and Sue, were holding a sign with a tweaked message in support of “Plasticine Action”.“About eight policemen came and they read me my rights and said I was being arrested under the Terrorism Act and they were about to take me away so I sat on the floor. And when they were bending down to take me away one of them noticed that it says something else and they had to let me go.”During the interview with the Guardian, a police officer approached them.“Sir, can I take your sign please?” the officer said, before realising it did not express support for Palestine Action. “I’m dyslexic!” she added.“I’m totally fed up with what is happening in Gaza,” said Larry. “Everybody that is not raising their voice to this is somehow slightly complicit in letting our government support this.”View image in fullscreenLarry from Buckinghamshire.Photograph: Anna Gordon/The GuardianThe Metropolitan police also said officers arrested six people in connection with a banner draped on Westminster Bridge in support of Palestine Action.The force said: “Officers were quickly on scene, the banner had been removed and the six people involved have been arrested for supporting a proscribed organisation.”Responding to Keir Starmer’s suggestion that the action should not go ahead, a Defend Our Juries supporter, Zoe Cohen, who was arrested at the August action and is Jewish, said: “Those who have used the attack on the Jewish community in Manchester to call for today’s vigil to be cancelled are wrongly conflating the actions of the Israeli state with all Jews. Jewish people around the world are not responsible for Israel’s crimes and there are many Jewish people who do not support the actions of the Israeli state. Cancelling today’s vigil would have perpetuated this dangerous narrative which fuels antisemitism.”She said if there was a strain on policing resources on Saturday, the blame lay with the government. If the protest had been cancelled, it would have been “letting terror win”.Cohen added: “When I was brought up learning about the Holocaust and we said ‘never again’, I learned that this means ‘never again’ for anyone.”Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Italians and Spaniards marched in Rome, Barcelona and Madrid against Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in a massive show of growing international anger over the two-year war.The protests on Saturday in Spain were planned weeks ago while those in Italy followedanger over Israel intercepting a humanitarian aid flotilla.Explore more on these topicsProtestMetropolitan policePoliceLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The attack took place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.Officers said on Friday that they believed Shamie, a 35-year-old British citizen of Syrian descent, may have been “influenced by extreme Islamist ideology” but added: “Establishing the full circumstances of the attack is likely to take some time.”The Guardian revealed on Friday that Shamie was on police bail for an alleged rape when he drove a car at members of the public before stabbing people at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in the Crumpsall area of the city.Melvin Cravitz, 66, and Adrian Daulby, 53, died in the attack. Police said they believed Daulby had been killed by a stray gunshot wound as armed officers shot Shamie. It was initially feared Shamie was wearing an explosive device, but it was later confirmed to be fake.Police said on Saturday that specialist officers had been granted warrants of further detention in relation to two men, age 30 and 32, and a 61-year-old woman arrested in Prestwich, near Bury. The fourth warrant concerns a 46-year-old woman who was arrested in Farnworth, near Bolton.In most cases, suspects must be released or charged within 24 hours of arriving at a police station, but this can be extended in more serious cases. Special exemptions apply to those suspected of a terror offence, who can be held for up to 14 days, pending court approval.The Manchester investigation is being led by Counter Terrorism Policing North West, with support from the national counter-terrorism policing network and local officers.An 18-year-old woman and a 43-year-old man who were also arrested in Farnworth were released and will face no further action, Greater Manchester police said on Saturday evening.The Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, visited the scene of the attack on Saturday before the party’s annual conference, which begins in the city on Sunday. Badenoch called for greater security for Britain’s Jewish population, saying some were “leaving to go to Israel”.Badenoch said: “Right now, what we’re seeing is people exercising their rights, but not responsibilities. Where is the responsibility to make sure that people are not intimidated? Where is the responsibility to make sure that people are treated equally under the law?“Jewish people right now are telling me that they are leaving to go to Israel. Israel is at war. How can people be leaving the UK to go to a war zone and think that they’ll be safer there? We need to bring back safety to our streets.”Badenoch added that “quite a lot needs to happen” to combat antisemitism, which has risen since the 7 October attacks almost two years ago.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Many railway lines and roads were closed and ferry services were disrupted amid high winds with gusts of more than 100mph recorded in some exposed areas.View image in fullscreenPart of the M77 was flooded in Kilmarnock, Scotland, on Friday amid Storm Amy.Photograph: Jeff Holmes JSHPIX/ShutterstockIn London, all eight of the city’s royal parks, including Hyde Park and Richmond Park, were closed on Saturday because of strong winds. A statement on the royal parks website said: “Due to severe wind gusts caused by Storm Amy, all of the royal parks, plus Brompton Cemetery and Victoria Tower Gardens, will be closed on Saturday 4 October.“This closure includes all park roads and cycleways, cafes and kiosks, park sports venues, the Serpentine lido and boating lake, and the royal parks shop.” It said opening times on Sunday would be delayed because of safety inspections.Storm Amy is expected to cause more problems for Scotland on Sunday after travel disruption, power cuts and floods.The north of Scotland will face a new amber warning for damaging winds with gusts of more than 90mph in some areas.Most of Scotland, apart from the east coast, will be covered by a yellow warning for rain while a yellow wind alert will be in place across the UK.A new record for the deepest area of low pressure in the UK for October has also been set. Storm Amy showed central pressure of 947.9 hectopascal (hPa) at Baltasound, Shetland. The previous record was 950.9hPa in 1988.Further travel disruption is likely to follow after several flights, rail and ferry services were cancelled.A building collapsed in Glasgow on Friday, falling on to a car, and leading to road closures in the city centre.Power cuts were also reported in the Highlands and a number of islands – the areas facing some of the worst weather.Fraser Wilson, from the Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks, spoke on BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme, where he said the network was working to restore power on Saturday morning.He said that 100mph winds had affected power, and while some people had their power restored there were still thousands without.He said: “Work will continue this morning to get 62,000 people reconnected. We expect, because of the extent of damage to the network and conditions we are still going to be facing today, that this will take some time, [but] this storm is not over by any means.”View image in fullscreenA car drives through a flooded park next to the sea on Friday during Storm Amy.Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/ReutersRoad closures also affected drivers and the Forth Road Bridge was shut to all traffic.The Tay Road Bridge reopened early on Saturday with a 30mph speed restriction but remained closed to high-sided vehicles, as were the Skye Bridge, Queensferry Crossing and Clackmannanshire Bridge.Scotland’s CalMac ferry operator said it expected many services to be disrupted over the weekend, with many routes cancelled.The Scottish government urged people to delay travel if they could and to check ahead if heading out.On Sunday, the north, north-east, Orkney and Shetlands islands will also continue to fall under a yellow warning for wind until 9am that morning.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The parent company has provided financial backing to several controversial Chinese technology firms including Sense Time, a pioneering facial recognition startup.In 2018, Investcorp International announced its “debut” investment inChina, pledging up to $150m (£112m) to the China Everbright new economy fund. The fund was designed to support the Chinese technology sector and promised “huge opportunities” for investors in the advent of AI. The China Everbright Group is an asset manager that is ultimately controlled by the Chinese government.One beneficiary was Sense Time, whose surveillance technology is used by the Chinese police. Investcorp International is understood to retain a small financial stake in the company.Human rights groups have accused China of carrying out mass surveillance on the Uyghur population in its northwestern Xinjiang province. More than a millionUyghursare believed to have been detained in a large network of “re-education” camps. In 2019, Sense Time filed a patent for a facial recognition device that it said had the ability to pick Uyghur Muslims out of a crowd.Although the company denied that the technology was used to discriminate against Uyghurs, the US imposed sanctions on Sense Time in 2021. The Biden administration said it was banning American investment in the firm because it was developing programmes that could “determine a target’s ethnicity, with a particular focus on identifying Uyghurs”.Earlier that year, British MPs voted to declare that the Chinese government was committing genocide against the Uyghur population, although Nigel Adams, the then Asia minister, said the government’s position was that it was a matter for the courts to determine. Beijing condemned the declaration and said MPs had “cooked up” the motion to discredit China.Fuller, the MP for North Bedfordshire, has held several roles at Investcorp Securities, some pre-dating his first election to parliament in 2010. However, he was only expected to consult Acoba when he wanted to rejoin the firm after leaving government.His current post earns him £25,000 a year on top of his parliamentary salary, according to the public register of MPs’ financial interests.Fuller said in a statement: “I returned as an adviser to the venture capital business in April 2023 following approval from the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. This was included in my register of interests in the usual way.“The venture capital group I advise is part of a much wider group, Investcorp. The funds I advise are solely focused on investments in European technology businesses.“At no time have I played any role at, or had any dealings with, either the China Everbright new economy fund or their portfolio company Sense Time.”Acoba is being wound down and will be disbanded this month after criticisms that it is “toothless”. Its functions will be transferred to a range of other government regulators.It is understood Acoba was not normally tasked with investigating the wider business activities of companies for which former ministers planned to work. It was supposed to consider whether a post-ministerial appointment could give rise to “public concern”.Acoba’s response to Fuller did not mention the Investcorp group’s documented links to Sense Time or suggest it had considered this when advising on the appointment.Its letter acknowledged a “risk” that Fuller’s “network and influence” could be used to assist Investcorp Securities unfairly. It added that in his government role Fuller may have had “access to general sensitive information which could benefit a range of organisations”.However, it said that these risks could be appropriately mitigated by a range of factors, including the fact Fuller’s time in the Treasury was brief. It noted that Fuller had not met with Investcorp Securities while in government. It advised Fuller he could take up the post on the condition that he did not use privileged information he had accessed or lobby the government on the company’s behalf for two years.A government spokesperson said: “We are committed to establishing the right structures to uphold the highest standards in public life. In July we announced a series of reforms, including forthcoming changes to the business appointments system.”A Sense Time spokesperson said the company “strongly opposes the unfounded designations and accusations made against it” by the US government and “regrets being caught in the midst of the geopolitical landscape”.The Investcorp group declined to comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

These drafts honoring America’s 250th birthday and [Trump] are real.”The X post – which boosted another account commenting on the draft design – said Beach looked “forward to sharing more” after the end of the partial government shutdown that began after midnight Wednesday when Senate Democrats demanding concessions on healthcare and other spending priorities refused to provide the votes necessary to pass a Republican-backed funding bill.AsPoliticopointed out, in 2020, at the end of his first presidency, Trump signed bipartisan legislation authorizing the treasury secretary to issue $1 coins during the calendar year 2026 that are “emblematic of the United States semiquincentennial”.One side of the coin on whose draft design Beach commented Friday showed Trump’s profile alongside “Liberty”, “In God we Trust”, and “1776-2026”.The other side referenced the attempt on Trump’s life at apolitical rally in Pennsylvanialast year, when authorities said a sniper injured Trump’s right ear and wounded two others before being shot to death by the US Secret Service.Trump raised his fist after the attack – one oftwo attempted assassinationsfor him as he successfully ran for a second Oval Office term in 2024 – and shouted, “Fight! Fight! Fight!” with an American flag looming nearby.A statement from a treasury department spokesperson to Politico said the draft which Beach’s X post discussed was not the “final $1 coin design”. But the statement maintained that “this draft reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles”.The US Mintsaysits commemorative coin program has generated more than $500m in surcharges – revenue that supports funding for monuments, federal museums and historical sites.Trump’s approval rating on average hasplummetedto -9.5%, as his second administration has cut healthcare protections and nutrition assistance that benefits the poor – while also implementing tariffs that preceded a reported rise in consumer prices.Apollof 3,445 US adults taken by Pew Research between 22 and 28 September showed 53% believed Trump had made the national economy worse. Only 24% believed that he’s improved the economy, according to the poll’s finding.Among other things, the Trump administration has also deployed US military troops into the streets of multiple cities, axed roughly half a billion dollars in funding for vaccines such as the ones that helped end the Covid pandemic, and struggled to contain a scandal over his past friendship with late convicted sex offenderJeffrey Epstein.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

So I think people should not be coming to theSuper Bowlunless they’re law-abiding Americans who love this country.”Bad Bunny was confirmed as the headline act at the Super Bowl last week. In September, the musician said he had excluded the US from his upcoming world tour due to concerns over potential immigration raids.“There was the issue of – like, fucking Ice could be outside [my concert],” he toldi-D magazine. “And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about.”The selection of the Puerto Rican has upset several conservatives, with Johnson complaining this week that Bad Bunny has “no songs in English”.Asked about the NFL choosing Bad Bunny, Noem said: “Well, they suck, and we’ll win, and God will bless us, and we’ll stand and be proud of ourselves at the end of the day, and they won’t be able to sleep at night, because they don’t know what they believe, and they’re so weak, we’ll fix it.”Noem’s insistence that Ice agents will be “all over” the Super Bowl appeared to clash slightly with the White House.On Friday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters: “As far as Ice being at the Super Bowl, as far as I’m aware there’s no tangible plan for that in store right now.”She added: “However, of course this administration is always going to arrest and deport illegal immigrants when we find them if they are criminals.

It was a wild finale,Liverpoolrun ragged, and when Estevão Willian delivered the decisive blow deep into stoppage time it was the cue for Enzo Maresca to leave his technical area, charge down the touchline and join the mass of blue shirts as they celebrated in front of the disbelieving supporters in the Matthew Harding Stand.Liverpool were beaten, their knack for late shows turned against them for the second successive weekend, and it is unlikely that Maresca cared when Anthony Taylor showed him a second yellow card. Call it the sweetest sending off of the Italian’s managerial career. Nobody will be casting doubt over his job security now. Not after witnessing the world champions make light of a recent stumble and an extensive injury list by producing a performance of grit and style to ensure that Liverpool ended a dreadful week with their third consecutive defeat in all competitions.Salah and Isak will click, says Slot after Liverpool slip to third defeatRead moreIf it feels premature to call it a crisis, it is certainly true that Liverpool must act quickly to reverse their slump. The response to looking up rather than down for the first time under Arne Slot will be fascinating. Do the champions rally after losingtop spot to Arsenalor do they fall into a decline reminiscent of Manchester City’s struggles last season?The positive is that Slot is not the type to panic. Dissecting this defeat, the Dutchman pointed to the changes Liverpool went through in the summer. He was adamant that the misfiring duo of Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak will eventually develop an understanding.At the moment, though, the connections are lacking. Liverpool are suspect defensively, the void left by Trent Alexander-Arnold’s departure at right-back has not been filled, the midfield is too open and there was not enough concerted pressure on aChelseaback four that contained three full-backs by full time.Isak did collect an assist midway through the second half, albeit with a heavy touch for Cody Gakpo to cancel out Moisés Caicedo’s stunning opener, but otherwise it was a listless display from the £125m striker. As for Salah, his shooting accuracy has rarely been worse. All of the forward’s efforts went off target, although he was not alone in suffering. Liverpool struggled as a collective. Maresca’s tactics outfoxed Slot in the first half and Chelsea’s bench also made a huge difference during the last 15 minutes. Estêvão, the Brazilian sensation, had sparkled after coming on and was threatening to decide the game even before he popped up with his first goal since joining from Palmeiras.View image in fullscreenMoisés Caicedo plays to the crowd after scoring a stunning opening goal for Chelsea.Photograph: Ian Stephen/Action Plus/ShutterstockBut one of Chelsea’s best win under Maresca was not about individuals. This was a team effort. The unfamiliar central defensive partnership of Benoît Badiashile and Josh Acheampong excelled before being disrupted when both cramped up. Caicedo and Enzo Fernández fought through fatigue to impress in midfield. Reece James was strong at right-back, then solid when he had to slot in at centre-back. Alejandro Garnacho, dangerous on the left, forced Slot to take Conor Bradley off at half-time.Systemic cracks remained apparent. Bradley was unnerved by Garnacho’s willingness to run behind him, Ibrahima Konaté and Virgil van Dijk were iffy and there were some nervy early touches from Giorgi Mamardashvili, making his league debut in goal because of Alisson’s absence.Little worked for Liverpool. Salah wasted opportunities to release Isak and there were structural problems in midfield, caused by Maresca’s decision to put Malo Gusto rather than Reece James next to Caicedo and Fernández.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Frenchman stuck to Alexis Mac Allister, preventing the Argentinian from instigating the buildup, and even made the opening goal when a quick ball round the corner to Caicedo exposed gaps in Liverpool’s setup in the 14th minute.There was so much space for Caicedo that for a moment he looked unsure what to do with it. But when Van Dijk backed off there was only path to take. Caicedo delivered, ripping a screamer past Mamardashvili from 25 yards.A special goal to enliven a mundane half. Chelsea played it carefully, sitting back and launching counterattacks. Maresca had to be pleased when he saw Ryan Gravenberch misplacing passes. The one scare came from Salah crossing for Isak to head over but Chelsea looked strong and might even have had a penalty when Dominik Szoboszlai tangled with Garnacho. Maresca being booked for his furious appeal was not the best look given that his young side keep getting red cards.Chelsea needed to maintain their composure. They wanted a second yellow for Bradley when the right-back fouled Garnacho. Taylor’s leniency allowed Slot tobring Florian Wirtz onfor Bradley at half-time and task Szoboszlai with dealing with Garnacho.Wirtz was immediately involved, releasing Salah, who shot wide. Chelsea fell back. Badiashile went off for Roméo Lavia. Acheampong made way for Jorrel Hato, another 19-year-old. Liverpool also had problems. Konaté limping off saw Gravenberch drop into defence.View image in fullscreenThe Chelsea manager, Enzo Maresca, was sent off for joining in the celebration of his side’s late winner against Liverpool.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersThe level of Liverpool’s play was low. They were level when Szoboszlai’s deflected cross reached Isak, whose attempt to turn and shoot became the perfect assist for Gakpo, who arrived to beat Robert Sánchez. Chelsea, though, were defiant. They found a second wind when Maresca brought on Estêvão, Jamie Gittens and Marc Guiu. Estevão and Gittens went close. Fernández headed against a post from an Estevão cross. No matter. Chelsea roared back. Marc Cucurella delivered a low ball, Andy Robertson fell asleep at the far post, Estevão slid in to score, Maresca set off on his run and Slot was left wondering whether his big rebuild is going to click.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In a week they have banished the demons of their poor recent record atNewcastleand here againstOlympiakos, it was West Ham’s turn to feel the force of a resurgent Arsenal as they went to the top of the Premier League afterLiverpool suffered a second straight defeat.Other than the concerning sight of first Martin Ødegaard and then Declan Rice, scorer of the first goal, having to be replaced because of injuries, this was a most satisfying afternoon for Mikel Arteta on his 300th match in charge. While 16% of Arsenal’s goals under the Spaniard have come from set pieces – a figure surpassed only by Tony Pulis and Sam Allardyce of those who have managed that many games in thePremier League– they showed they are still capable of breaking down teams who come to defend with a low block as well.Martin Ødegaard injury takes shine off Arsenal’s victory over West HamRead moreWest Ham, who had won onpast two trips here, initially put up a fight under their new manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, but were not able to respond after falling behind to the outstanding Rice against his former club. The England midfielder asked to be substituted in the second half clutching his back after the equally influential Bukayo Saka had made sure of the points with a penalty.It was with the memory ofFebruary’s damaging defeathere that ended a 15-match unbeaten run and any realistic hopes of catching Liverpool that probably persuaded Arteta to start with Rice as a single pivot in midfield with Ødegaard and Eberechi Eze ahead of him. But the experiment did not last long as the Norwegian was forced off on the half-hour mark, with his replacement, Martín Zubimendi, allowing Rice to push further forward.West Ham made the more positive start when Niclas Füllkrug headed over a corner inside the first minute. Nuno opted for a mobile midfield three of Matheus Fernandes, Soungoutou Magassa and Lucas Paquetá that caused Arsenal’s defence some more problems early on after Jurriën Timber had tested Alphonse Areola at the other end. Eze, who has the dubious honour of having had the most shots without scoring in the Premier League this season, then ballooned his 17th over from six yards when the French goalkeeper spilled the ball on the line in a moment he will want to forget.View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice gives Arsenal the lead.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersThe sight of Ødegaard having to limp off on the half-hour mark after hurting his knee in an ill-judged attempt to tackle Crysencio Summerville was not exactly what Arteta would have had planned either. But while Viktor Gyökeres was unable to convert a brilliant cross from Saka that skimmed off the big striker’s head as Arsenal stepped up the pressure, it was Zubimendi who helped unlock the visitors’ creaking defence.Eze’s shot after being played in by the Spaniard was pushed straight into the path of Rice and he did well to keep his follow-up down. “Declan Rice, we got him half-price,” sang the Arsenal supporters, with the England midfielder not celebrating, but instead taking a lingering glance at the away end that had earlier barracked him as he took a corner.West Ham were just happy to hold until the break as Arsenal – and the outstanding Saka in particular up against the raw Senegal defender El Hadji Malick Diouf – smelled blood. Areola was fortunate Riccardo Calafiori’s shot that hit him after cannoning off the post did not trickle back over the line.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is more of an intensity about their attacking this season with Rice so often the driving force from deep.West Ham could not get out of their own half and Nuno’s response was to replace Füllkrug and Magassa for the 20-year-old striker Callum Marshall for his debut and academy graduate Freddie Potts in midfield. It seemed only a matter of time until Arsenal doubled their lead, although they were fortunate that the referee, John Brookes, deemed Diouf’s challenge on Timber to have taken place inside the area and pointed to the spot, with Saka making no mistake.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

As he heads for retirement in 2026, the sport loses a rare entertainerAndrew LawrenceSat 4 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Oct 2025 06.01 EDTShareThe curtain call has come for another beloved tennis star: the veteran French player Gaël Monfils will retire at the end of the 2026 season, his 22nd year on the men’s tour. In a social media post announcing the news on Wednesday, Monfils struck an upbeat tone, thanking family and fans while doffing a cap at the range of opponents he was privileged to face during the game’s “golden age”; prominent among his mentions were Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic – the only one in that group who is still playing. And while history is likely to remember the 39-year-old Monfils – whose résumé includes nearly 600 match victories, a career-best No 6 singles ranking and more than $24m in on-court earnings – as one of the more unfortunate victims of the Big Four epoch, he makes a compelling counterargument for style over stats.Gaël Monfils: ‘I’m getting a little bit old. People forget that I still have it’Read moreFederer, Nadal, Murray and Djokovic may have all the titles. But while they were stifling three generations’ worth of tennis muscle, Monfils emerged as the era’s most dazzling performer. For years US tennis commentators groused about the home federation not doing enough to steer the country’s best young athlete away from other stick-and-ball sports and make American tennis great again. But it’s obvious now that the player they were constructing in their minds was Monfils: a 6ft4in skein of fast-twitch sinews, with the devil’s own forehand tacked on for good measure. In his own social media post, the estimable coach Patrick Mouratoglou framed his compatriot’s retirement as a mighty blow to the sport. “Tennis needs players like him,” he wrote. “They are so rare.” An athletic prodigy since elementary school, Monfils underscored his special talent after claiming victories in France’s under-13 and under-14 100m championships. His athletics coach at the time thought he could make an Olympics sprint final on that potential alone.Monfils’s career highlight reel looks like something out of NBA Inside Stuff: tomahawking overheads, blind tweeners that clip the line, Rodman-esque full extension retrievals. The first time I saw Monfils play up close, in the 2008 US Open third round against 2002 Wimbledon finalist David Nalbandian, I could not believe what I was seeing: a dirt baller, skidding around the hard court at Louis Armstrong Stadium as his poor sneakers wailed for relief. His Marvel-esque feats on-court rightly inspired a raft of nicknames – Slider-Man, the Flying Frenchman. In the end he went with La Monf, a term of endearment that dates to childhood. That it abided speaks to the tremendous respect Monfils commands from fans, ever keen to put their personal spin on their favorites.View image in fullscreenGaël Monfils’s career highlight reel looks like something out of NBA Inside Stuff: tomahawking overheads, blind tweeners that clip the line, Rodman-esque full extension retrievals.Photograph: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty ImagesYou’d be hard-pressed to find any stories about Monfils letting the superhero hype go to his head: no icy fan interactions, no media meltdowns, no egomaniacal spiraling. But that’s not to mistake Monfils for another unfeeling robo-jock. Where Federer or Murray might shrug off a freak winner as routine brilliance, La Monfoh là làs along with his gawkers – as if a mere mortal vessel for the divine. Djokovic, who played Monfils for the first time on a US Open outer court in 2005, called him one of the best athletes he’d ever seen in a recent tribute – and he’s hardly one to exaggerate. I suspect there are a fair number of us Monfils diehards who would pay to watch him hit balls against a garage door, just to see what kind of spectacle he could make of that. “I always admired you,” wrote Madrid Open tournament director Feliciano López, who only faced Monfils twice over the course of their staggeringly long careers and beat him both times.Overall, Monfils should’ve been more of a contender. The son of a Guadeloupe-born professional soccer player, Monfils set expectations high as a 15-year-old junior player, coming a US Open trip shy of notching a calendar slam in 2004. He turned pro later that year and faced national pressure to consolidate a tennis renaissance alongside Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Richard Gasquet and Gilles Simon; the hope was that thesenouveau mousquetaireswould be as dominant as the René Lacoste-led quartet enshrined at Roland Garros. But in the end Monfils’s Four Musketeers were no match for the Big Four.View image in fullscreenGaël Monfils plays a backhand at Roland Garros.Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty ImagesOnly Tsonga made it to a grand slam final and lost to Djokovic in the 2008 Australian Open for the first of the Serb’s record 24 majors. Gasquet never got farther than the semi-finals of Wimbledon and the US Open, and Simon was a slam quarter-finalist twice. Meanwhile, Monfils was cruising at the 2008 French Open until he ran into Federer in the semi-final, and steamrolling through the 2016 US Open bracket until he drew Djokovic in the semis – a four-set loss that makes for a juicy tennis history what-if. Had Monfils made it through to the final, he would have faced Switzerland’s Stan Wawrinka, who went on to beat Djokovic for his third and final major. Up to that point Monfils essentially had a coin-flip record against Wawrinka, the Federer sidekick who became a legit legend seemingly out of nowhere. It’s tempting to think of what might have been had the game’s best showman came together with the era’s biggest disrupter for a style-points Super Bowl of sorts. Wawrinka’s backhand is porn.Predictably, Monfils’s failures led to harsher scrutiny: about him choosing spectacle over strategy, about his fundamentally defensive playing style, about his perceived lack of commitment. Early in his career Monfils was criticized for touring without a dedicated coach when Federer was the only player getting away with that. But looking back, what was a coach gonna say to Monfils that he wasn’t already hearing from the crowds he so routinely energizes? (Some version of:NonononoYESSSSS!) Famously, after losing to Federer in straight sets at a 2006-opening stop in Doha, Monfils elbowed his way into a Las Vegas paddle tennis tournament and ousted the world’s top paddle tennis player on the way to winning the whole shebang. The longer you cheer Monfils, the more you learn to take the good with the bad and just sit back and savor the ride.View image in fullscreenGaël Monfils’s résumé includes nearly 600 match victories, a career-best No 6 singles ranking and more than $24m in on-court earnings.Photograph: Martin Keep/AFP/Getty ImagesNow that Monfils is rounding the final corner to fully ensconce himself in #girldadlife with his forever doubles partner, former world No 3 Elina Svitolina, there seems little point in second-guessing the road not traveled. In January, Monfils became the oldest player to win an ATP tournament, claiming his 13th title 20 years after his first to take at leastonerecord off Federer. Starting in 2005, Monfils had reached at least one singles final every year for 19 straight years – a feat only Djokovic and Nadal have equaled. Throughout Monfils held his head high in the face of racial animosity, and his broader influence as a cultural trailblazer is a legacy that isn’t talked about nearly enough. Naomi Osaka, Monfils’s US Open doubles partner, was among the welter of peers who described the Frenchman as an inspiration.No, Monfils didnt get the better of the Big Four, but he’s still got a shot against the Big Two – assuming he can bounce back from nagging wrist and ankle injuries and catch Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner slipping. Otherwise, the game plan remains the same: keep expectations modest, stay in the moment and give the people what they want. “You could have, you should have– I’ve never thought this way,” he wrote, “and frankly I’m far too old to start doing so now. Life is too short. Believe me when I say that I have no regrets.”So much of sports discourse these days is a fevered competition to prove who’s best by taking inventory of trophies, rings and other shiny baubles. But by playing tennis on his own terms and with singular vigor and panache, Monfils stands apart as a stark exemplar of the valor in defending the interior kingdom of the self. Enjoy the show while you still can.Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Verstappen backed off his final lap, waving in indignation at having lost downforce in the final corners behind the slow-movingMcLarenof Norris, who was on an in-lap.Singapore Grand Prix F1 qualifying: George Russell powers to pole position – liveRead moreThe two drivers are good friends, but in the sweltering heat of Singapore the bromance cooled as Verstappen took aim at Norris. “That is what happens when there is a car in front of you and that is noted and will be remembered as well,” he said.“Sometimes it happens on the street circuit that people are bored, make mistakes. You need every kind of clean air that you can have on a Q3 lap, especially because you’re fully on the limit with braking and everything. I lost a bit of downforce with that, so I went straight on.”Verstappen said he would not be speaking to Norris about the incident but insisted what had happened was not “not nice”. Norris, it should be noted, did nothing against the regulations, but, in Verstappen’s opinion, had been too slow in returning to the pits. The Briton was having none of it. “They always complain, they complain about everything, that’s Red Bull,” he said. “I didn’t even know, I was like three seconds ahead or something.”Whether the defending world champion would have matched Russell remains moot, however. He had been almost two-tenths off Russell on his first hot lap and with Russell going even quicker on the decisive runs. Verstappen had not looked like beating him before he aborted his lap.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen in action during qualifying.Photograph: Vincent Thian/APRussell’s pole was all the more notable for outpacing both title contenders.Oscar Piastriand Norris finished third and fifth respectively, unable to match Russell or Verstappen throughout the session. Both McLaren drivers were disappointed, admitting they did not quite have the pace, but it is Piastri, with a 25-point lead, who has the advantage on Sunday.Russell’s performance could not be faulted. His first run in Q3, even given he brushed the wall, was still a striking piece of precision driving and when he kept his rubber clear of the barriers on his second attempt, he went seven-thousandths quicker. Mercedes’ upgrade to the front wing is paying off.For the 27-year-old, it was a major statement as speculation around his future at Mercedes continues. His contract is up at the end of this season and demonstrations like this can only strengthen his hand. Moreover, he did it while still recovering from the respiratory illness that struck him at the last round in Baku.Russell has yet to win in Singapore, but neither has Verstappen, and the pair’s relationship has been feisty in the past. The run and entry to turn one on Sunday will be compelling stuff indeed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson has brought his story to Hollywood with A24’s The Smashing MachineLoretta HuntSat 4 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Oct 2025 06.01 EDTShareIt started with an affirming nod of heads between two tough guys at a Santa Monica Gold’s Gym in the summer of 1997. One-time Olympic wrestling contender Mark Kerr was training for his first Ultimate Fighting Championship fight, having dominated in a three-fight, one-night tournament in Brazil two months earlier. Dwayne “Rocky Maivia” Johnson, a former NFL prospect sidelined with a knee injury suffered during his second year with the WWE, approached him.“Can I take you to lunch?” Johnson asked Kerr, who obliged him at the Firehouse restaurant in Santa Monica. The conversation inevitably drifted to mixed martial arts, as Johnson peppered the 1992 NCAA champion with pointed questions about the unregulated sport.MMAwas gaining popularity in Japan, where multiple promotions hired pro wrestlers for “crossover” fights.“How’s this organization to work for? How’s the pay and do they pay on time? How’s the work schedule? I could tell from what he was asking that he was seriously contemplating his options,” said Kerr, age 29 at the time. “I asked him why he’d leave the WWE, which seemed much more of a stable choice than fighting. When he told me he was losing money on the road, touring 250 days a year for $150,000, I got it.”The pair exchanged numbers and parted ways, two ships passing in the night. Kerr defected from theUFCto Japan’s Pride Fighting Championships the next year for $200,000-plus paydays, while the babyface “Maivia” returned to the WWE and turned heel, courtesy of Vince McMahon. “The Rock” emerged soon after and the eyebrow-raising Johnson’s career quickly snapped into place.Between 1997 and 2000, Kerr was the No 1 MMA heavyweight in the world. His record soared to 11-0, but it was a feverish pace no athlete could keep up for long. Kerr was no stranger to drugs; a trainer had turned him onto steroids in his initial fights. Now, Kerr needed relief from the decades of cumulative pain to bolster his endurance for Pride’s grueling 10-minute rounds. Kerr had torn cartilage in his ribcage that pained him with every breath.“There was never a shortage of doctors [in Arizona] who’d prescribe me opioids,” Kerr said, “and if one said no, I’d just move onto the next.”Kerr was addicted to Vicodin in a few months, a missed dose creating anxiety, abdominal pain and fatigue. Being no novice to intravenous drugging, popping pills quickly evolved into shooting liquid straight into his veins. Kerr hid his Nubain and morphine bottle in the guest bathroom away from his girlfriend, Dawn. He shot up every morning, sometimes waking hours later slumped over the toilet when he’d dosed too much.View image in fullscreenMark Kerr, right, battles Moti Horenstein during UFC 14 at Boutwell Auditorium in Birmingham, Alabama, on 27 July 1997.Photograph: Zuffa LLC/Getty ImagesA camera crew captured this period on film, which became 2002 documentary The Smashing Machine.By then, Kerr’s MMA career was over. When he met Johnson a seocnd time in 2003, it was a reversal of fortune. “The Rock”, having been put over by Hulk Hogan at Wrestlemania XVIII the year prior, was a bona fide superstar with two feature films under his belt. Johnson gushed to Kerr about the documentary, as the MMA fighter fretted over his decision to expose his dark underbelly. Kerr hadn’t been offered a fight in over two years. He was no longer an intravenous user, but alcoholism had become Kerr’s daily enemy; he could down four bottles of red wine in one sitting. By the time another Pride offer came around, Kerr was nowhere near fighting shape. On the sport’s biggest stage, he knocked himself out seconds into the contest with of all things, an ill-timed takedown that sent his head driving into the canvas.Kerr married Dawn and they had a son, Bryce, in 2004. Their marriage remained combustible for years, as Kerr juggled drinking and the odd personal-training job between fights. After his final defeat in 2009, Kerr had no choice but to call it a day. A tarnished former champion was of no use to fight promoters. Kerr pivoted to car salesman, but dreaded getting noticed by potential buyers.“I could always tell when someone noticed me, even if they didn’t bring it up,” said Kerr. “They always got the same look on their face, as if to say, ‘What happened to you?’”Meanwhile, in 2009, Johnson landed yet another starring role in Return to Witch Mountain, his 11th film. Soon,Dwayne Johnson, minus “the Rock,” would become a household name.As Johnson’s trajectory rose over the next decade, Kerr’s took a nosedive. There was job-hopping and three stints in rehab. Dawn divorced him, but their volatile relationship continued as they tried to co-parent their son. Finally, it was the 14-year-old Bryce’s plea that stopped Kerr’s self-destruction in September 2018.“It was the anniversary of my mother’s death and Bryce said he knew today was a tough day for me, but asked if I could quit drinking the day after,” said Kerr. “How could I not listen?”Kerr was 10 months sober when Brad Slater, Johnson’s longtime agent, rang about securing the MMA pioneer’s life rights. The call was completely out of the blue. Kerr and Johnson hadn’t spoken in 12 years, and Johnson, the movie star, now had more cache over the roles he chose. Johnson had never forgotten about the Kerr’s documentary and secretly had hoped he’d get to play the tough, yet vulnerable fighter.View image in fullscreenHiram Garcia, David Koplan, Mark Kerr, Dwayne Johnson, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt and Andrea Romeo attend the red carpet of the movie The Smashing Machine at the Venice Film Festival in September.Photograph: Tiziana Fabi/AFP/Getty ImagesJohnson announced the film at a UFC press conference in September 2019. His Seven Bucks Productions would be at the ship’s helm, with writer-director Benny Safdie its rudder. Safdie set to work adapting the documentary into a screenplay, mining Kerr for additional scenes to flesh out Mark and Dawn’s relationship.“When the pandemic hit in March 2020, I thought it was over for the film,” said Kerr, who’d resigned himself to a quiet Arizona life. “If it was meant to be, it would all fall into place.”In sobriety, Kerr reconnected with a gym friend named Franci. They began dating during the pandemic and would marry on New Year’s Eve 2023.During the pandemic, Kerr didn’t hear a peep from Johnson, Safdie or Seven Bucks, but sometime during the 57-day shoot for Oppenheimer, Safdie convinced co-starEmily Bluntto watch the documentary. Blunt, a longtime friend of Johnson’s, immediately called her Jungle Cruise co-star, telling him the time was now to get the film done. Blunt signed on to play Kerr’s girlfriend, Dawn, and the fire was lit.Kerr received another call from Slater in September 2023, but this time there was a starting date that spring. Kerr toured the Vancouver film set that April and filming began that May. Per Johnson’s request, Kerr didn’t visit the set during shooting.“DJ had never played a living person before and I respected that process,” said Kerr. “I’m glad I stayed away. When my son saw the film, he couldn’t believe how DJ got down my [softer] speech and mannerisms. My own son!”Indeed, Johnson’s turn as Kerr is convincing, especially for those that know the retired fighter. Johnson received a 16-minute standing ovation for the film at the Venice Film Festival, while the innovative Safdie took home its distinguished director’s prize.For the 56-year-old Kerr, it’s a second chance at notoriety, however fleeting that might be. Johnson has been adamant that Kerr be at his side for most of the film’s promotional tour.“It’s amazing that a small decision I made decades ago, to keep the [documentary] cameras rolling while my life crashed and burned, grew into all this,” said Kerr, who plans to write a book next. “I couldn’t be happier with how this all turned out and I can honestly say that I’ve gained friends for life from it.”Explore more on these topicsMMADwayne JohnsonUFCWrestlingEmily BluntOpioidsA24featuresShareReuse this content"

With temperatures around freezing on a rocky ledge at 13,700ft, I searched for reprieve on the lee side of a boulder. I could see the city lights in the distance, but was more concerned with two headlamps approaching quickly, a few hundred feet below.Between us lay a slab of coarse granite, known as the Cables Route. It’s the most direct way to the summit of Longs Peak, but is less travelled because it’s rated a class 5 rock climb and often carries a river of verglas – black ice – running down it, which climbers must navigate.This was how I started the first morning of Kilian Jornet’s latest personal endurance project,States of Elevation. In it, Jornet would summit the highest 73 mountains in the contiguous US – every peak above 14,000ft – all under human power, cycling between and running up each one. I was along to document the literal and figurative highs and lows, as Jornet attempted, in layman’s terms, to run a marathon and ride a Tour de France stage every day for a month.Widely regarded as the greatest mountain athlete of all time, Jornet grew up in Refugi Cap de Rec, a mountain hut in the Pyrenees of north-eastern Spain. With a father who worked as a mountain guide and a mother as a schoolteacher, Jornet summited his first peak before the age of five. At 20, he was the youngest ever to win the Ultra-Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB), considered the World Series of ultrarunning.Over his two-decade career, Jornet has set speed records on Aconcagua, the Matterhorn, Denali, Kilimanjaro and Everest; won the triple crown of ultrarunning – Western States, Hardrock and UTMB – and dominated shorter trail races, with 10 wins at Sierre-Zinal and 11 at Zegama-Aizkorri. He’s a world champion ski-mountaineer, bestselling author, founder of the shoe company NNormal, and a physiology obsessive who often uses himself as a guinea pig to see how his body adapts under stress.Despite the accolades, Jornet remains soft-spoken and modest. While his racing success has bolstered his career and helped him accrue almost 2m Instagram followers, he’s leery of fame, sharing with me that many of his favourite days are solo adventures in the mountains. As he’s got older, he has shifted from racing to audacious endurance efforts like this one.View image in fullscreenKilian JornetPhotograph: Andy Cochrane/The GuardianLongs Peak was the start of a journey that would take him more than 3,000 miles across six states, culminating on Mount Rainier in Washington. Meanwhile, my challenge – outside of joining Jornet for a peak here and there – was to write about the journey candidly, without overusing hyperbole to endorse his otherworldly efforts, an easy trap to fall into. Almost every day Jornet did something that would qualify as the biggest, fastest or hardest, but piling on superlatives would strip his feats of their full value.At 3.30am I began hiking uphill, an hour before Jornet and Kyle Richardson, the current record-holder on Longs, started their ascent. Now, from my vantage above Cables, I watched the two dance across a section known as the Boulderfield and begin the technical climbing. I had taken my time on this part, carefully avoiding wet, icy and mossy handholds, and assumed they would do the same. To my surprise, their pace slowed negligibly as they scaled the vertical pitch, moving so carefree I doubted they noticed the sheer thousand-foot cliff a couple of dozen feet to their left.Emerging climbing star Balin Miller, 23, dies in fall from El CapitanRead moreAs they drew closer, I could hear them chatting casually about past adventures, like old friends on a shakeout run. Technical alpine rock, ice and snow is where Jornet feels most at home, and where he radiates the most joy. He arrived at my perch with an ear-to-ear grin, gave me a quick fist-bump, and we continued upwards together.On the top of Longs, Jornet paused to take out his phone and snap a few photos, which he would later send to his wife, Emelie Forsberg, also a professional mountain-runner, and their three young daughters. Despite the perception that Jornet’s life is dedicated to chasing the edge of possibility, nothing means more to him than family. Even after days with 20-odd hours of non-stop movement through the mountains, Jornet would try to call home.For him, this moment had been years in the making. In 2023 he climbed all 177 3,000m peaks in the Pyrenees in just eight days. The next summer he summited all 82 4,000m peaks in the Alps in 19 days, using only human power to connect them. Looking for a similar adventure that would let him explore a new landscape, Jornet landed on the American West.It was the perfect nexus of his curiosity about the body’s limits and a drive to understand threats to American wilderness, through both personal experience and conversations with locals along the way. If that wasn’t grand enough, Jornet decided he would follow, in his words, “the most aesthetic line”. When he first shared this with me in late June, I wasn’t sure what he meant. But I was about to find out.View image in fullscreenKilian JornetPhotograph: Andy Cochrane/The GuardianAfter summiting Longs, Jornet could have turned around, run down, and ridden to the next peak, saving hours and considerable energy. Instead, he chose to traverse the 38-mile LA Freeway, an off-trail route with 21,000ft of climbing and descent, which took him the rest of the day. I initially found this odd, but as the days passed I grew to appreciate the value of aesthetics in the mountains – in part because it’s emblematic of Jornet himself.Jornet is a minimalist who often goes hours without food or water. He’s an environmental advocate who believes in protecting wild places. He’s so proficient in technical terrain that it comes as naturally as walking. But above all, Jornet is an artist. Projects likeStates of Elevationare how he leaves his mark: encouraging others to explore wild places, without leaving scars on the land itself.On my third day with Jornet, as we climbed Grays Peak in the late afternoon as the tail end of a lightning storm blew through, I asked about his motivations. He explained it wasn’t about speed, records, or even anyone else knowing about it. If he wasn’t a famous athlete, he would still have done the route, likely with less support and fanfare. The purpose was so obvious to him it was almost hard to explain.To Jornet, the mountains are a necessity. He wanted to see the remote ranges of Colorado, feel the vastness of basin-and-range country, and grasp the vertical relief of the Cascade volcanoes, because being in these places gives him life. He also feared that some of these landscapes might not remain public or protected for long. But the most important part was what he left unsaid.A few days later Jornet ran the Elks Traverse, a 50-mile technical scramble near Aspen, Colorado, that has only seen a handful of finishers. The next day he completed Nolan’s 14, Colorado’s most notorious fourteener link-up, with just a 30-minute nap in between. Like a savant with a blank canvas, Jornet was etching the most beautiful line through these mountains. To him, this was art.On my last day in Colorado, I hiked up the backside of Mount Massive and met Jornet near the top. The sun had set and the sky was turning a hazy blue as the last rays disappeared. We paused a few hundred feet below the summit, watching a family of four mountain goats graze, unconcerned by our presence.View image in fullscreenKilian JornetPhotograph: Andy Cochrane/The GuardianJornet, fluent in five languages, looked at me and said: “There’s a lot of wildlife here.” In the previous week we had seen moose, black bear, elk, goats and coyotes – a sign of a diverse ecosystem and expansive wilderness that no longer exists in the Alps or Pyrenees. It was a reminder to stay grateful for the wild places we do still have, because they are far from guaranteed.A week later I rendezvoused with Jornet in southern California, after he had pedalled 900 miles in five days from Colorado. The next morning he began Norman’s 13, a 100-mile route with 39,000ft of climbing, connecting all of the fourteeners in the Sierra. I joined him for a quarter of the route, split into three sections, watching as he lowered the fastest known time by a remarkable 18 hours.For most people, this would have been an unrelenting pace across one of America’s most remote ranges. For Jornet, it was two composed, introspective days in the wilderness. On our climb up Glen Pass in Kings Canyon National Park, he paused, looked down the valley, and said: “It’s beautiful,” before carrying on. It may sound trite, but the sentiment was anything but.Jornet has spent considerable time in the most remarkable mountain ranges in the world – Andes, Himalaya, Alps and Alaska – yet remains in genuine awe at every corner. For the rest of that day, I found myself appreciating what was in front of me, instead of letting my mind wander. Our lives are often so busy and complicated we lose sight of the important things right before us.On my last day in California, I met Jornet on Thunderbolt Peak, after he completed a technical ridgeline called the Palisade Traverse, covered in snow and rime ice. Despite just two hours’ sleep in the prior two days, Jornet was surprisingly lucid. As he stopped to eat a sandwich, I asked what he thought of the route. “I would do it again,” he replied simply.I’m not sure if Jornet meant the Palisades, the Sierra, or the entire route, but I am sure that when he does come back, it will be an even more aesthetic line.Explore more on these topicsSportMountaineeringRock climbingUS sportsUltrarunningfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After trailing for much of Friday night’s Game 1, they stormed back behind a blistering fourth-quarter surge to edge thePhoenix Mercury89-86 and take the opener of the WNBA finals in Las Vegas.Phoenix seemed in control for long stretches, building a nine-point cushion in the third quarter and holding a 76-70 lead with just over eight minutes left. But when Satou Sabally, who had been a steady force for the Mercury, picked up her fifth foul and angrily spiked the ball – earning a technical – the momentum shifted sharply.Quick GuideWNBA finals 2025ShowScheduleBest-of-seven series.

Wilson, who has now claimed a record four league MVP awards, finished with 21 points and 10 rebounds, 12 of them coming in the decisive final stretch.Evans matched Wilson with 21 points off the bench, sparking a second unit that outscored Phoenix’s reserves 41-16. Jewell Loyd added 18 points in her finals debut with Las Vegas, Jackie Young chipped in 10, and Chelsea Gray orchestrated the offense with 10 assists, seven rebounds and eight points.Even so, the Aces nearly let it slip. With 24.6 seconds remaining, Phoenix trailed by one when Alyssa Thomas went to the line with a chance to put her side in front. She missed both free throws. On the ensuing possession Young calmly sank two at the stripe, giving the Aces their final three-point edge. Sabally’s contested three in the dying seconds was off target, and the Aces’ home crowd erupted.“Dana was huge for us,” Wilson said afterwards. “We’ve talked all year about how it’s going to take everybody. Tonight it was the bench that kept us alive until we could finish it out.”View image in fullscreenSatou Sabally of the Phoenix Mercury, right, drives as NaLyssa Smith of the Las Vegas Aces defends in the third quarter of Friday’s Game 1 of the WNBA finals.Photograph: Ian Maule/Getty ImagesThe Mercury, making their first finals appearance since 2021, had reasons to feel aggrieved at the missed opportunity. Kahleah Copper poured in 21 points, including 19 in the first half when she shot Phoenix into an early lead with five three-pointers – equaling Diana Taurasi’s record for most threes in a finals half. Sabally added 19, while Thomas came within a whisker of a triple-double with 15 points, 10 boards and nine assists.The opener underscored how narrow the margins may be in this series, the first best-of-seven format inWNBAfinals history. There were 12 lead changes, nine ties and no double-digit leads. Each time Phoenix threatened to push clear, the Aces clawed back – first when Gray drew a flagrant foul in the third quarter that momentarily turned the tide, then in the closing minutes when their stars found a second wind.Game 2 is set for Sunday night in Las Vegas, where the Aces will look to seize a commanding 2-0 lead.The drama on the court was preceded by a different kind of tension off it. Hours before tip-off, WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert addressed reporters in her traditional “state of the league” press conference, but her remarks came under a cloud of player unrest.Earlier this week, Minnesota Lynx forward Napheesa Collier, a vice-president of the players’ union, accused Engelbert of dismissing concerns over pay and officiating, calling the league’s leadership “the worst in the world”. Collier alleged Engelbert told her that young stars should be grateful for their platform and “on their knees” over the league’s media rights deal.Engelbert rejected those accounts but conceded the need to rebuild trust. “If the players in the W don’t feel appreciated and valued by the league, then we have to do better and I have to do better,” she said, while reiterating that she had “utmost respect” for Collier and her peers.With the league’s collective bargaining agreement set to expire at the end of October, the timing of the rift is especially fraught. Engelbert insisted she was committed to negotiating “a transformative deal” with significant salary increases and announced the creation of a “state of the game” committee to give players a greater voice on officiating and safety – two flashpoints during the season.Still, the backdrop of mistrust ensured that the finals’ opening night was about more than basketball. As Wilson and the Aces found a way past the Mercury, Engelbert and the league she leads faced their own test of survival, with the stakes extending well beyond this series.Explore more on these topicsWNBALas Vegas AcesPhoenix MercuryUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Still we need to try to bring these players in. If the result would have been better today with a draw or a win then we would have had a great start to the season if you take into account everything that happened in the summer in Liverpool.”Slot, who had to rejig his defence after Ibrahima Konaté went off with a thigh injury in the second half, defended Salah’s wayward finishing. “What I like is that we brought him many times in the position he would like to be in,” the Dutchman said. “And I would like him to be in because he’s shown in his career and since I’m here that in those positions he can score goals.“He had many opportunities to do what he’s done so often. He’s a human being and it’s not like every chance he gets is always a goal. We feel sometimes it is because of what he’s done last season.”Liverpool host Manchester United after the international break and Slot believes better finishing would have stopped his side from losing atChelseaand Crystal Palace. “In both games we’ve created more chances than the team we have faced but the truth is that we have only scored once in both games and our opponent has scored twice,” he said.Chelsea led through Moisés Caicedo’s early goal and it seemed they would have to settle for a point when Cody Gakpo equalised. But Enzo Maresca’s side moved up to sixth when Estêvão Willian, the Brazilian teenager, popped up in the 95th minute to score his first goal in English football.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ll have to wait and see from the doctors.“We haven’t had him since the start of the season for one reason or the other, the shoulder twice and then this injury.

Let’s wait, and hopefully it’s not that bad.”On Rice, he added: “He’s not all right because he asked me to come off, so that’s a shame.

He needs to adapt, new country, new training, the pressure you guys put on the goalkeeper was massive, so it was a little preparation for him to be ready to start his first game.“But it is just one game and he needs to work, he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard, but he did well and again he was comfortable during the game.

Spurs have won three of their opening four away Premier League games this season, which is as many as in their final 13 away league games of last season under the Australian.Frank added: “I’m extremely happy with the win. If you want to build any successful team, you need mentality, character, cohesion and togetherness no matter if you play like Inter or Barcelona. Whatever the style of play, you need that willingness to do everything to win and I think we’re building that more and more in the team.“We created two goals and other very dangerous situations and chances, so of course I’m delighted with the start we’ve made. Fourteen points in seven games – averaging two points per game – is very good and I’m extremely happy that on the road we have won three and drawn one.

But the German also took the positives, especially as Spurs were left hanging on at the end with Guglielmo Vicario’s fine save denying Joël Piroe a stoppage-time equaliser.“We have to take our chances and hope the goalkeeper is not the man of the match, but we should have hit the target with a few of our chances,” Farke said. “Still, we played one of the country’s top sides and were the better side. That’s encouraging and I’m proud of how far we have come.”Leeds fans were angry at referee Thomas Bramall’s officiating, but Farke insisted: “I have to be a bit careful, I don’t like to comment in public.

Maybe it’s just about conceivable that, had things gone slightly differently in the 70s, Malcolm Allison or Terry Venables could have been leading their side behind the Iron Curtain for a crack atValeriy Lobanovskyi’s cybernauts, but Dynamo Kyiv against Crystal Palace is still a clash that provokes a double-take. It feels like a category error: how can those two clubs possibly be in the same competition?But this is the modern world. Ukraine is battling invasion, its teams diminished. The Premier League is extremely rich. And Crystal Palace are managed by one of the rising talents of the European game. They didn’t just play each other on Thursday, butPalace won with a degree of comfort. It was their third straight win, their 19th consecutive game without defeat.And so, because no mid-size club can even just be allowed to enjoy a good run, all the talk is of where Oliver Glasner might go next. His contract expires at the end of the season and he hasrefused to sign an extension. He is 51; if he is going to take over a major club with the possibility of an extended spell in charge, he doesn’t have a huge amount of time to secure a move. Could he then be the solution for Manchester United? He does, after all, play the same 3-4-2-1 as Ruben Amorim, just rather more successfully.Which raises the question of why a system that has drawn so much scepticism at United works so well at Palace. But it’s never just about the formation, nor is it the case – within reason – that one formation is intrinsically better than another. Rather certain formations, in combination with the style they are enacted, prioritise certain elements of play. It is, at the very least, intriguing that since Harry Catterick’s Everton won the championship in 1962-63 with a W-M, only one side has won the English league title playing with a back three:Antonio Conte’s Chelsea in 2016-17.View image in fullscreenAntonio Conte’s Chelsea one the title in 2016-17 with a back three and effectively two No 10s.Photograph: BPI/ShutterstockEven that was something of a black swan event.Chelseathat season had no European football, keeping them fresher than their rivals, and they had players who suited the formation almost freakishly well.N’Golo Kanté, with his stamina and reading of the game, is almost two players, and he was operating at the back of midfield alongside either the calming presence of Nemanja Matic or Cesc Fàbregas, one of the most incisive passers of the ball the Premier League has known. That provided the platform for the two No 10s: Eden Hazard, who revelled in his free role, and Pedro, a master of the dart into the box. Each of those players was enhanced by their combination with the others.To an extent, the relative lack of success for the back three, at least in terms of winning titles, is cultural. Not many sides have won the league playing a back three because not many sides have played a back three. The World Cup win in 1966 reified in the English football consciousness the effectiveness of zonal marking with a back four.That remained the default, almost without challenge, for the two decades that followed. But there may also be more specific tactical reasons. A back three derives its width from the wingbacks; it may be that the extreme hard-running nature of the English game makes the demand on those players too great to be undertaken regularly.But the 3-4-2-1 poses specific challenges. It is solid, offering the trapezoid defensive shape – three central defenders protected by two holders – that is widely recognised as the most effective way to guard against opposition counterattacks. But that is only one phase of the game. If they advance too far from the protection of the three centre‑backs, given the prevalence of formations with a midfield triangle, two central midfielders will tend to be outmanned without support from elsewhere – unless one of them has the exceptional gifts of Kanté.View image in fullscreenEddie Nketiah celebrates after scoring his side’s second goal Dynamo Kyiv.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockThe very stability of that compact 3-2 shape, meanwhile, although an advantage for a side looking to absorb pressure, becomes a potential drawback for a team that seek to take the game to the opposition. Its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The blockish nature of the formation, the way the midfield is divided into holders and creators – all No 6s and No 10s in modern parlance, with no No 8s – means that without a player to step between bands there is a risk of predictability; again, Chelsea had the ideal player to do that, David Luiz often striding forward from the back three to become an additional midfield option.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have the second-lowest possession of any side in the Premier League. It’s not their job to have the ball. And that’s the main reason why a direct comparison with United’s struggles is difficult. United, by history and by expectation, cannot be the side with the second-lowest possession in the Premier League.Even if United chose to counterattack against other elite sides, most of their games will be against opponents who sit deep and would be happy enough with a draw. In most games there is an onus on them to dominate the ball.Perhaps a progressive team can play a 3-4-2-1 but it requires very particular players – as Conte had at Chelsea. Glasner’s success with it has come at Lask, Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt, where he has been able to have his side sit deep and break at pace.Palace have beaten West Ham and Aston Villa, because most sides do at the moment, frustrated Chelsea, andtorn Liverpool apart on the counter. But they’ve also drawn at home to Nottingham Forest and Sunderland, and struggled to beat Fredrikstad. Sit deep against Palace and they struggle for creativity.Could Glasner adapt were he to go to United? Probably. He has been successful in three different countries; he has proved himself adaptable. But it’s unlikely he could do so playing a 3-4-2-1 in the way he does at Palace, or, being frank, with the current United squad. He may be the manager who madeCrystal Palacebeating Dynamo Kyiv seem normal, almost expected, but he’s not a miracle worker.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceInside footballManchester UnitedChelseacommentShareReuse this content"

Frankfurt are sixth on nine points.Fresh from a 5-1 demolition of Pafos in the Champions League on Tuesday, Bayern shot out of the blocks and needed just 15 seconds to take the lead with Colombia international Díaz’s tap-in at the far post and Frankfurt caught napping.Both teams then had the ball in the net in a rollercoaster start to the game only to be caught offside but Bayern came close to a second goal when Frankfurt’s Robin Koch tried to clear a cutback and sent the ball bouncing on to the bar. The tempo gradually dropped off but Kane struck from outside the box, finding just enough space to unleash an unstoppable low drive and put Bayern 2-0 up.Frankfurt never managed to recover and were on the back foot even after Bayern eased off midway through the second half.

The 19-year-old’s first league goal came three days after scoring his first goal in the Champions League in a 1-1 draw against PSV Eindhoven.The 2024 German double winners, who endured a rocky start the season that led to the dismissal of Erik ten Hag, are undefeated in four league games under his replacement Kasper Hjulmand.In La Liga,Real Madrid’s Vinícius Júnior scored twice before a late finish from Kylian Mbappé wrapped up a 3-1 home victory overVillarreal, who finished with 10 men. Madrid now sit top on 21 points, two clear of Barcelona who visit Sevilla on Sunday.

The Brazilian forward doubled his tally from the penalty spot in the 69th minute, having been brought down by Rafa Marín, with his spot-kick just squeezing under Arnau Tenas.However, four minutes later Villarreal proved they had come to the Santiago Bernabéu to fight as Georges Mikautadze pulled one back with a low strike from the edge of the box. The drama continued when the Villarreal defender Santiago Mouriño was sent off after a second booking for a foul on Vinícius, leaving the visitors on the back foot. The impact was immediate as Mbappé scored in the 80th minute after Brahim Díaz broke through and laid the ball back for the Frenchman to complete the victory.In Serie A,Intercruised to a 4-1 home win overCremonese, with four different scorers on a rainy night. The victory moved Inter level on 12 points with first-placed Milan, Napoli and Roma, who all play their sixth league game of the season on Sunday.Lautaro Martínez started the rout in the sixth minute after latching on to a pass from Ange-Yoan Bonny inside the box and finishing unmarked with ease.

Two minutes later, Bonny again turned provider, slipping the ball to the unmarked Nicolò Barella, who buried the ball with a first-time finish for Inter’s fourth.The former England striker Jamie Vardy made his second league appearance for Cremonese when he came on just before the hour mark and was involved in the buildup that led to Federico Bonazzoli pulling a goal back three minutes from time.Danilo Cataldi’s penalty in the 13th minute of added time salvagedLazioa 3-3 draw at home toTorino, whileAtalantadrew 1-1 withComoandLeccewon 1-0 atParmaMarseillemoved top of Ligue 1 – above Paris Saint-Germain on goal difference – thanks to a 3-0 win at Metz.

With this pivotal victory and, significantly, this performance, it appears they might well be. They moved up to second in the Women’s Super League thanks to a late strike from Iman Beney that clinched a hard-fought win against Arsenal.It was a game that started poorly, but turned into a five-goal thriller and the result was priceless for the hosts. Arsenal, who dropped pointsat home to Aston Villalast time out and are now winless in three WSL games, slip five points behind the leaders, Chelsea, after five games, while Manchester City are a point behind the defending champions thanks to Beney’s finish into the bottom corner.Sandberg’s superb strike denies Chelsea as Manchester United hold WSL leadersRead moreIt is not the sort of form Arsenal would want to take in to the start of thedefence of their Champions League title, when they host OL Lyonnes on Tuesday, but there will now be a bit of pressure building around the club before that difficult-looking game against the eight-time European champions. It was nearly a very different story, though, as it looked as though Chloe Kelly had come back to haunt her former club by scoring an 83rd-minute equaliser.Kelly felt frozen out of the Manchester City team last winterbefore joining Arsenal; she pointed to the badge on her shirt as she celebrated her leveller in front of the travelling supporters.Manchester City, who have now won four consecutive WSL games since their opening loss at Chelsea, are beginning to click into gear under their new head coach, Andrée Jeglertz. “The game was won by us keeping on believing,” he said. “[At 2-2] there was no player thinking ‘now we just need to protect this result’. That is not happening in this group. This group is still believing that we will create scoring chances and we will win the game.”Their belief was also clear in a first half they dominated, with Vivianne Miedema having a header well saved against her former club. They took the lead when Khadija Shaw headed in Kerstin Casparij’s cross, after great work from Aoba Fujino to release Casparij down the right.View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly celebrates scoring Arsenal’s second goal against her former club.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersThe hosts should have doubled their lead when Shaw was played through on goal, but she hesitated too long and when her shot was diverted to Casparij to put the ball in the net, the Netherlands international was offside. Arsenal drew level moments into the second half when Mariona Caldentey lashed in a classy strike.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arsenal upped their game in response and looked as if they had rescued a point with Kelly’s clinical strike into the corner, but Beney was ruthless on the counterattack after Shaw’s knockdown.The worry for Arsenal will be that last season the champions, Chelsea, dropped six points in the entire campaign whereas Arsenal have already dropped seven. “We are very disappointed with the result,” the Arsenal head coach, Renée Slegers, said. “We know how much strength we have in the squad and when we need to come back from things, we know that we can. We all believe it will come, if we keep working really hard.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester City WomenArsenal WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I think we weren’t quite our usual selves off the ball. Little bits that we had to talk about at half-time. But of course, when you get your goals and we create the amount of chances that we do, then at the moment, the form that we’re in, you’ve got a great chance. It’s a period where we’re playing well. All the work that we do is coming together.”Commenting on the on-pitch protest, Lampard said: “I very much sympathise with them. I think they’re doing great in the way they’re carrying themselves and even the fans coming on the pitch, in my opinion, is understandable and they came off quickly.

It was a third league win of the season for Hull, but an eighth defeat forSheffield United.Chris Wilder admitted his United side failed to make the most of their chances, saying: “When we get into those positions, we have to put teams to bed. We need patience, we need time to work, but players have got to give their heads a shake. At times players have got to find those answers.

Boro needed a point to return to the summit following Coventry’s win earlier in the day, but the South Korean winger Yang Min-hyeok’s first-half strike was enough to earn Pompey a first win in five league games.“We showed a lot of puff and got into a lot of good areas, but the final product wasn’t good enough,” said the Middlesbrough manager, Rob Edwards. “It’s all well and good having a lot more of the ball, but you’ve got to do something with it. One shot on target is not enough, ultimately. Today is a frustrating day.”Stunning strikes from Jordan James and Abdul Fatawu helpedLeicesterreturn to winning ways with a 3-1 victory atSwansea. Wales midfielder James, on loan from Rennes for the season, gave Leicester a 13th-minute lead with his second goal in successive games.Adam Idah equalised from the penalty spot after 70 minutes, his first Swansea goal since joining from Celtic in a deal worth around £6m in September, but Leicester were not to be denied.

The Sierra Leone international Kargbo came under fire on Tuesday night after he gave the ball away against Swansea and failed to track back as the Swans scored the winning goal.But he came off the bench against Stoke and made his mark on a game Rovers were losing after Million Manhoef’s deflected strike early in the second half gave the Potters the advantage. Kargbo popped up in the 82nd minute to control brilliantly and maintain his composure before finding the bottom corner, and he also smashed an effort against a post late on as Blackburn tried to force a winner.“It’s always about the reaction,” said Ismaël. “Everyone makes mistakes and it’s important; how is the reaction straight away after the mistake on the pitch?

In a game of attrition on a windy afternoon, Daniel Jebbison scored his first goal for Preston to double the lead late in the second half.Preston’s manager, Paul Heckingbottom, heaped praise on Small, saying: “I’m really glad he was involved in the game. I spoke to him beforehand and said that it’s just another game but it’s different because Thierry is young and excitable. We just wanted him to really focus on his role and what his job was and he went and did it.”Heckingbottom also praised Jebbison after the on-loan Bournemouth man got off the mark for the season. “He’ll be delighted,” he said. “Jebbo’s showed great desire to get on the end of it. I’m really pleased for him. He’s a great lad but I forgot how much he frustrates me. I want to slap him about a bit at times.”Zak Sturge’s first goal forMillwallcapped a 3-0 victory overWest Bromthat put their midweek hidingat the hands of Coventrybehind them.

Jake Cooper lifted the mood with his first-half opener and, after Femi Azeez’s stunning strike doubled their advantage, former Chelsea youngster Sturge rifled in as West Brom were beaten for just the second time this season.“We’ve had some really good performances this year, we just haven’t been clinical at times,” said Neil. “I think that clinical aspect makes the games look different.

As far as he is concerned, nothing happened as a resultPaul MacInnesSat 4 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Oct 2025 01.58 EDTShareWhen Chichester City confirmed that Saturday’s FA Trophy tie with Farnham Town would go ahead, they did so with a message: “Billy Vigar, forever in our hearts.” The match, the team’s first since Vigar’s tragic death a week previously, would be contested to “honour Billy”, the club said. “We invite you to join us in paying tribute to Billy on the day.”Vigar, 21, died aftersustaining a “significant brain injury”during Chichester’s Isthmian Premier League fixture at Wingate & Finchley on 20 September. His passing was mourned by Arsenal, where Vigar had been part of the academy, and more broadly by clubs and individuals from across non-league football. There was a great sadness at the passing of a player who was well liked in a tight-knit community but had died, as Vigar’s family put it, “playing the sport he loved”.Although the cause of the lethal injury is yet to be officially confirmed, it is expected that it will be attributed to a collision between Vigar and a concrete perimeter barrier which surrounds the Wingate & Finchley pitch. In the aftermath of the player’s death, the Football Association announced it would conduct “an immediate review … that will focus on the safety of perimeter walls and boundaries around pitches in the National League System” – from the fifth to the 10th tier.View image in fullscreenFlowers are placed below a mural of Billy Vigar in a tunnel outside the Emirates Stadium. Vigar was an Arsenal youth player.Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty ImagesThe FA’s announcement was met with astonishment in the lower levels of the football pyramid, partly because such incidents had happened before. “When I first heard news of the incident I just felt shellshocked,” says the former Bath City striker Alex Fletcher. “We will wait to see what the details and the specifics are but, obviously, it was being widely reported that it was a very similar incident in nature to mine. So it brought a lot back to me.”Fletcher crashed into concrete advertising hoardings at Bath City’s Twerton Park during a match in November 2022. He sustained head injuries which necessitated emergency surgery and left the then 23-year-old in a coma. Eventually he returned to playing but had to relearn how to walk and is permanently deaf in his left ear. After his recovery, Fletcher spoke out about his experience and called for changes in the rules governing pitch boundaries to better take into account the safety of non-league players.As far as he is concerned, nothing happened as a result. “Until now the leadership from the FA has been nonexistent,” Fletcher says. “I was very public and very vocal about what needed to be done. We tried to ask the people who are responsible for setting these regulations to involve players more in it because they’re the ones ultimately going to be able to tell you where they don’t feel safe. That consultation process hasn’t happened.”This is especially shocking to Fletcher because his accident led to an intervention by government. In 2023 the then sports minister, Stuart Andrew, sent a letter to the FA jointly written with the Professional Footballers’ Association. The letter called on leagues (the FA oversees the operation of the National League system) to “take a proactive approach in working with clubs to ensure ground risk assessments take place, that clubs engage with players and other parties who may be able to help identify areas of concern within grounds, and that all parties work to put sensible mitigation measures in place where necessary to help improve player safety”. The letter continued: “As part of that process, we would also ask that leagues look at any standardised guidance they may give to their clubs on this issue to see whether it can be refined or improved.”View image in fullscreenBilly Vigar playing for Arsenal Under-21s in 2022.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesThe FA says that responsibility for the health and safety of “participants and spectators” at the National League system level “is the responsibility of the clubs and their local authorities”. It does, however, set the minimum standards any club must follow in order for a stadium to be accredited to stage a match. In 2023, after Fletcher’s injury, the FA opted to conduct a broad review of safety at stadiums within the National League system and has since visited 890 football grounds. The body conducting the review said it had been commissioned in part because “there was very little information held centrally by any of the stakeholders such as the Premier League Stadium Fund, the FA and the Premier League on the facilities used”. Those inspections will feed into future guidance on stadium criteria, according to sources, but currently the criteria relating to perimeter barriers, which are largely in place to stop spectators from entering the pitch or balls running far beyond it, require that they are of “sound construction (eg concrete and steel)”.The absence of any intervention from the FA has distressed many in the National League system who say the warnings of the risks to players’ safety were made clearly and repeatedly. “It was a really strange one because nothing happened and you expected it to,” says John Peel, a director at Lewes, another Isthmian Premier League side. “Sometimes it takes a long time to come up with a new decision or a new policy. So you’re always kind of thinking: ‘Well, maybe it’s coming.’ But it never did.”Describing the FA’s statement in response to Vigar’s death as “really odd”, Peel said: “I thought it passed the buck a little bit when really it’s their responsibility because they’re the ones who set the rules.”Lisa Nandy, the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, said this week that government would be “reviewing with sporting governance bodies the safety conditions of sports venues across the country” with a view to ensuring we never have another tragedy like this again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He suggests the distance between the boundaries of the pitch and any barrier, the so-called “run off”, should be looked at, alongside a move away from inflexible, hard materials.“We know that clubs aren’t blessed in all divisions with a great deal of space around the stadium,” Fletcher says, “but the [minimum] distance of [the run-offs], you’re talking no longer than the length of an average male. That’s not enough room for a footballer to stop when they’re competing full-blooded on the pitch. The material is what I maintain is the biggest problem. I’ve played at plenty of grounds where you’ve got these more flexible materials that are designed to give way on impact. And what that would mean is a greater stopping distance, obviously, for the player.”View image in fullscreenA minute’s silence was held in memory of Billy Vigar during the National League match between Truro and Morecambe at Truro City Stadium.Photograph: Frankie Okeeffe/PPAUK/ShutterstockThe minimum run-off requirement in the National League system is 1.83 metres while the minimum in the EFL is 2.25m, with 2.75m preferred. The minimum for any new-build in the National League system, however, is three metres. That is the recommended minimum run-off in the Premier League.Wingate & Finchley announced last weekend that they intended to install “rubber safety padding” around their ground after the tragedy, saying “there is currently no appetite for football at the Maurice Rebak stadium”. Their home match on Saturday will be hosted by their opponents, VCD Athletic.Lewes, meanwhile, have offered counselling to their players and say they will not force anyone to play in grounds with perimeters which feel unsafe. These are mitigation in the face of a broader problem which has been waiting too long for a solution. Meanwhile the family of Billy Vigar will continue to grieve.Explore more on these topicsFootballThe FAfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are treating it with the utmost seriousness.”Neither the Saints norHull KRare expected to comment further at this stage, with the matter now in the hands of the police, who are investigating the threat – but both clubs are believed to be taking the matter seriously.Rovers won the game to progress to a second successiveSuper LeagueGrand Final, where they will face the defending champions, Wigan Warriors, at Old Trafford next Saturday.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueHull KRSt HelensRugby leagueMerseysidenewsShareReuse this content"

Of course they wanted to win but on the night Willie Peters’ side fell short of the standards they had set throughout last year.St Helens given police escort after ‘terrorist threat’ made during Hull KR matchRead moreThis time, it does not feel as though history will repeat itself on that front. Since they were last there, the Robins have shed their tag of being rugby league’s perennial bridesmaids bywinning the Challenge Cupand the League Leaders’ Shield, ending their 40-year wait for a major trophy.This squad are now just one win away from a historic treble after navigating a tricky semi-final against a St Helens side short on quality but certainly not on effort. Now, Rovers’ most ferocious test awaits themnext Saturday: Wigan Warriors, who are seeking a third successive title.There was a school of thought that the week off earned as a result of finishing top would prove to be the catalyst for the Robins’ form to tick upwards again after a drop-off in the final month of the regular season. That looked emphatically to be the case early on as Rovers returned to the levels of performance we are accustomed to from them.St Helens did not even muster a play-the-ball inside Hull KR’s 20m area during a one-sided first half, with the Robins producing a defensive performance based on the kind of resilience and grit Peters’ men have become renowned for in 2025. By half-time, Saints were 12-0 behind and looking incredibly weary.View image in fullscreenJoe Burgess scores Hull KR’s second try against St Helens.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAThey briefly responded with Deon Cross’s try after half-time but by the time they scored again, the contest was over. There were some nervy moments with the semi-final finely poised at 12-6 but when Saints could not capitalise to score again, Rovers were able to rediscover their composure sufficiently in the final quarter.Two tries inside eight minutes from Oliver Gildart put the contest beyond Saints and, despite a late try from Harry Robertson, it only ever really felt as if one side was heading to the Grand Final.“I don’t think we were ready to win last year,” Peters said. “We’ve shown this year we’ve been the most consistent side.”Peters said the Robins had needed their free weekend to reset, and if Wigan were watching on closely, they would have been impressed by what they saw in the first half. Rovers were near-faultless as tries from Mikey Lewis and Joe Burgess moved them 12 points ahead with little fuss.View image in fullscreenDeon Cross scores a try for St Helens after half-time but it proved in vain.Photograph: Steve Mower/ProSports/ShutterstockThe Robins’ only gripe at the break would have been that it could and should have been more. Saints had been suffocated and looked bereft of ideas, but Cross’s try shortly after half-time added a layer of intrigue into the contest. But in the end, a side who have not won at any of the competition’s top three all season were never really truly able to threaten a victory.Attention will now turn to whether Paul Wellens will continue as Saints coach in 2026. They have underwhelmed in too many big games this year, and he was hesitant to say too much on his future. “It’s not something I want to get caught up in right now,” said Wellens, whose contract expires next month.He would have been heartened by the grit his side showed but they couldn’t muster enough attacking threat to level the scores. Gildart’s two quickfire tries were more than enough to get the job done and while Robertson scored late on, by then, the celebrations among the home fans had already started.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueHull KRSt HelensRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

The crowd at the Bethpage Black course in New York graduated from boos and heckles to homophobic slurs and insults aimed at players’ wives. The first-tee master of ceremonies set the tone by leading a chant of “fuck you, Rory!”, putting Rory McIlroy firmly in the crosshairs – along with his wife, who was hit with a beer cup.After initially playing it down, American golf officialsapologisedand said some fan behaviour had “crossed the line”, but the affair has left a nagging sense of unease. What if the line has in fact moved? What if accepted codes of crowd behaviour have changed?It is a question social scientists and event managers have been asking in recent years and spans several countries and types of spectacle, obviating any sense that the issue is confined to US golf fans.View image in fullscreenNew York state park police watch the crowd at the Ryder Cup tournament on the Bethpage Black golf course.Photograph: Lindsey Wasson/APTaunting banners brandished at football terraces, gum spat at tennis players, objects hurled on to concert stages, heckles during concerts – an apparently never-ending litany of boorish, loutish behaviour fills news feeds.“It’s undeniable that in all aspects of public life a growing number of people are becoming more belligerent,” saidKirsty Sedgman, a University of Bristol cultural studies scholar.“It’s not just that people are becoming more badly behaved, it’s that when they’re called out, instead of simmering down they’re much more likely to turn against those making the complaint.”Last week the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Communications and Theatre union (Bectu)published a surveythat showed 34% of those working in live events in the UK had experienced antisocial behaviour, violence, aggression or harassment from audience members in the past 12 months, with that figure rising to 77% for front-of-house staff.PGA of America president belatedly admits US Ryder Cup fans ‘crossed line’ with abuseRead moreSome theorists of crowd psychology attribute aggression to “deindividuation”, whereby a sense of anonymity and sensory overload untether people from their sense of individual identity and they do things they ordinarily would not.Other theorists posit “convergence”, in which the crowd dynamic uncorks individuals’ inner beliefs and values.Either way, the results can be ugly. “Faggot!” some US fans screamed at McIlroy. “Wanker!” shouted others. Many commentators have linked such invective to toxic social media feeds and the climate of political polarisation, which suggests a modern phenomenon.But there is nothing new in sports fans or theatre audiences behaving badly. In ancient Athens, Plato complained about spectators becoming mobs, arguably making him the first theorist of crowd behaviour.Any gathering of humans, in fact, can cause upset. Thomas Hardy took the title of his novel Far From the Madding Crowd from Thomas Gray’s 1751 poem,Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, that railed against the “ignoble strife” of those who disrupt “sacred calm”.Today’s anxiety over the coarsening of crowd behaviour can be overdone and is to some extent “moral panic”, said Sedgman. “Each society has golden-age thinking – looking back to a time when everyone was kind and courteous.”View image in fullscreenPlastic beer cups lie on the pitch after the Uefa Euro 2024 match between Croatia and Italy in Leipzig.Photograph: Dan Mullan/GettySome Scottish boxing fans still squirm over memories of a crowd booing Muhammad Ali during an exhibition bout at Paisley in 1965. “All booing must stop when the king’s in the ring,” he exhorted in vain.Eric Cantona took more direct action in 1995 when a Crystal Palace fan shouted “fuck off back to France you French motherfucker” by leaping over the barrier todeliver a kung fu kick.Some experts question whether modern manners really have degraded. “The headlines tend to come from high-profile incidents: disorder at Wembley, gate-rushing at the Copa América final,” said Anne Marie Chebib, the managing director of the UK Crowd Management Association (UKCMA). “Yet the data tells us these are exceptions. The overwhelming majority of events take place safely and securely, with no disruption, but those stories rarely make the news.”In a 2023 poll of the association’s members, 93% reported deteriorating behaviour but the following year 57% reported no change or only a slight worsening, a pattern replicated in aGlobal Crowd Management Alliancereport. “Many practitioners now see behaviour as broadly stable,” said Chebib.View image in fullscreenDiogenes the Cynic (c412-404BC to 323BC) challenges Plato in the academy at Athens.Photograph: AlamyStephen Reicher, a University of St Andrews psychology professor and an authority on crowd behaviour, said there were perennial fears about the rowdiness and danger of crowds but that violence was extremely rare.Of 49 million attendances at British football matches last year, there were 1,963 arrests, of which half were disorder, he said. “You would likely get far more arrests if that many people of that demographic were in town of a Saturday afternoon. So you could argue that people are less likely to be disorderly and violent in a football crowd.”However, crowds make news only when there are disturbances, said Reicher. “You can have hundreds of games on a Saturday afternoon and violence at one. So which will be reported? And if we only see crowds when crowds are violent we get a highly distorted view of crowds as characteristically violent.”The Ryder Cup’s history and uniqueness suggest other reasons not to extrapolate too much from the scenes at Bethpage Black. The 1999 contest at Brookline, Massachusetts, was marred by abuse likened to a bear pit. McIlroy asked security officials to expel a particularly obnoxious heckler at Hazeltine in Minnesota in 2016.View image in fullscreenEric Cantona delivers a kung fu kick to a Crystal Palace fan in 1995.Photograph: Action ImagesThe tournament is structured around the US versus Europe at a time that Donald Trump is reconfiguring the meaning of Americanism, said Reicher.“It affirms the new world against the old. It is about triumphalism, about domination, about success by any means necessary. It rejects a rule-based order. It celebrates masculinity, domination excess.“The Ryder Cup shows the traction it is getting among at least some Americans. We cannot suppose from that it is relevant to all sports or even all golf.”Mark Breen, the strategic director ofSafe Events Global, a company that advises on security, said swift action can shape crowd behaviour.“It’s about knocking bad norms on the head early, or establishing good ones,” he said.“Normal, decent people will get caught up in some behaviours so maybe you throw out the first hecklers, make an example of the worst offenders. But you don’t want to sterilise the sport, take the passion out of it.”View image in fullscreenFans watch Wet Leg play the Other stage at Glastonbury. ‘You don’t want to take the passion out,’ say crowd security experts.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockAdding concerts and other events as adjuncts to sporting occasions complicates the balance, said Breen. “When you’re building a festival vibe, it’s harder to manage social norms. You just have to work as hard as you can to avoid boorishness.”John Drury, a social psychology professor at the University of Sussex, said music event organisers had reported deteriorating audience behaviour since the Covid pandemic, to the point it was now normalised.One possible explanation was that lockdown restrictions stunted socialisation, said Drury. “You’ve got a cohort of people that weren’t socialised by older generations when they’re going out, so they’re not used to it, and so perhaps don’t know what the norms are. What they’re doing feels right to them, but to other people it doesn’t feel right.”Another possible factor was audience members doing stunts to get attention on social media. In most cases it was just a tiny minority causing disruption, said Drury. “But these dramatic events are then presented as a kind of trend in audiences.”Sedgman has a more ominous analysis. Audience behaviour is a bellwether of wider societal trends and the apparent growth in loutishness, or lack of consideration, shows a fraying in the social contract, of the agreed norms that bind a society, she said.“An increasing number of people think they don’t need to follow these norms, that only mugs do so. It’s the canary in the coalmine.”"

But what they are not entirely used to – yet – is the sight of a robot pulling up to their front door. The co-founder ofSkype, Ahti Heinla, believes his new venture is about to change that.Heinla is the chief executive of Starship Technologies, a startup that, he claimed, is able to operate deliveries run by trundling robots at a small profit – and cheaper than a human delivery driver, even in small towns and villages where delivery has not previously been viable.“We’ve solved everything that there is to solve,” Heinla said over lunch at a London hotel. “You could count how many years this is or how many months this is. But it will happen. It’s very clear it will happen.”Residents of Manchester, Leeds, Cambridge andMilton Keynes in the UK, across Finland, and in Heinla and Starship’s home country of Estonia have all received food and groceries from the robots. They are becoming increasingly mainstream: they made an appearance at a 10 Downing Street garden party, andin an episodeofThe Bear, the hit US restaurant drama. Starship has made 8m deliveries with only 200 employees, but the company wants that number to rocket.Heinla has already made a lot of money by co-creating software that became a verb:to Skype.In 2000, Heinla was a video game developer who was hired by Skype co-founders Niklas Zennström and Jaan Tallinn, a fellow Estonian, to write some new code quickly. That became thefilesharing programme Kazaa, and then, using similar tech, Skype. The six-strong founding team ended upselling to the online auction site eBay for $3.1bn (£2.3bn) in 2005.That was an age ago in tech time – Skype closed this year, and Heinla says of that time”: “It’s almost like a different me.” Heinla would not reveal how much he made, but he could, he said, do the ex-tech boss thing flying in private jets if he wanted to.View image in fullscreenAhti Heinla says robotics could ‘touch everybody’s lives’ through autonomous deliveries.Photograph: noneBut he does not want to. “I do see a lot of people in the world just trying to pursue money for money’s sake, even if they have enough,” the Estonian said. “I’m not like that. I’m sure I’m not interested in money or making money.“I don’t need more. Why should I need it? Why do I have a palace? Why? What’s the point?”Instead, Heinla said that making a success of autonomous delivery is one of the quickest ways that robotics could “touch everybody’s lives”.After Skype, Heinla founded various businesses, including a shortlived social network effort. In 2014, he decided to enter a competition run by the US space agency Nasa to design a cheap Mars rover. Nasa did not choose the design, but what was good enough to cover extraterrestrial terrain could also handle wonky paving on urban roads. Radars, cameras, and ultrasound sensors watched out for obstacles, while the system learned from experience.By 2017, the robots were driving in Estonia without an accompanying “safety walker” – which Heinla claimed were the first unsupervised robots driving autonomously in public. In 2018, the company launched its pilot commercial service onMilton Keynes’s predictable grid of streets. It is working with fellow Estonian tech company Bolt, the UK’s Co-op supermarket chain and the US food delivery company Grubhub, among others.View image in fullscreenA Starship Technologies robot making grocery deliveries in Milton Keynes, England.Photograph: Justin Long/AlamyStarship may well have the largest fleet of autonomous vehicles in the world. However, it will face competition as autonomous technology improves. Rivals include US startups Serve Robotics and Nuro, plus Saudi Arabia-backed Noon. There could also be a challenge from the host of companies developing autonomous cars, ranging from the US’s Tesla to China’s Baidu.Perhaps the most eye-catching rivals are those that have slipped the bonds of earth: the Dublin startupManna Aero is already delivering coffeesand pizzas using flying drones, whileAmazonand Google sister company Wing have also tried out drone services.A common complaint from many of these companies is that they are being held back by inconsistent rules. Starship has had to negotiate with each individual council in the UK, holding back its rollout. In contrast, the company is making 1m deliveries a year in Finland – where the government introduced national legislation on what robots were allowed on pavements – to a population of 5.6 million; in the UK far fewer robots serve 69 million people.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we could have more, we could have much more.”He cited the example of a potential customer in the UK that has delivery in 200 sites, but wants to add it in 800 more, including those outside big towns and cities.View image in fullscreenA Starship Technologies robot crosses a road during tests in Northampton, UK.Photograph: Brian Tomlinson/Starship Technologies“That is a unique part that robots could be doing,” said Heinla. “And we want to do that. We want to bring delivery to the small towns in the UK as well. We’re ready to invest in scale.”Many economists and futurists have longwarned that the rise of robotswilltake human jobs. Heinla argued that Starship’s robots are not stealing jobs, but rather will address the burgeoning demand for deliveries, while humans focus on longer and more complicated jobs. He also argued that robots will help smaller stores “to thrive economically and compete with the larger, more central operations”. “Giving more capabilities to people is useful,” he added.Starship has raised just over €200m (£175m), with the last funding round led by Plural Partners in London and other venture capitalists primarily in Europe. That is far less than the billions raised in recent years by rapid delivery companies reliant on humans. However, many of those companies –Getir,GorillasandWeezy, among others – flamed out after raising huge sums.Robots have an upfront cost – several thousand pounds, but below €10,000, said Heinla – but overall costs per delivery are “comparable to what it costs with people, but it’s less”, he said, while declining to share precise figures. He said that Starship deliveries generate cash.“We are not a fully profitable business yet, but I’m sure we will be,” he said.Some retailers are sceptical that robots can be more efficient than human riders offered by the likes of Deliveroo and Uber Eats. However, Heinla argued that robots can work for restaurants and retailers in less densely populated urban areas because they do not need to be paid for idle time.“Almost every company that does delivery will need this,” he said. “At some point it will be not even a choice, because it will just be so much cheaper to do it by robot.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryRobotsSkypeEntrepreneursTechnology sectorTechnology startupsCouriers/delivery industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

OpenAI’s own terms of service for Sora as well asChatGPT’s image or text generation prohibit content that “promotes violence” or, more broadly, “causes harm”.In prompts and clips reviewed by the Guardian, Sora generated several videos of bomb and mass-shooting scares, with panicked people screaming and running across college campuses and in crowded places like New York’s Grand Central Station. Other prompts created scenes from war zones in Gaza and Myanmar, where children fabricated by AI spoke about their homes being burned. One video with the prompt “Ethiopia footage civil war news style” had a reporter in a bulletproof vest speaking into a microphone saying the government and rebel forces were exchanging fire in residential neighborhoods. Another video, created with only the prompt “Charlottesville rally”, showed a Black protester in a gas mask, helmet and goggles yelling: “You will not replace us” – a white supremacist slogan.LiveOpenAI Sora 2 generated video 1The video generator is invite-only and not yet available to the general public. Even still, in the three days since its limited release, it skyrocketed to the No 1 spot in Apple’s App Store, beating out OpenAI’s own ChapGPT.“It’s been epic to see what the collective creativity of humanity is capable of so far,” Bill Peebles, the head of Sora,posted on Xon Friday. “We’re sending more invite codes soon, I promise!”The Sora app gives a glimpse into a near future where separating truth from fiction could become increasingly difficult, should the videos spread widely beyond the AI-only feed, as they have begun to. Misinformation researchers say that such lifelike scenes could obfuscate the truth and create situations where these AI videos could be used for fraud, bullying and intimidation.“It has no fidelity to history, it has no relationship to the truth,” said Joan Donovan, an assistant professor at Boston University who studies media manipulation and misinformation. “When cruel people get their hands on tools like this, they will use them for hate, harassment and incitement.”Slop engine or ‘ChatGPT for creativity’?OpenAI’s CEOSam Altmandescribed the launch of Sora 2 as “really great”, saying in ablog postthat “this feels to many of us like the ‘ChatGPT for creativity’ moment, and it feels fun and new”.Altman admitted to “some trepidation”, acknowledging how social media can be addictive and used for bullying and that AI video generation can create what’s known as “slop”, a slew of repetitive, low-quality videos that can overwhelm a platform.“The team has put great care and thought into trying to figure out how to make a delightful product that doesn’t fall into that trap,” Altman wrote. He said OpenAI had also put in place mitigations on using someone’s likeness and safeguards for disturbing or illegal content. For example, the app refused to make a video of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin sharing cotton candy.0:10OpenAI Sora 2 generated video 2In the three days since Sora’s launch, however, many of these videos have already made their way elsewhere online. Drew Harwell, a reporter for the Washington Post,created a video of Altman himselfas a second world war military leader. Harwell also said he was able to make videos with “ragebait, fake crimes and women splattered with white goo”.Sora’s feed is full of videos of copyrighted characters from shows like SpongeBob SquarePants, South Park and Rick and Morty. The app had no trouble generating videos of Pikachu raising tariffs on China, stealing roses from the White House Rose Garden or participating in a Black Lives Matter protest alongside SpongeBob, who, in another video, declared and planned a war on the United States. In a video documented by 404 Media, SpongeBob wasdressed like Adolf Hitler.Paramount, Warner Bros and Pokémon Co did not return requests for comment.David Karpf, an associate professor at George Washington University’s School of Media and Public Affairs, said he had viewed videos of copyrighted characters promoting cryptocurrency scams. He said it’s clear OpenAI’s safeguards and mitigations for Sora aren’t working.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Varun Shetty, OpenAI’s head of media partnerships, said: “We’ll work with rights holders to block characters from Sora at their request and respond to takedown requests.”Emily Bender, a professor at the University of Washington andauthor of the book The AI Con, said Sora is creating a dangerous situation where it’s “harder to find trustworthy sources and harder to trust them once found”.“Synthetic media machines, whether designed to extrude text, images or video, are a scourge on our information ecosystem,” Bender said. “Their outputs function analogously to an oil spill, flowing through connections of technical and social infrastructure, weakening and breaking relationships of trust.”Nick Robins-Early contributed reporting‘My son genuinely believed it was real’: Parents are letting little kids play with AI.

Maria Ressa, joint winner of the Nobel peace prize, is a Filipino and American journalist who co-founded the news website Rappler. And Rory Stewart is a British academic and former Conservative MP, writer and co-host of The Rest Is Politics podcast. Their conversation ranged over the rise of AI, the crisis in democracy and the prospect of a Trump-Putin wedding, but began by considering a question central to all of their work: how to live a good life in an increasingly fragmented and fragile world?YNHPeople have been arguing about this for thousands of years. The main contribution of modern liberalism and democracy was to try to agree to disagree; that different people can have very different concepts of what a good life is, and they can still live together in the same society, agreeing on some very basic rules of conduct. And the challenge was always that people who think they have the absolute answer to what is a good life try to impose it on others, partly because, unfortunately for many ideologies, an inherent part of the good life is attempting to make everybody live it. And even more unfortunately, in many cases, it seems that it is easier to impose it on others than to do it ourselves. If we take the original crusade in medieval Christian Europe, you have all these people who can’t live a Christian life of modesty and compassion and love your neighbour, but they are able to travel thousands of kilometres to kill people and try to force them to live according to these principles. And what we are witnessing in the world right now is more of the same.RSAt the heart of that observation is this extraordinary idea, which, broadly speaking, is called liberalism. It is an idea that became very powerful, particularly by the 19th century, and found a new form after the second world war. We’re the heirs of that: it assumed things like a rules-based international order; an idea that we would agree how we behaved, state to state; it had an idea of democracy at its heart. And of course, that idea of democracy has a lot of the ingredients that Yuval is talking about, which is tolerance, human rights – how you protect the minority from the views of the majority. And there was an extraordinary period that probably lasted until the mid-2000s where it really seemed possible that this was the natural destination of humanity. And then things began to come off the rails. Now we find ourselves in a world where almost every bit of the model has entered its shadow form. So instead of focusing on democracy, we’re in a world dominated by authoritarian populism. Instead of a world of free trade, we’re in one that’s increasingly about protection and tariffs. Instead of a rules-based international order, we’re in a world of isolation: the strong do what they can, the weak must suffer what they must. And all this, of course, is then reinforced by social media and increasingly by AI.We are now creating a superintelligence, and there is every reason to think that it will be super deludedYuval Noah HarariMRThe biggest question we have today is whether impunity will reign, because it’s clear from what is happening in the physical and virtual world that an international rules-based order is not working. How do you live a good life when big tech is using surveillance for profit, to manipulate us in order to keep making more money? Now we’re individually targeted by technology that can go to the cellular level of every democracy.All five major world religions say that the battle that matters in order to live a good life is the battle inside yourself: your better self versus your worst self. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you; it’s a simple thing. But how do we maintain these values when the very way we connect with each other is corrupted?YNHWhat is new in the current situation is that we now have the technology to hack human beings and manipulate the inner battle in a way that was simply impossible in the middle ages or even in the 20th century. Big corporations, and anybody wielding this new technology, can both decipher and also manipulate human desires and thoughts in a way that is unprecedented. And liberal democracy, as it was constituted in the 18th and 19th century, really doesn’t know how to deal with it.RSThere’s also the possibility that technology begins to overshadow us. If you think about civilisation, a lot of it traditionally was about these great figures, these role models, these heroes. And what is a hero? Somebody who stretches the limits of what it means to be human. We believe we are this extraordinary species who can do things in science or poetry or drama that no other species can do. The risk of artificial general intelligence is that suddenly it is quite literally superhuman. At that point, if it can effortlessly write a poem better than I can, create a play better than I can, suddenly we are diminished.View image in fullscreenYuval Noah Harari.Photograph: David Vintiner/The GuardianMRIt would be great if the technology that is enabling this transformation is actually 100% accurate. It is not. But because we’ve grown up with integrity of information, it’s much easier to fool us, because when you see it in writing, you expect it to be right. The way AI has been pushed in our society is completely separate from facts. And I know Yuval in his book says information is not about facts, it’s about the stories we tell, but facts anchor our shared reality.A question I would like to ask you guys: do you think people are fundamentally good or fundamentally evil? I sound super religious in this conversation, but really that makes a difference, because what we’re doing now in the public information ecosystem, part of the breakdown of democracy, part of our ability to elect illiberal leaders democratically, is because we’ve muted the goodness of humanity. I’ve covered the crappiness of humanity, of people killing each other, I’ve been in war zones, but I’ve also been in these areas where a natural disaster happens and people are incredibly generous. We would not have survived the six-year presidency of Rodrigo Duterte if there were not people who gave not just of themselves, but gave money to Rappler. So I think this is what’s at stake.I’ve been in war zones. But I’ve also been where a disaster has happened and people are incredibly generousMaria RessaYNHOne of the most important observations is that goodness is not closely related to intelligence. Artificial intelligence is the most important technology of the era; it has been forgotten that intelligence is no guarantee of goodness or even of wisdom, that when you look at the grand span of human history, you don’t see a clear correlation between intelligence and compassion, or even a clear-sighted view of reality. Homo sapiens is by far the most intelligent species on the planet, and it simultaneously is the most deluded species: humans believe the kind of nonsense that no chimpanzee or elephant or rat would ever believe. We are now creating a superintelligence, and there is every reason to think that it will be super deluded.RSYuval is unusual because he is capable of considering the possibility of where we might be in 200 years. But let’s try 20 for a second. When we think about the world, often we think about it from Silicon Valley, and we imagine that really the future is Star Trek, and Elon Musk is off to Mars. For most, perhaps half of humanity, over the next decades to come, hundreds of millions will be living on incomes of under $2 a day, and billions under $5 a day.The next thing is that conflict is changing. We can see with what’s happening in Gaza and to some extent in Ukraine, the way in which wealthy countries with technology can inflict astonishing damage on their neighbours and take very little risk themselves. Added to that, there is a push towards an arms race happening all over the world. So if we look at Europe, we’re now increasing our spending on defence to 5% of GDP. That will literally suck hundreds of billions of euros every year out of our health systems, our education systems, our welfare systems, at exactly the moment that our economies are flatlining and our populations are getting older, so there’s every likelihood that over the next 10-20 years, at the same time as AI is developing, much of the world will begin to feel like a shabbier, poorer version of the current world, that median incomes will stagnate and that conflict will rise.View image in fullscreenMaria Ressa.MRI completely agree with what Rory said, but I’m more pessimistic. I don’t think it’ll take 20 years. The Philippines gets an average of 20 typhoons every year. We’re watching islands sink, and yet the west is debating whether climate change even exists.I think the death of journalism is around the corner within six months to a year. The internet is getting worse by the day, and there are absolutely no guardrails put in place, even as news organisations are being forced to pay for that, and our content is exploited. It is a very predatory online world, and that has translated to the world we live in.YNHIf I had to characterise the emotional tone of what I have been doing for quite a number of years, I would say that I was in the business of anxiety – that I’m creating more anxiety around AI, climate change, whatever. Now we need to switch to a different project, which is to rebuild trust, because when there is too much anxiety and you can’t trust anybody or anything, you can’t do anything. The most important thing is to rebuild trust in human institutions, in the media, in government, elsewhere. The big question is, how do we do that?Government is much worse than I could ever have imagined – the whole thing has become a gameRory StewartRSI would say that that involves rebuilding those human institutions. My experience as a politician is that government is much worse than I could ever have imagined. Liz Truss, my boss and colleague, who became prime minister in the United Kingdom, basically thought that her job was Instagram and campaigning, and she dedicated very little time to any serious consideration of policy, and in fact was derogatory of people who worried too much about the real-life impacts of what she was doing. The whole thing has become a game.MRHow long will we pretend that there is integrity of elections as the world falls off the cliff? Part of what made the international rules-based system work was that we had a powerful anchor for it: that we did what was for the greater good. We expected leaders to pull back from their greed. And if they didn’t, journalists would expose these things. Now that the US doesn’t seem to care about any other country but itself, what will that mean? Does that mean that we throw away every value system that was built into the international organisations? If the most powerful only work for themselves, is it every person for themselves?View image in fullscreenRory Stewart.Photograph: Christopher Owens/The GuardianYNHYou see a re-emergence, in a strange way, of monarchist ideas: the leaders that are rising now are quite different from the 20th-century dictators. It’s not a coincidence that, in the US, one of the movements against Donald Trump is “No Kings”, because he is reviving something really medieval. One of the most amazing moments of the last year was the meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy in the White House. One of the things that emerged very clearly was that Trump does not think about politics as being an interaction between states or between people, in the sense of the American people, the Russian people, the Ukrainian people. He thinks about it as an interaction between persons, monarchs, dynasties. When people told him that Putin had broken previous agreements, Trump said, “Well, he broke an agreement with Biden, he broke an agreement with Obama, not with me.” And the implication is, the agreement is not between Russia and the US, the agreement is between two people, and if I make an agreement with Putin, I will make sure he sticks by it, but it only holds as long as I’m president. If you then replace me with someone else, that’s the end of the agreement. You see the return of the concept of politics as a dynastic affair between families. This is a bit crazy, but not too crazy, to think, for instance, of a solution to the Ukraine war where Barron Trump would marry Putin’s granddaughter, and they would get Crimea and Donbas as their kingdom.If you want the truth, and you want reality to win, each of us has to do some of the hard work ourselvesYuval Noah HarariLet me just say one more thing about this monarchical idea: in the 20th century, dictators served an ideology which, in a way, limited them, because if you’re, say, a communist dictator, you have to promote a communist ideology. You can’t really do what you want. With the new leaders like Trump, there is no ideology there. When you look at somebody like Trump or like Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, the amazing thing is how much freedom of action these people have.RSOne thing that is so striking about the modern age is that we’ve lost an ethical vocabulary in engaging with leaders. I mean, fundamentally, what is Donald Trump? He is shameless. It would be very difficult for Aristotle or Cicero or a Renaissance theorist of politics, or indeed the writers of the American constitution, to imagine this degree of shamelessness, this degree of contempt for constitutions, contempt for minorities, contempt for the truth, the open performance of immorality. And very difficult also to imagine that we would have entered a world where we, at some level, are so tempted to just enjoy the spectacle, and have just lost the ability to be shocked that every day he does three or four things which in the old world would have shocked us to our core.MRWith Zelenskyy at the White House, it was shocking that the breaking news reporters just kept repeating what President Trump said, which was a lie. They could instead have used what is known as a truth sandwich: “Russia invaded Ukraine, President Trump says this, Russia invaded Ukraine.” In journalism, we have to shift: we can no longer stand behind “he said, she said”. Now we actually have to pull up and say, “This guy is lying.” Because those are the facts. So our reporting shifts. On the technology, we cannot live under surveillance for profit, we cannot keep getting manipulated in this way, because it encourages the worst of who we are. [At Rappler] we began to build a chat app two years ago. Our vision is for a global information ecosystem, but we anchor our news organisations with our communities. So this is how we move forward: we embrace the technology. We call it out where it is wrong. We look back at our history, and regardless of all of the problems of democracies, we still haven’t found a better system than this. Of course, it could all end soon, but we keep fighting.YNHI think that more people need to realise that we have to do the hard work ourselves. There is a tendency to assume that we can rely on reality to do the job for us. That if there are people who talk nonsense, who support illogical policies, who ignore the facts, sooner or later, reality will wreak vengeance on them. And this is not the way that history works.So if you want the truth, and you want reality to win, each of us has to do some of the hard work ourselves: choose one thing and focus on that and hope that other people will also do their share. That way we avoid the extremes of despair.Explore more on these topicsBooksPhilosophy booksPolitics booksSociety booksClimate crisisSocial mediaYuval Noah HararifeaturesShareReuse this content"

How they achieve that varies: the largest, such as tether and USD Coin, are effectively banks. They hold large reserves in cash, liquid assets, and other investments, and simply use those reserves to maintain a stable price.Others, known as \"algorithmic stablecoins\", attempt to do the same thing but without any reserves. They have been criticised as effectively being backed by Ponzi schemes, since they require continuous inflows of cash to ensure they don't collapse.Stablecoins are an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They provide a safer place for investors to store capital without going through the hassle of cashing out entirely, and allow assets to be denominated in conventional currency, rather than other extremely volatile tokens.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.So, like it or not, many and varied digital currencies are coming, bamboozling all but a minority of the population with impenetrable jargon and an impossibly long list of options.As with all financial services, the urge to prey on customers’ fear and greed is irresistible when it means the provider can get its hands on someone’s savings and turn it into something more exciting, more profitable, and with the risk of default passed back to the customer (sorry, you’ve lost all your money) or the taxpayer (sorry, my bank is bust, can you bail it out).A government that backed a central bank digital currency (CBDC) would be justifiably saying to the finance industry, we need to control this thing because we are on the hook when it goes wrong.The argument in favour of privatisation rests on the moral hazard created by an explicit promise by the public sector to bail out the losers. Much better to keep up the pretence that financial services companies, when caught in a collective tailspin, will be allowed to crash.Rachel Reeves is one of many who want to go down the private route, attracting more and bigger finance companies to the UK.There could be some immediate and practical benefits. Costs will also be lower, we are told, because without a bank standing in between the customer and the seller, charges on credit transactions could fall from 1.5%-3% towards 0.1%. Weekend payments would not have to wait until Monday to be reconciled.Donald Trump is the architect of the most extreme version of private digital money.A well-known crypto currency supporter, he has also pushed for a financial services regime that supports dollar-backed stablecoins.Congress has yet to fill in the vast gaps in the Genius Act, which was passed in the summer with bi-partisan backing, so it is difficult to know exactly how risky US stablecoins will be.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Such a move, in contrast with China’s newly-minted, state-run stablecoin, tells us that the US will truly be the wild west of the world’s digital currencies.As the economics professor and Nobel prize winner Simon Johnson told the Guardian: “We have been here before. I couldn’t tell you when the [stablecoin] crash will come or how severe it will be, but you know it’s coming.”Health warning: Nigel Farage would favour the Trumpian free-for-all.For the UK, following mainland Europe was an option. It has already committed itself to a CBDC and has nine European banks in a consortium lining up a stablecoin for launch next year.While the UK has rejected the US model, it must be legitimate to fear the knock-on effects from Trump’s recklessness when so many US banks have outposts in London, along with many of the world’s shadiest financial firms.In 2021, when former deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe kicked off the stablecoin debate in a series of speeches, the message was clear: however tight the regulation, it would be too cumbersome and too slow to prevent risky behaviour from quickly becoming a systemic problem and even a full-blown banking crisis.At the time, it looked like the UK and the EU would move in lockstep. In the years since, London’s stance has moved westwards, to a mid-Atlantic spot that is supposed to capture the safety Brussels seeks with the competitive spirit that underpins the US model.Maybe the UK central bank is clever enough to develop a system both safe and competitive. It’s a tall order.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesOpinionBitcoinInternetBank of EnglandFinancial sectorAndrew BaileyDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

And every nine minutes that ‘someone’ is a child, according to statistics collated by the anti-sexual violence non-profit Rainn.Instead of sendingallegedsex offenders to court, the Trump administration seems moreinterestedin putting them inpositions of power. Less than 4% of reported rapes, sexual assaults and child sexual abuse allegations in certain cities across the country ever lead to a sex crime conviction,an NBC News investigationfrom earlier this year found. To reiterate: that’sreportedassaults. Bysome counts, nearly 80% of rapes and sexual assaults go unreported.Don’t be too hard on the justice system, though. After all, police and prosecutors have got far more important things to think about than rapists. Namely: locking up pregnant women. According tonew researchby Pregnancy Justice, prosecutors in 16 states charged 412 people with pregnancy-related crimes in the first two years after the US supreme court overturnedRoe v Wade.What, you may be wondering, is a pregnancy-related crime? Good question! Most of the cases included in the new report involved low-income women and allegations of substance use during pregnancy. In one casedescribed to the Guardian, a woman was arrested for felony child neglect after giving birth when a drug test came back positive for marijuana. The woman in that case had a medical marijuana card. While substance use during pregnancy is obviously a serious issue that can result in long-term harm to the baby, researchsuggeststhat criminalization actuallyworsenshealth outcomes.Hundreds of US women charged with pregnancy-related crimes since fall of RoeRead moreWhat is most worrying about this post-Roe trend of “pregnancy-related crimes”, however, is that the laws used in most of these prosecutions are meant to protect children rather than fetuses. What we are seeing here is a growing acceptance of the idea of “fetal personhood”, which grants fetuses and embryos the full rights of a legal person. According to Pregnancy Justice, at least 24 states include language around “fetal rights” in laws regulating orprohibiting abortion care.You can see where this is going, right? We’re headed towards the increased surveillance of pregnant people and the criminalization of any behaviour the Trump administration might unilaterally consider “dangerous”. TakingTylenolduring pregnancy, for example. “What our work has proven is that, unfortunately, anything is possible when it comes to policing pregnancy,” a spokesperson from Pregnancy Justice said.For a terrifying glimpse of America’s future, look to El Salvador, which an increasing number of expertsare warningcould serve as a model for the US. Ever since 1998, there has been a total abortion ban in El Salvador, even when the life of the mother is at risk. Pregnancy is aggressively policed and there is whatAmnesty Internationalhas termed a “guilty until proven innocent” approach when it comes to women who suffer pregnancy-related complications. Although having a miscarriage or a stillbirth is not technically illegal, a recent investigation by the journalistMaria Hinojosafound El Salvadorian prisons are full of women who lost their babies. One woman who was incarcerated for a miscarriage told Hinojosa that she estimates “90% of the women who are in prison in El Salvador are in prison for this”. While that’s obviously an observation rather than hard data, it’s still frightening.Donald Trump has made his admiration for El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, the self-described “coolest dictator in the world”, and his repressive regimevery clear. Increasingly, the two countries seem to be in lockstep. While there’s been a global trend towards liberalizing abortion laws, for example,only four countrieshave bucked this trend and rolled backabortion rights in the past 25 years: the US, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Poland. The arc of the moral universe, as we all know, is long. But in an increasingly authoritarian and misogynistic US, it does not seem to be bending anywhere near justice.Spain seeks to make abortion a constitutional rightOn Friday Spain’s leftist governmentsaid it was planningon following France’s lead and making abortion rights constitutional. “With this government, there will be no backtracking on social rights,” Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on X.Conservatives rush to explain how being pro-death penalty is pro-life“Someone who says I’m against abortion but is in favor of the death penalty is not really pro-life,” Chicago-born Pope Leo XIVsaid this week. “And someone who says I’m against abortion but I’m in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States, I don’t know if that’s pro-life.” The rightwing political commentator Matt Walsh immediately rushed to explain that, actually, the pope’s argument is “moral madness” and the “death penalty is pro-life”. So many mental gymnastics going on there, he deserves a medal.Megachurch pastor pleads guilty to child sexual abuseRobert Morris, who joined the White House spiritual advisory committee during the first Trump presidency,pleaded guiltyto sexually abusing a 12-year-old girl in Oklahoma in the 1980s.Women dominate the World Cheese CompetitionFinally, some gouda news: the Philadelphia cheesemonger Emilia D’Albero and teammate Courtney Johnson recently won first place at theMondial du Fromagein France, a competition sometimes known as the “Cheesemonger Olympics”. “My teammate … and I are the first all-female team USA,” D’Albero said. “They had never sent two girls before.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ever since the birth of this nation, its citizens and leaders haveechoed Benjamin Franklin’s admonitionthat “we must all hang together, or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.”InDonald Trump’s America, hanging separately seems to be the order of the day. This seems especially true when it comes to his treatment of this country’s millions of non-citizen residents.From the start of his political career, demonizing immigrantshas been Trump’s stock in trade. Since his return to office, he hasbeen unusually aggressivein his campaign to round up, detain and deport people whose citizenship status is questionable, and, in some cases, citizens have been caught up in the dragnet.The administration has repeatedly violated the constitution bytargetingpeople because of how they look or the sound of their accents. It has even singled them out because of what they have said or written.James Comey’s real ‘crime’? Daring to put the law before loyalty to Trump | Lawrence DouglasRead moreOn 30 September, Judge William Young of the United States district court of Massachusettsmade clearthat when it comes to freedom of speech, the constitutiondoes not distinguishbetween people born in the United States and those who have come here as immigrants. His decision in American Association of University Professors v Rubio offers both a stirring civics lesson and an unusually personal rebuke against the Trump administration. The court found that the Trump administration had violated the right to free speech in its push to detain and deport pro-Palestinian foreign scholars.In his opinion, the judge went beyond the usual bounds of a judicial decision to note that the president “ignores everything … The Constitution, our civil laws, regulations, mores, customs, practices, courtesies – all of it; the President simply ignores it all when he takes it into his head to act”. Young added: “While the President naturally seeks warm cheering and gladsome, welcoming acceptance of his views, in the real world he’ll settle for sullen silence and obedience. What he will not countenance is dissent or disagreement.”The judge also accused the president of “bullying”.Legal purists who might applaud the judge’s reading of the constitution will be offended by seeing that kind of language in a judicial opinion. But what he did helps frame the danger Trump poses to the rights of immigrants in a way that connects them to the rest of us.Bravo, Judge Young.Recallthe case of Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder and graduate of Columbia University. He was arrested anddetainedin March for participating in pro-Palestinian protests on the Columbia University campus. Hewas heldfor more than a hundred days in Louisiana.As his lawyersaidon Democracy Now: “If free speech means anything in this country,” he noted, it means “government agents can’t pick you up off the street and throw you into jail because of what you’ve said.” But that is exactly what the administration did, hoping to make an example out of Khalil and send a chilling message to other immigrants.Or how about Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University graduate student,arrested by masked Ice agentsforwriting an op-edcalling on Tufts to do something to protect human rights in Gaza? As a Washington Post storynotes, “Ozturk had committed no crime, yet her detention was a priority for the new Trump administration. US officials used the immigration system in unprecedented ways to covertly research and detain noncitizen students, relying on an investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security whose work traditionally has focused on crimes such as drug smuggling and human trafficking.”“The effort to deport pro-Palestinian student activists,” the Post reports, “represented the Trump administration’s first major challenge to free-speech norms in the United States.” It had to know that what it was doing violated the First Amendment but went ahead anyway under the pretext that it was acting to prevent or punish terrorist activities.This is not the first time that immigrantshave been punishedfor saying or doing things that an administration labelled dangerous. But since the middle of the 20th century, the supreme courthas heldthat the government cannot deport people because of their views or what they say.At that time, Justice William Douglas explained that “freedom of speech and of the press is accorded aliens residing in this country” and that “the utterances made by … [them] were entitled to that protection”. Justice Frank Murphy joined him and stated: “Once an alien lawfully enters and resides in this country he becomes invested with the rights guaranteed by the Constitution to all people within our borders.”Young cited those views in his own opinion. “Noncitizens’ speech rights are,”he said, “identical to those of citizens.” He argued: “Political speech is not, on its own, a facially legitimate reason for expelling persons from this country.”After laying out in great detail all the things the Trump administration has done to violate that principle, including its mistreatment of Khalil and Öztürk, he called out Trump for ignoring the constitution and acting as if “the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech applies to American citizens alone”.Young called the case he was deciding “perhaps the most important ever to fall within the jurisdiction of this district court”.Citing the language of the first amendment – “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech” – the judge insisted: “‘No law’ means ‘no law.’ The First Amendment does not draw President Trump’s invidious distinction” between citizens and non-citizens, “and it is not to be found in our history”, Young wrote.That reference to “our history” suggests that Trump’s treatment of non-citizens is un-American. But Young was not finished.He added: “Triumphalism is the very essence of the Trump brand. Often this is naught but hollow bragging: ‘my perfect administration,’ wearing a red baseball cap in the presidential oval office emblazoned ‘Trump Was Right About Everything,’ or most recently depicting himself as an officer in the First Cavalry Division.”The US government is facing a crisis of legitimacy | Daniel MendiolaRead moreHe criticized Trump for his “triumphal, transactional, imperative, bellicose, and coarse” language that “seeks to persuade – not through marshaling data driven evidence, science, or moral suasion, but through power”.Near the end of his opinion, Young quotes former president Ronald Reagan. “Freedom,” Reagan said, “is a fragile thing and it’s never more than one generation away from extinction. It is not ours by way of inheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation, for it comes only once to a people …”Returning to Trump, the judge goes on to say: “I’ve come to believe that President Trump truly understands and appreciates the full import of President Reagan’s inspiring message – yet I fear he has drawn from it a darker, more cynical message … [and that he] believes the American people are so divided that today they will not stand up, fight for, and defend our most precious constitutional values so long as they are lulled into thinking their own personal interests are not affected.”By going beyond the precise issue in this case, the free speech rights of immigrants, and going after Trump, Young’s opinion helps frame threats to the rights of immigrants in a way that connects them to the rest of us. He hopes to rekindle the spirit of Reagan and inspire Americans to prove Trump wrong by showing that they will “stand up, fight for, and defend our most precious constitutional values”.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsUS constitution and civil libertiesOpinionUS immigrationDonald TrumpLaw (US)US politicsUS justice systemTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Everyone, everywhere, should be thrilled by this decision.What Anthony Rotondo did by uploading these images was perpetrate “image-based abuse” against his victims. It’s a wanton, wilful act of cruelty intended to harm and humiliate its targets, and it is against Australian law.The case against Rotondo was initially brought by Australia’s online regulator, the eSafety commissioner, two years ago.Before any brain-rotted internet apologist decides to leap in with the usual excuses for boys being boys, mistakes being made and girls being fair game, please note: when eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, issued a removal notice for the content, Rotondo claimed it meant nothing to him, and told her to get a warrant.When a court subsequently did order Rotondo to remove the images and not to share them, his response was to email them to 50 addresses, including to Inman Grant herself.The capacity for nastiness will ever flow and spread in poorly regulated spaces.Yes, AI is getting scarier. So why do I need that loveless machine to tell me everything will be all right? | Van BadhamRead moreSo it’s a relief that the court heeded the regulator’s recommendation that a significant penalty be imposed on Rotondo to practically – and culturally – discourage foul dickhead behaviour before it metastasises into something far worse than mere problematic scale.Social normalisation.I wrote inJune last yearof the shameful incident at Bacchus Marsh grammar school in which a teenage boy was arrested, and released with a caution, after 50 female students discovereddeepfake pornographic images of themselves. A parent who happened to see the material threw up when she did.Australians were so horrified, anti-deepfake legislation enjoyed bipartisan support and a speedy passage through the parliament.In the wake of the hefty fine on Rotondo, let’s pop corks. Let’s throw confetti. In an internet-dominated world where vain techlords rule us by whim, sovereign governments seem reduced to the role of rearguard guerrillas.This enforcement of law in Australia feels like the escape from Mos Eisley, if not yet the successful attack on the Death Star. Chalk up two skirmishes won by the local rebels, given Australia’s hugely popular ban on social media for children is also reminding governments that they might, actually, be able to spring Leia from Vader’s clutches if they try.European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen,praised the banafter Albanese’s recent speech about it at the UN. “Inspired by Australia’s example,” she said “we in Europe are watching and will be learning from you.”Could courage be contagious? Let’s hope so, because in the absence of powerful regulation, the online normalisation of awful blooms like candida that itches as it cripples, and becomes increasingly difficult to shift.Dare I remind everyone there was a time when trolls lived only in folktales, lies did not travel the worldsix times as fast as the truth, and “skibidi” was not a word, let alone a neat explanation for why peoplethrow dildos at basketballers?Every day, the news presents organised humanity with digital challenges we can ignore and let hurt us or apply the cream now to do something about.This week alone, a “talent studio” advised it was taking bookings foran AI-created human-styled moving imagemade from the stolen parts of working actors. The US actors’ union, Sag-Aftra, is enraged; unlicensed, composite cartoon “Tilly Norwood” solves no talent problems, but creates them “using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardising performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry”.Then Harvard research revealed that while the use of AI tools has been rushed into workplaces to drive productivity, it doesn’t: 95% of businesses see no measurable return for the low-quality “workslop” replacing human jobs and activity.Oh, and I discovered there were whole YouTube channels dedicated toAI-created videos depicting pretty girls murdered violently, until YouTube recently removed them.The deeply troubling world of deepfakes – podcastRead moreI watched the US president publish an AI-made video seemingly claimingmagical bedsfrom QAnon fairy stories were soon to be available to Americans (soon deleted). Then came some AI-generated, offensively-sombrero-themed propaganda denigrating a political opponent – and it’s still there.Trumps’ political bete noire, Democrat Gavin Newsom, responded with an AI-generated depiction of Trump’s VP, JD Vance, in his “Garbage Pail” memetic iteration making sexual allusions to aChesterfield couch. Newsom’s response is simultaneously ugly, disillusioning and strategically appropriate to the new demands of political battle online.But legislators don’t need to know an edgelord from a smol bean to bring the excrescence of tech under control.Nathaniel Lubin from policy operation the Better Internet Initiative uses the metaphor of early water sanitation for the potential regulation of tech. British engineers had no knowledge of germ theory when they switched off the water source of a cholera epidemic. They just solved the problem in front of them and worked out the detailsfrom there.The punishment of deepfakers, growing regulatory appetites andDenmark imposing copyright protection over people’s imagesare laudable efforts and should be loudly encouraged, especially given the AustralianProductivity Commission’s shamefully naive recommendation the governmentallow data mining exemptionsfor tech companies to train AI models.Advocates of internet regulation, restriction, bans and penalties are persistently demonised as “nanny-staters”. Yep, I love babies, the state should protect them, guilty as charged, bring it on.There’s a reason nannies exist, fellas.

We need you to stand with usDave RichThere’ll be sympathy and heightened security, but in the 1960s when Jewish communities faced attack, there was also solidarity. We need that backSat 4 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Oct 2025 08.33 EDTShareYom Kippur isthe holiest dayin the Jewish year, a day of repentance, prayer, fasting; and now – for two Jewish families in Manchester – also a day of mourning. It is also, increasingly, a day when terrorists visit their local synagogue to murder the Jews inside.Six years ago, that terrorist was Stephan Balliet,a German neo-Nazi, and the synagogue was in Halle, Germany. Yesterday it wasJihad Al-Shamie, at the Heaton Park Synagogue in Manchester. Both attacks left two people dead; both were thwarted from further atrocities by the simple act of closing the front door.Anti-Jewish terrorism has been around for a very long time. In the early 1960s an arson campaign by theNational Socialist Movementhit 34 synagogues, schools and other Jewish buildings across London, one of which resulted in the death of a 19-year-old student (although no charges were ever brought for his murder). In the late 1960s Palestinian nationalist terrorism arrived from the Middle East, bringing a wave of bombings and shootings that continued into the 1990s. Since then, the baton of anti-Jewish terrorism has been taken up by Jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda and Isis and the state terror of Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah. And more recently, the social media-driven phenomenon of individual terrorists – not trained or directed by any group but produced and encouraged by online subcultures of hatred and extremism – comes in neo-Nazi, jihadist and extreme leftwing varieties. And they all have one thing in common: they target Jews.This is why synagogues have reinforced doors and windows, cameras, gates and guards. It is why Jewish primary schoolchildren practise active shooter drills. And it is why Jewish communities across the worldspend millions of pounds every yearsimply for the basic right of being Jewish without getting killed.The impact this has had on Jewish life is both extraordinary and banal. Visit any Jewish community building, anywhere in the world, and you are likely to have to pass through an eye-popping level of security. This is not the result of paranoia but a reaction to reality. Most Jews take it for granted, a normal part of what is required to live a free and safe Jewish life. But it shouldn’t be normal at all.This all long predates the rise in global antisemitism since the 7 October attacks, but there is no doubt this threat to Jews has become much more acute since then. British Jews have watched in horror as our fellow Jews wereshot in the US,stabbed in France,murdered in the UAE. There have been more than 150 terrorist attacks, plots and acts of extreme violence targeting Jewish communities in more than 40 countries during the past two years. Synagogues have been burnt on five continents: no other hatred operates in such a synchronised global fashion. That it took so long to happen here has more to do with the efforts of counter-terrorist police and the security services than any lack of would-be terrorists.This wave of anti-Jewish violence sits atop an ocean of incitement and hatred, none of which is new, much of which currently swirls around the topics of Israel and Gaza. People turn to government and police to tackle this phenomenon, and understandably so. There is likely to be much more policing for Jewish communities, more investment in security equipment and guards, more effort to extend the security blanket that is already wrapped tightly around Jewish life in this country. This will be expected and welcomed by many British Jews, but it only addresses the symptoms of this problem. It cannot tackle the cause.Here, there are difficult questions for everyone else. Antisemitism has been allowed to rise in an unacceptable way for far too long. Last year’s official hate-crime statistics showed that a Jewish person in Britain was12 times more likely to be the victim of a religious hate crimethan someone from any other faith background. Calls for violence against Jews, or Israelis, or Zionists, online and on our streets, have become normalised in parts of our politics. And the stark truth is that, while the hard protection provided by government funding and police deployments is ideologically agnostic – a locked door can stop a jihadist terrorist just as easily as a neo-Nazi – the same cannot be said for civil society. When Jews are attacked by the far right, solidarity and sympathy flows easily from the anti-racist ecosystem that exists to protest and campaign against prejudice and hatred. But when Jews are murdered by jihadists? Not so much.There are plenty of reasons for this, but they all amount to the reality that large swathes of the anti-racist movement that stood alongside Jews when they faced neo-Nazis in the 1960s abandoned Britain’s Jewish community a generation ago. The instinctive support that progressives show for other minorities, the sense that they are naturally on their side, has evaporated when it comes to Jews. This has to change.

They were wrong about her; they could also be about StarmerSat 4 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Oct 2025 11.45 EDTShareParty conference time is when British politics goes berserk. Leaders soar and crash in a morass of cliches. Polls go mad and cataclysm always delivers the best copy.Thus, back in 1981, Margaret Thatcher was at her Blackpool conference, two years into office.Brixton was rioting,inflation was 11%and the Tories werepolling at 23%. The Labour opposition was faring as badly, also at 23%. Meanwhile, a third force, the Social Democratic party (SDP), in alliance with the Liberals, wasrunning at more than 50%and dominating the news.Conference talk that year was unanimous. Thatcher would be gone by Christmas. Her conference speech was awful, receiving the “shortest standing ovation” any leader had received for years,according to Charles Moore’s biography. Rivals roamed fringe meetings, publicly manoeuvring for her job. The Guardian’s Peter Jenkinswrote that “a brief political obituary of Thatcherism [was] now in order”. All bets were on the SDP leader Roy Jenkins becoming prime minister – and soon.Whenever I recall 1981, I wonder how commentators got it so wrong. The answer: hysteria. Conferences are when the Westminster club steps down to flirt with the mob and usually loses its way. That year, Blackpool’s vipers’ nest was so vicious it seemed as if Thatcher could not dare return to Downing Street. Yet, she not only returned, but by the time of the Falklands war the following spring, she was on her way to total command of her party and to two more election victories.Labour just doesn’t get it: workers feel poorer than ever. Is it any wonder Reform is rising? | Sharon GrahamRead moreThe chief difference between today and 1981 is the relative weakness of Reform. Its poll share of27% in the most recent YouGov pollis only half that of the SDP in 1981. The peculiarities of first past the post can be shown to give Reform a majority, but the slightest shift in other party support could put its majority far out of reach.What matters in both cases is the performance of a divided opposition. In 1981, Thatcher felt she could relax electorally as long asLabourwas split down the middle. The SDP went briefly wild but, like Reform, it did not establish a substantive hierarchy or presence. It dwindled in the polls before a general election could test its electoral strength. All it did was stop Labour under Michael Foot from making headway. Thatcher’s Tories were also split, but the division was internal, between “wets” and “dries”. Thatcher shrewdly kept them in balance.So long as the Tory party does not shut up shop, and so long as Reform sticks around, there is no reason why Keir Starmer should not recover to win again in 2029. His relentless bigging up of Reform and its leader,Nigel Farage, is tactically astute. What he has to do over the next two years is ensure that Reform’s support stays more of a threat to the Tories than to Labour. But it must not so devastate the Tories as to lead them to get rid of Kemi Badenoch. She is Keir Starmer’s Michael Foot, and he needs her badly to stay in place.View image in fullscreenMargaret Thatcher acknowledges the audience at the end of her conference speech, Blackpool, 16 October 1981.Photograph: Bill Cross/Daily Mail/Rex FIf history is any guide, Reform is a classic third party. It is internally chaotic and shows no sign of maturing into a lasting electoral force. But it is unlikely to fade sufficiently to allow the Tory party a repaired Commons majority. The Tories’ best hope is that theGreens under Zack Polanskido well enough to seriously split the left-of-centre vote – at which point all bets on a winner are off.Every pundit with whom I discuss 1981 dismisses it as “past history” and says that “things are now different”. The day of populism is at hand. Voters are fluid. Reform is the new politics. I can only conclude that Armageddon has the best tunes, and never more so than at conference time.Starmer’s past year has seemed like one long Downing Street apprenticeship. Every past prime minister reflects on how they wish they could have their first year over again. Starmer had everything going for him, not least one of the biggest Commons majorities in modern times. At least for two years, he could be doing almost anything.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He reshuffles his cabinet. He changes his mind on winter fuel payments, benefits, Angela Rayner and Peter Mandelson. He infuriates small businesses, farmers and non-doms for trivial sums of money. He claims to want more houses, yet he leaves it to the property market to choose where to put them.Meanwhile, Britain is stuck in the mire of “small boats”, to which there is only one remotely plausible answer – win French collaboration. That involves Britain seeking to join the EU initiative to stem the migrant flow out of Asia and Africa. It means embarking on a serious reversal of Brexit. The bravest thing Starmer could do to curb migration and boost his growth agenda is to read the polls telling him that is what people want. Yet he does not dare.As for Reform, I stick to 1981. It will be polling below 25% by the end of next year and Starmer will be in Downing Street for the duration. And conference time will still be pandemonium.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabour conference 2025OpinionKeir StarmerLabourReform UKNigel FarageConservativesMargaret ThatchercommentShareReuse this content"

A better and more compassionate route is possibleSat 4 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Oct 2025 07.05 EDTShareJust 24 hours after he described providing asylum as the “mark of a decent, compassionate country”,Keir Starmersaid the UK had been too “generous” towards refugees, and announced a plan to end what he described as the asylum “golden ticket,” which allows people to resettle their families in Britain. For a refugee who has pulled the body of their child from the rubble of their bombed-out home, or made a perilous journey alone as a young adult having lost their family, it certainly doesn’t feel this way.The government believes that to deter refugees from crossing the Channel in small boats, it must restrict their ability to reunite in Britain with their immediate family. It must also make it impossible for them to achieve settled status if they have ever claimed benefits or received a criminal record.Labour may think that appearing tough on asylum seekers will win plaudits with those who might otherwise vote Reform. But to combat the rise of Reform, the government needs to do two things. It needs to demonstrate competence on controlling Britain’s borders at the same time as upholding British values of fairness, decency and compassion. This latest asylum announcement signals failure on both fronts.The idea of restricting refugees’ rights to deter small boat crossings is not new.The previous Conservative government did exactly this; it had no real impact on small boat crossings. This is hardly surprising. After all,refugees don’t follow developments in immigration policy. They don’t study the nuances in the family reunion policies of different European countries when deciding where to head.Asmall proportion of refugees in Europe come to the UK. Those that do come here do so because they have existing links with the UK. They may already have family here, or know of long-standing diaspora communities, or have linguistic and cultural links from the Commonwealth. Changing rules that nobody knows about will not change their decision-making.The government is grasping at failed policies. This is concerning to say the least. There are ways to reduce the number of people risking their lives in the Channel: the “one in, one out” deal with France could be a step in the right direction if it’s implemented with the right safeguards and protections. The government should be focusing on getting this right while considering other legal routes, instead of policies that will only lead to more broken promises and push ever more exasperated voters closer towards Reform.Reducing boat crossings is complex. It will take time. In the meantime, there are meaningful ways that the government can demonstrate competence and control immediately. The key is closing the hotels, which are the most visible symbol of a broken system. TheRefugee Council has published a proposalshowing how the government could end hotel use within a year by introducing a one-off scheme to give people from countries where they are almost certain to be recognised as refugees permission to stay for a limited period, subject to rigorous security checks.Closing hotels and scaling up the deal with the French in a way that respects the rights of asylum seekers and treats them with dignity could have a significant impact. It could also restore public confidence. But taking away the right to be reunited with family members and erecting numerous barriers to settlement simply vilifies refugees. Under the government’s plans, a widowed refugee would be prevented from ever becoming a British citizen, for which settled status is a prerequisite, because it is almost certain that she will not have immediately found a job that would allow her to rent a home without receiving a top-up of housing benefit.It doesn’t matter if that woman works two jobs, attends evening classes, studies for a degree and raises British children who become hard-working, tax-paying members of society. It will never be enough. She will never be considered permanent. She will never be able to become a proud British citizen. This is not decent or fair. It does not reward hard work or entrepreneurialism. It is punitive, and it smacks of a desperate attempt to counter Reform.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As with anything that makes me think of my mad little cat, Mackerel, they were a cocktail of guilt, bafflement and love.Let’s start with guilt. The charity Cats Protection has warned against the use of harnesses – as in, leads – because of how they cause cats undue stress by suppressing their flight response and making them feel trapped. I did not know this when I bought a harness for Mackerel, though I worked it out soon enough by her reaction, which was to play dead the second you put her in it. Now, I didn’t buy a harness without reservations, although rather shallowly it was my personal image that ultimately caused me to ditch it. Here is what I wrote in 2020 (from my book The Year of the Cat, which was all about how I adopted Mackerel during an intense period ofmaternal broodinessand pandemic-induced isolation):“Sometimes I see myself from the outside: a childless, thirtysomething freelancer with a cat on a lead that won’t cooperate, and I can’t help but note that this is not how I pictured my life turning out.”They have a way of humbling you, cats, although admittedly Mackerel has always been an oddball. She drinks coffee, for instance, and once watched the whole of Saltburn (about the appropriate target-audience level for that film, in my opinion). But let’s not get sidetracked. The reason I felt bafflement when I read about the one in six cat owners using harnesses is because it made me wonder: just who are all these cooperative, compliant cats that obediently trot down the pavement alongside their humans? I see them on the streets sometimes and always shake my head in disbelief. It’s the same feeling I have whenever I see a photo of a cat wearing a silly little costume: namely, how does its person still have their eyeballs?In my case, it’s really not an unreasonable question. When my son was still a baby, I had to go to Moorfields eye hospital because Mackerel had scratched my sclera while I was trying to nap. She had seen my rare moment of repose as an opportunity to hunt my flickering eyelid. Considering what she’s capable of when I am lying down, one can only imagine her reaction if you tried todress her up as the pope. So, I have long accepted my lack of dominion over her.Much likeCatsProtection, I do have strong opinions about the rights of cats to self-determination. Raised in the countryside, I used to be strongly opposed to even the concept of an indoor cat, let alone the ridiculous idea of a cat on a lead. It seemed to me that it went against nature. Then I met Mackerel, who – after a too-early separation from her mother and an alarming visit to a vet for spaying whereupon he discovered that she didn’t actually have a uterus – simply refused to go outside. This despite being given ample opportunity. The lead was our attempt to acclimatise her to the great outdoors. Almost six years later, she is yet to cross the threshold of her own volition.These days, for that reason, I try hard not to judge other cat people. Cat people love to judge one another, perhaps even more than parents do. More and more humans seem to be treating their pets as if they are their actual offspring (not helped by the vets who call you “Mum” and, hilariously, insist on giving them your surname). On a few occasions when out and about I have stared into a bassinet expecting to see a baby only to find, with a start, a cat or a small dog staring back. Worse, the other day my husband and I were crossing the road and he gestured towards a bloke wearing one of those infant carriers. “What a hideous baby!” he said. I was about to rebuke him when I looked closer and saw that the sling contained not a baby, but a small ginger cat.I am as guilty as anyone of treating my cat as a surrogate child. Yet I do wonder if, just as children have less freedom than they used to, the same is becoming true of some cats. A part of me was relieved when Mackerel decided to be an indoor cat. The hazards facing cats – traffic, foxes, thieves, XL bullies, poison – haven’t changed, but perhaps our protectiveness has. Humans want to keep their precious “fur babies” safe. To lose a cat is, after all, real grief.Nevertheless, as the saying goes, when you love something, you have to set it free. Even against your better judgment, it’s easier said than done. God knows, I’ve bloody tried.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My prang highlights the neoliberal folly of false economiesSat 4 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 4 Oct 2025 09.40 EDTShareIwas lucky. Last week, I was cycling downhill when I hit a pothole. The front wheel folded into an infinity symbol. I went over the handlebars and, with no time to put my hands out, landed on my face. My helmet and glasses took most of the impact. I emerged, remarkably, with just a few cuts and bruises.My glasses were banjaxed, my bike needed major repairs and my clothes were torn. Altogether, that pothole has cost me about £450. Again, I’m lucky – I can afford it. But the point is this: fixing apotholecosts us between£45 and £90. Not fixing it costs us far more. God knows how many other people have pranged their bikes or wrecked their car tyres in the same hole. Between us, we may have paid hundreds of times the cost of its repair. If people have suffered significant injuries, so must the NHS. One of my correspondents tells me: “I’m three months into recovery from a cycling accident with a pothole that left me being airlifted to hospital with potentially life-threatening injuries. As well as a brain haemorrhage (despite a helmet), I had numerous broken bones and can’t yet walk without crutches.” The cost to the health service must be huge; the cost to him incalculable.Austerity – which leaves our potholes, alongside many other gaps in public provision, unfilled – does not save money. On the contrary, it costs us a fortune. What the rich might save in taxes, the rest must pay over and over again.False economies abound. For example, the government may at last be persuaded to remove the Tories’ vicious, Malthusiantwo-child benefit cap. But what many people have failed to grasp is that behind it stands another brick wall: thehousehold benefits cap. If families now receive money for a third child, it could push them past the household limit, and they’ll be scarcely better off than before. This household cap has extreme and perverse consequences. It ensures that rents, even in the social sector, are almost everywhere unaffordable to thefamilies affected, most of which are headed by lone parents. The result is that they are thrown into temporary accommodation, which local authorities must provide at far greater expense: roughly£2.3bn a year. Being forced into temporary accommodation also curtails adults’ employment opportunities and children’s performance at school, and generates great suffering, which can translate into physical and mental health problems, which of course means further economic impacts.In 2019, aparliamentary committeecalled on the government to “conduct a full cost benefit analysis of the benefit cap”. The governmentrejectedthe call, but said it would explore the possibility in future. I checked with the Department for Work and Pensions – it still hasn’t happened.Keeping people in poverty is an expensive luxury. Poverty persists in rich countries because governments have made a political choice to keep people poor. This choice is driven by two imperatives. The first is a deep, ancient andirrational beliefthat poverty is a vice that must be punished. The second is the bosses’ need to keep us in a state of fear, so that people continue to perform stressful and demeaning work for lousy pay.Or take adult social care. Around 2 million elderly people arenot receivingthe care they need. Many younger adults who could work if they had sufficient care are unable to do so. Some 2.6 million people, mostly women, havegiven up paid workto care for family members, as there are no good alternatives. They lose anaverageof £5,800 in annual earnings, a vast aggregate cost to the country.Insufficient care drives many people into the arms of the NHS: at any one time, 13% of NHS beds are occupied by people waiting forsocial care support. Proper funding would provide a major economic boost, as good care requires a large workforce. According to theFuture Social Care Coalition,for every £1 invested in social care work, £1.75 is generated in the wider economy. But, as aparliamentary inquiryfound, evidence of the costs of failing to provide sufficient care “is scandalously scant or even absent from decision making”. The government counts the costs of provision, but not the costs of non-provision.The shortfall in government funding for social care has caused afinancial crisisin almost every local authority. Other services are being cut to the bone. The potholes crisis, in other words, is a direct result of the social care crisis. In any exploration of the costs and benefits of social care spending, you could include the price of people being airlifted to hospital because the roads are falling apart.Of course, we should be wary of reducing everything to a cost-benefit analysis: many forms of necessary spending will carry a net cost to the exchequer, which is the price we pay for living in a kind and decent society. But this should not prevent us from remarking on the utter perversity of counting only the costs of state spending, while ignoring the benefits.The government, using a definition that means nothing to people falling into potholes, or into temporary accommodation, or into debt, insists austerity has ended, as there has been a slight, albeittemporaryrise in public spending as a percentage of GDP. But when it leaves so many essential services underfunded, the technical definition becomes a sophisticated lie. A more honest definition of austerity is a decline in services caused by a shortfall in funding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that’s neither necessary nor inevitable. If Labour chose, next month’s budget could put us on an entirely different course, one in which we need not suffer smashed glasses, mangled bikes, broken bones, evictions, poverty and neglect, to allow the ultra-rich their private jets, powerboats, beauty spas and second, third or fourth homes. Either they carry the cost, through income tax, wealth tax and a much fairer council tax orproperty tax banding system, or everyone else carries a much higher one.There would be a cost – a political cost – for the government in confronting the massive infrastructure of persuasion the very rich have built, and ending our 14-year sentence of austerity. But the cost of failing to do so, for all of us, is so much higher.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsAusterityOpinionCyclingBudget 2025commentShareReuse this content"

Parigi is in her mid-30s, gorgeous, friendly, and young enough to be his daughter – or granddaughter at a push. To be fair, though, Richie looks fabulous. As a young man, he was all chin and tache. Now he’s just regular handsome, surprisingly tall, with a bearing that verges on the military. Parigi leaves us to chat.Richie is famous for his bonhomie. He doesn’t simply invite you to the party, he leaves you feeling that he’s hosted it for you, and you alone. Within seconds of learning I’m from Manchester, he’s telling me stories of his times there. “Everyone prepared three days earlier to come to the concert in Manchester. They went to the pub on the first day, then on the second day they went to the pub, and on the third day they said, ‘Now we’re going to the concert.’ At one point I thought, they don’t know it’s me on stage. I mean they’re havingtheirparty. They take over the show, then do the soccer chants, then in between the soccer chants they go back and sing Three Times a Lady again. And, wait a minute, I’m not singing Three Times a Lady now. Oh my God, I have great stories.”View image in fullscreen‘What I loved about where I grew up is that failure was not an option’I know he has. I’ve just read his memoir and it’s rammed with them. He has worked with everyone – there’s Marvin and Stevie, and Quincy and Michael. One moment, he’s getting advice from Sammy Davis Jr that transformed his career, the next he’s taking Nelson Mandela clothes shopping in LA.But even more important is the role of his family, growing up on a black American university campus in the deep south. He knows it’s an atypical story for a person of colour born in the 1940s, and it’s one he says the media has often resisted because it didn’t conform to their idea of what his narrative should be. It really is a fascinating tale. Richie has a Zelig-like quality; there for all the big moments in music and civil rights history, whether as an active participant, a passive bystander or hanging on the coat-tails of girlfriends. He is a man we associate with relentless positivity, but there have also been terrible lows.The story starts in Tuskegee, a tiny campus city just 38 miles from Montgomery, Alabama, and what many regard as the birthplace of the civil rights movement. Tuskegee was a black middle-class enclave. Everybody there was so proud of their education and the city’s political history, Richie says. From a young age he was taught about Booker T Washington (founder of the Tuskegee Institute and advocate for African American economic self‑sufficiency through vocational education), and scientist George Washington Carver (who revolutionised southern agriculture and championed sustainable farming). Richie’s mother, Alberta, was a school principal and his father, Lyonel Sr, was a systems analyst for the US army. Meanwhile, his maternal grandmother Adelaide Mary Foster, a classically trained pianist, was the grandchild of an enslaved woman called Mariah and the plantation owner Dr Morgan Brown. In his will, Brown stipulated that Mariah and her son John Lewis Brown be given their freedom, and John went on to become the head of a black fraternal order promoting education. Richie and the family grew up in his grandparents’ beautiful home, which had been the institute’s faculty house, and was given to them by its original owner and close friend Booker T. History was rich and ever present in the family.View image in fullscreenLionel Richie with his parents, Alberta and Lyonel Sr, and his sister, Deborah.Photograph: Alan Silfen“The level of education was so heavy that you couldn’t help but just let it rub off on you. What I loved about Tuskegee is that failure was not an option. With the airmen there, the academics there, my grandmother, her generation, I grew up with these extremely bourgeois, aristocratic black folk.”Richie tells me his young self could not have been less cool – hopeless at sport, invisible to girls. “A lot of time people see artists and go, ‘Well, he must have been a jock or he must have been the ladies’ man.’ I wasnothing. I was the shyest, almost broken kid.’” He was a frightened little boy in awe of his tough, high-achieving father who passed on so much wisdom to him. Lyonel Sr taught him that it was normal to be frightened. “My dad had a great line,” he says. “‘What’s the similarity between a hero and a coward?”I say I know the answer from the book.“Can you tell me?”“Both are equally scared. But the coward takes a step back, while the hero takes a step forward,” I respond on cue.“That’s it!” he says, delighted. He looks at his manager Bruce Eskowitz, who’s sitting in with us. “Bruce, give him an A for this course. Give himtwostars.”A hotel waiter comes to take our order.Richie orders a cappuccino. I go for a flat white and double espresso. I’ve just flown in to Hungary, and am feeling it.“Ooooh!In that case, I’ll double him by having one more of these. Hahaha! If he’s going to up the stakes, I gotta stay with my man. He read the book! So I’ve got to be at my sharpest.”Richie says he realised when he was writing it he had endless anecdotes to tell. The publishers loved them, but asked where the meat was. He told them he was the meat – his journey of self-discovery, how he got to where he is today. The story he tells is a profound one; of his own inner dialogue with his blackness. How black does he have to be? Who defines that? What are the constraints of being black? And, again, who makes that decision?At the age of eight, he had a life-changing experience on a shopping trip with his father to Montgomery. Richie was unknowingly drinking from a whites-only fountain. Lyonel Sr was approached by a group of angry white men who were repeatedly using the N-word and demanding, “Can’t you read?” Richie waited for his father to “kick some ass”, but Lyonel Sr quietly told him to get in the car, and they drove off. Richie was ashamed of his father’s reaction and couldn’t bring himself to ask about it. Five years later, he brought it up at the dinner table. Lyonel Sr replied, “I had a choicethat day – whether to be your father or be a man. I chose to be your father, because I wanted to be here to see you grow up.”There was a Tuskegee anger – some of the smartest people in America were stymied and siloed by racismMajor civil rights landmarks run through Richie’s life, almost by happenstance. He remembers leaders such as Martin Luther King and Malcolm X passing through town. He was a member of Jack and Jill, the organisation that fostered leadership potential in black college-bound kids. At the age of 10, he fell in love with a girl called Cynthia whom he met through Jack and Jill. Cynthia was clever, with “a grace and a smile that were breathtaking”. Every time he saw her he froze in her presence. Then she disappeared. Many years later, in 1977, he saw her picture on a TV screen, looking just as he remembered her. The news was reporting on a Ku Klux Klan member who had been convicted for the 16th Street Baptist church bombing in 1963 that claimed the lives of four young African American girls. Cynthia Wesley, 14, was one of them. Richie knew all about the church bombing and says it marked the end of innocence for him, but until then he had no idea that Cynthia was one of its victims.In 1966, aged 17, he learned of the murder of 21-year-old Tuskegee voting rights activist Sammy Younge. After helping register 40 black voters in one day, Younge had stopped at a gas station to use the restroom. When the white attendant told him to use the hole “where Negroes go”, Younge replied that the segregation of bathrooms was illegal. The attendant drew a gun, fired and missed, and Younge drove off looking for police protection, to no avail. He returned to the gas station to argue his rights. Later that night, Younge was found dead behind the gas station from a single bullet to the head. The attendant claimed self-defence at trial and was acquitted. Yet another wake-up call for Richie.After Luther King’s assassination in 1968, he writes, “a heaviness hung over everything”. He started to follow the Black Panthers, “who I thought were the greatest. If Stokely Carmichael had something to say, I wanted to hear it.” Richie was living in Harlem, and was by then a member of the Commodores and dating a teacher called Sharon Williams – “sweet, pretty and a deep thinker”. She joined the Black Panthers, explained the struggle to Richie, and headed off to California for the revolution. Years later, Richie heard that Williams had been involved in a shootout with the police. “I think she died in the shootout. Again, I was on the outskirts.”View image in fullscreenRichie, second left, with the Commodores.Photograph: Echoes/RedfernsHad he realised before writing the book how personal his connections to the civil rights movement were? “What I didn’t realise was that it made up the core of who I was. At the time I didn’t realise because our parents made a point of keeping a lot of that edge away from us [his sister Deborah, a librarian, is two years younger than him]. We were in the bubble.” In 1965, when MLK had marched to Montgomery, his parents told 15-year-old Lionel that he was too young to get involved.Had he wanted to be part of it? “I waslongingto be part of it. And my parents kept telling me it was dangerous.” How did he feel about that? “I was angry, because I thought they had left me out of some of the most significant history. My anger came when I realised what my grandmother and grandfather had gone through, what my mom and dad had gone through. I said to my folks, ‘Why did you not tell me? Why did you not involve us in this?’, and their answer was, ‘We didn’t want anything to limit you in your thinking of what the possibilities for your future could be. And if we had attached you to our anger then you would be stuck in our anger.’” He’s talking quietly, with immense passion. Was he aware of that anger? “You couldn’t miss it. Every day I was aware of the anger, because there was a Tuskegee anger.” That was the anger of some of the smartest people in America stymied and siloed by racism. Civil rights didn’t start in 1965, Richie says. He talks about the activists of 1936 who campaigned against school segregation, the challenge to interstate bus segregation in 1947. If he’d not opted for a career in music, you could see Richie as a professor of black history. As a child, he imagined being ordained as an episcopalian priest.In 1974, Richie graduated from the Tuskegee Institute with a degree in economics and business. But he’d known for a long time that he wasn’t destined to specialise in either. At college, Richie was invited to join a band called the Mystics by guitarist Thomas McClary. The Mystics, then got together with members from a more successful college band, the Jays, and they became the Commodores. The name was chosen by randomly opening a dictionary and going for the first word their eyes fell on. The word before Commodore was commode. Richie says he doubts the Commodes would have been as successful. By 1974, the Commodores had been playing for six years and were just about to release their first album, Machine Gun, on Motown. The title song, an instrumental, became a huge hit. Richie was a saxophonist who played by ear and sang three songs in their set.In concert with the Commodores in 1979.Photograph: Christian RoseDid the rest of the band come from a similar background? “No, I had to overcome one phrase from within the group for the longest time, ‘Lionel, you don’t know what it is like to be poor.’ And I said, ‘Guys, I don’twantto know what it’s like to be poor!’” But the comment touched a nerve. “I’d say, ‘Will you stop saying that? You’re pissing me off.’ But then I got the best lesson from them, because they taught me how to survive.”In the early days on the road he did find out what it was like to be poor. “I’d be like, ‘I’m hungry, it’s time to eat,’ because I was used to three meals a day. ‘Well, we don’t have enough money to eat, Lionel – get a jar of orange juice and sip on it slowly, OK.’ Next thing is, ‘You’re going to eat this.’ Well, what the hell is it? ‘It’s chitlins and pickled pig feet.’Pig feet? My grandmother never had pickled pig feet in the house. It was the best education, because it gave me the opportunity to go down to ground floor.”The newly radicalised Richie was determined to play the tough guy. He admits he was naive. “I remember the day this guy called me the N-word.” The Commodores were booked to play a prom at a white high school, and they arrived 45 minutes late. Three men greeted them and told them to get back in the van and get straight out of town. All three were using the N-word. “Instead of running I said, ‘Oh my God!’, and the guys were going, ‘Lionel get back in the van!’’, and I was like, ‘Nononono, I’m in the civil rights movement now.’ And they’re like, ‘Lionel.Get. In. That. Van.’” When one of the men pulled out his Bowie knife, he gingerly stepped back into the van.After Machine Gun, Richie found himself playing less sax, taking over the vocals and writing the biggest hits. Their variety confounded critics, but Richie says it just reflected the range of music he grew up with. “When I got into the music business, I realised they had little holes for everything – ‘OK, now this is the R&B guy, you’re the black singer’, and I was like, ‘What’s going onhere?’ I didn’t know these categories. I was educated across the board from country music, classical music, classical pipe organ music, R&B, the blues, gospel.”Where did it all come from? “That one little town.” Tuskegee, he reckons, had a population of about 2,000 when he was growing up. “When I started writing, someone would say, ‘Where does Sail On come from, that’s a country song? Three Times a Lady, that’s a waltz? Where’s the funk coming from?’ Well, that’s all here at the house with the guys on the campus. It was so rich in culture.”One of the best bits of advice he received came early on, from Sammy Davis Jr. He told Richie that his career was about to go through the roof and that he would be approached by the biggest players in the industry who would offer him everything he’d dreamed of and more. Richie responded enthusiastically. Davis Jr told him it wasn’t anything to be enthusiastic about. He instructed Richie, “Your answer to everything they offer you is no.” When Richie asked why, Davis Jr said, “Because I said yes. And I don’t want you to make the same mistakes I made.” He was warning you off being owned? “That’s right. That alone saved me a hundred years of misery.”By the beginning of the 1980s, he was branching out. He wrote chart-topping songs for other artists – Lady for the country star Kenny Rogers and Endless Love for Diana Ross (her biggest hit, on which he duetted). In 1982, he went solo and for the next five years he was a constant in the US Top 10, with four No 1s. There were clubbing classics such as Dancing on the Ceiling and All Night Long, and there was schmaltz galore such as Say You, Say Me and Hello (with itscheesy-creepy videoof a drama teacher falling in love with his blind pupil).View image in fullscreenSinging Endless Love with Diana Ross, 1982.Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveMusic promoters and executives asked what Richie was playing at when he wrote for Rogers. They suggested he had become divorced from his roots. It infuriated him. “I bent myself into a pretzel to be black enough for R&B and accessible enough with pop promoters,” he writes. “Or as detractors in my own community later put it, ‘Lionel Richie crossed over and can’t get black’.”When Richie joined Motown, Berry Gordy’s soul label was thriving. He got to know all the greats. The Commodores’ first tour was supporting the Jackson 5 in 1971. Richie, then 22, was like an older brother to 12-year-old Michael. In 1985, he and Jackson wrote the song We Are the World, which was produced by Quincy Jones and sold more than 20m copies to raise money for famine victims in Ethiopia.He describes Jackson as “eccentric and extremely chaotic”. He says he would wear the same clothes till they disintegrated. “Quincy and I called Michael smelly.” He says Jackson would laugh because he knew he was being teased out of love. At one point, he was at Richie’s house and the stench was so strong that Richie presented him with a pair of his own jeans and a new pair of underpants, and told him to change into them. Later that day, Richie saw the discarded underwear and jeans in Jackson’s bedroom “lying there like roadkill”.Jackson was cleared of child molestation in 2005, though the allegations were revived more than a decade later in the documentaryLeaving Neverland.Richie’s daughter Nicole, who became famous in her own right as a reality TV star alongside Paris Hilton, was Jackson’s goddaughter. Nicole often slept in Jackson’s bedroom along with other children and has said she never witnessed anything inappropriate. “My parents would never put me in hands that they thought were dangerous. I never had any complaints, and, you know, I love him,” she said in 2003.View image in fullscreenWith Michael Jackson in 1985.Photograph: Polaris/eyevineRichie talks movingly about Jackson’s genius and his battles. “I watched him struggle. Before I got into the fame business, at least I had my friends from school and college. I had some experiences. I had the opportunity to hang out at a football game. I knew what a date was. I’d been jilted. He missed it all.He. Missed. It. All.I was there with him when he was going to that studio every day after school and he’d pull in like a machine at 3pm and stay there till six. Just imagine a kid like that and all you hear is, ‘Watch out the girls are coming! You can’t trust her, you can’t trust them!’ I saw it.”He claims many people were stealing from Jackson in one way or another. Was Richie in a position to advise him? He shakes his head. “No. When you’re in the war and you’re both ducking bullets it’s hard to give advice to the other soldier. The same crooks that were trying to take advantage of him were coming to take advantage of me.”At the same time, he made so many incredible friends. He could tell stories about them all day long. There’s the time Stevie Wonder told him to get in the passenger seat of his car, and reversed down the driveway at speed, terrifying the life out of him (“I lost it completely and screamed, ‘Stevie, what the fuck are you doing!?!’”). Then there’s the occasion he took Nelson and Winnie Mandela clothes shopping at Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue in preparation for a reception in honour of the South African leader. (“Young man, I want to thank you for your lyrics and your music,” Mandela told him. “Your songs got me through many years while I was in prison.”)View image in fullscreenRichie, centre, with Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson, performing at the 2022 American Music Awards.Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for dcpI ask who influenced him most as a songwriter. “Smokey Robinson, Norman Whitfield and Marvin Gaye. Each one in their own way would stop by and give me just a little thing. Marvin said to me, ‘What’s the most important note you’ll ever get, kid?’ I said I don’t know. And he said, ‘Hhhhhh-haaah.’ He inhales and exhales, Marvin-like. “Make sure they hear your breathing on the record. It’s not how hard you hit the note, it’s the storytelling.” What about Smokey? “Smokey is the lyricist of lyricists. But also what I love about him is he could have grown up in Tuskegee. He has that smooth way of teaching. It was always, ‘Little brother, let me teach you this, let me show you this, let me bring you in.’ When Smokey was with you in the room, you got nothing but knowledge.”Of all his mentors, it’s his father he most often returns to. He tells me of the day Lyonel Sr explained that life had not tested his son yet, and when it did there would be people glad to see him fall. His father told him that the test comes to any person in the form of “the five Ds” – divorce, disease, disaster, disgrace and death. “His line to me was, ‘A great fighter is not determined by how many punches he can throw, it’s how many punches he can take. And you haven’t been hit yet.’”Soon after, in June 1988, Richie was hit good and proper. He and his wife, former childhood sweetheart Brenda Harvey-Richie, had discreetly split up. Richie was dating Diane Alexander, who went on to become his second wife and the mother of his two younger children Sofia and Miles. When he was at Alexander’s house, there was a knock on the door. It was Brenda. She confronted Richie about the relationship and then physically attacked both Richie and Alexander. The police were called, Brenda was charged with corporal injury to a spouse, battery and resisting arrest, and the story became front-page news.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenWith his first wife, Brenda Harvey-Richie, and their daughter, Nicole (top); and his second wife, Diane Alexander, and their children, Sofia and Miles (above). Photographs: Darlene Hammond; Alan SilfenHow did he cope? Badly, he says. “Disaster and disgrace, that’s two of them, back to back. And you think, how do I maintain this dignified approach when the curtain has been pulled away and you have to survive that? All of Dad’s teachings came together at that central point of my life. He didn’t tell me what was going to happen, he just told me it’s going to happen, but when it does, don’t be shocked about it, just remember to do one thing.Get. Up. Off. The. Floor.”But that was easier said than done. Richie still wasn’t done with the Ds. In 1990, Lyonel Sr died, then one of his vocal cords haemorrhaged because of overuse and he was told he might never be able to sing again. (It took four operations to fix.) At his nadir, he retreated to Jamaica and spent five days drinking till he “damn near passed out”. He sat alone, on a deckchair at the ocean’s edge, polishing off bottles of Cristal champagne, oblivious to the fact that he was up to his waist in water. Later, when he was recovering, he spoke to Motown executive Skip Miller about it. “I said, ‘You know what, Skip, man, if I hadn’t quit the business I would have had a nervous breakdown.’ And he said, ‘Oh, you had a nervous breakdown all right, that’s why youdidquit the business.’”How long did he stop working for? Five years.Fiveyears.” He sounds as if he can’t quite believe it. Richie says it’s a tough industry, and he starts totting up its victims. “Who did we lose?Everybody. Marvin’s gone. You name it, they’re gone. Michael, Prince, Hendrix …”I ask what he thinks his parents would have made of today’s United States and Trump as president. He responds with a surge of raw emotion. “You know what, I’m glad my dad and that group is not here. It would be tough. I can’t even imagine.” He talks about the progress they witnessed through the civil rights movement, and how it is now being reversed. “And now we’re going back to eliminate it.” He looks at his manager. “Bruce can tell you, I’m having my worst moments because youcan’terase all of this progress. I made a statement in 1983 when we were talking about civil rights, and I said, ‘We still talk aboutthat?’, as if to say that’s behind us, we’re interested in the future. Now, here we are 42 years later and we’re still talking about the same thing. But it’s even worse. What I’m watching now is not only going backwards, but it is the erasing of history.”Is he scared for the US? “Always,” he says with a hint of desperation in his voice. Would he ever go into politics to challenge Trump? He laughs nervously, then answers definitively. “Never.” Then he remembers he’s Lionel Richie, the eternal optimist, the lover man, the great unifier, who brings the world together through music. He points out he’s not only African American, he’s also part Cherokee Native American on his grandmother’s side, with a splash of French-Canadian, English and Scottish thrown in for good measure. Of course, he was always going to bring people together. “If you’re waiting for Martin Luther Richie, he ain’t coming. But if you’re waiting for Lionel Richie, the bearer of love, you got me. Back in the day I was thinking politics is a great place. But I saw Malcolm, I saw Martin, I saw all the civil rights guys, and, guess what, they didn’t survive it. It’s not survivable. Politics is ugly, it’s nasty, and it’s got even worse now because they character assassinate you before you even get in. And I found an avenue that works well for me.”View image in fullscreenWith his partner, Lisa Parigi, in May.Photograph: Christopher Polk/Penske Media/Getty ImagesHe tells me of a Unesco meeting where he was invited to perform and talk about the power of music in bridging differences to a group of Middle East delegates from countries including Israel, Jordan and Egypt. When he asked why he’d been invited, they told him he was the only person everyone could agree on. “I can walk into a room. The room does not like each other. It’s suspicious of each other. I walk in and everybody starts smiling. That’s powerful.” Then he takes me to a typical gig back in the 60s. “ Right in the middle of all this craziness, on the third row there’s the guy from the Klan. Big fan. I can have a conversation with anybody and get the message out better than I can by standing on a podium, pounding my fist down and saying, ‘Follow me!’”In the end, he says, that message has to be love, and he’s thankful he’s surrounded by it in his own life – three children, three grandkids and his partner, Lisa. Is there any truth in the rumour that they’re thinking of tying the knot? He makes a shushing noise. “I don’t want to jinx it. Ilovethe rumour,” he says, giggling like a schoolboy. “Keep it like that.”As I prepare to leave, Bruce asks us not to mention Trump in the piece. Richie, though, says he’s fine with what he has said. But, yes, he’s sticking with love rather than politics. “I’m the pied piper of that whole thing, buddy. ‘I love you’: three corny words that the world needs to hear every day.Wantsto hear every day. Now I’d rather say that than, ‘Let’s go fight the revolution.’”Truly by Lionel Richie is published by William Collins, £25). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

But is it believable?Rachel AroestiSat 4 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareI’m not sure where Aimee Lou Wood – the Stockport-born star of Sex Education andThe White Lotus– got the idea for Film Club (Tuesday 7 October, 10pm, BBC Three), the new drama she has created with fellow actor Ralph Davis, but I’d be amazed if it’s drawn from her own life. Not because the fearlessly outspoken global celebrity plays a woman too scared to set foot outside her mum’s house in Manchester following a nervous breakdown, her only respite being a weekly movie night with uni friends in the garage. No. It’s the garage itself.Each week, unemployed, agoraphobic Evie somehow finds the wherewithal to transform her garage into a spectacular film set. For a screening of Alien, this one-woman Secret Cinema wallpapers it with tinfoil and hazard tape and fills it with smoke, strip lights and acres of aluminium ducting. For The Wizard of Oz, it’s floor-to-ceiling emerald gauze, gingham curtains and dozens of human head-sized flowers. For The Shawshank Redemption, bars, laundry and personalised prison-style posters line the walls. I simply refuse to believe such breathtakingly wasteful party decor would ever appear in an actual British household. America,maybe. Britain? Not. A. Chance.Evie lives with her sister Izzie (Liv Hill) and mother Suz (Suranne Jones), who is excruciatingly try-hard, desperate to keep both the mood and appearances up, up, up, lest her first-born backslide psychologically. When Evie’s best friend and most reliable film club companion Noa (Nabhaan Rizwan) reveals he’s moving to Bristol for work, Suz panics, fearing Evie will lose her raison d’être. She decides to put a manically positive spin on the news by hastily arranging a prosecco toast to Noa, during which she reads out a depressing poem Evie wrote about being a ghost when she was eight. Is this meant to raise her daughter’s spirits? Or force her to flee the house in embarrassment, thereby curing herself? Either way, it provides Jones with another opportunity to slip into the twitchily anxious mum mode she long ago perfected.Film Club has the vibe of a romcom but not the substance. Evie and Noa clearly have a connection: their conversation is composed almost entirely of movie quotes, and it’s a small miracle they’ve both found someone willing to tolerate this mode of communication. But elsewhere, their chemistry seems patchy. Rizwan plays Noa in his trademark understated style, which means little detectable emotion, while Wood is all aquiver with feeling – though she seems more irritated by Noa than consumed by lust. Besides, she’s smitten with her boyfriend Josh (Wood’s real-life partner Adam Long), who seems too good to be true. He is, as we later discover in a bizarre subplot.View image in fullscreenJust like the movies … Wood with Nabhann Rizwan as Noa in Film Club.Photograph: BBC/Gaumont/Ben Blackall/PAInstead, the most believable bonds are located within the family unit. An early scene in which Izzie is alarmed by the size of her sister’s tampons (Evie: “Fine Izzie, I’ve got massive, wizened 28-year-old flaps”) has echoes of Such Brave Girls, Kat Sadler’s mercilessly funny sitcom about a ferociously dysfunctional mother-daughter-daughter trio. But that’s a red herring. Evie, Izzie and Suz do bicker, but Film Club turns out to be a far soppier affair.All the moping around the house – which Evie does in a miniskirt and leather blazer, for some reason – plus a perpetually wittering matriarch reminds me of Mike Leigh’s Life Is Sweet. Yet while that film’s cosy awkwardness eventually gives way to bracing emotional depth, Film Club retreats into sentimentality. We never get much insight into Evie’s condition: as she confirms to a cheeky local lad (Adolescence’s Owen Cooper), she just “malfunctioned” and “lost the plot”. Her movie night obsession isn’t even a symptom of her unhappiness; in flashback, we see that she took it just as seriously at university seven years ago.So Film Club isn’t actually about mental illness. It’s not really a love story, either. It’s not even about film buffs: the movies referenced here are all route-one classics. At the end of the day, it’s about a garage in Manchester, and what one woman unBritishly sticks on its walls.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherAimee Lou WoodTelevisionSuranne JonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When it’s quiet, my brain fills the gap with racing thoughts. It wasn’t until lockdown, when I was 27, that I was diagnosed with ADHD and autism, but looking back it made sense: the fidgety teenage nights, the late-night TV marathons, the constant need for background noise.As a kid, my insomnia was brutal. When I couldn’t sleep, all I wanted to do was get up and do something, but I shared a room with my sister so I just had to lie there, still and frustrated. I found our workaround: TV. My sister and I would put films on at night to soften the atmosphere and fill the silence.Our childhood home was quite unstable and we were left alone a lot, so TV became our bedtime white noise. By my teens, it had become routine: I would pick a film, then watch it night after night for a week or two until a new one took over. Films such as The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and The Breakfast Club were particular favourites. But they weren’t a fail-safe solution, and my sleeping issues persisted.I’ve watched it every night for 15 years. I often don’t make it past the opening credits without falling asleepThen, when I was about 15 or 16, my mum – a childminder at the time – put onRatatouillefor the kids she was looking after in our house. It was just after the film had come out. She intended it as a distraction for them, but I watched it too and loved it.I decided that day that it would be my sleep film for the night, and I instantly knew I’d struck gold. It’s hard to explain to anyone who hasn’t tried to fall asleep with a film playing, butRatatouillehas a remarkably consistent soundscape. It’s not about the volume – obviously you can set that as loud or quiet as you want – but the uniformity. There are no big explosions, no sudden jump scares; just the steady hum of kitchens, the occasional pan clatter.From that night on, I stopped swapping films – Ratatouille became my nightly ritual. I now watch it without fail every single night, and have done for 15 years. I have essentially trained myself to fall asleep to it. I own it on DVD, have it on my phone and iPad, and stream it when I travel. There is no universe in which I can’t access it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We’ve been together for eight years and live together, which means he’s probably seen the first five minutes of Ratatouille thousands of times – significantly more times than I have, since I often don’t make it past the opening credits before falling asleep. He usually waits until I’m out cold, switches it off, and puts something else on.People sometimes ask if I even like the film, since I never get to the end. The answer is yes, I love it. So much so that I sometimes resent how fast it knocks me out, because I’d like to watch it through properly. There are probably still whole chunks of it I haven’t seen, despite 15 years of nightly viewing. But I think my love for it is partly why it works: I trust it and feel comforted by it.Now, it has become a running joke among my friends. If I stay over at theirs, they’ll ask when I’m going to set up Ratatouille for the night. I’ve also talked it through with my therapist, who agrees that as far as coping mechanisms go, there are far worse ways to help with symptoms of ADHD and autism.I can’t imagine watching anything else at night now. The only thing that might possibly replace Ratatouille is the sequel, which is in the works. Until then, I’ll keep watching the original. Or at least the first five minutes.Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?

(That’s if they’re movable – if not, you go to them.)We asked visitors for their highlights – here are some of them.‘An amazing surprise’Backdrop for theBallets Russesproduction of Le Train Bleu,1924View image in fullscreenA young couple enjoy Picasso’s Le Train Bleu.Photograph: Olive Burnside/Guardian CommunityLe Train Bleu, the Picasso backcloth for Ballets Russes, was an amazing surprise. The scale of the piece was huge, in a space of its own, after all the racks and floors of interesting objects. The only other people were a young couple struggling to take a selfie that did it justice. When I offered to hold their phone they immediately struck the pose. They were so wonderful I had to take another picture for myself. I loved lots of the objects on display, but this one trumped them all.Olive Burnside, Glasgow‘Architecture preserved and installed in such a creative way’View image in fullscreenA two-storey section of Robin Hood Gardens in Bermondsey, south-east London.Photograph: David Parry/PAFacade from Robin Hood GardensThe exhibit that I liked the best was theRobin Hood Gardens facade. It was unexpected to find part of a Brutalist building in the V&A collection. The reason it resonates with me is that I lived in a tower block – Addy House in Bermondsey – for seven years, after I graduated in London. Back then it was deemed “hard to let”. We were seven floors up in a 60s concrete block that was in some disrepair. Despite this, we loved living there. The flat itself was spacious, with brilliant views, floor to ceiling windows and beautifully tiled floors. We lived alongside residents who had moved in when the block was first built. They spoke of brass panels and handles on the doors that they would polish regularly, and the joy they had at living in a newly built home that everyone looked after.I loved the fact that this huge section of architecture has been preserved and installed in such a creative way. On each level of the Storehouse, behind the facade we learned more about it. Level one: the moving film introduced us to some of the residents. Level two: the interior of the building shown through the front doors and entrance halls of two flats. And on level three, images of residents inside their homes. So much more than a facade, it preserves memories along with the architecture.Helen Rose,St Leonards-on-Sea‘A tutu with unusual wings’Le Bal theatre costumeView image in fullscreenA Giorgio de Chirico costume for one of the four sylphs in Le Bal (1929), choreographed by George Balanchine for Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes.Photograph: Richard Davis/Courtesy of the V&AMy recent master’s dissertation focused on the care of historic classical ballet tutus. My favourite object was one I ordered via the “order an object” service: a tutu worn by Alice Marks. It was acostume for a sylph by Georgio de Chirico– a Romantic tutu with unusual wings and decoration. The design was unusual and powerful. The toughness of the material is at odds with our usual impressions of sylph delicacy. The massive sculptural wings suggest a sort of exoskeleton or armour rather than the usual whimsy and fragility. The woman in this dress is strong, tough and mysterious. De Chirico’s design is both referential and extremely modern in its style.Lara F Martyn, Cumbria‘Like time-travelling to 1930s Pittsburgh’Frank Lloyd Wright’s officeView image in fullscreenFrank Lloyd Wright’s office.Photograph: Kemka Ajoku/Courtesy of the V&AFrank Lloyd Wright’s office was my personal highlight. It might be an obvious choice because it is one of the larger items on display, but there is something magical about being able to stand somewhere that once belonged in a different time and place – like time-travelling to 1930s Pittsburgh. The art deco room itself is beautiful, a real icon of its time. The deceptively simple patterns on the wood panel walls were a particular highlight. Little details like the bust of Nefertiti and the stainless steel ashtray stand made it feel as though the room could have been in use yesterday. It was also amazing to see it from the outside, to see the notes to the people who had to move it, piece by piece. It gave me a new appreciation of how difficult it must be to move larger objects around a collection.Emma Thomas, 31, Croydon‘A cross between a provincial museum and Ikea’Assorted piecesView image in fullscreenA 1950s television, a medieval altar piece and a modern chairI love the juxtaposition of objects and the “organised chaos” of the place. One of the standouts was this combination on the end of a row: a 50s television and medieval altar piece and a simple chair. This display was a great demonstration of the range of artefacts on show. I’d describe the whole experience as a cross between a provincial museum and Ikea. Just brilliant!Stephen Buddle, Guildford‘Not something I would expect to see at a traditional museum’Mannequin dummiesView image in fullscreenThe dummies are designed to be covered but are ‘beautiful in their own right’These mannequin dummies (pictured) were a highlight. Though initially simple, they provoked a variety of thoughts. Five female body shapes that stood out to me due to their starkness, like a feminine show of strength. I also thought the mannequins represented what was “typical” body shape from different periods of history, so ideas of what was desirable have changed through time, in particular waist and hip shape and proportions. I thought how important mannequins are in fashion and dressmaking. They are designed to be covered but are beautiful and individual in their own right. Mannequins are not something I would expect to see at a traditional museum, so they reflected the very eclectic collection of items that resonate in different ways to different people.Lynn, Welwyn Garden City‘A cabinet of curiosity’Cabinet designed by Charles Rennie MackintoshView image in fullscreenThe hall cupboard by Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928).Photograph: Courtesy of the V&AOn my visit I requested an eclectic mix of items, ranging from a tiny pair of lotus shoes to a large Mackintosh hall cupboard. Being able to handle [some] items that were only previously seen behind glass, such as the 19th-century kimono and intricately decorated gold dragonflyinro(a small, decorative case which hangs from the belt), was very special. I have lived in Japan and have an interest in traditional Japanese clothing. The opportunity to select items which pertain to your personal interests, however varied, from one of the world’s most important collections is such a joy.Beckie, York‘Visitors could really investigate close up’The Frankfurt kitchenView image in fullscreenThe Frankfurt Kitchen: ‘practical and efficient’.Photograph: Courtesy of the V&AMy favourite piece on my visit in July was the Frankfurt Kitchen, because it was something tangible that visitors could really investigate close up – without touching, of course. It’s a great example of a research-based design, done by a female architect who apparently didn’t actually cook. It’s a practical, efficient kitchen which would meet the needs of ordinary people, and has influenced kitchen design today. An awful lot was crammed into a small space, but she managed to display clean lines with no feeling of clutter. Though the kitchen dates from the 1900s, I’d be happy to cook in such a kitchen today. There are some lovely refinements such as the double sink, a raised drainage shelf, aluminium storage drawers, plentiful other storage, and good workspace. Many elements are still sought-after in today’s fitted kitchens. It just shows there’s nothing new under the sun!Karen Davies, 67, FranceExplore more on these topicsMuseumsV&AArchitectureLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maria Ressa, joint winner of the Nobel peace prize, is a Filipino and American journalist who co-founded the news website Rappler. And Rory Stewart is a British academic and former Conservative MP, writer and co-host of The Rest Is Politics podcast. Their conversation ranged over the rise of AI, the crisis in democracy and the prospect of a Trump-Putin wedding, but began by considering a question central to all of their work: how to live a good life in an increasingly fragmented and fragile world?YNHPeople have been arguing about this for thousands of years. The main contribution of modern liberalism and democracy was to try to agree to disagree; that different people can have very different concepts of what a good life is, and they can still live together in the same society, agreeing on some very basic rules of conduct. And the challenge was always that people who think they have the absolute answer to what is a good life try to impose it on others, partly because, unfortunately for many ideologies, an inherent part of the good life is attempting to make everybody live it. And even more unfortunately, in many cases, it seems that it is easier to impose it on others than to do it ourselves. If we take the original crusade in medieval Christian Europe, you have all these people who can’t live a Christian life of modesty and compassion and love your neighbour, but they are able to travel thousands of kilometres to kill people and try to force them to live according to these principles. And what we are witnessing in the world right now is more of the same.RSAt the heart of that observation is this extraordinary idea, which, broadly speaking, is called liberalism. It is an idea that became very powerful, particularly by the 19th century, and found a new form after the second world war. We’re the heirs of that: it assumed things like a rules-based international order; an idea that we would agree how we behaved, state to state; it had an idea of democracy at its heart. And of course, that idea of democracy has a lot of the ingredients that Yuval is talking about, which is tolerance, human rights – how you protect the minority from the views of the majority. And there was an extraordinary period that probably lasted until the mid-2000s where it really seemed possible that this was the natural destination of humanity. And then things began to come off the rails. Now we find ourselves in a world where almost every bit of the model has entered its shadow form. So instead of focusing on democracy, we’re in a world dominated by authoritarian populism. Instead of a world of free trade, we’re in one that’s increasingly about protection and tariffs. Instead of a rules-based international order, we’re in a world of isolation: the strong do what they can, the weak must suffer what they must. And all this, of course, is then reinforced by social media and increasingly by AI.We are now creating a superintelligence, and there is every reason to think that it will be super deludedYuval Noah HarariMRThe biggest question we have today is whether impunity will reign, because it’s clear from what is happening in the physical and virtual world that an international rules-based order is not working. How do you live a good life when big tech is using surveillance for profit, to manipulate us in order to keep making more money? Now we’re individually targeted by technology that can go to the cellular level of every democracy.All five major world religions say that the battle that matters in order to live a good life is the battle inside yourself: your better self versus your worst self. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you; it’s a simple thing. But how do we maintain these values when the very way we connect with each other is corrupted?YNHWhat is new in the current situation is that we now have the technology to hack human beings and manipulate the inner battle in a way that was simply impossible in the middle ages or even in the 20th century. Big corporations, and anybody wielding this new technology, can both decipher and also manipulate human desires and thoughts in a way that is unprecedented. And liberal democracy, as it was constituted in the 18th and 19th century, really doesn’t know how to deal with it.RSThere’s also the possibility that technology begins to overshadow us. If you think about civilisation, a lot of it traditionally was about these great figures, these role models, these heroes. And what is a hero? Somebody who stretches the limits of what it means to be human. We believe we are this extraordinary species who can do things in science or poetry or drama that no other species can do. The risk of artificial general intelligence is that suddenly it is quite literally superhuman. At that point, if it can effortlessly write a poem better than I can, create a play better than I can, suddenly we are diminished.View image in fullscreenYuval Noah Harari.Photograph: David Vintiner/The GuardianMRIt would be great if the technology that is enabling this transformation is actually 100% accurate. It is not. But because we’ve grown up with integrity of information, it’s much easier to fool us, because when you see it in writing, you expect it to be right. The way AI has been pushed in our society is completely separate from facts. And I know Yuval in his book says information is not about facts, it’s about the stories we tell, but facts anchor our shared reality.A question I would like to ask you guys: do you think people are fundamentally good or fundamentally evil? I sound super religious in this conversation, but really that makes a difference, because what we’re doing now in the public information ecosystem, part of the breakdown of democracy, part of our ability to elect illiberal leaders democratically, is because we’ve muted the goodness of humanity. I’ve covered the crappiness of humanity, of people killing each other, I’ve been in war zones, but I’ve also been in these areas where a natural disaster happens and people are incredibly generous. We would not have survived the six-year presidency of Rodrigo Duterte if there were not people who gave not just of themselves, but gave money to Rappler. So I think this is what’s at stake.I’ve been in war zones. But I’ve also been where a disaster has happened and people are incredibly generousMaria RessaYNHOne of the most important observations is that goodness is not closely related to intelligence. Artificial intelligence is the most important technology of the era; it has been forgotten that intelligence is no guarantee of goodness or even of wisdom, that when you look at the grand span of human history, you don’t see a clear correlation between intelligence and compassion, or even a clear-sighted view of reality. Homo sapiens is by far the most intelligent species on the planet, and it simultaneously is the most deluded species: humans believe the kind of nonsense that no chimpanzee or elephant or rat would ever believe. We are now creating a superintelligence, and there is every reason to think that it will be super deluded.RSYuval is unusual because he is capable of considering the possibility of where we might be in 200 years. But let’s try 20 for a second. When we think about the world, often we think about it from Silicon Valley, and we imagine that really the future is Star Trek, and Elon Musk is off to Mars. For most, perhaps half of humanity, over the next decades to come, hundreds of millions will be living on incomes of under $2 a day, and billions under $5 a day.The next thing is that conflict is changing. We can see with what’s happening in Gaza and to some extent in Ukraine, the way in which wealthy countries with technology can inflict astonishing damage on their neighbours and take very little risk themselves. Added to that, there is a push towards an arms race happening all over the world. So if we look at Europe, we’re now increasing our spending on defence to 5% of GDP. That will literally suck hundreds of billions of euros every year out of our health systems, our education systems, our welfare systems, at exactly the moment that our economies are flatlining and our populations are getting older, so there’s every likelihood that over the next 10-20 years, at the same time as AI is developing, much of the world will begin to feel like a shabbier, poorer version of the current world, that median incomes will stagnate and that conflict will rise.View image in fullscreenMaria Ressa.MRI completely agree with what Rory said, but I’m more pessimistic. I don’t think it’ll take 20 years. The Philippines gets an average of 20 typhoons every year. We’re watching islands sink, and yet the west is debating whether climate change even exists.I think the death of journalism is around the corner within six months to a year. The internet is getting worse by the day, and there are absolutely no guardrails put in place, even as news organisations are being forced to pay for that, and our content is exploited. It is a very predatory online world, and that has translated to the world we live in.YNHIf I had to characterise the emotional tone of what I have been doing for quite a number of years, I would say that I was in the business of anxiety – that I’m creating more anxiety around AI, climate change, whatever. Now we need to switch to a different project, which is to rebuild trust, because when there is too much anxiety and you can’t trust anybody or anything, you can’t do anything. The most important thing is to rebuild trust in human institutions, in the media, in government, elsewhere. The big question is, how do we do that?Government is much worse than I could ever have imagined – the whole thing has become a gameRory StewartRSI would say that that involves rebuilding those human institutions. My experience as a politician is that government is much worse than I could ever have imagined. Liz Truss, my boss and colleague, who became prime minister in the United Kingdom, basically thought that her job was Instagram and campaigning, and she dedicated very little time to any serious consideration of policy, and in fact was derogatory of people who worried too much about the real-life impacts of what she was doing. The whole thing has become a game.MRHow long will we pretend that there is integrity of elections as the world falls off the cliff? Part of what made the international rules-based system work was that we had a powerful anchor for it: that we did what was for the greater good. We expected leaders to pull back from their greed. And if they didn’t, journalists would expose these things. Now that the US doesn’t seem to care about any other country but itself, what will that mean? Does that mean that we throw away every value system that was built into the international organisations? If the most powerful only work for themselves, is it every person for themselves?View image in fullscreenRory Stewart.Photograph: Christopher Owens/The GuardianYNHYou see a re-emergence, in a strange way, of monarchist ideas: the leaders that are rising now are quite different from the 20th-century dictators. It’s not a coincidence that, in the US, one of the movements against Donald Trump is “No Kings”, because he is reviving something really medieval. One of the most amazing moments of the last year was the meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy in the White House. One of the things that emerged very clearly was that Trump does not think about politics as being an interaction between states or between people, in the sense of the American people, the Russian people, the Ukrainian people. He thinks about it as an interaction between persons, monarchs, dynasties. When people told him that Putin had broken previous agreements, Trump said, “Well, he broke an agreement with Biden, he broke an agreement with Obama, not with me.” And the implication is, the agreement is not between Russia and the US, the agreement is between two people, and if I make an agreement with Putin, I will make sure he sticks by it, but it only holds as long as I’m president. If you then replace me with someone else, that’s the end of the agreement. You see the return of the concept of politics as a dynastic affair between families. This is a bit crazy, but not too crazy, to think, for instance, of a solution to the Ukraine war where Barron Trump would marry Putin’s granddaughter, and they would get Crimea and Donbas as their kingdom.If you want the truth, and you want reality to win, each of us has to do some of the hard work ourselvesYuval Noah HarariLet me just say one more thing about this monarchical idea: in the 20th century, dictators served an ideology which, in a way, limited them, because if you’re, say, a communist dictator, you have to promote a communist ideology. You can’t really do what you want. With the new leaders like Trump, there is no ideology there. When you look at somebody like Trump or like Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, the amazing thing is how much freedom of action these people have.RSOne thing that is so striking about the modern age is that we’ve lost an ethical vocabulary in engaging with leaders. I mean, fundamentally, what is Donald Trump? He is shameless. It would be very difficult for Aristotle or Cicero or a Renaissance theorist of politics, or indeed the writers of the American constitution, to imagine this degree of shamelessness, this degree of contempt for constitutions, contempt for minorities, contempt for the truth, the open performance of immorality. And very difficult also to imagine that we would have entered a world where we, at some level, are so tempted to just enjoy the spectacle, and have just lost the ability to be shocked that every day he does three or four things which in the old world would have shocked us to our core.MRWith Zelenskyy at the White House, it was shocking that the breaking news reporters just kept repeating what President Trump said, which was a lie. They could instead have used what is known as a truth sandwich: “Russia invaded Ukraine, President Trump says this, Russia invaded Ukraine.” In journalism, we have to shift: we can no longer stand behind “he said, she said”. Now we actually have to pull up and say, “This guy is lying.” Because those are the facts. So our reporting shifts. On the technology, we cannot live under surveillance for profit, we cannot keep getting manipulated in this way, because it encourages the worst of who we are. [At Rappler] we began to build a chat app two years ago. Our vision is for a global information ecosystem, but we anchor our news organisations with our communities. So this is how we move forward: we embrace the technology. We call it out where it is wrong. We look back at our history, and regardless of all of the problems of democracies, we still haven’t found a better system than this. Of course, it could all end soon, but we keep fighting.YNHI think that more people need to realise that we have to do the hard work ourselves. There is a tendency to assume that we can rely on reality to do the job for us. That if there are people who talk nonsense, who support illogical policies, who ignore the facts, sooner or later, reality will wreak vengeance on them. And this is not the way that history works.So if you want the truth, and you want reality to win, each of us has to do some of the hard work ourselves: choose one thing and focus on that and hope that other people will also do their share. That way we avoid the extremes of despair.Explore more on these topicsBooksPhilosophy booksPolitics booksSociety booksClimate crisisSocial mediaYuval Noah HararifeaturesShareReuse this content"

So it’s no surprise that his new film, about a school bus trying to flee the epically destructive 2018 Camp Fire in California, is a tense, thick-of-the-action thriller – one that may have you checking your hair for singeing by the end. Matthew McConaughey (at the frazzled end of his handsome spectrum) is driver Kevin McKay, who picks up a bunch of kids, plus teacher Mary Ludwig (America Ferrera), as an inferno surges towards the town of Paradise. Greengrass keeps a vice-like grip on the plot, and our emotions, as the temperature rises and their options narrow.Simon WardellPlay Dirty, out now, Prime VideoNovelist Richard Stark’s ruthless thief character Parker has been seen in many films under many names (the best being Point Blank), and now director Shane Black takes his turn in this zippy caper.

New York mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared with firefighters. When producer Lorne Michaels asked: “Can we be funny?”, Giuliani replied: “Why start now?”It was September 2001 and, just 18 days after the worst terrorist attack in US history, Saturday Night Live’s blend of satire, silliness and live music was back on the air. “In bad times, people turn to the show,”Michaels told Rolling Stone magazine20 years later.SNLturns 50 this monthand must once again try to meet the moment. This time, the crisis is not external but taking place in late-night TV comedy itself. In recent weeks, the genre has become the canary in the coal mine of US democracy.Over the summer, CBSannounced the cancellationof The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ostensibly for financial reasons, though notably Colbert is a longtime Trump critic and CBS owner Paramount had been seeking government approval of an $8bn merger with Skydance.On 17 September, ABCsuspended Jimmy Kimmel’s showover comments he made after the assassination of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk. Hours before the suspension, the Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, warned that local broadcasters who aired Kimmel could face fines or loss of licences and said: “It’s time for them to step up.”The move prompted an outcry over freedom of speech. ABC parent Disney faced pressure from Kimmel’s fans, some of whom cancelled subscriptions to the company’s streaming services Disney+ and Hulu.Kimmel returned to the airsix days later and mocked Trump: “He tried his best to cancel me and instead he forced millions of people to watch this show.”Now the spotlight shifts from CBS and ABC to America’s other major network: NBC. WhenSNL returns on 4 October, Bad Bunny will host with Doja Cat as the musical guest and five new featured players following several cast departures. But no moment will matter more than the “cold open” in how it deals with the current climate.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny backstage as he prepares to host Saturday Night Live.Photograph: Rosalind O’Connor/AP“This would be one of the biggest, most important cold openings in the 50-year history of the show,” saysStephen Farnsworth, a co-author of Late Night With Trump: Political Humor and the American Presidency. “But in the past, when Saturday Night Live has faced a major challenge, like they did in the wake of 9/11, they’ve risen to the occasion.”SNL’s mockery of Trump has at times earned the wrath of his supporters and the president himself, but Farnsworth advised against pulling punches, saying: “Saturday Night Live will face charges that it isn’t going far enough or that it went too far pretty much no matter what they do, so there’s no reason not to be all in.”Farnsworth, the director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, adds: “It’s striking that a man who desires the spotlight as much as the president does, who wants to be a public figure as badly as he has over the years, doesn’t understand that criticism is part of the package that comes with power.”Launched a yearafter the Watergate scandal toppled Richard Nixon, SNL features sketches and live musical performances. But it is also known for covering politics and featuring politicians. The weekend update segment provides ongoing commentary while cast members often parody presidents, candidates and other figures.The most famous include Gerald Ford (Chevy Chase), George HW Bush (Dana Carvey), Bill Clinton (Darrell Hammond), George W Bush (Will Ferrell), Sarah Palin (Tina Fey), Donald Trump (Alec Baldwin) and Joe Biden (various cast and guest actors). Trump is now portrayed with aplomb byJames Austin Johnson.Susan Morrison, author ofLorne, a biography of Michaels, recalls: “When Alec Baldwin was doing him, Trump was furiously tweeting right about SNL: it wasn’t funny, FCC should investigate, Lorne was over. Watching Alec Baldwin do his thing, it almost felt like bear baiting. It was so fun to watch the back and forth, and don’t anticipate that they’re going to pull back.”Politicians have also appeared as hosts or in cameos. Al Gore, John McCain, Jesse Jackson and Sarah Palin have all featured. Trump hosted in 2004 and, more controversially, in 2015 during his presidential run. Hillary Clinton appeared multiple times, including alongside her impersonator, Kate McKinnon, andKamala Harris took partbefore last year’s election.The show picked up 12 Emmys recently for its 50th season and anniversary programming, including an award for outstanding variety special. Saturday’s episode will be scrutinised closely for how it deals with Trump’s attack on comedy, free expression and democracy – and whether it can make a serious point in a funny, unsanctimonious way.View image in fullscreenLorne Michaels and Colin Jost in the press room with Emmy awards this year.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesMorrison continues: “Lorne and his very smart writers will come up with some clever but on-the-nose way of dealing with this. The thing that it’s important to remember about Lorne is he’s been doing this for so many decades. He’s outlasted so many slates of executives. He’s a survivor. As Conan [O’Brien] told me, in the Game of Thrones of show business, Lorne would be the last man standing.“That isn’t to say that he’s going to cave but he will figure out a way to address this and stay on the air. I also don’t think the people at NBC or Comcast or the FCC are going to mess with him. He’s too much of a statesman in the TV business. But he’s going to come up with a way of dealing with it and addressing it and he’ll be funny about it.”Conservatives have long accused SNL of bias, arguing that the show disproportionately lampoons right-leaning figures while going easier on Democrats. Former head writer Tina Fey openly acknowledged a “liberal bias”in a 2003 interview, fueling the narrative. But Michaels insists that it is nonpartisan and willing to mock both sides.Morrison adds: “It isn’t to say he would ever be an apologist for the Trump regime; nobody could have expected that politics would jump the shark in quite this way. But he certainly would not hesitate to make fun of Democrats even now if they merit it and that’s part of it.“To quoteJim Downey, one of the show’s longtime writers, you never want the show to seem like it’s the comedy division of the DNC [Democratic National Committee]. Lorne is committed to that and that will help here as well.”David Litt, aformer speechwriter for Barack Obama dubbed “the comic muse for the president” for his work onWhite House Correspondents’ Association dinnermonologues, acknowledges that he has been on the receiving end.“I was in the audience at SNL when their cold open was about the Obamacare website crashing,” he said. “I was working at the White House at the time and I remember thinking, I’m not having fun. Everyone else in the audience seemed be having a better time than I was.”Writing comic material under time pressure is tough, Litt says, and that will be the SNL team’s top priority for the new season. He said: “This is a show that rises to a pretty intense challenge every week and I assume they’re going to be thinking about rising to the exact same challenge, which is, how do we turn around a show that is good and funny because that’s hard enough without having the president of the United States breathing down your neck.“That’s part of what infuriates Trump so much about comedians. It’s not that they’re making fun of him, it’s that the audience is laughing. It’s connecting. If Kimmel or Colbert or weekend update was making a joke about Trump and the audience was rejecting that joke, I don’t think Trump would care. It’s the fact that it exposes him as still, despite everything, a fundamentally laughable person, or at least a human person.”Litt, whose new book,It’s Only Drowning, is about his unlikely friendship with a Joe Rogan fan, adds: “I can’t imagine that people are going to be sitting around a writers’ room saying, how do we address this as though they were journalists. I think they’re saying, how do we do funny stuff? Because doing funny stuff is really hard.”SNL has already used up one potential Trump gag. Its cold open on 9 November last year, the first weekend after Trump won the presidential election, was entitled SNL for Trump and had cast members sarcastically trying to get on Trump’s good side, singing: “We will, whatever you want.” The sketch was a satirical take on the public figures and institutions that had shifted their stances or expressed deference to Trump for political or personal gain.Bill Carter, author of the book The Late Shift and executive producer of the CNN docuseries The Story of Late Night, says: “The gauntlet has been thrown now and, if they don’t do something, they will disappoint people. People will be expecting their take and their take won’t be the most obvious one. It’ll be some creative way of approaching it. They have a very good Trump right now so they ought to use him.”Saturday Night Live: the 10 best sketches from the 50th seasonRead moreTrump has frequently railed against SNL over the years and is likely to be watching its return with fingers poised for a hot take on the cold open. But like Morrison, Carter thinks it unlikely that SNL will suffer the same fate as Colbert or Kimmel.“Unlike those shows, Trump cannot say this has terrible ratings and does not make money,” he says. “Saturday Night Live does not have terrible ratings. In fact, with the right host, it will often be among the most watched shows on television. And it has the best demographics on any show on television except for sports.“The idea that they would abandon that show is nuts, because if they did, some streaming service would say, we’ll put on Saturday Night Live. It’s 50 years that show’s been on. It’s had an audience all those times of a new generation of viewers. It continues to do that so it’s a tremendously valuable franchise. NBC is not walking away from that show. I don’t care what pressure they put on it.”Explore more on these topicsSaturday Night LiveTV comedyComedyTelevisionUS televisionUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a double-bill inspired by the cycle of myths about the cursed Oedipus (Frank Blake), his wife, Jocasta (Eileen Walsh), and their children, Marina Carr expands on herearlier reckonings with Greek tragedy.Drawing here on the Theban plays of Sophocles andEuripides, Carr gives her characters freedom to expand beyond those sources, testing the limits of received ideas about morality, punishment and above all, the existence of powers – god or gods – beyond this world.Lavishly produced with a cast of 16, the majestic scale of the staging by director Caitríona McLaughlin and set designer Cordelia Chisholm does justice to Carr’s ambition. Shimmering silver curtains reveal a raised stone slab and a suspended ceiling, demarcating the palace of Thebes and the gods’ realm, with mirrored projections creating a dual perspective. Rippling lighting (Jane Cox) and video design (Dick Straker), ethereal vocals and thrumming depth-charges of music and sound (Carl Kennedy) add ominous tones.View image in fullscreenExpansive … The Boy at the Abbey, Dublin.Photograph: Ros KavanaghJocasta is the protagonist here, alternately wittily acerbic and anguished in Walsh’s magnetic performance. The queen who gives away her baby son, Oedipus, only to marry him years later is portrayed as a woman who rails against anyone who tries to control her, whether gods, “the shower above”, or men. The central drama of The Boy focuses on the shocked realisation by Jocasta and Oedipus that in trying to thwart the prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother, Oedipus has fulfilled it.“You are my husband,” Jocasta says, in a riveting scene, raw in its sexual and emotional charge, as they try to understand how much they had already guessed about each other. In the second play, The God and His Daughter, Jocasta follows the now blind Oedipus into exile at Colonos, the tension between them curdling into mutual accusation and recrimination, closer to marital bickering than the obsessive passion that went before.View image in fullscreenTense … Éilish McLaughlin and Frank Blake in The God and His Daughter.Photograph: Ros KavanaghWith the dramatic momentum stalling, part two offers a commentary on the action and its violent aftermath in Thebes, with snatches of other Greek myths narrated, unpicked and questioned. While underlining Carr’s point that there is no definitive version of a myth, with every retelling a creative act in itself, there is a sense of treading water. In the next generation, even the much-dramatised confrontation between the couple’s daughter, Antigone, and her uncle, Creon, seems sketchy, with Antigone (Éilish McLaughlin) motivated by her ambition to be queen rather than considerations of divine rites and conscience.While The Shee (Olwen Fouéré), a steely messenger from the gods, warns this cursed family they will not escape their fate, her fellow immortals seem far less interested in “the clodhoppers”. Played with delicious comedy by Catherine Walsh, Amy Conroy and Jolly Abraham in absurd puffed-up costumes, these gods are portrayed as decadent, pampered creatures, having difficulty keeping track of events on earth. With Carr’s ironic humour making a welcome return, they slyly remind us that figures of fun can wield frightening amounts of power – even if nobody believes in them.At theAbbey, Dublin, until 1 November.Dublin theatre festivalcontinues until 12 October.Explore more on these topicsTheatreMarina CarrSophoclesEuripidesIrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

Everything is open again and the intense heat, which seems to ooze out of the walls and up from the pavements in summer, has mellowed to pleasantly warm. It’s the perfect temperature for languishing on a cafe terrace with the sun tickling your skin as afternoon slips into evening. Noise levels are back to normal, which means cacophonous.It feels like the entire population is out on the streets, catching up with their friends and chatting about all the things they want to do, the films they want to see, the new bars they’ve heard about and the restaurants they fancy trying over the next few months. If you could do with a boost, spend a few days in the Spanish capital this autumn.The dazzling light and clear blue skies lift your mood as soon as you arrive. Madrid being the highest major capital city in Europe may have something to do with that. It is a comparatively young capital too. Arabs from north Africa settled here in the ninth century, building a citadel where the royal palace and Almudena cathedral are now, but Madrid only really got going when Philip II moved his court here from Toledo in 1561, establishing the city as the new capital of Spain.View image in fullscreenPlaza Mayor, Madrid’s main public square, at dusk.Photograph: Jorg Greuel/Getty ImagesTo get a sense of the city’s history, walk from the Puerta del Sol – the centre not just of Madrid but the whole of Spain – to the 17th-century Plaza Mayor, which is framed by redbrick buildings with slate roofs and spindly spires. Then stroll along Cava Baja, the curving street that follows the course of the 12th-century city wall. Vestiges survive in the basements of several bars and restaurants that originated as inns and taverns for the merchants and travellers who arrived by stagecoach.In Madrid, you absorb the city’s heritage just by walking around. In the Barrio de las Letras, or literary quarter, the bar-lined streets are named after the great writers who lived there in the 16th and 17th centuries, such as Miguel de Cervantes, Francisco de Quevedo and Lope de Vega.Walk in, find yourself a place at the bar and you’ll wonder why you don’t live in MadridYou could spend weeks in the city’s big three museums –Prado,Thyssen-BornemiszaandReina Sofia– but try to fit in some others too. TheReal Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernandogets a fraction of the visitors, despite being just off the Puerta del Sol and having astounding collections that include Goya, El Greco, Picasso and Francisco de Zurbarán.This autumn I’m looking forward to theSuma Flamencafestival (14 Oct-2 Nov), where leading flamenco dancers, singers and musicians will be performing new work such asFlamenco Gospel by Juan Carmona. The main festival venue is theTeatros del Canal, an arts complex designed by Juan Navarro Baldeweg, one of Spain’s most renowned architects, who is also an artist (an exhibition of his work is on atCentro Centrountil 14 December). The Teatros del Canal is also a hub for theFestival de Otoño, (6-30 Nov), one of the cultural highlights of the year, with theatre, music and more by Spanish and international artists.The Chamberí district, where the Teatros del Canal is found, is in a less touristy area, just north of downtown. The most traditional and characterful areas of the city, considered the homes of a “pure” and distinctive Madrileño spirit, are calledbarrios castizos –and Chamberí certainly fits that description. Base yourself here for a more authentic feel – try the palatial and stylishOne Shot Fortunyhotel, which has doubles from around £160 room-only in October.As you explore, take in the flowers spilling over the wrought-iron balconies and the gleaming fruit and vegetables outside little shops (particularly the mushrooms at this time of year) and peer into the tiny, tiled bars where locals are having a quick coffee or beer. Walk in, find yourself a place at the bar and you’ll wonder why you don’t live in Madrid.View image in fullscreenThe Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando.Photograph: Wiskerke/AlamyTrafalgar, the part of Chamberí closest to the centre, is fast becoming one of the most fashionable parts of town, but still has a laid-back, family vibe. I’ve been meeting friends in the Plaza de Olavide for decades and seen it undergo umpteen makeovers.Eight streets flow into the square, bringing a constant stream of people searching for friends and dragging chairs to form messy configurations of all ages that change constantly as the night wears on. It’s normal to arrange to meet one friend here, and end up with a table of 10.New bars, restaurants, galleries and boutiques are opening in traditional premises here, but I love that the people behind them are keeping the original fixtures and fittings or hunting down zinc or steel counters and revamping old bar stools to recreate thecastizocharacter, while also adding their own contemporary vibe. Pop intoBar Trafalgarfor a cocktail – or maybe a vermouth and a smoked ham and cheese toasted sandwich – and you’ll get the idea. It’s the kind of place that works at any time of day or night. I love theOlavide Bar de Librostoo, both a bookshop and a cafe – browsing books and sipping a glass of wine are two of my favourite things.Also on my list this autumn isInternational Architecture Week(until 13 Oct, although some exhibitions run beyond that date). The programme includes an Álvaro Siza exhibition (until 9 Jan 2026) at the Colegio Oficial de Arquitectos de Madrid, a short stroll from the Plaza de Olavide. This is followed byMadrid Otra Mirada(16-19 Oct), when you can visit historic buildings and gardens that are not usually open to the public.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Madrid is all about going with the flow. Drift aroundParque del Buen Retirofor a couple of hours, taking in the startlingly vivid magenta and ochre tones of the oak, chestnut and willow trees. Exit the park on the east side, where Calle de Ibiza and the surrounding streets have become a gastronomic hotspot. I love tapas at the bar atLa CatapaorLa Taberna de Rox, although both also have tables if you want to rest tired feet.There’s a lot to see and do at this time of year, but don’t  pack your days with plans. Madrid is all about going with the flowFor more autumnal hues, it’s now a lot easier to visit the elegantCampo del Morogardens, which slope down from theroyal palaceto the Manzanares River. There used to be only one entrance, down by the river – which always felt like too much of a hike after traipsing around the palace. A lot of people weren’t aware that the gardens were open to visitors. Now, thank goodness, you can get in from the top end, from the Cuesta de San Vicente or the Cuesta de la Vega, which is really handy if you are going to theRoyal Collections Galleryas there is direct access.If you haven’t been to Madrid for a few years, this museum, which opened in 2023, is a must, with paintings by Bosch, Titian, Velázquez and Goya as well as a vast array of treasures collected by Spanish monarchs over the centuries, housed in a spectacular building designed by Emilio Tuñón and Luis Moreno Mansilla.View image in fullscreenPlaza de Olavide, Chamberi.Photograph: AlamyWalk down through the gardens – maybe stopping for a drink on thecafe terraceat the bottom – and cross the river to reach theCasa de Campo, the largest green space in Madrid. I rarely get beyond the lake, where there is a string of restaurants with tons of outdoor tables. A plate of garlic prawns with fried eggs atVilla Verbenainvariably seems like an excellent idea at this point. It’s worth going just for the view of the Madrid skyline.Back in the centre, head for Lavapiés, which is one of the mostcastizoneighbourhoods in Madrid but also the most international, with a huge range of places to eat and drink. Not that you need any excuse for a night out here, but theTapapiéstapas and music festival (16-26 October) is a particularly good time for a mooch around. More than 100 bars and restaurants are taking part and are offering a tapa and a beer for €3.50. There’s going to be live music, dancing, processions and kids’ activities too. If all that’s not a good enough reason to book a stay, I don’t know what is.Explore more on these topicsMadrid holidaysSpain holidaysCity breaksEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One insurance policy for life, death and everything in between! One pan lid for all the pans! Wouldn’t that be great? That’s what the burrito, with its multiple ingredients swaddled in tortilla, promises. Except that I haven’t always loved the heft of them and the way the flavours merge too readily.

Add a half-teaspoon of smoked paprika, a quarter-teaspoon of garlic powder, half a teaspoon of cumin, a tablespoon of chipotle in adobo, half a teaspoon of salt and two tablespoons of the oil, and toss so the tofu is well coated.Put a teaspoon of rapeseed oil in a pan on a medium heat, add the pumpkin seeds and a big pinch of salt, and toast for two to three minutes, until they are golden and popping. Tip out on to a plate and sprinkle over the lime zest.Put two tablespoons of rapeseed oil in the same pan on a medium heat, then fry the tofu, turning occasionally, for 10 minutes, until crisp and golden. Tip out on to a second plate.Pour the beans and their liquid into a saucepan, add the remaining half-teaspoon each of cumin and paprika, the last quarter-teaspoon of garlic powder, two tablespoons of the lime juice and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, and warm through gently for five minutes, mashing a few beans as you go.In a small bowl, make a chipotle mayonnaise by mixing the mayonnaise with the remaining tablespoon each of lime juice and chipotle in adobo.Just before serving, peel, stone and slice the avocado, and warm the tortillas until they’re soft and pliable.To assemble, spread a tablespoon of mayo in a horizontal line down the centre of each tortilla. Following the same line, add a quarter of the avocado slices, spoon over a quarter of the beans and a quarter of the tofu, then sprinkle over a quarter of the toasted pumpkin seeds and coriander.Fold the left and right sides of the tortilla over the edges of the filling, then fold up the bottom of the tortilla and roll it away from you.
