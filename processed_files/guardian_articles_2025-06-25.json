In fact,Keir Starmerwill have been thrilled with the timing. OK, he may have to swallow his pride and indulge in the by now obligatory Sunbed God idolatry to which every Nato leader has now signed up. But at least he didn’t have to face the embarrassment of a 120-and-growing rebellion by his own backbenchers over the welfare bill. Weirdly, cutting benefits to people unable to wash themselves wasn’t the reason why many Labour MPs went into politics.So, for the second week running, Starmer’s duties were transferred to the more than capable hands ofAngela Rayner. Though she may feel that the prime minister must now owe her a favour or three given the circumstances. Ange might have known exactly what was coming at her but that didn’t mean she had to enjoy it, even if she could allow herself one of her favourite pleasures of taking the piss out of the Tories. Although it is a bit like stealing sweets from children given the current state of the Conservative party.Starmer’s absence meant that Kemi Badenoch was also obliged to send out a deputy. This might be called sub-optimal for the Tory leader, because her replacements – even Chris Philp – invariably outperform her. Largely because they are at least capable of sticking to one subject and talking in full sentences. Though this is a low bar. Kemi did promise she would improve atPMQsweek on week but I’m not sure she meant by not showing up. She says it best when she says nothing at all.This week, following the unwritten rule of Anyone But Robert Jenrick, the shadow chancellor,Mel Stride, was given his chance at the dispatch box. This in itself was slightly problematic. Not because the Melster is a bit of a plodder at heart – no one would ever dream of asking him to multitask – but because having someone with a little insider knowledge is equivalent to shooting yourself in the foot.Stride may not be aware of the irony of a former work and pensions secretary moaning about years of spiralling benefits bills, but everyone else in the chamber certainly was. It’s hard to take the Melster seriously at the best of times. Even more so when he’s trying to be serious and speak with the air of authority. Long before the end, he sounded like someone who was merely going through the motions and knew he was unlikely to get another call-up any time soon.Then again, Angela didn’t sound as if her heart was totally in it, either. She’s professional enough to parrot the party line more or less convincingly, but the Ange of a few years ago would have been one of the first to man the barricades against the welfare bill. We weren’t quite in gritted teeth territory, but not far off. Still, things could have been worse. She could have been the work and pensions secretary. Liz Kendall looked the picture of misery as she sat silently on the Labour frontbench. Lost in a private hell. Occasionally looking anxiously at her phone. Presumably checking to see if her shrink had replied to her WhatsApp for an urgent appointment.The resulting session was all a bit under-powered. Anaemic. Two deputies who would rather have been elsewhere going through the motions. The Melster tried to stick to his questions. Why was the government rushing through with the bill, when the Tories would have cut the welfare budget by far more? Uh, hello? Wasn’t this the same Mel who was in charge when the welfare budget rose to record levels? Mel shook his head. He was certain it had been another Mel who had done that. The thought of there being two Melsters running around in ever-decreasing circles in Westminster would be one of Dante’s nightmares.Rayner just held the line. The welfare reforms were necessary. The second reading would go ahead next Tuesday. She said that because she could hardly say otherwise. But no one took her seriously. The chances of the government not pulling the bill if it’s odds on it will lose are nil. Better to lose face than to risk totally undermining the prime minister’s authority. But no need to rush into things. Leave it as late as possible to minimise the damage. If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well it were done as late as possible. Still, the good news for Ange was that no Labour backbenchers had it in for her over welfare. Why shoot the messenger?Over in The Hague, Keir looked totally knackered as he gave his end-of-Nato press conference. The past year has not been kind to him. He has aged a decade in just 12 months. His eyes have deadened and he appears not to have had a good night’s sleep in weeks. Power commands its price and Starmer was paying for it as he tried to talk up the summit. His role in it. That it was totally normal for Donald Trump to have come into it questioning article 5 and accusing the Pentagon of fake news for suggesting the American bombing raid may have set back the Iranian nuclear programme by only a few months.For Keir there was only unfriendly fire from the British media. Was he concerned that there was no mention of Russia in the final communique? Was this an Agent Orange thing? Not at all, Keir said. Just an oversight. Nato was more committed to Ukraine than ever. It was the dialectics at work. The less they said about Russia, the more serious they were.The rest of the questions were on the welfare bill. Nato was so last week. What was he going to do? Was he effectively on the way out already? Was his authority shot? No. But he was. Out on his feet. Keir could do with a few days off. A chance to regather his thoughts. But he wasn’t going to get it. Not till August. For now the show must go on. Tuesday could look after itself.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe politics sketchAngela RaynerMel StridePMQscommentShareReuse this content"

Oh god, I loved him so much’In this deeply moving and cathartic film, the presenter confronts his father’s death by going on a holy pilgrimage … and ends up releasing his soul in the sacred river. BeautifulChitra RamaswamyWed 25 Jun 2025 17.00 EDTShareThree years ago Amol Rajan’s father died unexpectedly of pneumonia. Ever since, as the BBC journalist and broadcaster puts it at the start of Amol Rajan Goes to the Ganges, “I’ve been in a bit of a funk.” I get it. As a fellow second-generation kid of Indian immigrants (and journalist from southwest London to boot) I, too, have been in a funk since my mother died (two years before Rajan’s father, at the same age, 76, as him). In Rajan’s case, his grief plunges him into a search for belonging and an attempt to reconnect with his Hindu roots. Where might such a quest take him? To the largest gathering of humanity on earth. TheKumbh Mela, where over 45 days at the start of this year half a billion Hindus gathered on the sacred banks of the Ganges. The question Rajan poses, and it’s a pertinent one for many, is whether “an atheist like me can benefit from a holy pilgrimage”.This is the deeply personal premise of what turns into an intimate, moving, entertaining yet oddly depoliticised documentary considering both the day job(s) of its presenter and the fact that the Kumbh Mela is the world’s biggest Hindu festival, funded by a prime minister whose success is built on his identity as a Hindu nationalist strongman. Only once is Narendra Modi mentioned, halfway through, and it’s in the context of his government investing £600m in the biggest Kumbh Mela to date: a mega-event owing to a specific celestial alignment that occurs once in 144 years. We know, watching Rajan’s film in the aftermath, thatat least 30 people were killedand many more injured in terrifying crowd crushes. As much as he is spiritually shaken, even altered, by the experience, he’s also traumatised by what he sees. “The people in front of me were just stepping on women,” Rajan says after he and his fixer are forced to turn back due to reports of a stampede 800 metres ahead. “Lots of very poor, very old, very fragile, possibly quite sick women … they were like human debris on the floor. Kids as well.”View image in fullscreenRajan and his festival fixer, Sumit Tyagi, at the Kumbh Mela.Photograph: BBC/Wildstar FilmsBefore he flies to Delhi, Rajan returns to his childhood. Born in Kolkata, he was three years old when his family moved to southwest London in 1986. On the three-year anniversary of his dad’s death, he goes home to Tooting with his mum. “This was my field of dreams,” he says wistfully as they drive past the pitch where he played cricket as a boy. “You were very chubby … pleasantly plump,” his mum recalls with a giggle. The loving, mischief-laden sparring between mother and son make for the most touching moments. Like when Rajan’s mother watches him flip a dosa and quips: “You are already getting spiritually enhanced!” Or when he jokily asks, “Do you want me to come back a mystical yogi?” and his mum gets serious and says, “No. I want you to be calmer, to take life in your stride.”What emerges, above all, is how grief-stricken Rajan is by his father’s death. “I’ve avoided thinking about him because I found it too painful,” he admits, sitting on a bench with his mum overlooking the Thames where they scattered his ashes (the exact same stretch where we scattered my mother’s ashes). Weeping over a framed portrait of his father, the rawness of the loss overwhelms him. “I really miss that smile,” Rajan says. “I miss his love. Oh god, I loved him so much.”View image in fullscreenHigh as a kite … Rajan is blown away by all the men who look like his father.Photograph: BBC/Wildstar FilmsIn India, the documentary ups its pace as Rajan heads for the city of Prayagraj, joining the millions of Hindu pilgrims seeking moksha (liberation from the cycle of birth and death and the end of suffering). He spends the night in an ashram withsadhuswho, hilariously, stay up on their phones watching YouTube and WhatsApping videos to one another. He’s astonished by the magnitude of the megacity temporarily built on 15 square miles of flood plain to house the Kumbh Mela – the 30 pontoon bridges, 250 miles of road and 150,000 toilets. He’s just as blown away by all the men who look like his father.The pilgrimage to the Sangam – the sacred confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati river – takes three days. Along the way Rajan, a congenial, very English guide, becomes more and more introspective. He puts on orange robes, talks to pilgrims in the smattering of Hindi he’s barely spoken since childhood, and begins to feel a “tremendous affinity and fellow feeling with others”. It’s moving and subtly handled. By the end Rajan has failed to make it to the Sangam because of the dangerous crowd surges. Instead he performs an ancient funeral rite for his father, finds a safe spot to enter the Ganges, releases his dad’s soul and plunges underwater. Has the atheist been healed by the largest gathering of people ever recorded in history? Kind of. “There’s a power in doing something that a lot of people have done for a very long time,” is how he carefully puts it, high as a kite. What Amol Rajan Goes to the Ganges expresses most powerfully of all, certainly to this fellow bereaved Hindu, are the irresolvable particularities, and commonalities, of second-generation grief.Amol Rajan Goes to the Ganges aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsKumbh MelaTV reviewTelevisionIndiaHinduismNarendra ModiReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

It failed to beatDonald Trump, a twice impeached convicted felon, and lost both chambers of Congress. Since November,Democratshave been searching for a path out of the wilderness. On Tuesday, they found one.But instead ofcelebrating Zohran Mamdani’sapparent victory in the New York mayoral primary election, the first major Democratic contest since Trump’s win, many in the party establishment went into panic mode.Mamdani, 33, a self-described democratic socialist who would be the first Muslim mayor of America’s biggest city, represents a unique threat to the entitled elites, gerontocrats and consultants who have helped take Democrats’approval rating to a record low of 29%.His defeat ofAndrew Cuomo, a 67-year-old from a political dynasty vying to come back from a sexual harassment scandal, could hardly have been better scripted as a pivot point for Democrats who ruined their brand by closing ranks to cover up concerns over former president Joe Biden’s decline.View image in fullscreenAndrew Cuomo at his election night event in New York on Tuesday.Photograph: Adam Gray/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesCuomo, bankrolled by corporate donors and endorsed by former president Bill Clinton and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, personified the twitching tail of a dying animal. Mamdani, anaspiring rapperturned state politician backed by congresswomanAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow New Yorker, represented a dare to imagine what a post-Trump future might look like.“What’s happening in NYC is a blaringly loud message to those in the Dem establishment who still cling to old politics, recite focus-grouped talking points, and are too afraid to say what needs to be said,” tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to former president Barack Obama.It was a campaign that triangulated ground game,digital styleand policy substance. Mamdani was a shoe leather candidate who put himself all over the city, talked to countless voters, projected optimism without sounding preachy and had thousands of volunteers knocking on doors multiple times.He also learned from Ocasio-Cortez’s mastery of the attention economy. Where otherDemocratsseem contrived and cringy on social media, Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez are of a generation that swims naturally in such waters, proving that you cannot fake authenticity.Born in Uganda to a family of Indian descent, he is a cosmopolitan and charismatic New Yorker. In November, a week after Trump’s victory, he went to Queens and the Bronx with a microphone and interviewed working class New Yorkers about why they voted for Trump or did not vote at all. Avideo of the exchangeshas 2.7m views on the X social media platform.View image in fullscreenZohran Mamdani celebrates with his mother, Mira Nair, his wife, Rama Duwaji, and his father, Mahmood Mamdani, after midnight on Wednesday.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianOn New Year’s Day, dressed in full suit and tie save for bare feet, he ran into freezing waters off Coney Island then strolled along the beach talking policy andtweeted some pleasingly bad puns: “I’m freezing … your rent as the next mayor of New York City. Let’s plunge into the details.”For all Democrats’ angst over messaging, none of it matters if the policies fail to resonate. The Democratic party has come to be seen as the party of the college-educated elites, something that Trump, with no sense of self-irony as a millionaire New Yorker, has exploited to maximum effect with blue-collar voters.But Mamdani evidently struck a chord in a city feeling the pinch ofthe affordability crisis. The average Manhattan rent now stands at $5,000 a month. His proposals include freezing rent for many New Yorkers, free bus service and universal childcare paid for by new taxes on the rich.When Trump identified some of the frustrations and offered fake populism, he was twice rewarded with the White House. When Mamdani offers solutions that would be regarded as mainstream in many European countries, he is demonised as an extremist. On Wednesday, the New York Times newspapercharacterised him as“running on a far-left agenda” while the front page of Rupert Murdoch’s New York Postdeclared: “NYC SOS. Who will save city after radical socialist batters Cuomo in Dem mayoral primary?”Mamdani showed the value of fearlessness. A staunch supporter of Palestinian rights, he has called Israel’s actions in Gaza a “genocide”, joined a hunger strike outside the White House calling for a ceasefire and championed the cause ofMahmoud Khalil, a student activist at Columbia University who spent more than three months in detention on the orders of a federal judge.View image in fullscreenMamdani announces a hunger strike to demand that Joe Biden ‘call for a permanent ceasefire and no military aid to Israel’ in Washington DC on 27 November 2023.Photograph: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc/Getty ImagesCuomo and his allies’ efforts to portray Mamdani as antisemitic fell flat. There is a lesson for Democrats who denied a Palestinian American a speaking slot at their national convention last year and saw Kamala Harris lose to Trump in the Arab-majority suburb of Dearborn in Michigan, potentially costing her the crucial swing state of Michigan.Expect the Democratic establishment to fight back, just as Hillary Clinton did against senator Bernie Sanders’s insurgent candidacy in 2016 (Sanders endorsed Mamdani). They fear the loss of the control they have long enjoyed. They also fear that Republicans and rightwing media will cast Mamdani, Ocasio-Cortez and the rest as radical Marxists, as sure to lose elections as Britain’s Jeremy Corbyn.Matt Bennett, a cofounder of the centrist thinktank Third Way,wrote on social mediathat it is “dangerous to believe a NYC Dem primary offers a roadmap for winning” in swing or conservative places and urged Democrats to follow moderates, “not the siren call” of socialism. He added: “Mamdani diagnosed the right problem: the affordability crisis facing the working class. But he has the wrong solutions: his ideas can’t work and would make matters worse.”View image in fullscreenCampaign memorabilia adorn an election night watch party for Zohran Mamdani in New York on Tuesday.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianThere will certainly be much debate over whether New York City, a Democratic stronghold with many distinct characteristics, is a useful template for candidates in cities, towns and rural areas the length and breadth of the country. “As New York goes, so goes the nation,” is not really a thing.Even so, after six months of anguished soul searching, Democrats now have one answer. Some don’t like it. Mamdani – likely be the favourite in November’s general election for mayor – signifies a generational change and rebuke to a party establishment grown complacent and hypocritical in its deference to figures such as the Clintons, Biden and Cuomo despite their obvious flaws.The odds ofOcasio-Cortez, currently 35, running for and winning the Democratic nomination in 2028 just got shorter. It is a leap of political imagination for America that progressives would savour – but so, too, would the Republican election machine.Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniNew YorkUS politicsDemocratsanalysisShareReuse this content"

For some, it was simply too timely. After all, it’s one thing to release a film about tech billionaires fighting over the remnants of a world ravaged by war and AI, but quite another to do it while that exact thing was really happening.For others, Mountainhead marked the point where ultra-rich antiheroes reached full saturation. Writing in theAV Clublast week, Saloni Gajjar made the argument that – between Mountainhead, Your Friends & Neighbors, The White Lotus and Nine Perfect Strangers – we have now arrived at a moment where television seems unable to tell stories that are about anything but the badly behaved rich.Tech-bro satire Mountainhead is an insufferable disappointmentRead moreGajjar’s point is well made, but I think the truth might be a little bit more insidious than that. Yes, we do appear to be in the middle of an unceasing wealth glut on television, but the problem isn’t just rich antiheroes. It’s the rich, full stop.If you watch enough TV, you might have noticed a slow creep of aspiration. Houses are getting bigger. Clothes are becoming more stylish. Home furnishings have become so universally luxe that no matter what I’m watching – Shrinking, maybe, or The Four Seasons – I’ll almost always find myself detaching from the plot to wonder where the characters bought their nice lamps.And once you start to notice it, you’ll see it everywhere. The Better Sister is a generic murder mystery that is impossible to engage with because everyone lives their lives in a heightened state of monied comfort. Sirens is a whirlwind of impeccable interiors and not much else.View image in fullscreenSarah Jessica Parker in And Just Like That.Photograph: HBONobody on And Just Like That has spent even a second worrying about money, even though Carrie Bradshaw has basically got the exact same job as me and I can barely make it halfway around Lidl without having a panic attack about exceeding my overdraft. When I watched Good American Family, my first thought wasn’t ‘How awful that these people abandoned their infant daughter alone in an apartment while they moved to Canada,’ but ‘How the hell did these people afford an entire separate apartment for their infant daughter?’And this is the problem. At least when the rich people are the baddies you can argue that the shows are attempting to make a point about them. Succession essentially trapped its characters within the confines of their wealth. They might have it all, the show said, but only because they had to cash in their souls. And whileThe White Lotushas to return to the same well too many times by dint of its format, it still has plenty to say about the wealthy. This year, especially, it was the newly wealthy. Watch how quickly Belinda, a lowly spa manager in season one, traded in all of her defining traits the moment a windfall hit her account.I’d even argue that Mountainhead didn’t qualify as wealth porn, because every single character was caught up in a frantic, exhausting status game to the exclusion of everything else in their lives. True, it featured a massive house but, as Variety’s recentgroup interviewrevealed, they only chose it because it made the cinematographer want to kill himself. I’m no expert, but I don’t think that the appeal of porn is how many suicidal tendencies it triggers.View image in fullscreenRamy Youssef in Mountainhead.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All Rights Reserved.In other words, depictions of extreme wealth on TV are OK if they have a point. All these shows had a point. Billions had a point. Even Schitt’s Creek managed to say something about money. The problem is when this wears away and characters are only rich because producers want to give the viewer something nice to look at. Sometimes this shift even happens on the same series. The Morning Show might have started as a glossy satire about Reese Witherspoon’s plucky reporter being thrust into the well-to-do world of New York media, but it lost that bite long ago. Now it exists as a weird kind of internal competition to see which character can have the shiniest hair.And it’s this Selling Sunset-ification of television that needs to stop. When we’re confronted with such an unyielding parade of upscale comfort, the effect isn’t as aspirational as producers probably think. We aren’t left with a growling envy of how the other half lives; we’re instead left worrying that they wouldn’t know what real life was like if you bonked them over the head with a Poundland flipflop. Although if anyone from The Four Seasons does want to get in touch to tell me where all their nice lamps came from (and, where possible, some acceptable Temu dupes) I’d appreciate it.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionUS televisionThe White LotusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had only shotOasisat the Q awards and live shows. In 2001, I was commissioned by a US publication for a feature about The US tour of Brotherly Love, with Oasis, the Black Crowes and Spacehog. All the bands had two brothers in them, and I had been asked to photograph the Gallaghers and the Robinsons from the Black Crowes together.The shoot was at the Scala in King’s Cross, London. It was peak Oasis, but there was no entourage, nobody watching over my shoulder. There was also literally nowhere to shoot in the venue. I ended up finding a corridor with a white wall and I thought: “I’ll try and make this look as much like a studio as possible.”I think Liam was holding a can of Red Stripe and they were smoking. I started taking shots of them all together and then, being a savvy photographer, made sure I did lots of the Gallaghers on their own. It is very rare that you see pictures of them laughing: Noel’s almost rolling his eyes. I wasn’t really tuned into what they were saying – and I might not have even been able to hear. I certainly wasn’t the one making them laugh.I was chuffed to get the chance to shoot them, but I felt like Liam had quite a front, and I couldn’t really connect with him. I remember thinking: “The shots are OK.” Now they feel a lot more classic – black and white, very contrasty – but that’s something that only happens with the passing of time.‘I thought Noel was the tour manager’Chris FloydView image in fullscreen‘Every phone call was the same: “All right, seen our kid? OK, bye”’ … Noel in 1994 by Chris Floyd.Photograph: Chris FloydBack at the very start of my career, when I was 25, I knew an art director who was working on a new magazine called Loaded. In May 1994, he rang and said: “I’ve got a job for you.” He gave me the address of a hotel somewhere in Manchester and told me to meet a guy called Noel Gallagher. I thought he was a tour manager, at first. Nobody said he was actually in the band.The hotel was like an Edwardian house: the place was so depressing. The receptionist had that Mancunian ambivalence, very downbeat. I said I’m here to see Noel Gallagher and she gesticulated with her thumb. So I go down this corridor, knock on the door. He answers and just goes: “All right?” That’s it, devoid of any warmth.He’d split up with his girlfriend and they’d shared a flat, so the record company were paying for him to live at the hotel. He had this little pocket address book and was making phone calls. Each one was the same: “All right, seen our kid? OK, bye.” I was sitting there like a lemon thinking: “What is ‘our kid’?” So I thought: “I’ll just take some pictures.” Then he got up and said: “Let’s go.” As we were leaving, he stopped and said: “What do you think of Blur?” And I went: “I quite like them.” “Second-best band in Britain,” he said.We walked to this street corner and then four guys came from the opposite direction. You could identify the leader from 200 yards away, because he had this unbelievable walk. It was mad experiencing that walk. I quickly gathered Noel and Liam were brothers. They spoke to each other in such a relentlessly passive aggressive way. Noel would tut and roll his eyes at everything Liam said.Liam asked me what football team I supported. I said Arsenal. He put his hand up to my face and went: “I can’t even look at you.” For the actual shoot, we went to Maine Road [then Manchester City’s home]. I got on the ground and he made as if he was kicking a football at the camera.Before that day, I had been living a very precarious existence. Afterwards, I started to get a lot of well-paid work. My wife’s best friend knows Noel and a couple of years ago we both went to a birthday dinner at her house. I said to Noel: “I often think of that photo as the day my career started.” He goes: “I’ll tell you why that’s the day your career began – because that’s the day you met Oasis.”‘They weren’t yobby – I found them quite sensitive’Kevin CumminsView image in fullscreen‘In Tokyo, fans were wearing Man City shirts’ … Liam in 1994 by Kevin Cummins.Photograph: Kevin Cummins/Iconic ImagesBands – especially ones with a pretty boy singer or a female singer – can get really nervous that the singer gets all the attention. Noel was never like that. He said: “You’ve got to use the assets you’ve got.” Liam was a really attractive young boy at the time. You put that on the cover of a paper, you’re going to sell a lot.Early on, I was asked by their label, Creation, to get Oasis used to being photographed and work out what kind of image suited them – whether we wanted a modern look or a 1960s vibe. I was from Manchester originally and Noel, Liam and I supported Manchester City, so the label thought I was the person to ease them into it. Bands are normally a little bit cocky when they first start, but Oasis weren’t. They were like: “Oh, I love those pictures you did of Joy Division.” So they were kind of in awe of me initially.In July 1994, we went to Manchester to do a big session for the NME. A couple of people at the NME were obsessed with the Beatles and wanted Oasis to be a bit like that, but I didn’t really see that in them. They weren’t yobby – they were quite sensitive, I felt – but by the same token, they were lads who went to watch football. And those were the people who liked the band.We went to Maine Road to do some photographs. This picture was taken from the steps of the entrance to the stadium. I like it because it’s very monotone. Liam’s shirt is pretty much reflected in the painted brickwork around the ground. At the time, City were sponsored by Brother, a Japanese electronics company, and to have “Brother” on the shirts was an absolute gift. We did a lot of pictures of the band in the Manchester City shirts that day. That was meant to be the cover of the NME, but my editor said: “I don’t want them to be associated with losers” – because City were about to get relegated.Even now, people associate that shirt with the band. It was interesting because football wasn’t fashionable in the way it is now – and it wasn’t glamorous at all. It was very difficult for people outside the UK to get football shirts from English clubs but in Tokyo, fans in the front four rows of their shows were wearing Man City shirts. They must have written to the club and had them imported.‘Liam looked after a woman’s kid on the plane’Tom SheehanView image in fullscreen‘I think Liam bought the top in homage to John Lennon’ … Oasis in 1994 by Tom Sheehan.Photograph: Tom SheehanIn 1994, I was chief photographer for Melody Maker and that July I flew to New York for the Maker’s first Oasis cover. We were booked on the same flight, but the band were in club class and me and the hack were in goats-and-chickens. Liam came back to say hello. He was a garrulous guy, even pre-fame. He was standing at the back of the plane having a beer and this woman came by huffing and puffing with some kids and Liam offered to look after one of them. He pulled down one of those seats the flight attendants sit on and had the girl on his lap and chatted to her. After the tales I’d heard, I’d thought I was about to spend a few days with a nutcase. But he was sweet as a nut.We were out there for four days. They were shooting a video and doing a gig. This shoot was on the third day and we’d over-grooved the night before. It was punishingly hot. We got on the subway, we walked here, walked there, looking for a location, then this woman from the label said: “I know this place.” She took us to a disused bridge. It was amazing: you can see one of the greatest cities in the world behind the band. I think Liam bought the top in homage to John Lennon. There’s a picture that Bob Gruen took of Lennon wearing a similar shirt.They’re really good people. They had a tremendous professionalism, but they always had a cheekiness, too – and such a bloody great sense of humour. Especially Liam. He’s a good laugh, a tremendous piss-taker.‘How come you never fight when I’m around?’Jill FurmanovskyView image in fullscreen‘I was like a mother figure’ … Oasis in 1995 by Jill Furmanovsky.Photograph: Jill FurmanovskyI first met Oasis when I was finishing a book called The Moment. The book started with a picture of Paul McCartney taken on an Instamatic and I was looking for an up-and-coming band to end on. I sent Oasis all the live shots I’d taken of them at their gig at the Cambridge Corn Exchange and they really liked them. From then on, I started documenting them with their blessing.This was taken in Paris the first year I was working with them, at the end of 1995. We were supposed to meet them in Noel’s room but my assistant found Liam in the bar. It appeared he’d been up all night and was still drinking. Obviously, Noel was not in the greatest mood, having been kept waiting and then seeing that Liam was somewhat inebriated.I had done several shoots with them already, but never experienced the tension between the brothers that other photographers had recorded. I used to say to them: “How come you never fight when I’m around?” This wasn’t a fight, but it was a chance to document in a subtle way the dynamics. The brothers, who are looking in opposite directions, somehow they’re touching but they’re also so separate from each other.We were pursued by paparazzi, probably British, as we were walking along the banks of the Seine, which is where this was taken. Liam was a bit merry and was saying hello to French people. He is an unpredictable soul. He’s a joy to photograph, but a challenging person all round. I was very experienced – I’d worked with the punks – so wasn’t particularly fazed. I was quite a bit older than them, like a mother figure. That was useful because all of them were more or less brought up by their mums, so they were perhaps more likely to be cooperative with an older female.My brief from Noel was to just record stuff. They knew already that they couldn’t spend hours posing for shoots with fashion accessories and so on, but Noel had the intuition that whatever was happening to them should be documented. If it had been a band that were very protective of their public image, I think the shoot would have been cancelled that day. But Oasis weren’t like that. They permitted that closeness. I felt like part of the crew. That was the great joy of photographing them.Oasis: The Masterplan by Kevin Cummins is published by Cassell. Roll With it by Tom Sheehan is published by Welbeck.

A number of cabinet ministers are now said to believe the bill has no chance of passing in its current form, though some are still being deployed to speak to angry MPs in an attempt to win them over.Keir Starmer is expected to begin speaking to MPs directly after returning from the Nato summit on Wednesday evening.The prime minister fuelled further anger within the party after he appeared to shrug off mounting Labour unrest over the proposed reforms, dismissing the backlash as “noises off” and insisting his party remains “pretty united” behind the need for change.Starmer is facing thebiggest revoltof his premiership over the welfare reform bill, which would make it harder for people to access Pip, the main disability benefit.Labour whips admitted privately they were having no success convincing MPs to withdraw their names from an amendment which would effectively kill the welfare bill next Tuesday.The rebellion is being led by select committee chairs including the Treasury select committee chair Meg Hillier and many previously loyalist Labour MPs concerned about the scale of the disability cuts.At least two more MPs were expected to sign the reasoned amendment overnight – making it at least 126 rebel Labour MPs by Thursday morning.Just one MP has withdrawn their name, despite significant pressure from whips and cabinet ministers. The chair of the environmental audit select committee Toby Perkins, a former shadow minister, is among the latest to sign the amendment.Both Starmer and the deputy prime minister,Angela Rayner, have insisted the vote will go ahead. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is understood to be particularly opposed to pulling the vote.Sources said there was a considerable difference of opinion within government. “There is a camp for pulling it, a camp for concession and a small but insane camp for ploughing on,” one said, suggesting Reeves was in the latter camp.Starmer is expected to begin speaking to MPs himself on Thursday when he returns from the Nato summit. But ministers and MPs have told the Guardian they do not believe the government has the option to press ahead with the bill in the face of such unrest.One frontbench source said: “I don’t believe there is a way to win this vote without offering a concession that can peel away a big chunk of those rebels.”Angela Rayner says welfare cuts vote will go ahead as Labour rebellion growsRead moreChief whip Alan Campbell has been telling MPs the government needs to “ameliorate” the situation. “That’s not going to be enough,” one rebel said.MPs have said they expect ministers and other frontbenchers to resign if no changes are made.One said: “The PM’s determination to push ahead has gone down like a cold cup of sick. The [frontbenchers] who were hoping that today [Wednesday] would see some kind of concession are now being put in a difficult position by him – and the whips know about some of them.”One senior government source said concessions would be presented to MPs by Friday at the latest, in order to give the PM time to consider them and then to give MPs time to reflect on them over the weekend.Speaking at the Nato summit in The Hague, Starmer rejected suggestions he lacked political instinct, pointing to Labour’s landslide election win as proof of his judgment.Asked if he had failed to read the mood of his MPs on welfare, he said critics had made similar predictions before and had been proved wrong.“I’m comfortable reading the room and delivering the change the country needs,” he said.“We’ve got a strong Labour government with a huge majority to deliver on our manifesto commitments. And that’s the work that we did over many years to win the election.“Now we start the work over many years to change the country. Having changed the party, we now change the country.“And is it tough going? Are there plenty of people and noises off? Yes, of course, there always are, there always have been, there always will be. But the important thing is to focus on the change that we want to bring about.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If they are joined by the Liberal Democrats, it further increases the likelihood of selection.But MPs say the intention of the amendment was to demonstrate the breadth of opposition to the bill – and that it should be taken as an indication of those prepared to vote against the government on the entire bill.It is so far unclear whether the Tories would abstain, as the government views their conditions for backing the bill as undeliverable. They have asked for an undertaking from Starmer that the bill will reduce the welfare budget, get people into work and not necessitate a rise in taxes.1:06PMQs: Rayner confirms welfare cuts vote will go ahead next week – videoAt his press conference, Starmer defended the proposals as necessary to build a “fairer and more efficient” system and said they were squarely in line with Labour’s manifesto mandate.He said Labour was the best party toreform welfare. “The argument I would make is that it is a Labour government that should reform welfare,” he said.“If the welfare system isn’t working for those that need it, and it is not, it’s a Labour government that should make it work for the future.“Just as it was a Labour government that created the welfare system, it falls to this Labour government to make sure we’ve got a welfare system that’s sustainable for the future to come.“We created the health service, and now we have to ensure that it’s fit for the future. Same with welfare. That is a progressive argument, that is a Labour argument, and it’s the right argument to make.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareKeir StarmerBenefitsLabourAngela RaynernewsShareReuse this content"

It was, he said, “something that no one really thought possible. And they said: ‘You did it, sir, you did it’. Well, I don’t know if I did it … but I think I did.”Though the headline commitment is for Nato members to commit to increasing defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, it will consist of 3.5% in core military spending and the rest in infrastructure, intelligence, cybersecurity and other spending that allies can already match. It means a real-terms increase of about £30bn in the UK after 2027.Wednesday briefing: Why N​ato is rolling out the red carpet for Donald Trump at key summitRead moreTrump described this as “the Hague defence commitment”, saying it was “a monumental win for the United States, because we were carrying more than our fair share” and “a big win for Europe and for actually western civilisation” because Europe would now be “stepping up to take more responsibility”.The US president has long been a sharp critic of the low levels of defence spending by other Nato members, and at the 2018 summit hinted the US might quit the alliance. During his 2024 election campaign, Trump suggested the US might not defend a country being attacked if it were spending less than previously agreed targets.Those concerns sharpened after Trump’s election win, as Europe and Canada feared that he would reduce US engagement with Nato, shift closer to Russia, abandon Ukraine and rapidly move troops out of Europe. Though the White House is cooler on Europe and Ukraine than its predecessor, a sharp rift has been averted for now.Earlier on Wednesday, Rutte offered sycophantic praise of the US president in his presence, saying that “Daddy sometimes has to use strong language” – a reference to Trump’s foul-mouthed outburst about Iran andIsraela day before. Just before heading to The Hague, Trump had accused both countries of not knowing “what the fuck they’re doing” after reports of breaches by both of a ceasefire he had imposed.The Nato secretary general defended his tone towards Trump and denied it was demeaning, though he acknowledged it was “a bit of a question of taste”. Rutte said that Trump was “a good friend” and added: “Would you ever think that this would be the result of this summit if he would not have been re-elected president?”Asked about Rutte’s comments, Trump reacted positively: “He did it very affectionately. ‘Daddy, you’re my daddy.’”A day earlier, Trump had also released a series of flattering texts from Rutte. “You are flying into another big success,” said one, linking the Nato spending commitment with the bombing of the Iranian nuclear enrichment site at Fordow, showing him buttering up the president before the meeting.The significant concession on defence spending, with most Nato countries spending a little over 2% of GDP now, was “not about US taxpayers paying more”, Rutte said – with the US nearly in line with the 3.5% military spending target – but about “Europe and Canada paying more” to, in most cases, increase their defence budgets.Trump said he had a lunchtime meeting with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, “to see how he is doing” and said in response to a question from a Ukrainian journalist that he pledged to supply Kyiv with Patriot anti-missile interceptors, some of which had been sent to Israel.“We’re going to see if we can make some available,” Trump added, after asking the reporter where she and her family were living and sending his regards to her husband, a soldier. Later when he was asked if the US would restart military aid to Ukraine, stopped under his administration, he did not rule it out entirely. “We’ll see what happens,” the president said.LiveTrump shows concern for worried BBC Ukraine reporter during press conference – videoIn his account, Zelenskyy described the meeting as productive, and said his priority was “the purchase of American air defence systems to shield our cities, our people, churches, and infrastructure” and said that Ukraine was willing to buy the equipment and “support American weapons manufacturers”.However, in his closing press conference Trump continued to emphasise, with not much more than rhetoric, that “Vladimir Putin really has to end that war” and said he would try to speak to the Russian president again “to see if we can get it ended”.The short summit communique, just five paragraphs long, did not repeat previous commitments to Ukraine’s “irreversible path” to Nato membership, reflecting the White House’s position. Trump continues to hope to persuade Moscow and Kyiv to agree to a ceasefire to halt the war, which is now in its fourth year.Criticism was reserved for Spain, which said it believes it can meet its Nato commitments by spending only 2.1% of its GDP on defence. “I think it’s terrible,” Trump said, and he threatened to “make them pay twice as much” through trade sanctions, though this is an issue negotiated at EU level.Trump digressed and failed to answer a question about the US commitment to Nato’s article 5, which says that an attack on one alliance member is considered an attack on all. Flying out to the summit on Air Force One, Trump had said “There’s numerous definitions of article 5, you know that, right?” but he never elaborated.Explore more on these topicsNatoDonald TrumpUS foreign policyIranIsraelMark RutteMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Billionaires pay “effective tax rates close to 0.3% of their wealth, well below what average workers contribute”, Oxfam said.The charity called on the UK to work with other governments to oppose “extreme inequality”, with private wealth growing eight times faster than the net wealth of governments between 1995 and 2023.Rachel Noble, a senior policy adviser at Oxfam, said: “This government is in danger of careering way off course on international development if it does not recommit to proven approaches to tackle poverty through public investment and fair taxation.“The government must fairly tax the trillions of pounds that are locked away in the bank accounts of the super-rich and prioritise the fight against inequality, gendered oppression and the climate crisis.”View image in fullscreenMinisters from Spain, Brazil, Germany and South Africa have called for a levy to counter the use of tax havens such as Monaco.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/AlamyLast year Spain, Brazil, Germany and South Africa signed a motion at the G20 fora minimum 2% taxon the super-rich to reduce inequality and raise public funds.

It often requires hospital admission. Symptoms include severe pain in the abdomen, nausea and fever.Patient information leafletsfor GLP-1 medications list pancreatitis as an “uncommon” reaction, affecting around one in 100 patients. To date, the scheme has received nearly 400 reports of acute pancreatitis from patients who have used Mounjaro, Wegovy, Ozempic and liraglutide, with nearly half (181) involving tirzepatide (Mounjaro).NHS begins mass rollout of weight-loss jabs to patients in EnglandRead moreMore than one quarter of these cases have been reported in 2025. Since the beginning of the year, there have been 22 reports of acute pancreatitis after taking semaglutide (Ozempic and Wegovy), and 101 after taking tirzepatide (Mounjaro) to the Yellow Card scheme.An MHRA spokesperson said: “Alongside increased usage, we are seeing an upturn in the number of Yellow Card reports mentioning GLP-1 medicines and acute pancreatitis.”Due to the impact of this serious disease on patients, the MHRA said it wanted to understand whether there were any genetic factors at play. It has encouraged anyone hospitalised with acute pancreatitis suspected to be related to taking these drugs to report it to the Yellow Card scheme.Healthprofessionals are also urged to report to the scheme on behalf of their patients.The MHRA will then invite those patients to take part in theYellow Card Biobank study, run by Genomics England. Participants will be asked to provide further information, alongside a saliva sample, which will be analysed by scientists.Although there is no known genetic link that increases the risk of acute pancreatitis while taking GLP-1 medicines, the MHRA said: “Sometimes genes can influence the side-effects an individual experiences when taking a medicine, so in the context of the increasing usage of these medicines and the reports of acute pancreatitis we have received, we are exploring this further.”Studies have shown that adverse reactions to medication account for one in six hospital admissions.Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA’s chief safety officer, said: “Evidence shows that almost a third of side-effects to medicines could be prevented with the introduction of genetic testing. It is predicted that adverse drug reactions cost the NHS more than £2.2bn a year in hospital stays alone.”A spokesperson for Lilly, the maker of Mounjaro, said: “Patient safety is Lilly’s top priority.“We take reports regarding patient safety seriously and actively monitor, evaluate and report safety information for all our medicines. Adverse events should be reported under the MHRA’s Yellow Card scheme, but may be caused by other factors, including pre-existing conditions.“The Mounjaro (tirzepatide) patient information leaflet warns that inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis) is an uncommon side-effect (which may affect up to 1 in 100 people). It also advises patients to talk to their doctor or other healthcare professional before using Mounjaro if they have ever had pancreatitis.”Explore more on these topicsHealthDiabetesObesityDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

But they are also leaving the door open to new tariffs on foreign steel when the current ones run out next year.Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, said: “The UK is an open trading nation but we must reconcile this with a new geopolitical reality and work in our own national interest.”He added: “Broad and complex trade deals like we secured with India will bring billions to our economy every year but to deliver [our plan], we will strike more agile, targeted deals that exploit the sectors which drive the most growth for our economy.”Since coming to office, Labour has signed dealswith the US,Indiaand theEU, none of which are fully fledged free trade agreements, even though British officials have been pushing for such deals with both the US and India for years.Conservatives have criticised the deal with India because the government gave Indian workers a tax break to finalise it – something Tory ministers had refused to do – in return for a relatively limited set of tariff reductions.Meanwhile the US deal was negotiated in such a hurry that officials on both sides arestill hagglingover some of the fine print, including whether steel tariffs will be dropped as planned.Reduced tariffs on cars and aircraft parts will come in on Monday, but the UK is still trying to assuage American concerns about the fact that Tata Steel now imports most of its raw materials from abroad.The government’s new strategy suggests it wants to sign more of these limited deals, despite their downsides, with officials arguing that this is a more realistic aim in a world where many countries are imposing new trade barriers rather than eliminating them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ministers are so concerned about protecting UK steelmaking capacity thatthey previously nationalised the British Steel works at Scunthorpe.UK Steel, a lobby group, has long called for theextension of measures to protect British steelmakers, fearing a “cliff edge” next year. However, the industry is unclear on how the government will impose quotas while still complying with rules set by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Under WTO rules, the temporary safeguards cannot be extended again.Douglas Alexander, a trade minister, said: “As we target these agreements, we will take every step necessary to safeguard British businesses from the increasingly protectionist mood in much of the world by sharpening our defensive toolkit.”Officials said however that the trade strategy reinforced Britain’s commitment to the WTO, suggesting they will look for other ways to protect the British steel industry. They said the government remained “agnostic” on how best to do so.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeEconomicsBrexitnewsShareReuse this content"

So we are very, very pleased.“The reason we got justice for Harry in the end was no thanks to the United Kingdom government; it was thanks to the British public and the media on both sides of the Atlantic, who spoke truth to power and made sure that we held them to account.”Last week, Northamptonshire police apologised for “clear and significant shortcomings” in its investigation into Dunn’s death after areviewfound the force “failed his family on a number of fronts”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsPoliceNorthamptonshireEnglandUK criminal justiceForeign policyHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

The book is “an important piece of testimony and a precious, powerful work of literature: a steady beam of light born amid darkness and violence”.Amelina “brings to her narrative the acuity of a journalist and the artistry of a born writer, making her a true heir of George Orwell”, said judging chair Kim Darroch.Meanwhile, Irish writer Donal Ryan was awarded the Orwell prize for political fiction for Heart, Be at Peace, which is set in rural Ireland and told in 21 voices. The book is a follow-up to his debut The Spinning Heart, which won the 2013 Guardian first book award.The mosaic of voices in Heart, Be at Peace becomes “a kind of simulacrum of life, as if we have been landed in this village, have a chance to overhear its inhabitants’ most private thoughts, move from one house to another, sit in the pub, discover who believes who is to blame for what, and what can be excused or forgiven,” wrote Erica Wagner in herGuardian review.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The chief executive of the British Business Bank (BBB) has spent much of his tenure attempting to revive the state-owned lender’s image after a battering from the fraud-hit pandemic loan scheme under the last government, and will soon have to defend its actions at theCovid inquiry.But until then, he can focus on the BBB’sgleefully landed fresh £10bn mandate linked tothe centrepiece industrial strategy Labour hopes will boost a flagging economyas it nears the end of its first year in power.As part ofRachel Reeves’s spending review, Taylor pitched to beef up its operations through investment plans aimed at growing startups and British businesses.“There was a menu of options that we gave to ministers,” Taylor said. “They ordered pretty much the whole menu.”With its funding capacity increased to £25.6bn from about £15.6bn, Taylor’s team has a souped-up range of investment schemes, mainly aimed at eight key sectors that ministers believe have the highest potential to drive economic growth over the next decade: advanced manufacturing, the creative industries, life sciences, clean energy, defence, digital and tech firms including artificial intelligence, financial and professional services.The BBB will now expand regional investment programmes aimed at finding promising businesses outside London, hunt for specialist fund managers to deploy its cash, and launch a turbo-charged direct investment programme that will see it take stakes of up to £60m in individual companies.That could mean taking stakes in suppliers ofsmall modular nuclear reactors, or life sciences startups working on preventive cancer treatments, Taylor said. But the aim is not to compete with private investors, but instead to act as a magnet to draw attention and “crowd-in” cash to underserved businesses.But other motivations are at play. Direct equity investments could help “anchor future superstar firms in the UK”, according to industrial strategy documents, at a time when more firms are being snapped up by foreign rivals or shifting their listings or headquarters to the US.“If there’s no UK money in these companies, they tend to gravitate to where their capital came from, and the UK economy loses those companies at the point where they become economically interesting,” Taylor said.“And so what we’re trying to do is to crowd in UK institutional money as a counterbalance to overseas money … to make sure they stay and grow and thrive in the UK.”This will mean taking a gamble with taxpayer cash. Taylor says some investments could deliver returns of up to 6% above government borrowing costs, but expects many companies it invests in will ultimately fail.“There will be quite a large number of companies that don’t make it. But for the money that we lose, we hope to make more from those that really succeed,” he said.And with the government increasingly pushing the City and regulators to take more risk, this does appear in step with Labour’s current strategy.But ministers would be wise to call for careful scrutiny given the scars on the organisation, headquartered in Sheffield, from pandemic-era problems.That includes the £47bn government-guaranteed bounce-back loans scheme, which saved small businesses across the country but alsobecame synonymous with fraud and mismanagement of taxpayer cash.It also faced fire for allowing now-disgraced lender Greensill Capital into its Covid loan programmes, through which it breached lending caps and handed £400mto embattled metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta.This week, the public accounts committee accused the government of being “dangerously flat-footed” in its approach to recovering nearly £2bn in estimated taxpayer losses from the Covid bounce-back loan scheme.The BBB also managed the former prime minister Rishi Sunak’s Future Fund, which supported startups –including companies linked to his wife, Akshata Murty– during the pandemic.While these issues pre-date Taylor’s arrival at the BBB in June 2022, they continue to loom large, with its programmes due to be scrutinised by the Covid inquiry later this year. Taylor is expected to strongly defend the BBB’s record.“I don’t think there’s a need for us to resurrect any reputation,” said Taylor, who has acknowledged having to navigate several“bruising endeavours”during his career in public service and earned £356,400 in 2024.“We’re building on an already strong reputation. And we’re going to jealously guard that reputation.“Up to 650,000 businesses and up to 3.4 million jobs were saved.“And to the extent that there was a cost in terms of credit losses and fraud losses, which are all regrettable, those represent, effectively, a business continuity insurance premium for the whole economy during a real crisis.“We’re very confident that they [the Covid inquiry] will see that there was value for money.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessEconomicsCovid inquiryLabourSpending review 2025BankingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Relatives have been killed and wounded by previous Israeli strikes, and with nowhere to go, his mother recently said it would be more merciful if they were killed by a nuclear bomb.Every morning, Mo, who has not been able to see his mother for 13 years, fears news will come that more ofhis family have been killed. “We shouldn’t wait until everyone in Gaza is dead. It’s never too late,” he said. “Something must be done. Nothing is going to stop Israel but action.”“We continue to see people killed at these so-called aid distribution points,” Rohan Talbot, the director for advocacy and campaigns at Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), told UK parliamentariansearlier this month.Talbot and representatives from other humanitarian organisations gave evidence to the foreign affairs committee about Israel’s attacks on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, including mass casualtiesat food distribution points.“The situation is completely catastrophic,” said Talbot.Throughout the conflict, the charity has sent volunteer medic teams into Gaza, who have shared testimony with the Guardian of the deliberatetargeting of healthcare workersandinfrastructure.Mo had volunteered for a trip last year which was later cancelled, which he said was a result of the IDF not allowing him to enter Gaza with Palestinian identification.The British MPLayla Moransaid Mo’s story is a heartbreaking reminder of how deeply betrayed many British Palestinians feel by their own government’s inaction.She said: “The government’s continued failure to act decisively in Gaza has allowed the horror to spiral into something unconscionable. The scale of destruction is unimaginable, and the human cost is something that can never be undone.”Moran, who is also Palestinian, met Mo afterhe operated on her last year. She has raised his case in parliament andcontinues to urge the governmentto halt all arms sales to Israel, end trade with illegal settlements and recognise the state of Palestine.Five members of biggest British Jewish body suspended after Israel criticismsRead moreA Foreign Office spokesperson said: “Reports of shootings near aid delivery centres are appalling and highlight the desperate need to get aid into Gaza. Israel must allow partners to operate in line with humanitarian principles and deliver lifesaving aid.”In May,the UK suspended trade negotiations with Israel, condemning the refusal of aid into the territory and calls by Israeli cabinet ministers to “purify Gaza” as extremist. Although Moran has welcomedthe government’s recent shift in tone, words alone, she said, are not enough.“We cannot allow history to remember us as silent when our voices could have made a difference,” said Moran.But for Mo, the UK government’s recent shift has come too little, too late.He said: “I think they should be ashamed that they have not used their leverage on Israel until now. They should be ashamed because they have power to prevent this, not only militarily but also diplomatically.”The IDF has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaForeign policyLayla MorannewsShareReuse this content"

You mean like at work?This is taking a breakfromsex.What? Who wants to do that?Er, 24% of American adults, according toa new survey.Why?Reasons vary, from “wanting to learn other forms of intimacy” to favouring “emotional closeness over physical connection”.All I’ll say to that is: be careful what you wish for, survey respondents.In addition, 52% of the 2,000 adults surveyed said they had previously taken an extended break from sex, lasting six months on average.So? I’ve managed that– and then some.I think they mean on purpose.Everybody says it was on purpose afterwards. Who commissioned this survey?Thesexual wellness brand Lelo.What does“sexual wellness” mean?They sell vibrators, mainly.Sounds as if they have a vested interest in these survey results.“Taking breaks from sex or focusing on other forms of physical intimacy can actually enhance a sex life,” says Lelo’s chief marketing officer, Luka Matutinovic.Oh yeah? How?“By reducing pressure and fostering exploration, as well as introducing new additions to your routine, like sex toys …”I knew it.In any case, most of those who had taken a sex sabbatical were very positive about it: 53% said it helped them appreciate sex more.It will tend to do that.But it’s not all good news.None of this is good news so far.According to the survey, 30% of Americans believe romance is dead.I’m not surprised – what’s the point?Fortunately, 69% of those not in relationships said they were happy being single.Good for them. What about the ones who are in a relationship?Forty-seven per cent of them said it can be healthy for a couple to have a sex break.Oh my word.On the other hand, 44% said their relationship wouldn’t last a year without sex.Oh, naive respondents – you might surprise yourselves.Indeed.So if Americans are taking sex breaks andsabbaticals intentionally, does that mean they’re having less sex than they used to?The latter assertion seems unquestionable – the percentage of American men and women not having sex hasrisen by every measure since 1982.That’s quite an alarming statistic.Not if you own a vibrator company.Do say:“Oh look, Newsnight’s on.”Don’t say:“Could we try taking a break from taking a break?”Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsPass notesMenWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s gritty and somewhat shocking, insofar as it’s not a highly discussed topic in film, yet it is also very tender. I watched it on a rainy Saturday afternoon without knowing anything about it. I was immediately hooked by how normal Max’s life was and intrigued by his decision to set up an online escort profile under the name of his alter ego, Sebastian, for the purpose of his novel, in which he details his varied sexual experiences. The film addresses issues such as shame, authenticity in fiction and consent with a refreshing lack of judgment on the topic of sex work. Ruaridh Mollica is fantastic as Max/Sebastian and I can’t wait to see him in more films.Ann-Marie, GlasgowBlue Road: The Edna O’Brien StoryBlue Road is an engrossing and hugely enjoyable documentary of Edna O’Brien’s enigmatic life of dizzying highs and haunting lows. Beautifully edited, it ultimately depicts how emotionally vulnerable we all are, regardless of any public persona. It’s a wonderful, inspirational documentary for any would-be writer or artist who wishes to stay true to their vision and who craves a life less ordinary. O’Brien rattled all the right cages all the time. At the height of her fame, she returns to County Clare and listens to her father sing Danny Boy. She stares at him with a stoical yet fearful expression – a powerfully resonant image. Edna, 93, watches it and loves that song. It reminded me of the Smiths song Back to the Old House. And, funnily enough, I noticed her image this week in a review of a Morrissey concert. He is using Edna as a backdrop on stage. What a woman she was.Ron, LondonParthenopeParthenope by Paolo Sorrentino is the best film I’ve seen this year. I’m surprised it’s been quite poorly received by critics and audiences. The problem seems to be Parthenope, the aloof, distant woman at the centre of the story. She is playful, innocuously flirtatious and happily uninterested in forging any deep connection with the many male admirers she’s surrounded by, her only real interest being in the writer John Cheever – whose homosexuality and ennui pose no threat to her – and, ironically, he gracefully declines her offer of company one night, not wanting to “steal a second of [her] youth”.We find that people are strange, mostly unknowable, and we are, one way or another, destined to fail any attempt to close (or even narrow) the gap between us and the rest of the world. The film is exceptionally beautiful to look at. Yes, it is long and meandering, and not a lot happens, but the overall feeling is that you’ve experienced what life is often like: a curious sense of removal from all the living going on around you; not feeling fully a part of it.Stephen, DublinHoly CowView image in fullscreen‘It perfectly captures the inertia of youth in a rural community’ … Holy Cow.Photograph: Laurent Le Crabe/Zeitgeist FilmsHoly Cow gets my vote. It’s an uplifting, funny ensemble piece from mostly untrained actors set in the bucolic Jura region of France. It perfectly captures the inertia of youth in a rural community where Totone, the local teenage delinquent, strives to make the perfect comté cheese to win prize money to prop up his ailing farm and family. Local rituals and rivalries vividly portray farming communities without sugarcoating the harsh reality of working the land day in day out. You end up rooting for Totone and his merry gang.Kate Franklin, HoveBring Her BackBring Her Back is my film of the year so far because it perfectly executes all of its genre conventions yet steps outside every single one simultaneously. It also has a central role from Sally Hawkins that deserves every recognition available. Finally, while much horror is trending on grief and trauma, Bring Her Back gives proper emotional weight while never once encouraging empathy towards evil. Genuinely brilliant.Michael Macaulay,Paraparaumu, AotearoaFlowView image in fullscreen‘Exquisite attention to detail in portraying the behaviour of animals’ … Flow.Photograph: Courtesy of Sideshow and Janus FilmsFlow has to be my favourite film released so far this year, and I have a strong feeling it may also be my daughter’s. We watched it on the big screen and were immersed in this seemingly post-apocalyptic world, where abandoned buildings reclaimed by nature are the only thing to suggest humans ever existed. It’s a lovely film about companionship, physical struggle, uncertainty and hope. It’s also beautifully illustrated, and the story is so urgent that, months on, we still urge all our friends to watch it. It’s evident that the makers of Flow have paid exquisite attention to detail when it comes to portraying the behaviour of animals, as they catch fish, sleep and ultimately try to survive.Dnieper,LondonI’m Still HereOne dark Sunday evening in February, I dragged myself out to watch I’m Still Here. It was theMubifilm of the week, I had no other plans, and I knew it had been nominated for some awards. And honestly, it was one of my best decisions of the year. I’m Still Here is a heady juxtaposition of beach life, sepia shots and easy, middle-class family life in Rio de Janeiro with the growing reality of a repressive military regime. I quietly sobbed through chunks of the second half: a masterclass in film-making, and Fernanda Torres deservedly won her Golden Globe for the portrayal of a woman trying desperately to hold it all together as life as she knows it falls apart around her.

Lots of films critique capitalism or patriarchy, but I struggle to think of any which do such a good job of showing how intertwined they are. And it tells that story in such an engaging and surreal way; as the main character loses his grip on reality in his self-destructive pursuit of this property, it feels as if you’re following him down the rabbit hole of delusion and insanity.Joe, LeedsSpitView image in fullscreen‘Unappealing but entirely human’ … David Wenham in Spit.Photograph: Vince Valitutti/Transmission FilmsMy choice is Spit, starring David Wenham. It’s a sendup of Australia’s criminal class, with more savage mockery of its immigrant detention system and a rather unappealing and entirely human protagonist.David Arthur,Maryborough, QueenslandThe Ballad of Wallis IslandAs widely reviewed, the film is a stark and humorous look at loneliness, but I would argue its perspective on nostalgia and letting go of the past is even more compelling. We all suffer from nostalgia-baiting and can all meander down memory lane at times, but this film can show the danger of living in the past. It is wickedly funny, with the conservatory scene a particular highlight. (I still chuckle when I think of: “Oh yes, unbearably hot.”)Eddie, LondonSinnersSinners is a marvellous film reminiscent of the Coen brothers’ O Brother, Where Art Thou? The music alone is incredible. There is an amazing scene based around a blues song, where the genres that inspired the tune combine with the genres it continues to inspire. I loved the story and the relationship between the anti-hero and his wife. It encapsulates what community does, and is capable of, when it needs to come together. It felt real. This is something a lot of films miss the target on. A belter of a movie.Lee Keith, SunderlandA Real PainView image in fullscreen‘A complex relationship’ … Kieran Culkin (left) and Jesse Eisenberg in A Real Pain.Photograph: APOf the 35 films I have seen this year, it is Jesse Eisenberg’sA Real Painthat stands out for me. Rightly known and celebrated for Kieran Culkin’s turn as Benji, cousin to David (Eisenberg), this movie offers so much more. A sensitive, delicately formed homage to Eisenberg’s family history, it explores their complex relationship, the essence of trauma tourism and the history and beauty of Poland. It also has a haunting score of Chopin’s intricate piano pieces.David Reid, Mirfield, West YorkshireExplore more on these topicsFilmBest culture of 2025 so farI'm Still HereSinnersA Real PainfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you want your coffee machine and grinder to perform their best, morning, noon and (very ill-advisedly) night, you need to give them the care they deserve. Get into a routine of basic cleaning and low-cost maintenance, and they will run better and last longer, meaning fewer emails to the manufacturer’s help desk or trips to a repair cafe – or worse, buying a new machine altogether.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve consulted two experts: Radu Bria atespressorepairshop.co.uk, a man who’s repaired more coffee machines than I’ve had flat whites. And Ben Young, a manager atCraft House Coffee.Here are their hard-earned tips, tricks and general advice for keeping your brewing equipment in tip-top condition so it lasts for years to come.Before we get into the nitty gritty, though, there are some general rules of thumb.Always read the manualThere are a huge number of coffee machines and makers out there, and what works for one won’t necessarily work for another. Before you start scrubbing, soaking or descaling any of your equipment, check the manufacturer’s recommendations – and warnings – first.Unplug your machineIf you’re embarking on deep cleaning, then always remove that plug. Water and electricity do not make a pleasant brew.Use dedicated cleaning suppliesNever, ever use your usual cleaning kitchen cloths and brushes. You don’t want to contaminate your coffee with harmful or abrasive cleaning products.Clean little and oftenView image in fullscreenA light clean a day keeps expensive repairs at bay.Photograph: MathieuLphoto/Getty Images/iStockphotoThis sounds ridiculously simple, and it is: keeping your machine clean cuts down on a huge number of issues.Coffeesplatters, sticky milk residue and wet coffee grounds can make your machine a grime magnet. They don’t just look messy: they can block spouts and prevent your machine from working to its full potential.Both Bria and Young recommend regular, light cleaning over the occasional desperate deep clean. What you do depends on the type of machine (or maker) you have. The intricate internal design of an espresso or bean-to-cup machine will require a more fastidious approach than a simple filter coffee maker.A quick wipe-down goes a long way. Clean spouts, drip trays and milk frothers daily if used. Wipe the exterior of your machines regularly to prevent staining. If you have a fancy machine with a touchscreen or LCD display, then don’t put harsh chemicals anywhere near it – use a general-purpose, nonabrasive cleaner.Get tough on milk residueSteam wands are particularly prone to getting blocked with milk deposits, so ensure you wipe them with a dedicated damp cloth after every use. Do it before purging the wand with steam, though, or you’ll bake the milk residue on to the wand. For automatic machines, ensure that every nook and cranny of the milk carafe is cleaned, scrubbed and soaked after every use to remove buildup and prevent tainting.If milk or coffee residue does end up getting caked on, then don’t waste effort scrubbing, as it’s incredibly sticky.Instead, use a dedicated coffee machine cleaner such as Urnex Cafiza or a milk system cleaner such as Urnex Rinza. These are available in liquid, tablet and powder forms, so pick the one that works best for your machine. For instance, many automatic bean-to-cup machines recommend cleaning tablets rather than powder, so check your manual before buying the wrong type.If your machine uses a manual steam wand, and the power seems a bit limp, then Bria’s advice is simple: remove the steam tip, soak it and clear any blockages with a needle, paperclip or – technical term incoming – the little poky tool that came with your machine.If it’s really baked on, then soak the tip in a milk cleaner solution. Either Urnex Rinza or Puly Caff will do a good job.It’s worth noting that Urnex’s Rinza comes in bothalkalineandacidicformulas. Both can be used as part of a regular cleaning regime, but they’re complementary rather than strictly interchangeable. Thealkaline formulais best at removing all types of milk residues, including non-dairy alternatives, whereas theacidic formulais most effective at dissolving scale buildup – something which is particularly useful if you live in a hard water area.View image in fullscreenUrnex Rinza milk system cleaner, 1.1l£14.49 at AmazonView image in fullscreenPuly Caff milk frother cleaner, 1l£10.90 at Clumsy GoatAccording to Young, manual espresso machines require more regular care. Make sure to clean your portafilter with a dot of dish soap and a non-abrasive cloth after every use. If your machine has an auto-cleaning cycle, don’t be afraid to use it regularly.The best espresso machines to unleash your inner barista at home, testedRead moreMore upmarket espresso machines equipped with solenoid valves (often found in machines costing upwards of £300 – if in doubt, ask your manufacturer) can be back flushed with espresso machine cleaner to remove internal coffee residue buildup. If you’re doing regular cleaning, Young recommends Clean Express’s group cleaning powder as a slightly cheaper option than Cafiza.View image in fullscreenClean Express group cleaning powder, 900g£6 at Copper Coffee RoastersView image in fullscreenUrnex Cafiza cleaning powder,566g£10.66 at Nisbets£11.99 at AmazonFilter your waterIf you live in a hard water area, the mineral deposits can quickly cause limescale buildup and, over time, put your machine out of action.A simple jug filter will help (and potentially improve the taste of your brews). And some machines allow you to fit dedicated internal water filters: buying these in bulk can make it reasonably economical, and more convenient than having to keep a filter jug topped up.View image in fullscreenBrita Marella XL jug, 3.5l capacity£24 at Argos£18.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenPeak water filtration starter pack£40 at Camden Coffee RoasteryDescale regularlySome fancier machines provide a water pH testing strip: based on the results, they’ll remind you to descale after a set period. Most machines, however, rely on you to remember.The easiest option is to put a reminder in your calendar. Consult your machine’s manual for specific recommendations, and consider that your water hardness and usage levels will affect the required frequency.Using the right descaling method for your machine is essential – the manufacturer will usually recommend a specific type – as some products may damage the metal parts inside. We’d recommend using coffee-machine-specific descalers, such as Urnex Dezcal and Puly Cleaner powder descaler.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It’s more affordable than pricey specialist products. It’s safe to consume, and any residue is easy to detect. It works on more than coffee machines, too – it’ll tackle limescale anywhere in the home.Whatever you do, don’t attempt to make up for lost time by using more descaler than advised, as this may damage the machine. You want just enough to dissolve limescale; any more and it may start attacking metal parts, too. Always follow the instructions. Also, avoid using vinegar. Unless, that is, you’re happy to risk tainting your machine permanently and potentially eating away the rubber parts and internal components.Rinse the machine through thoroughly after descaling. Run several cycles of clean water through before brewing another batch – you don’t want it in your coffee.View image in fullscreenUrnex Dezcal, 900g£13.99 at Zoro£14.74 at NisbetsView image in fullscreenPulyCleaner powderdescaler£7.79 at Clumsy Goat£11.95 at AmazonView image in fullscreenFood-grade citric acid, 1kg£6.49 at AmazonConsider reverse osmosisA more hardcore option for real connoisseurs is a reverse osmosis (RO) filter, which you can plumb in under the kitchen sink. This has far faster filtration – water jugs are slow; tediously slow if you’re uncaffeinated – and the dramatically larger and more effective filters in reverse osmosis filters may only need to be replaced every six months to a year. The downside is expense, and potentially the need to plumb in a dedicated tap.Another consideration raised by Young is that RO systems don’t just remove the stuff you don’t want – they also remove beneficial minerals, too, which can negatively affect the taste of your brews. You may need to consider adding a remineralisation cartridge to optimise coffee taste and keep your machines working well. Needless to say, unless your water quality is objectively terrible – or you’re a certified coffee obsessive – this approach is akin to using a sledgehammer to crack a coffee bean.View image in fullscreenWaterdrop G2P600 water filtration system£269.99 at WaterdropTreat your grinder rightWhether it’s a stand-alone grinder or a bean-to-cup machine, Bria urges owners not to forget about its maintenance. Oils from beans build up over time, and these can impede grinding quality and cause off flavours. If you’re particularly partial to dark roast, oily beans, then your grinder will need more regular cleaning.Use a combination of stiff and soft brushes to clean the burrs, chutes and internal parts, and you’ll help ensure that nothing gets clogged.View image in fullscreenRhino grinder and bench tidy brush£16.99 at Coffee HitView image in fullscreenRhino steam wand and milk frother brush set£9.99 at Coffee HitEvery once in a while, a deeper clean is a good idea – but you don’t have to dismantle the grinder. One easy option is to use cleaning pellets. Run through the grinder to remove stuck on coffee residue. Once done, flush by grinding some old coffee beans and discarding the grounds.If you have an automatic bean-to-cup machine, don’t use cleaning pellets without consulting the manual or manufacturer first. As these kinds of machines automatically grind then brew, you don’t want to end up brewing the cleaning powder (which expands upon contact with water) and clogging your machine.Crucially, keep an eye out for worn burrs. If the grind becomes uneven, and the coffee quality fades – for instance, if you find your brews suddenly becoming sour or bitter – then it might be time for new burrs. Some are easy to replace at home, but consult your user manual or manufacturer for advice. If in doubt, give your local coffee machine repair shop a call.View image in fullscreenUrnex Grindz cleaningtablets, 430g£26.38 at Nisbets£21.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenPuly grinder cleaning crystals, 405g£21.99 at Bella BaristaAnd finally … avoid flavoured beansGood, fresh coffee can taste like all manner of wonderful fruits and flowers, nuts and chocolate, but if it’s literally sprayed with flavouring, then that sticky stuff can ruin a good grinder.

But as Terry Deary tells me, with exactly the kind of relish you’d expect from the author of Horrible Histories, this particular drinks vessel belonged to the Victorian-era mass murderer Mary Ann Cotton. Believed to have killed 12 of her children, not to mention three husbands, she was finally caught after poisoning her stepson in 1872 with an arsenic-laced brew. “And in Beamish they’ve got the teapot!” says Deary. “I was blown away to hold it!”View image in fullscreenThe murderous drinks vessel … Mary Ann Cotton’s teapotPhotograph: Courtesy: Beamish MuseumHe’s talking about Beamish, the Living Museum of the North, an open-air site based in County Durham (just like Cotton herself, who was eventually hanged in Durham Gaol). Featuring an 1820s tavern, a 1900s pit village and colliery, a 1940s farm and a 1950s town – all populated by costumed staff – it’s something of a pioneer when it comes to immersive experiences, having first opened its doors 55 years ago. This year it’s one of five museums nominated for theArt Fund Museum of the Year award, a prestigious prize that has previously been won by The Burrell Collection in Glasgow, London’s Horniman Museum and Gardens and the Hepworth Gallery in Wakefield. With £120,000 available to the winner (and £15,000 to the other four finalists), it is the world’s largest museum prize.Deary’s love of Beamish, which is only down the road from him, extends to more than just a fascination with grisly murders. Back in the 1980s when he was working as an actor, he would take schoolchildren there and perform educational theatre in order to teach them “what war was about” – not the well-trodden story of the trenches but tales of bewildered soldiers returning home, and deserters.View image in fullscreenNot too nostalgic … a 1950s a electrical repair shop at Beamish.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianBeamish is considered important because it keeps alive memories of Britain’s industrial heritage. “But they’re not too nostalgic about it,” says Deary. “You can go into a pit, and it’s horrible! When I was a lad leaving school, they said I could become a coalminer, and after they sent me down a pit in the Sunderland area I was put off wanting to be a miner for life. I think Beamish dispels some of the glamour of the industrial era too.”From the humble teapot, then, to a piece of stone – although this is no ordinary piece of stone. “When you see it now, it glistens,” enthuses Scotland’s first minister John Swinney. He’s taking time out from a meeting in his Perthshire North constituency to tell me about Perth Museum and it’s prize possession: the Stone of Destiny.For almost three decades the stone had been on display at Edinburgh Castle, in rather dark conditions. Now it sparkles as pride of place in this museum that only opened in March 2024. “It’s one of the most epic symbols of the nationhood of Scotland,” says Swinney. Indeed, it was first recorded as being sat on by royalty in 1249, during the inauguration of the boy-king Alexander III. Fifty years later it was taken as war loot to Westminster Abbey by King Edward I of England – but now, 700 years later, it is finally back at its Perthshire home where it belongs.View image in fullscreen‘One of the most epic symbols of the nationhood of Scotland’ … the Stone of Destiny exhibition at Perth museum.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe museum is located in the former Perth City Hall, and Swinney remembers its previous life as the venue for the Scottish Conservative Conference, where Thatcher would turn up in her heyday to address the faithful. Now it has been refitted as the perfect venue to tell Perth’s – and Scotland’s – remarkable history. Inside you’ll find part of the Strathmore meteorite that exploded and scattered across Coupar Angus and Blairgowrie on a crisp December day in 1917. There’s the Pictish St Madoes cross-slab, which dates back to the eighth century. And for lovers of things that aren’t stones, Swinney is particularly fond of the Carpow logboat that is dated from around 1,000BCE. “It was found in the marshes of the River Tay and as you come into the museum it looks like it’s inside the river itself,” he says.Swinney thinks the museum shows us how “Scotland’s history is part of Scotland’s future” and it would be hard to deny it’s having an effect: Perth and Kinross Council have reported an average city centre footfall increase of 68% since the museum opened.Not all the museums on the list sell themselves on their exhibits. Cardiff’s Chapter has no historical stones or murderous teapots – in fact it has no permanent collection at all. And yet, as broadcaster Huw Stephens tells me, it’s been “at the heart of Cardiff’s creative scene since it opened in 1971”. Stephens talks me through the museum’s importance: how Pino Palladino (“the world’s greatest bassist”) would go and see live music there; Karl Hyde describing it as a key venue when he formed Underworld in the city with Rick Smith; the amazing work it does today with the city’s deaf community (Chapter hosts Deaf Gathering Cymru, Wales’ largest festival of D/deaf-led creative activity).View image in fullscreenAbsolutely integral to the city … Chapter in Cardiff.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianWith writers’ circles, artist’s studios, residencies, theatres and a cinema showing international films “that wouldn’t get shown in Cardiff otherwise,” Chapter is undeniably centred around art. From next week you will be able to see Jenő Davies and Iolo Walker’s Meadowsweet Palisade, an exhibition of film, sculpture and sound about renewal and rural spaces, whereas if you’ve got a little one you can currently have a go on the Feeding Chair, a touring artwork that invites parents and carers to feed their babies and young children in public venues.But speaking to Stephens makes you realise how much Chapter goes beyond that mandate. During school holidays they provide free meals to children, the museum has a no-questions-asked food bank and – in response to the cost of living crisis – they recently expanded their “pay what you can” pricing scheme.“This community spirit goes hand in hand with working alongside the creative sector in the city,” says Stephens. “You feel it instantly when you walk through Chapter’s doors.”In fact, so integral to Cardiff’s vibrancy is Chapter that Stephens struggles to imagine the city without it. “In many ways, it is our equivalent of the Southbank Centre. They have a busy garden, they host experimental music festivals … Cardiff would be a much duller, poorer place without Chapter.”Derry Girls star Tara Lynne O’Neill could say the same about Golden Thread inBelfast– not least because it helped her out during a difficult time. She had moved back to her home city 15 years ago following a period being a “very unemployed actor” in Dublin and she found that the museum’s free art workshops gave her an outlet to express her creativity and the chance to meet fellow art lovers. “It convinced me that I was very much in the right genre of art form,” she laughs. “I’m not talented visual-wise, but it was the community aspect of it, the meeting like-minded people. The accessibility was unbelievable, you know, because it was free!”View image in fullscreen‘ It makes such a difference for aspiring local artists’ … Golden Thread gallery in Belfast.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianGolden Thread opened in 1998, the same year the Good Friday Agreement was signed, and its collection doesn’t shy away from confronting the Troubles. Paul Seawright’s Sectarian Murder photography series visits spots where violent attacks took place and documents them as empty playgrounds, eerie grass verges and desolate fields. These unpeopled images, accompanied by text from local news reports documenting the attacks, serve as an act of remembrance – but also drives home the constant tension of the times and the chilling senselessness of it all.“It’s important that those stories are documented, but also that they have a permanent home,” says O’Neill. “The kids who watched Derry Girls don’t remember the Troubles. But looking at the paintings and how people expressed themselves during that time … I’d say art saved a lot of people. I think we forget a lot of the time that art isn’t just for sale. It’s not all about being a commercial thing.”Golden Thread, which recently moved to a new home in the city centre and boasts just one full-time staff member, is equally concerned with the city’s brighter future. O’Neill remembers seeing Susan Hiller and Shirin Neshat’s recent multimedia show Can You Hear Me? and thinking how wonderful it would have been to have had access to something like that when she was a working-class kid growing up in the city. “My idea of a museum was somewhere stuffy and full of old things,” she says. “I never would have thought a gallery would play video. It’s that whole thing of ‘if you can see it, then you can be it’. It makes such a difference for aspiring local artists to know that they can end up having their work on show in a gallery.”View image in fullscreen‘A cross between the Wallace Collection and White Cube’ … Compton Verney in Warwickshire.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianIf this list contains a variety of museums, from the traditional to the experimental, then Prue Leith believes her choice – Compton Verney in Warwickshire – touches all bases. “It’s like a cross between the Wallace Collection and the White Cube gallery,” she says. “They have this amazing collection of Chinese bronzes, probably one of the best in the world, and then you’ll walk a few rooms down and find some crazy installation. I remember going there once and there were all these upside down umbrellas stuck to the ceiling.” Currently on display is Emma Talbot’s multimedia extravaganza exploring the experience of life from birth to death.Leith is a fan of the museum’s serious collection of folk art (“which is normally considered as very inferior”) and recalls being beyond wowed by an exhibition of Picasso’s drawings there (“illuminating”). During a showing of Dutch sculptor Grinling Gibbons’ carvings, she was thrilled to get a peek at some of the works being transported in specially made boxes lined with “all sorts of padding and polystyrene.” That gets to the heart of her love for Compton Verney. It may be a Grade I-listed 18th century mansion showing international masterpieces, but it’s also small and friendly enough that you can ask staff questions about how the works travelled. “They’re receptive to telling you about behind the scenes stuff.”Leith says the activities for families and kids are exceptional – from stone carving to bat walks – and she raves about the grounds, which sets a sculpture park (featuring works by Sarah Lucas and Larry Achiampong) within 120 acres of Capability Brown parkland, proving once more that a great museum is about more than just what it has in its collection.“Everybody I’ve ever taken has been astonished,” she marvels. “I mean, even if you weren’t interested in art, it’s worth going there just for the trees!”The winner will be announced on 26 June at a ceremony at the Museum of LiverpoolExplore more on these topicsMuseumsExhibitionsAwards and prizesCardiffBelfastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here are your takes on the work of a beloved children’s authorJulia Donaldson’s best books – ranked!Guardian readersWed 25 Jun 2025 11.44 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 11.46 EDTShareLast week, Stuart Heritageranked his 15 favourite books by Julia Donaldson, and readers have responded with their own opinions, along with memories of reading her beloved stories to their children. Here are some of the most popular picks from the Gruffalo author’s gigantic oeuvre.Monkey PuzzleMonkey Puzzle is my three-year-old daughter’s favourite book. She’s bilingual, and – for this book specifically – she always wants me to read it in Arabic. So it’s “La, la, la!” instead of “No, no, no!”, otherwise she doesn’t like it (and she lets me know about it). Her Arabic is much better because of this book, at least when it comes to animal-related vocabulary. We went to a zoo the other day, and she referred to the elephant’s trunk in perfect (Sudanese) Arabic – a proud parenting moment for me.Affa, GlasgowView image in fullscreenWilliam and his son.Photograph: Courtesy of WilliamMy son is multisensory-impaired, he has nystagmus and unilateral hearing loss, and has always loved stories as somewhere that he can completely immerse himself. Julia Donaldson’s have always appealed and, though it’s difficult to know how much of the detail in the illustrations he can see, he loves to point out the characters or items of interest.Monkey Puzzle is often revisited, and if there’s a part that I misread then it will be corrected. He particularly loves naming all of the animals after I have read the “No, no, no!” part and we will often repeat these to each other in the day and laugh. I know that this is something that will always bring a smile to his face.William, East SussexThe GruffaloFifteen years later I can recite The Gruffalo word for word. My son insisted on me reading it to him at bedtime every night for the best part of a year! If I ever go on Mastermind it would be my specialist subject!UncleKarlMMy daughters are now 14, 17, and 20. Julia and Axel [Scheffler]’s books are as indelibly imprinted in my memory as the Ladybird books I read as a nipper in the 70s. When the animated version of The Gruffalo was broadcast for the first time I sat us all down excitedly to watch (they were still of an age where they would mostly listen to anything I had to say) – within seconds I was in bits. All those years of reading it to them, but it was like someone was reading it to me. Very embarrassing.stripsidebobView image in fullscreenIllustration: flab/AlamyMy children used to give me belly laughs all the time. One of my favourites was when my son was four and I was reading The Gruffalo to him and his older cousin who was visiting. I got to the bit just before the real Gruffalo appears and he stopped me and said earnestly to his cousin: “There’s a Gruffalo along in a minute.” Like most things that cause a complete collapse this probably doesn’t sound funny to other people but I was laughing so much I couldn’t speak for five minutes.WithoutPurposeThe Paper DollsI think The Paper Dolls is an amazing book; definitely my No 1. It touches on so many themes: imagination, loss, memories, cruelty, play and the way traditions are passed down through generations. Such a talented combination of author and illustrator to cover all of that in a relatively low number of words and a few pages. Most importantly, it’s still simple and entertaining enough for little ones to understand and enjoy. Both my kids are too old for it now, but I’ve kept a copy, and hope to be able to read it to grandkids one day.ProfyleNeimskip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

When he watches the animation he just laughs and laughs. We listen to the soundtrack in the car, too, and he greets people saying: “Stand and deliver!” which is both hilarious and mortifying.Susannah MohammedZogOur two-year-old, Phoebe, loves all of the Julia Donaldson books but her favourite is Zog. From a very young age she loved the illustrations of the brightly coloured dragons and all of Zog’s mishaps. We think Princess Pearl is a feminist icon for challenging traditional stereotypes about what girls can do and she has inspired our daughter to want to be a doctor and look after people (and dragons) when she grows up.Amy Peck, ChelmsfordExplore more on these topicsBooksChildren's books: 7 and underJulia DonaldsonPicture booksFamilyParents and parentingChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why isn’t Katy Perry going? And how is Eva Longoria still on every guest list, despite not having been famous since 2012? – but the one I keep sticking on in this: as the world’s third richest man, Bezos could, we assume, charm almost any woman on the planet into some sort of marital arrangement with him. In which case, and with all due respect, why Sánchez?I don’t mean this to be as rude at it sounds. Lauren Sánchez, a 55-year-old former TV presenter and licensed pilot, is, I’m sure, funny and clever and up there with Peter Ustinov as a great dinner party guest. Her betrothed, on the other hand, doesn’t appear to be a man comfortable with making anything but the most obvious choices. Bezos got rich, built a rocket, and turned himself from a weedy tech nerd into a comic-book Mr Universe so that these days he looks like a man wearing an Amazon cardboard box under his polo shirt. That this person would choose not only a woman a mere six years younger than himself but one who, stylistically speaking, edges closer every year to theJocelyne Wildensteinschool of bizarre beautification speaks either to the loveliness of a genuine soul match or something else altogether.By which I mean: the strange aesthetic that many women inside the Maga world seem enthusiastically to have taken up as the norm. If there is a Maga look for women it is the one exemplified not only by Sánchez but by Kristi Noem, the head of Homeland Security mockingly nicknamed ICE Barbie for her combination of pageant-style looks and heavy-handed immigration policing, and by Melania Trump, whose eyes are creeping slowly but inexorably up the sides of her temples in what is informally known as “Mar-a-Lago” face.What’s odd about this style isn’t that it’s augmented, but that it’s an aesthetic which seems deliberately to draw attention to its own artificiality in a way that, in other contexts, might be referred to as “bad work”. People with money can make poor choices about cosmetic surgery too, of course, but the uniformity of this particular look – so heavy on the filler, silicone and Botox as to make its wearers seem not younger, but weirder, and in a state of constant discomfort – suggests something closer to design. If you were the type of person to make liberal references to The Handmaid’s Tale, you might even speculate that this aesthetic has been tailored by the world’s richest men to symbolise just how completely – almost derisively – they can control the bodies of the women around them.But let’s focus on the wedding, which has provided us this week with welcome respite from the news from Iran, with the spectacle of a man worth $223bn being frightened off by the threat of angry locals coming at him with pool floats. The wedding on Saturday was originally planned to take place in the centre ofVeniceat the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, a 16th-century meeting hall surrounded by canals, raising the spectacle of notable guests including Oprah, the Kardashians and Ivanka Trump arriving on public waterways via open-air taxi.It is safe to say the Venetians weren’t happy. After a group calledNo Space for Bezoslightly threatened to disrupt the guests’ arrival withinflatable alligators, Bezos changed venues to a less accessible hall outside the centre. (It should be noted that No Space for Bezos is not the same as Everyone Hates Elon, a different but equally energised group that unfurled a huge banner in the Piazza San Marco bearing the legend, “If you can rent Venice for your wedding then you can pay more tax.” Let’s hope Mark Zuckerberg, who will reportedly be at the wedding, gets his own bespoke group along these lines.)“We are very proud of this!” said Tommaso Cacciari, No Space for Bezos’s spokesperson,to the BBCon Tuesday. “We are nobodies, we have no money, nothing!” Meanwhile, protest groups including Greenpeace are still planning on demonstrating in the city centre on Saturday to draw attention to the obscenity of a projected 90-odd private jets flying in for the event. As for Bezos and Sánchez, let’s end on a gracious note and wish them all the happiness in the world as they marry in a city that doesn’t want them, in front of 200 people who don’t know them, in a celebration of money over sense.

It can turn its back on the dreams of a younger generation which, if we don’t change that system, will likely be worse off than their parents.It can continue to depend upon billionaire donors and out-of-touch campaign consultants and spend huge amounts of money on dumb 30-second ads that fewer and fewer people respond to.It can ignore the tragic reality that tens of millions of Americans are giving up on democracy because they don’t see their government understanding their struggles and the realities of their lives or doing anything about it.Why establishment Democrats still can’t stomach progressive candidates like Zohran Mamdani | Arwa MahdawiRead moreOr it can learn the lesson that theZohran Mamdanicampaign taught us on Tuesday.And that is:Have the courage to address the real economic and moral issues that face the majority of our people, take on the greed and power of the oligarchy and fight for an agenda that can improve life for working families.Some may claim that Mamdani’s victory was just about style and the fact that he is a charismatic candidate. Yes. He is. But you don’t get a Mamdani victory without the extraordinary grassrootsmovementthat rallied around him. And you don’t get that movement and thousands of enthusiastic people knocking on doors without an economic agenda that speaks to the needs of working people. The people of New York and all Americans understand that, in the richest country on earth, they should not have to struggle every day just to put food on the table, pay their rent or pay their medical bills. These are the people the Democratic consultants don’t know exist.Mamdani has been criticized for his “radical” and “unrealistic” economic policies:Demanding that, at a time of unprecedented income and wealth inequality, the rich and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes.Demanding that, when many New Yorkers are no longer able to find affordable housing, there should be a freeze on rent hikes.Demanding that, when commuting to a job takes a big toll out of a worker’s paycheck, public transportation should be free.Demanding that, when many low-income and working people are unable to access good-quality food for themselves and their kids, publicly owned neighborhood grocery stores should be created.These ideas, and more, are not radical. They may not be what billionaires, wealthy campaign contributors and real estate speculators want, but they are what working people want. And maybe, just maybe, it’s time to listen to them.Mamdani’s victory was not about “star power”. It was very much about people power, about revitalizing democracy and opening the door for ordinary people to gain control over the decisions that impact their lives.Importantly, he did not run away from the moral issue that is troubling millions in New York and around the country: the need to end US military support for a rightwing extremist Benjamin Netanyahu government in Israel that is obliterating the people of Gaza and starving their children. Mamdani understands that antisemitism is a disgusting and dangerous ideology, but that it is not antisemitic to be critical of the inhumane policies of the Netanyahu government.The lesson of Mamdani’s campaign is that it is not good enough just to be critical of Trump and his destructive policies. We have to bring forth a positive vision and an analysis of why things are the way they are. It is not good enough to maintain a status quo that is failing most Americans. At a time when hope is in increasingly short supply, people must have the sense that if we work together, if we have the courage to take on powerful special interests, we can create a better world – a world of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.Will the current Democratic party leadership learn the lessons of the Mamdani campaign? Probably not. Too many of them would rather be the captains on a sinking Titanic, rather than change course.Then again, it doesn’t matter what they think. The establishment threw everything they had against Mamdani – millions in Super Pac money, endorsements from “important people”, a hostile media – and they still lost.The future of the Democratic party will not be determined by its current leadership. It will be decided by the working class of this country. Increasingly, people understand that our political system is corrupt and that billionaires should not be able to buy elections. They understand that we should not have an unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality; that we should not be the only wealthy country not to guarantee healthcare for all; that we should not deny young people the right to a higher education because of their income; that we should not have a major crisis in affordable housing; that we should not have a minimum wage that is a starvation wage; that we should not allow corporations to illegally prevent union organization – and much, much more.The American people are beginning to stand up and fight back. We have seen that in the many Fighting Oligarchy events that we’ve done around the country that have drawn huge turnouts. We have seen that in the millions of people who came out for the No Kings rallies that took place this month in almost every state. And yesterday, we saw that in the Democratic primary in New York City.We’re going forward. And no one is going to stop us.Bernie Sanders is a US senator, and ranking member of the health, education, labor and pensions committee.

They’re unwieldy, harder to hold in bed, especially under the sheets when I was supposed to be asleep.In my teens I raced through Agatha Christie, Alistair MacLean and the like, and Reader’s Digest too, countless editions of which were lined up beside every toilet in the house. Then schooling started interfering with my tastes and I got into Thomas Hardy in a big way, and other big thick, proper paperback novels. After my A-levels I went cycling in France with a mate, which was a miserable experience, saved only by the enjoyment I got from reading Anna Karenina, the battered doorstop edition of which I still have but am fearful of looking at lest it completely falls apart.Then I went to university to study English literature and had the love of reading sucked out of me. Reading, in my book, was for enjoying, not for studying. I didn’t enjoy the studying of it, so I inevitably stopped enjoying the reading of it. Those reading years are a dismaying blur. The only writer to survive the cull in my love of literature was Evelyn Waugh. Everything else seemed to be a struggle. I blamed myself for not being clever enough. When I left university, I all but left reading behind too. I came across Raymond Carver, who I found easy to read and loved very much. And Richard Ford, who I found hard to read but still managed to love. Apart from that, the rest of my 20s and, and my 30s, passed by almost fiction-free.But it all came flooding back, oddly, with the advent of the digital age. The Kindle seemed to free me up to wade back into literature until I was out of my depth and swimming freely again. I’m not sure why this is so. I think it might be that physical books had been triggering strong feelings of intellectual inadequacy from back in the day. Who knows? I didn’t care. I was loving reading all over again.But as much as the ebook gave me something beautiful back, slowly but surely it took it all away again. I think the problem has been the smartphone rather than the Kindle. Reading ebooks on the Kindle app on the iPhone rather than on the Kindle itself was too convenient an option. But, just as smartphones relentlessly erode our capacity to focus on life itself, slowly but surely my ability to engage with any one thing on them, certainly anything as long as a novel, drained away as briskly as the phone’s battery.So the other week I picked out one of the countless old-style Penguin paperbacks on my bookshelf. It was A Good Man in Africa by William Boyd. Then the peculiarly named Doctor Fischer of Geneva or The Bomb Party by Graham Greene. Then Muriel Spark, Margaret Drabble and anyone else I fancied from shelves at home or in charity shops. I’m back to the paperback format of my childhood and my reading life has begun again. These little beauties are barely 25% bigger than my iPhone and, most importantly, you can’t swipe in and out of them. Suddenly I can engage with words again. I put the phone away, open the book, and read, actually read. On the tube, snootily regarding the phone-starers, I feel a bit of a clever dick. This will last until I give in to the temptation to revisit the Famous Five. I can’t wait.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Babcock International, the defence contractor with a specialism in kitting out the UK’s nuclear submarines, has emerged from the depths. After about half a decade in which the story was mostly about cost overruns, acquisition indigestion,accounting woes, pension deficits and too much debt, Babcock is suddenly back in the FTSE 100 index and is a hot stock. The share price has more than doubled this year.Of course it’s not really a miracle because the performance is easily explained. A fix-the-basics strategy was started in 2020 under ex-Cobham boss David Lockwood and has worked. The last of the badly performing major contracts – to build first-of-a-kind Type 31 frigates for theRoyal Navy– is no longer spitting out provisions.Meanwhile, the group has kept its promises to the City on cashflow et cetera and was able on Wednesday to lift its medium-term target for operating margins by a percentage point to 9%. The pension position is vastly improved, dividends are back and there’s enough cash for a £200m buyback.Babcock International share priceYet that progress alone would not have pushed the shares so high so soon. The other part of the tale, of course, is “the new era for defence” as Lockwood put it, meaning the comingNato splurge in spending.Babcock’s full-year numbers happened to land on the day that Nato allies formally declared a commitment to invest 5% of GDP annually on defence and security by 2035.“Public market investors appear convinced this pivot in govt spending will happen. European defence stocks are trading like crypto/memes,” tweeted Simon French, the chief economist at Panmure Liberum.You can see what it means. If the share prices of Babcock, Rolls-Royce (up 56% this year) and BAE Systems (58%) are soaring, try Germany’s largest arms company, Rheinmetall – 158% higher since January.It’s true the Nato commitment is enormous. Analysts at Berenberg calculate the core defence spending element (ie not the whole) adds up to $600bn (£440bn) a year, of which $350bn would come from non-US allies, assuming the US and countries in Europe’s north and east spend 3.5% of GDP, while countries in Europe’s south and west only manage 2% and others do 3%.In Babcock’s case, it is the second largest contractor to the Ministry of Defence so can hardly fail to benefit from the natural home bias in defence spending. The UK has already committed £6bn to upgrade nuclear submarine production and the list of what Babcock does elsewhere is long – from maintenance work with long-term contracts for all three armed forces, to technical trading and more.Meanwhile, on its civil nuclear construction side, the breezes are also strong, assuming Sizewell C and small modular reactors happen. This is specialist stuff; the world is not awash with competitors.Whether the “new era” for defence really arrives as scheduled, and to the last percentage point, is open to question. Share prices in the sector may also be ahead of events. Defence companies, traditionally viewed as dull income stocks even when the contracts are free of hiccups, are now typically trading on 25-times earnings. That will take some getting used to.But it’s hard to argue with the general direction. If even three-quarters of these spending commitments are fulfilled, a fundamental change is happening.Explore more on these topicsBabcock InternationalNils Pratley on financeDefence policyRoyal NavycommentShareReuse this content"

I may not do it,” the president said to reporters on the White House lawn. “Nobody knows what I’m going to do.”The question was about joining Israeli air strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Days later, US bombers were on their way. Some expected it to happen. Others, including Keir Starmer, had gone on record to say they didn’t. No one had known. The unpredictability doctrine wouldn’t have been violated either way.It applies also in economic and domestic policy. Trump’s boast of inscrutability could have been made about tariff rates, or adecision to deploy marinesagainst US citizens who defy his immigration agency.Volatile inconsistency is a trait of the presidential personality, but also a learned management technique. Keeping everyone around you guessing, lurching from charm to menaces, swapping and dropping favourites on a whim – these are methods of coercive control. They generate disorientation and vulnerability. People who are braced for sudden mood swings must hang on the leader’s every word, looking for cues, awaiting instruction. Individual agency is lost, dependency is induced. It is something cult leaders do.A method that works with a quasi-monarchical entourage is poorly suited to international affairs. Foreign leaders are not White House courtiers. They might seek the US president’s favour in trade or fear his military wrath, but always with competing national interests in the background. On the world stage, Trump will never feel the unalloyed devotion he gets from worshippers at a Maga rally, which is one reason why he hates to travel.That tension is palpable at this week’s Nato summit in The Hague. Trump makes no secret of his disdain for European democracies. He resents their reliance on the Pentagon for security. He is unconvinced that defending their continent, especially the corner of it under violent assault from Russia, is the US’s problem. The threat he briefly made in his first term to pull out of Nato if other members didn’t start paying their way still hangs over the alliance. European leaders must strive to keep Trump onside while contingency planning for the day he decides to abandon them.Matthew Whitaker, the US’s permanent representative at Nato,tried to be reassuringon that point at the summit, declaring that it “has never been more engaged”. But he also conceded ignorance of what Trump might actually do. “I don’t want … to claim to be able to read his mind and know what he’s going to say.”That is the doctrine: nobody knows. This forces Nato members into an awkward dance, performing for Trump’s benefit while also working around him. They want to impress him with their financial ambition, pledging tospend 5% of their national GDPon defence by 2035. But they know also not to expect any reciprocal commitment, or none that can be trusted.War in the Middle East ramps the uncertainty up to new heights. European leaders need to stay focused on Ukraine and the prospect of Russia turning its territorial aggression on some other portion of Nato’s eastern flank. Vladimir Putin sees no legitimacy in borders that were drawn by the collapse of the Soviet Union. He has also geared Russia’s economy, political apparatus and propaganda machinery to assume perpetual war with the west. One lesson from Ukraine’s plight is to assume that when Putin says he is going to fight, he means it. Another is that, while deterrence is expensive, it is cheaper than the war that comes when the Kremlin feels confidently undeterred.These calculations keep Europeans up at night, but not Trump. He doesn’t recognise Russia as the aggressor in Ukraine and would happily see the war end on terms that leave Nato humiliated and Putin emboldened, and signal an epoch-defining shift in the balance of global power away from democracy.But framing the choice in grand geostrategic terms obscures pettier motives, which are often the salient ones with Trump. He doesn’t want to take Kyiv’s side because that is what Joe Biden did. It isn’t his cause and so he thinks it is dumb.This is not the case withIran. US allies are required, in public at least, to judge Trump’s military intervention as though it were made according to a conventional diplomatic and strategic calculus: the prospect of Tehran wielding powers of nuclear apocalypse is truly abhorrent; negotiation was not bearing fruit. Maybe there was reason to dispute US intelligence assessments that said the threshold of weapons-readiness was not imminent. Maybe the time to act really was at hand.But those are rationalising arguments, retrofitted to a choice that Trump made as much from vanity as any more sophisticated motive. He was bounced into war by Benjamin Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister appears to have gamed the US president’s aversion to looking weak and his limitless appetite for glory. Early Israeli success – an extraordinary feat of military intelligence that took out senior Iranian commanders and assets – offered Trump the prospect of climbing aboard a winning operation and grabbing credit for victory.Hints that regime change was on the agenda may have prodded Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, towards a ceasefire on the basis that early capitulation with some power retained, while unpalatable, is preferable to assassination. Senior White House officials insisted the war aims were limited to containment of the nuclear threat, but since they hadn’t even known a war was coming their authority on the matter is questionable.Trump’s supporters say this is proof that his volatile style works. In strategic studies it is known as the “madman theory”. Discarding guardrails, looking ready to do something irrational, forces an enemy to choose caution. The obvious risk is that it also teaches the rest of the world the merit of madness. Iran’s rulers will be more convinced than ever that only nuclear weapons can guarantee their sovereignty. (That view would persist through regime change, since none of the viable scenarios result in a flowering of pro-western democracy in the region. Tehran’s atomic ambitions may be set back by years, but the cause of negotiated, multilateral non-proliferation is also in tatters.)That doesn’t interest Trump. He thinks in terms of easy wins, not complex consequences. Hence hispalpable irritation with Israel and Iranfor violating the ceasefire and generally not knowing “what the fuck they’re doing”. He is aware that he looks played by Netanyahu, much as he once showed aflicker of frustration with Putinfor “tapping” him along in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. He promised US voters deals. He gets cross when the world withholds them from him.This is a natural function of the unpredictability doctrine. Telling other countries they can never know what you’ll do makes them less responsive to diplomacy; less biddable to the whim of a US president. A vicious cycle then begins. Trump relies on his volatile persona to assert control in situations that he doesn’t understand, generating chaos that exposes his impotence, which in turn provokes him to tug in more arbitrary fury at his levers of power.For European democracies this is debilitating. It is hard to coordinate defence against external threats when the paramount power in your alliance is the origin of so much instability. But Nato leaders will get no respite from the uncertainty as long as Trump sits in the White House. The thing they most need from him – reliability – is the one thing he is destined by personality and doctrine never to provide.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelcommentShareReuse this content"

Don’t dare do this in our nameWed 25 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 06.59 EDTSharePride has never been apolitical, but in recent years, particularly after the Israeli occupation’s onslaught on the Gaza Strip after 7 October 2023, the coalition of queer rights in the west has felt increasingly fractured.In Berlin, the city I call home, Pride events have splintered along political lines as Palestine has been a recurring point of contention.According to organisersof Internationalist Queer Pride Berlin (IQP Berlin), a split between two major alternative Pride events followed an incident in which the initial organisers called police to the event after participants expressed solidarity by chanting “free Palestine”. Meanwhile, at Berlin’s official Pride parade, attenders have previouslywaved rainbow and Israeli flagsas they marched through Berlinalongside an Israeli embassy float.At last year’s IQP Berlin, the Palestine bloc was one of the largest. Jews and Arabs walked side-by-side, wrapped in Palestinian keffiyeh scarves, flanked by German police.The eventfaced police pushback, including officers in full riot gear wielding batons and shields. At least 25 people were detained, with the Palestine bloc being key targets for the police.Despite these displays of solidarity, and the risks of repression protesters have faced, there have been those who have sneered at the idea that queer people can find common cause with Palestine and advocate for liberation. The most popular example of this came last year when US pop star Chappell Roan criticised the Biden administration for its arming of the Israeli military. On stage at theGovernor’s Ball festival in New York, the singer, who is a lesbian with a drag persona,turned down an offerfrom the White House to perform for Pride month, saying: “We want liberty, justice and freedom for all. When you do that, that’s when I’ll come.”Roan’s show of solidarity drew the ire of talkshow host Bill Maher, who suggested the singer would be “thrown off a roof in Gaza”, invoking an oft-used cliche based on a video that has been debunked byReutersandAFP,among others.He went on to make punchlines about Roan’s career “blowing up” like pagersin Lebanon,referring to Israeli attacksthat killed 12 people and wounded thousands. Hundreds of children were killed in the following months in Lebanon, thousands in Gaza. Maher postured as the liberal hero of queer people, but it seemed easier for him, like many in the west, to point fingers at Palestinian society than to confront the systems his own countries support – systems that bomb, displace and isolate queer Palestinians in Gaza.WhenBenjamin Netanyahu addressed congress in July 2024, the Israeli prime minister said that pro-Palestine protesters holding up signs saying “gays for Gaza” might as well call themselves “chickens for KFC”, suggesting our existence is mired in contradiction.That attempt to sever solidarity between queer people and Palestine has been deadly. A year earlier, an Israeli soldierheld up a Pride flag in Gaza, with “in the name of love” scrawled on it in English, Hebrew and Arabic. The state of Israel’s official X accountboasted of this achievement, “the first ever pride flag raised in Gaza”. As a queer Palestinian, it is enraging to see my identity used as an instrument of war, but what I find most strange is the cognitive dissonance: for the “love” of whom is this flag raised? Certainly not of the queer Palestinians living in Gaza, who have faced 19 months of terror, and a lifetime of occupation.In Jerusalem, the city where I was baptised, there is a very small organic scene of queer Palestinians. Some Palestinians from the city even visit Tel Aviv for Pride if they are allowed to travel there. Most are not. Queer Palestinians all face different obstacles based on where they live and how visible they are; their pain lives precariously in the crossfire of multiple struggles.One friend inGazatold me he only wished to live in peace, away from conservatism, religious extremism and war. I later discovered he lost both of his parents and his brother, as well as cousins, in Israel’s onslaught. Another friend from Jerusalem told me he had a message for the west: that freedom comes in many layers. “We are under occupation and facing an ongoing genocide,” he said. “So the first layer is simply to exist.”We can imagine and hope for a just, safe world for queer Palestinians to flourish in. Though there are some vibrant, if quieter, queer communities across the Middle East, there is still persecution. But if the goal is for queer Palestinians to live in an open, tolerant society, then they need first to survive Israel’s aggression. There can be no Pride under occupation.There are Palestinian LGBTQ+ organisations such asalQawsandAlwanwith aspirations to shape a Palestinian society based on tolerance, equality and openness. An ambition that is made so much harder, if not impossible, by occupation.You can’t see rainbows from underneath the rubble. Equally, you cannot in good conscience celebrate Pride in the west while knowing that many of our countries are supplying the arms and funds that are killing queer Palestinians, along with their families. Despite attempts to position the struggles of queer rights as in opposition to Palestinian liberation, I have been moved to see queer people not fall for the trap. This Pride month, we will march again, surrounded by confetti and keffiyehs.Jad Salfiti is a British-Palestinian video producer and journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If actor Anna Camp (42) has a new girlfriend called Jade Whipkey (24), meaning there’s an 18-year age gap between them, is this a) disgusting; b) perfectly fine; c) something I have no desire to think about?If you answered c), then I’m afraid large sections of the internet disagree with you. There has been heated debate about the propriety of the Camp-Whipkey romance ever since the two went public – so much so that Camp recentlyspoke outon the matter.“I’ve dated men exactly my age and Jade is FAR more mature than any of them,”Camp wrote in a social media post. “We have more in common than anyone else I’ve ever dated and can literally talk about anything and everything.”Of literally anything and everything happening right now, Camp’s relationship with another consenting adult is obviously low on the list of things to worry about. It’s probably one step above fretting over whether we’re trending towards “tomato girl summer”, “lavender girl summer”, or “apoplectic girl summer”. That said, it might be wise to use this as a teachable moment and review some important rules about age-gap relationships.First, if you are a 38-year-old adult whose 17-year-old love interest is still at high school, you need to be sent straight into detention. I’m not pointing any fingers here, but I suggest you Google what Jerry Seinfeld was up towhen he was 38 in 1993.Second, if you area 72-year-old manwho has a child with a 30-year-old who happens to be the former stepdaughter you first met when she was four, that’s … problematic. Again, I’m not pointing fingers, just advising you to research Elon Musk’s father. It explains a lot about how poor Elon turned out.Third, if you are middle-aged andeveryoneyou date is under 25, it’s less a sign of their maturity than it is a red flag about yours. I was going to cite Leonardo DiCaprio here but, after years of dumping girlfriends the moment they turned 25, he nowseems settled downwith a 27-year-old. It looks as if 50-year-old Leo has finally grown up.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Enemies are deterred because an attack on one is understood as an attack on all. That is why Donald Trump’s record of ambivalence has been so destabilising.Nato leaders, gathered for their annual summit in The Hague this week, were heartened to hear the US president say he is “with them all the way”. It was a stronger affirmation of the alliance’s purpose than the one he had given the previous day. Asked about his commitment to article 5, Mr Trump equivocated, saying: “It depends on your definition.”That implies some category of tolerable attack on a fellow Nato member. Such ambiguity invites Russia to keep testing the threshold with escalating campaigns of sabotage and provocation on the alliance’s eastern border and at sea. But Mr Trump doesn’t seeVladimir Putinas an adversary. He speaks warmly of their telephone calls. He doesn’t recognise the Russian president’s culpability for the war in Ukraine and has shown willingness to broker a peace deal there in terms that would amount to a Kremlin victory. His administration is resisting tighter sanctions on Moscow.By contrast, most European delegates at the summit see Moscow’s extreme hostility to the west as by far their most urgent strategic challenge. Mr Putin’s rhetoric and the state propaganda machine that promotes his agenda are ferociously bellicose. Ukraine’s experience suggests it is unwise to dismiss such language as the stuff of empty threat. The Russian economy isgeared to war. Europe needs to upgrade its defence and deterrence systems in response.To that end, Nato members havepledged to spend5% of GDP by 2035. This is as much an investment in keeping the US engaged as a plan to supplement the shortfall if Mr Trump’s support should wane. Previous US presidents expressed frustration with what they saw as European free-riding on Pentagon security guarantees, but none threatened to quit the alliance, as Mr Trump did in 2018.Such volatile unreliability has proved effective as a device for forcing European leaders to do something most recognised they needed to do anyway.Mark Rutte, the Nato secretary-general, pointedly praised the US president for his galvanising effect. “Dear Donald, you made this change possible,” he said.Thefawning stylemay be required when dealing with an egotistical president, but that very necessity reveals a brittleness in the transatlantic unity on display. Mr Trump’s noncommittal caprice is not a minor character foible that can be managed with flattery. It is a function of his inability to conceive of truly reciprocal partnerships between states. He sees other Nato members as vassals and feels no durable obligation to them. He has no affection or respect for democracy and is at home in the company of despots. But he also commands the military power on which European democracies depend for their security, and will continue to depend for some time.There is no easy resolution to this tension, between reliance on the US and the president’s inherent unreliability. But there is growing clarity among European democracies that they must expect to take ever more responsibility for their collective security. It is a difficult, expensive path, but the costs and risks of not taking it are surely greater.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What – whenit disappears– can set back children’s education, damage mental wellbeing, drive conflict within communities and become a vector for racial hatred?The humble donkey has rarely been in the spotlight. Yet Chinese demand for its skin proved so destabilising that African governments agreed toa continent-wide banon the slaughter of the animal for its hide last year. This week, officials are meeting in Ivory Coast to discuss implementation.A recentpaperby Dr Lauren Johnston of the University of Sydney outlines the extraordinary rise and fall of the Sino-African trade in donkey skins, and its repercussions. Ejiao – donkey hide gelatine – was first developed around 3,000 years ago and is used in traditional Chinese medicine, and more recently in beauty products. Longstanding demand was supercharged by growing prosperity and media influence, reportedly surging after characters in a popular Chinese TV period drama, Empresses in the Palace, were shown taking it. But while production of ejiao had been industrialised, a problem soon emerged: donkeys are notably hard to breed. Ejiao consumption equates to 4m to 5m hides per year, equivalent to almost a tenth of the global donkey population. China’s stock of animals plummeted from 11 million in the early 1990s to just 2 million – and attention turned to African hides.The continent is home to almost two-thirds of the world’s 53 million donkeys. Their use as beasts of burden there dates back even further than the invention of ejiao; owners describe them aspriceless. Despite governments’ attempts to regulate the trade in hides, there were repeated complaints not only of inhumane treatment but also crime; on one estimate, as many as a third of the exported hides were stolen. Families woke to find their animals had vanished, or been slaughtered and skinned on the spot.Many could not afford to replace them, because the price of new animals had soared. Without the creatures, women are often forced to carry heavy loads of firewood or water; children may be kept home to help with chores; families can no longer rent donkeys to neighbours, reducing their incomes. Former owners reported reduced wellbeing and increased stress. Some suspected their neighbours of stealing their donkeys, and in South Africa, online posts about Chinese gangs involved in the illicit trade attracted commentsinciting racial hatred. The African Union ban may tackle some of these problems. But it may also be shifting them. In Pakistan, the price of the animalshas rocketed.The case of the missing donkeys may sound like a niche concern but is really a particular instance of a pressing global issue. Oil and minerals may get the attention, but growing competition for resources – driven by increasing prosperity in economies such as China and India and the pace of consumer culture – can pop up in unexpected areas, hit the poorest hardest and create new diplomatic, social and economic tensions. Addressing such cases will take not only determination but ingenuity and a willingness to work with unlikely allies: Africa’s ban was driven by a coalition of farmers, animal rights campaigners, economists, gender activists, religious leaders and others. It will also need to be done at speed. The donkey shock is not a one-off, but a warning of other potential flashpoints ahead.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But, even in retirement, he is discovering new tricks. For more than an hour he has little kids from West Byfleet junior school transfixed as he coaches them through the joys of mini-tennis. There are swings and wild misses, gentle advice and high fives. In fact Murray is so locked in, he even makes his familiar power-exhale noise while he gently lifts the ball over a tiny net.In short, he is a natural – even if he doesn’t quite see it that way himself. “I think they were just buzzing to get a few hours out of the classroom to be honest,” he says, typically self-effacing, as he chats during a quick break. “But it’s great. I love seeing kids on a tennis court having fun.”That includes his four children. Although he indicates that none of them have the desire or talent to be the next Andy Murray.Andy Murray hopeful Wimbledon statue will not repeat Shanghai’s terracotta gaffeRead more“They’re not good tennis players,” he says, smiling. “But my eldest daughter had her first school match yesterday. I hit a couple of balls with her in the morning. She was saying to me, ‘oh, I’m terrible’ and she was laughing about it. But she actually went undefeated. She and her partner won their matches. We were a bit surprised at her level being that high. So they all hit a little bit, but not a whole lot.”Murray is in West Byfleet to promote an LTA and government initiative that has led to more than 3,000 dilapidated park tennis courts being brought back to life in three years. It is something that clearly matters deeply to him.“When I was growing up, a lot of the park courts around where we lived were almost unusable with broken nets and weeds growing out the ground,” he says. “So to have 3,000 more courts just gives more people an opportunity to play. If you want more players at the top, this is where it starts.”With that, Murray’s thoughts inevitably turn to Wimbledon. Although he admits that now his playing days are behind him, and hiscoaching stint with Novak Djokovic has ended, it will take something special to lure him back to the All England Club this year.View image in fullscreenAndy Murray says he won’t be giving public advice to Jack Draper with Wimbledon about to start.Photograph: Christopher Lee/Getty Images for LTA“I don’t have any plans to go,” he says. “I’m not working there. I don’t go to watch tennis as a fan. But if one of my kids wanted to go along and watch, I obviously would take them. Or if a British player made the final I would go. I went to theDjokovic v Alcaraz finala couple of years ago, just because I had a feeling it was going to be a great match. But I won’t be there otherwise.”Given Jack Draper’s form, Murray may have to change his mind and he is clearly impressed with the 23-year-old’s development.“I’m not surprised that he’s up there,” he says. “I trained with him quite a bit when he was younger, and he’s very good. He has a brilliant game. He’s a big guy, lefty, with a big forehand and a really consistent backhand. He also moves really well for a big guy.“He just had lots of niggles and various injury issues. But this year he’s been fit for the majority of the season and his ranking is where it should be and where it deserves to be.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And sometimes that advice is contrary to what your coach is telling you. But I would obviously speak to him and his coach privately.”However, Murray is optimistic about the state of British tennis, with Jacob Fearnley also coming through and three women – Emma Raducanu, Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal – all in the world’s top 50.“We’re going well at the moment,” he says. “Jack’s done very well. Emma’s a grand slam champion. Sonay’s had a brilliant year. And what Jacob has done in the last year is not quite unprecedented, but it’s very impressive. To come out of college and be around the top 50 is great to see.”View image in fullscreenAndy Murray (left) embraces Jack Draper after the pair played at Indian Wells in 2023.Photograph: Ella Ling/ShutterstockFor now, though, Murray admits he is likely to spend more time working on his golf game than watching tennis. Especially now his handicap, which was seven last year, has come down.“It’s not seven any more,” he says. “I’m two now. I was a bit better than that, but recently I’ve been struggling. So yeah, my handicap is going in the wrong direction.”But didn’t he nearly win his club championship recently? “I don’t know about nearly won,” he shoots back. “I was one shot behind the leader on the middle of the 13th fairway on the second and final day. But I didn’t manage to get it done.”When it comes to ex-players Murray reckons that Tim Henman, who is off scratch, is the one to beat. “I played with him on Monday,” he says. “Wimbledon had a golf day with some of the players. He played, along with Alcaraz, De Minaur and Lleyton Hewitt. We were in different groups but Tim played very well. He’s really, really good.” Before he leaves, Murray wants to get a final message across: that he is backing the LTA’s call for more government funding to provide 40 covered tennis, padel and multisport facilities, especially in areas of highest social deprivation.“It is essential in this country for the winter months,” he says. “Because the weather is not great, particularly up north. It’s tough. It’s not easy to go out and want to run around when it’s freezing cold and raining. So more covered courts will make a big difference.”It is a message that is soaked in Murray’s upbringing in Scotland. But, as you watch him high five another excited child, you realise it comes from the heart too.Explore more on these topicsAndy MurrayWimbledonTennisinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Then, after listening to the hit from Zootropolis, she will try to chase down the impossible.The 31-year-old from Kenya is already a three-time Olympic champion, the world mile record holder, and arguably the greatest female middle-distance runner in history. And now she intends a spectacular encore, by becoming the first woman to crash throughthe four-minute mile barrier.Gout Gout breaks his own 200m national record in latest stunning runRead moreEvery scientific instinct suggests it won’t happen – at least not yet. Kipyegon’s world record for the mile is 4min 7.64sec, which means she will have to find nearly eight seconds. In a sport decided by fractions, that is a chasm.Yet Faith certainly has faith that she can emulate Sir Roger Bannister, who was the first man to achieve the feat in 1954. “You can’t limit yourself,” she says. “You have to dream, to go for that risk and just believe in yourself in everything you do. We all have the same dreams. And what a man can do, a woman can do.”They are powerful words. But biology may deliver a blunt reality check. As the top track and field coach Steve Magness points out, to be capable of a sub-four mile an athlete needs to be capable of running the 800m in about 1min 53sec – four seconds quicker than Kipyegon has ever gone.While she will be armedwith several new pieces of kit, including a special aerodynamic skinsuit with “3D-printed aeronodes”, which draws on similar technology used by British Cycling and British Skeleton when they dominated the Summer and Winter Olympics, it is unlikely to make a substantial difference.One scientist involved in the British Cycling skinsuits told the Guardian they were never used by Team GB in track and field because the benefits did not translate. “I expect the suit to have negligible effect. At world-class level, we’d expect a 10% reduction in drag to have around a nine times greater performance advantage for cycling compared to running.”So what else is there? Well, Kipyegon has new super spikes, whichNikesays are lighter and more propulsive than ever before. Even so, they are unlikely to be worth more than a second over a mile.View image in fullscreenKipyegon will have to bridge a huge gulf to reach her goal.Photograph: Remo Casilli/ReutersThat brings us to drafting. When Kipyegon runs she will have a team of pacers surrounding her to block out the wind and make her run faster. But how much faster? According to the scientist, it is hard to see anything more than a two- to three-second improvement from “perfect” drafting in real-world conditions. That would still leave Kipyegon several seconds short of her dream.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAnother leading sports scientist, Ross Tucker, reckons that an option to gain about 0.5sec might be for Kipyegon to run in lane six to create a “circle” or bubble around her, rather than a line. “So she’d benefit from drafting to the front, front left and front right,” he says. That, acknowledges Tucker, would still not be enough, but he wonders whether Nike might yet have another trick up its sleeve. Perhaps. Or maybe the reality is more prosaic. There is no magic bullet, yet, to get Kipyegon all the way to 3min 59sec.Certainly Nike is not making the sort of bullish noises it did when it fundedEliud Kipchoge’s first attemptat a sub-two hour marathon distance in 2017. Back then, Nike also gave detailed specifics when it came to the improvement from its super shoes. This time around its experts have been far more vague.Still, a question remains. Would Nike really be doing this if Kipyegon didn’t have a shot at the impossible – even if it won’t count as a world record under WorldAthleticsrules as it is not an official race? It all makes for a highly intriguing four minutes. So what is it? Nike PR stunt or groundbreaking moment for women? Kipyegon is about to face her moment of truth.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsNikefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Take three years ago, when word got back that Brendon McCullum had told his England players to “run towards the danger” at Trent Bridge before Jonny Bairstowvaporised a target of 299against New Zealand. It was like ruddy catnip for the press corps.This time,after reeling in 371 at Headingleyon Tuesday at a breezy 4.5 runs per over and with 14 overs to spare? Apparently very little was said in the dressing room beforehand beyond “bat the day, win the game” or Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett deciding between them to ignore the target and just “play like it was day one”.Ben Stokes hits back at England critics: ‘Test matches are played over five days’Read moreNot nearly so sexy, admittedly, but perhaps in its own way just as instructive. It may just be that after three years of McCullum and Ben Stokes unstitching some old-world English thinking about chasing – pressure, historical precedence, securing the draw before turning thoughts to the win – we are witnessing the upshot: a team with such clarity in these situations that sabres no longer need to be rattled.“My mindset was a bit different to what it has been over the last couple of years,” said Duckett, his match-winning 149 from 170 balls having begun with caution against the obvious threat of Jasprit Bumrah. “It was potentially a bit of maturity from me kicking in, trying to see [Bumrah] off, not necessarily playing any big shots, and knowing it would get easier.“And massive credit to Zak [who made 65 in an opening stand of 188]. The way he played, I took my hat off to him. He is definitely thinking about batting differently now. He’s still smacking the bad ball away, but his thought process is so calm.”It does feel like the project as a whole has gone this way of late; that the big talk has not only receded in public – as per Rob Key’s directive – but also eased off behind closed doors. There were still moments when aggression tipped into self-harm, Jamie Smith holing out on day three with the second new ball moments away. But at the back end of the chase, 69 to win, Smith fed off Joe Root’s typically low heart-rate at the other end and played a gem for his 44 not out.View image in fullscreenJoe Root and Jamie Smith remained calm to seal England’s victory.Photograph: Allan McKenzie/SWpix.com/ShutterstockThis is where the naysayers will interject, pointing to the catches India grassed, a pitch that stayed largely true to the end, plus another season of Dukes balls that seem to need changing more often than a newborn’s nappy. Just like the one-day team under Eoin Morgan that stuck an extra run on established scoring rates between 2015 and 2019, England being the team to shift the dial tends to invite a fair degree of scepticism and caveats.The drops? Well, England put down a couple of costly ones themselves. Pitches that suit Bazball? At Headingley, such surfaces predate the Stokes-McCullum axis when you rememberShai Hope’s magnum opus in 2017.Even with a few sliding doors moments, not uncommon over five days, this victory was still pretty remarkable. Not just the run chase either, but for England surviving two slogs in the field as India chalked up five centuries. Not long ago, shoulders would have slumped here.Alastair Cook said as much afterwards, telling Test Match Special that had he won the toss and seen the opposition reach 430 for three – India’s position mid-morning on day two – players would have been questioning his judgment internally. But not so this current bunch under Stokes, who, to pinch a line from his own Headingley heist in 2019, seem to “never, ever give up”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the 835 runs India scored in Leeds was the fourth-highest total conceded by a team who have gone on to win.

But go down from one to 11 and every incumbent contributed to this 1-0 lead. Even Shoaib Bashir did the thing folks thought beyond his current stage of development, the rookie holding an end in the first innings when the seamers struggled to locate the right length.Chris Woakes, you say? He has clearly had better games with the ball and, aged 36 with the body possibly starting to creak, it is taking him longer to get up and running. But then consider his 38 in England’s first innings, repelling the second new ball and one half of three partnerships worth a combined 111 runs. It was not headline-grabbing stuff, but it was central to the cause, not least considering India’s Nos 8-11 managed nine runs between them in the match.It is here where the tables have been turned since England’s 4-1 defeat in India last year, a tour that had the locals scratching their heads as to why the visitors kept compromising their ability to take 20 wickets by insuring themselves against a lengthy tail. As counterintuitive as it sounds after Josh Tongue razed their lower order twice, India would be better served playing their best four wicket-taking bowlers plus Ravindra Jadeja – and making sure the catches start to stick.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamEngland v India 2025India cricket teamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Dave Winter/Icon Sport/Getty ImagesIn the first of our exclusive Euro 2025 interviews, the midfielder talks about France’sbelief and being a role modelByAnna CarreauWed 25 Jun 2025 14.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 14.59 EDTShareGrace Geyoro has suddenly become one of the most experienced players in France’s squad for the Euros. Last month the head coach, Laurent Bonadei, made the controversial decision to drop the captain Wendie Renard, the vice-captain Eugénie Le Sommer, who also happens to be the most capped female player in France of all time, as well as Kenza Dali. Geyoro was left standing and the Paris St-Germain midfielder is going into her sixth major tournament with the national team and has a clear objective: “To win.”As we sit down for an exclusive interview in Nancy as the Euro preparations get underway she says she is optimistic about France’s chances in Switzerland. “We have a great team, we have young players, we have more experienced players,” says the 27-year-old, who has 98 caps and 19 goals for her country. “We score goals, we win important matches. We have players who have won titles this season, in England for example.”France drop Renard, Le Sommer and Dali in shock cull before Women’s EurosRead moreGeyoro describes the France team as very technical, very powerful and very fast, saying: “There are a lot of strikers who are able to play. Our weak points are that we may have less experience because we have not won any titles [at international level]. In difficult times we have to be able to be better because we have had disappointments.”Disappointment is an understatement. France go into most Euros and World Cups among the favourites, but have never reached a final, even falling short at last year’s home Olympics. At the last Euros, in England,they lost 2-1 to Germany in the semi-finals.“Since we prepare competitions one year, two years in advance, when you arrive in the competition and you get eliminated quickly, it has an impact on the mind,” she says. “It can be exhausting at some point, especially when you see the team you have.”Bonadei prefers to see France as outsiders, reminding his players that they will face the past two winners, England and the Netherlands, in the group stage, along with Wales. “I know that he believes in us more than anyone else,” Geyoro says. “He pushes us and knows we are capable of going over mountains. I would say we remain part of the favourites. I know the talents we have, I train with these girls. Honestly, we have nothing to envy in other nations.”View image in fullscreenGrace Geyoro says she did not have a female role model when she was growing up.Photograph: Zoe JeulinBut Geyoro must be fearfulof facing England, the holders? “No, no, no,” she says. “At PSG, Mary Earps told us about the talents the English team has. And we see their championship [the Women’s Super League], they [Arsenal] won the Champions League… we know it is a very great nation and we are prepared for that. But we must look them straight in the eyes so that we do not lower our heads.“I might prefer to play badly and win than to play very well and lose at the last-eight stage,” Geyoro goes on to say and she believes the squad shares the same mantra. We used to count on individual talent, to count on the difference-making of just one player. Today, we rely on the collective side. We need a whole group and those who come in, those who do not start the competition, maybe they will be the ones who will finish it.”Asked about Bonadei’s decision to exclude Renard, Le Sommer and Dali, she says: “When you know they’ve been in the French team for so many years, it can be a bit surprising. He [Bonadei] gave us explanations and justified his choice. We are players and the coach makes his own choices.”Many thought Geyoro would replace Renard as captain, but that responsibility has been given to Griedge Mbock, also of PSG, with Geyoro named one of the vice-captains, along with Sandie Toletti and Sakina Karchaoui. “An armband is what’s on the arm,” Geyoro says. “The most important thing is to have this leader on the field and to push the team in and outside the locker room.”View image in fullscreenGrace Geyoro became captain of PSG at the age of 24.Photograph: Melanie Laurent/DPPI/ShutterstockGeyoro became captain at PSG at 24. “I also had it when I was young. They didn’t ask me if I was ready or not. It’s you and that’s it. That helped me become more confident in myself. I told myself that to be given the armband is no small thing.”Confidence was something she needed as a young girl who started playing football surrounded by boys, back in Orléans, a city 100km south of Paris. “It was not easy,” she says. “You have to show strength of character. When I was a little girl there were not all of the things you have now for the development of women’s football. I was just passionate. I played without thinking about what I could have tomorrow. I just believed I could succeed by being a girl who wanted to play football.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I missed a female role model.Women’s Euro 2025 team guides: BelgiumRead more“Unfortunately, that was normal back then. To find a female football match at the time was difficult and I’m not even that old. Today, it’s easier, little girls arrive at PSG in incredible conditions.”Geyoro was born in Kolwezi, in the southern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and moved to France with her family at the age of two. “I was a child who was very protected by her parents, overprotected, even,” she says. “And when you have to go to boarding school [Clairefontaine, France’s national centre of football] at 13 years old, it’s complicated.“You arrive with girls you don’t know and you have to adapt quickly to the schedule: in the morning you go to school, in the afternoon you train. You’re also responsible for all your stuff. It makes you grow up so fast. You have no choice.”Geyoro’s route to the top has shaped the person she is now and that is why she wants to be a role model for the next generation, or a pioneer as she puts it. “My dream would be to win a competition with the national team, no matter which one, and to be remembered for what I represented. To be part of the legends you can easily cite when talking about women’s football.“We know that our careers are going to stop so it’s all about what you’re going to leave as a legacy, what you’re going to leave as a footprint.

We cannot change it, right?” the manager said. “So it’s better to play like in the last stadium [which was indoors and air-conditioned], it was fantastic. I’m making the selection tomorrow [Thursday] thinking about the second half because in these conditions we can’t play at our rhythm. But all the teams have to handle it, so it is what it is. For the next World Cup [in the US], people will know [about] it already, but we have to be ready to suffer. My advice to people is to bring water, hats and towels.”Guardiola also criticised Fifa for banning Rico Lewis for three matches for being sent off in the2-0 opening group gameagainst Wydad. “If Fifa wants to show how serious they are – OK. Accept the three games,” he said.Claudio Echeverri may miss the rest of the tournament due to the ankle injury he suffered in the6-0 win over Al Ain.

He stressed the need to relax during time off at the tournament. “The end of the season was so demanding emotionally,” said Guardiola. “It wasn’t the best for consistency and results. I decided we’d do good training but let the players relax for the rest of the day.“If they want to play golf, go to the pool, on a day off be with their families [fine] – otherwise it would be so difficult mentally. It’s to keep it fresh in the training sessions, not expending energy before the games because it would be so tough. We didn’t lose physical condition after the season.“Some went to their national teams and didn’t have days off. It’s maintaining [fitness] and relaxing. We have 11 months ahead of us. I decided for them to do whatever they want.”Rodri is not yet ready to play a full game after his comeback from a season-long injury. “Not for 90 minutes but he played the last [two] games 30 minutes or 35 minutes,” said Guardiola. “He’s making steps forward. In the last three or four days he didn’t have some niggles that sometimes he has [what can be normal after a long layoff].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The process was long, but I was taking my time. The most important thing was to keep focused and be strong. Not be sad or whatever. One day I’ll come back and this day has finally come and. I’m very excited to play again.”He has previouslycriticised the packed schedule for players. “Well, now it is a massive opportunity for me to come back,” he said. “Maybe if this tournament doesn’t happen, I will be on holiday. But for me, individually, it’s a great opportunity to come back at the highest level and play a tournament we have never played. The idea is amazing, honestly. I think we’re excited. You can see the difference between the clubs from and all around the world. It’s good and interesting for the people.”The Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson has entered the final season of his contract and the manager was asked if this might be the No 1’s final year at City.“I don’t know.

Meanwhile, the Arsenal full-back Laura Wienroither – who can also play on both sides – has been linked with a move away following her loan spell at Manchester City in the second half of last season.Hinds received widespread praise and support in March after she spoke up about being subjected to “sexually inappropriate comments” from a spectatorduring Liverpool’s Women’s FA Cup win at Arsenal. The incident occurred while Hinds was receiving treatment on the pitch and a member of the crowd was removed from the stadium by stewards. Both clubs offered her their “full support”, while Hinds said at the time: “Together we can continue to make our sport better both now and for the years to come.”Meanwhile, Liverpool are understood to be getting closer to appointing a new manager, having been without a long-term replacement for Matt Beard since his departure in February.Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenLiverpool FC WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

When the top order batting sets itself for launch of late, the results tend to be less Nasa, more SpaceX. Which is to say, the whole thing blows up. Ten days after scraping past 200 in both innings of the World Test Championship final, the specialist bats had another rapid unscheduled disassembly in Bridgetown, bowled out by West Indies for 180 to start the first Test. No Australian team in the Caribbean has ever made so few after choosing to bat.Australia lose stability without batting axis but could find a future against West Indies | Geoff LemonRead moreYou can trace a line back to the last time Australia played West Indies, in Brisbane. That first month of 2024,Shamar Joseph tore them up for 209 and won the match. In the 18 months since, Australia have been bowled out for 164 in Wellington, 256 in Christchurch, 104 and 238 in Perth, 234 in Melbourne, and 181 in Sydney. The fact that they managed to come back and win most of those Tests is impressive, but has relied on late-order runs and late-game rallies. It shouldn’t disguise the fact that the batting hasn’t delivered.Australia brought three innovations into this Test: Sam Konstas in a bid to be the long-term opener, Josh Inglis in the middle order to replace Marnus Labuschagne, and Cameron Green getting a second Test at No3 though his career has been spent further down. All fell for single figures, gone with 22 on the board. After a recovery between Usman Khawaja and Travis Head of 89, the second part of the slide totalled 69-7.It was Joseph who set this up, seeming to pick up exactly where he’d left off in Brisbane. Bowling from the Joel Garner End, he has half the height but can project as much presence, generating pace, constantly testing players with a line that twitches off the seam and bounce that can variously skid or jump. In no time at all he was smashing Konstas on the knee roll, reviewing it to show three reds, then drawing edges from Green and Khawaja.View image in fullscreenShai Hope attempts to take a catch off Shamar Joseph.Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesJoseph was on the heater, but for a time there was the painful sense that this magic spell of possibility would be wasted. Both those edges were dropped in the cordon: Green’s was the first touch of the ball for Brandon King on debut, Khawaja’s the first touch for Roston Chase as captain. The omens were bad. Joseph buttered up to get a second nick from Green, going hard at the ball as he does in defence, and Inglis made a rare bad decision in Australian colours, deciding that the end of Joseph’s spell was a good time for a Test No4 to manufacture a six over square leg. Wicketkeeper Shai Hope collected the high top edge, Jayden Seales the wicket.But Khawaja was still there, settling in, reprieved once, then a second time as King dived past a catch at gully. Travis Head was there, with his peculiar record against West Indies: two golden ducks, a 38 not out, then a 99, a 119, and a 175. To put it another way, as per the figures when he walked in, if Head gets off the mark against West Indies he averages 143. He soon drove the first four of the day, Khawaja took on a hook for six, and while the latter mostly batted time, Head’s bursts of aggressive driving kept reaching the boundary that a slow outfield otherwise put beyond reach, scoring nine fours while the rest of his team managed ten.But as they built, through a curiously long spell after lunch for medium pacer Justin Greaves, Joseph was gathering steam for his next burst. What a burst it was: Khawaja beaten for pace to edge a pull behind for 47, then Webster on 11 getting a work of art, angled in, seaming away, made to look even better by a clueless push across the line while the ball took middle and off stumps.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After Head slashed at the ball and a not-out review found a bottom edge on the sound graph, a catch that carried clear as day to Hope was ruled not out, despite replays showing the ball rolling up the keeper’s fingers into the glove. One frame where the squashed padding was obscured drew the umpire’s interpretation. This prevarication from ICC officials is something the governing body has to address.Luckily for West Indies, it wasn’t costly. Three balls before tea, then two balls after it, two South Australian left-handers fed cut shots to the cordon, good bounce sending the ball off the top edge. Alex Carey on 8 let Chase redeem himself with a good grab at first slip before Hope took the next chance from Head for 59, with Seales and Greaves the beneficiaries. Then it was Seales charging to a late five-for, more bounce accounting for Starc’s edge on 0, Pat Cummins smacking 28 fast runs before drilling to mid off, and Josh Hazlewood snorted out off the glove for 4.With a surprising hour and a half left to them on day one, Australia’s bowlers made some amends, with three top-order wickets and the nightwatchman shared between the fast bowlers, leaving West Indies 57-4, still 123 runs behind. The guilty fielders, King and Chase, are the not out players with the chance to make amends with the bat. Australia’s bowling strength and West Indies batting weakness may well combine to make this another match that the visitors can rescue, but when they leave Barbados, they will take their batting troubles with them.Explore more on these topicsCricketAustralia cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Politics is about prioritising. It is a daily series of choices and trade-offs. I fear we’ve made the wrong one.”The prime minister backed the historic measure, whichpassed the Commonswith a majority of 23. MPs were given a free vote.When asked on Wednesday if the bill must be implemented and the budget must be found for the legislation, Starmer told reporters ahead of the Nato summit: “It is my responsibility to make sure the bill is workable, and that means workable in all its aspects. I’m confident we’ve done that preparation.”Assisted dying bill: how will it work and when will it come into effect?Read moreThe assisted dying bill, which was formally introduced in the House of Lords for further scrutiny on Monday, gives terminally ill adults in England and Wales with six months to live the legal right to end their lives with medical support.This would be subject to approval by two doctors and a panel including a social worker, senior legal figure and psychiatrist.Kim Leadbeaterintroduced the legislation as a private member’s bill, and the Labour peer Charlie Falconer is expected to lead on the legislation in the Lords.Falconer, who supported Leadbeater’s efforts, said peers should not use procedural devices to block the bill.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In her testimony to fire brigade investigators she admitted she had thrown a cigarette that had ignited one of [the five] fronts.”Witnesses also reported seeing the incident.More than 400 firefighters, backed by water-dumping aircraft and hundreds of volunteers, have been battling blazes on Chios since Sunday, forcing authorities to call a state of emergency and dozens of villages to be evacuated.View image in fullscreenA firefighting helicopter on Chios this week. Firefighters say the wildfires are still not under control.Photograph: Kostas Kourgias/EPABlazes broke out in different areas of the island simultaneously. As the fires spread, fuelled by gale force winds, officials raised the spectre of some of the conflagrations being started deliberately, saying it was otherwise hard to explain how they had erupted in such diverse areas at the same time.Giorgos Toumbos, president of the Chios Mastic Producers Union, told the Greek daily Kathimerini late on Tuesday that efforts were focused on putting out flames raging across a prime plateau to prevent the fires engulfing mastic villages – 14th-century fortified villages famous for their production of mastic resin – farther south.A reported 40,000 hectares have been reduced to ashes on the island. It is unclear how many tourists were visiting Chios when the conflagrations erupted on 22 June.Kozanis said the fires were receding but were by no means “entirely under control”.“They have yet to be fully contained,” he added. “Yes, they are in recession but they have not been extinguished.”A Mediterranean hotspot, Greece is on the frontline of the climate emergency with the countryexperiencing a dramatic uptick in wildfiresbecause of higher temperatures and ever-drier conditions in recent years.Faced with a dramatic increase in forest fires, Greece’s centre-right government has toughened penalties for arson and ecological destruction with the criminal code foreseeing prison terms of up to 20 years and fines of up to €200,000 for such crimes.Greece is experiencing its first heatwave of the summer with temperatures expected to nudge 40C in the coming days.Explore more on these topicsGreeceWildfiresEuropeGeorgianewsShareReuse this content"

They also blocked off access to key buildings, including the parliament and the official residence of the president, William Ruto, with razor wire.View image in fullscreenFires were lit in the streets and central business district of Nairobi.Photograph: EPAIn the city centre, where many businesses were closed, thousands gathered for the march, waving Kenyan flags and placards with images of victims of last year’s protests.Others lit street fires and chanted slogans against Ruto. Later, violence ensued, with police firing teargas and water cannon and hitting protesters with batons, while protesters threw stones and other objects.A source at Kenyatta national hospital in Nairobi told Reuters the facility had received 56 people, most of them with injuries from rubber bullets.The planned marches also developed into clashes between civilians and police in the cities of Mombasa, Nakuru and Kisumu and other parts of the country. Protesters torched parts of court buildings in Kikuyu town in Kiambu county.The communications authority of KenyaorderedTV and radio stations to stop live coverage of the protests, threatening those that failed to follow the directive with regulatory action. The TV stations NTV, KTN, K24 and Kameme were later taken off air.Lawmakers left parliament buildings in Nairobi, and protests continued to intensify in the city centre. Elsewhere, throngs of people marched along major roads towards the capital.1:43Police fire teargas at protesters in Kenya – videoOutrage has been growing in Kenya over the past few years due to corruption, unemployment, government excesses and rising living costs.Wednesday’s protests come against a backdrop ofdemonstrations last yearprompted by proposed tax increases, in which dozens of people died and many more disappeared.The street protests reduced over time, but killings,arrestsanddisappearancescontinued, triggering more anger towards the authorities.Two incidents this month – the death of the teacher Albert Ojwangin police custodyafter reportedly criticising a senior police official on social media, and the police shooting of the vendor Boniface Kariuki at close range during a protest over Ojwang’s death – have further inflamed public anger.Stephanie Marie, a young protester in Nairobi, said she was at Wednesday’s march because of Ojwang. “It could be my brother, it could be my cousin, it could be anyone,” she said. “These are just normal boys, doing normal things.”She called for leaders to heed what they were saying: “The people voted. You’re here for the people. You’re working for the people … we just want you to listen to the people. That’s it.”Another young protester in Nairobi, Innocent, was commemorating the loss of his friend in last year’s protests. He said he’d been exposed to a lot of teargas from police on Wednesday but he was relentless.“The youth are unstoppable,” he said. “Because we’ve come to fight for our rights.” He added: “We don’t want bad leadership.”Explore more on these topicsKenyaProtestHuman rightsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Sorkin is rumoured to be directing the follow-up.“I blame Facebook for January 6,” he said in 2024 on a special edition ofThe Town podcast, live from Washington DC. When asked to explain why, he responded: “You’re gonna need to buy a movie ticket.”The Social Network was an adaptation of Ben Mezrich’s book The Accidental Billionaires, and the sequel will be based on the Wall Street Journal seriesThe Facebook Files. The 2021 investigation examined the damage caused by the social networking site and how internal findings had been buried. Subjects included the influence on the January 6 riot and the mental health of teenage users.“Facebook has been, among other things, tuning its algorithm to promote the most divisive material possible,” Sorkin said. He added: “There is supposed to be a constant tension atFacebookbetween growth and integrity – there isn’t.Jesse Eisenberg, who earned an Oscar nomination for playing Zuckerberg in the original, has yet to be officially attached to the project. He recently directed the Oscar-winning comedy dramaA Real Painand will next be seen in the thirdNow You See Memovie.The Social Network made $224m worldwide and won three Oscars.Zuckerberg has been critical of the film, including in a recentpodcast interview.“It was weird, man,” he said. “They got all these very specific details of what I was wearing, or these specific things correct, but then the whole narrative arc around my motivations and all this stuff were, like, completely wrong.”Sorkin’s last film wasBeing the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman as Lucille Ball.Explore more on these topicsThe Social NetworkAaron SorkinMark ZuckerbergFacebookJesse EisenbergSocial networkingMetaShareReuse this content"

For many decades, his speciality has been corals, but he has warned that the next generationmay not see their glorybecause so many reefs are now “flickering out across the world”.View image in fullscreenMarine ecologist David Obura at home in Kilifi county, Kenya.Photograph: Tommie Ominde/The GuardianWhy are corals important?Multiple reasons. They are home to a huge amount of biodiversity, which provides food and environmental services. They also serve as coastal buffers, protecting coastlines from storms and swells. In many ways, coral are like underwater forests. The algae living inside corals are photosynthetic and grow very much like trees. Together, they are the ecosystem architects, and if you lose those, you lose the entire ecosystem.What is happening to coral reefs?There are sudden collapses and also long linear declines. It depends on the circumstances. Climate change and pollution are really changing the background environmental conditions that coral reefs need to survive in. And then through fishing and other exploitation, a lot of their biomass is being extracted. There are so many of these different pressures happening at the same time that it’s a death by a thousand cuts. In the end, you lose the interactions and the complexity that characterises a coral reef. Half of the total area of live coral has been lost already. Many reefs no longer support the diversity and abundance that they used to.When scientists talk about a tipping point for coral reefs, what do they mean?Tipping points occur when the characteristics of a given system cease to exist. In the case of coral reefs, that happens due to a loss of the diversity and abundance of different species. At a certain point, this leads to the breakdown of the functions and the ecosystem processes of the entire system and if you don’t have any of those, then you don’t have a coral reef any more.View image in fullscreenCoral bleaching on the southern Great Barrier Reef off Queensland, Australia.Photograph: WWF AustraliaFor people who are not experts, what are the signs of a collapsing reef system?Firstly, less colour, because there’s less coral and other brightly coloured invertebrates. Instead, drab algae tend to dominate, and other invertebrates, such as sponges.Then in the water, you see less abundance and diversity of fish. What you hear is also very different: on a vibrant coral reef, there are so many sounds, it is just like walking through a forest and listening to all the insects and birds. But a degraded, simpler reef has fewer animals making sounds, and they sound deathly quiet.Finally, the three-dimensional structure breaks down. This may only take 10 years or so and then all the complexity is gone.Where is this most pronounced?It is easier to say where it is not pronounced. The last major holdout is perhaps the “Coral Triangle” in the Indonesian-Philippine archipelagos. It shows some resilience, though even there some places are strongly impacted because of local threats or climate change. In almost every other region, you’re seeing declines in coral cover and diversity and a loss of abundance and diversity of fish and invertebrates. That weakens the general health of the reef systems, and makes them more vulnerable to diseases and microbial activity, which are very harmful to coral species.The most pronounced losses are probably in the Caribbean because it’s a smaller sea; a regional basin surrounded by land-based impacts. That’s also true of the Persian-Arabian Gulf, where there are many places that may no longer be called coral reefs. Whole regions are now vulnerable to ecosystem collapse and specific corals within them are increasingly endangered.How close are coral reefs to a tipping point or has this already happened?There’s a huge amount of discussion about that. Should we consider a tipping point at a small local scale, or at the level of an island or a coastline, or a region or the whole world?Certainly it is already evident at a local scale; many reefs across the world have passed a point of no return. At the regional scale, I think the Caribbean may have tipped as an integrated coral reef system, even though there are locations that are still very vibrant, like the Mesoamerican barrier reef and some of the islands. All the coral reef regions that have so far been assessed on the red list of ecosystems have been classed as threatened, which means there is a high risk they may collapse within a 50-year period – unless the right actions are taken.How muchglobal heating do scientists estimate coral reefs can withstand?We have recently revised the temperature threshold. Up to 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said the tipping point for coral reefs would occur when warming is between 1.5C and 2C above preindustrial levels. Butin 2023, we revised that to between 1C and 1.5C. The world is already close to that upper limit and it will certainly come within the next 10 or 20 years as a result of committed climate change – which comes from cumulative emissions that have already gone into the atmosphere. So have we already gone past the tipping point for coral reefs in global terms? Perhaps.View image in fullscreenCorals during a colourful bleaching event in the Philippines in 2010. Research has found some corals emit a ‘sunscreen’ in the form of a dazzling colourful display as protection from rising sea temperatures.Photograph: Ryan Goehrung/University of Washington/PAWhat are the consequences?The most obvious is the loss of the physical presence of coral reefs, their diversity of species and their functions. That has an effect on people because reefs protect coastlines and are habitats for fish that we eat. They are natural capital – assets that support our lives. When we lose coral reefs, we lose a lot of the foundations of societies and economies that depend on them.Which fish depend on coral reefs?Most affected are fish that eat or live in corals. They are mostly small, ornamental species, such as butterfly fish, damsel fish and things like that. But more importantly, corals provide the structure that sustains a much wider diversity of fish that eat algae, plankton, invertebrates and many other sources. All are impacted when the structure of the reef simplifies.Are there any redeeming impacts?Not at all. When coral cover goes down, it gets replaced by algae. Sometimes this can lead to an increase in herbivorous fish, because there’s more food for them. That may be good for fishing in the short-term, but any benefits disappear quickly as the three-dimensional structure of the reef declines.Will this also affectpeople who don’t live near coral reefs?They’ll feel it in many different ways. First, psychologically – instead of going on holiday to see beautiful coral reefs or getting messages from friends about their amazing colours and biodiversity, they will hear news of loss and decline. Second, there will be an economic impact. People won’t get fish on their plate from coral reefs, and tourism and coastal economies that depend on reefs will decline.More broadly, the loss of corals will herald wider, systemic threats because corals are a canary in the coalmine for climate and other compounding threats. It means there will be a lot of other hidden tipping points, of other beautiful landscapes or the ecosystems that rural communities and even cities depend on. We’ve basically been using nature for free. If we had incorporated the cost of really caring for nature in our economies, we wouldn’t be in this situation right now.Is there any way to restore corals?Not yet at scale. Many techniques are being trialled, and many show promise – but they cannot replace what we are losing. There are now fewer and fewer healthy coral systems, more and more isolated from one another. The water is just getting too hot and too polluted, and there is too much extraction, all of which is punching big holes in the mosaic of reefs along our coastlines. Restoring coral reefs in this context is an uphill battle, and existing technologies are too difficult, and too expensive to apply at scale. What restoration does do is engage people in visible and tangible efforts to care for reefs, and this may deliver the greatest benefit, to finally build commitment to conserve coral reefs much more broadly.View image in fullscreenA diver plants staghorn harvested from a coral nursery inside the the White River fish sanctuary in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, to try to jump-start the natural growth of a coral reef.Photograph: David J Phillip/APWhat about experiments to artificially grow coral? Is there any hope of a technological solution?There are a lot of trials, and many innovations. I’m a scientist, so I think we always need research into new techniques, otherwise we’ll never discover them. But the thing that I am adamant about, particularly coming from Africa, is that money that would go into community development and local resilience and building up low-income communities should not be going into the pockets of researchers and consultants doing artificial coral restoration. Research funding could and should be available, but we have to be very conscious of the rights and the equity issues around hi-tech fixes – who benefits and who doesn’t.Putting aside scientific knowledge acquisition, how do you feel about the state of the world’s corals?Angry, more than anything else. I want to point my fingers at the people who are responsible so they change what they’re doing. It’s not the billions of poor people around the planet; they face local challenges and environmental degradation, but they don’t have a global footprint. The global footprint that is causing a decline of corals and so much else is from the much smaller number of high-income consumers and economies. Until that is understood and they transform what they’re doing, we won’t be able to resolve the challenges at the bottom end of the income pyramid. You, in the global north, have to change what you’re doing in order for there to be an option for better futures, rather than just giving up and letting the worst futures come about. This is my mission now – to make waves for change.Tipping points: on the edge? – a series on our futureView image in fullscreenComposite: Getty/Guardian DesignTipping points – in the Amazon, Antarctic, coral reefs and more – could cause fundamental parts of the Earth system to change dramatically, irreversibly and with devastating effects.

The region’s relentless warming means many of those no longer exist. With theArctic heating up four times fasterthan the global average, they have simply melted away.Forty years on, Moore’s research network, the University of the Arctic, has identified61 potential interventionsto slow, stop and reverse the effects of the changing climate in the region. These concepts are constantly beingupdatedand some will be assessed at aconference in Cambridge this week, where scientists and engineers will meet to consider if radical, technological solutions can buy time and stem the loss of polar ice caps.View image in fullscreenDr Shaun Fitzgerald drilling through ice.Photograph: Real Ice/University Of Cambridge“We want to get them down to maybe 10 [ideas] that it’s possible to proceed with. No one is talking about deployment yet,” Moore says, insisting that research is about “excluding the non-starters, the hopeless ideas”. “But we may have ideas that work if we start them now; if we don’t do something for 30 years, it could be too late.”The best way to do that, he says, “is by evaluating them in a rational manner; otherwise it’s just guesswork or religion”.Fromsunlight reflection methods(SRM) bybrightening Arctic clouds, stabilising ice sheets withhuge underwater curtainsto stop warm water melting glaciers, and evenbuilding vast mirrors in space, ideas that were once closer to science fiction have become increasingly mainstream.“None of these ideas are going to fix everything,” says Moore,adding that part of the issue will be to weigh up the potential cost against the perceived benefit.For Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of Cambridge University’s centre for climate repair, which is hosting the conference, it has been a 30-year journey – from working in emissions reduction to exploring more radical ideas to save the Arctic – as he became aware of “our futile progress” in slowing the climate crisis.The risks of not doing something need to be compared against the risks of trying to do somethingDr Shaun Fitzgerald, Cambridge University“I felt an obligation to further our knowledge in these other areas,” he says. Some of the more outlandish sounding ideas to be debated include the use of 10km-wide sunshades suspended between Zeppelin-sized airships andcreating corridors of anchored raftsto help Arctic wildlife that require ice floes. Other measures are already under way. Last year,British startup Real IceandDutch company Arctic Reflectionsundertook projects that pumped water on to the ice to refreeze it.For many critics, the ethical and legal questions around many of these interventions make geoengineering a fraught subject. In 2021, for example, theSaami Council, which represents the interests of the Saami people across Finland, Norway, Sweden and Russia, joined NGOs incriticising the proposed pilotof a Harvard-ledprojectthat wanted to test plans forstratospheric aerosol injection(SAI). This methodinvolves introducing aerosols into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight and cool the planet by mimicking the effect of a large volcanic eruption. The plan was, the Saami Council wrote, a “real moral hazard”.View image in fullscreenAn Inuit hunter rides a skidoo through meltwater in Uummannaq, West Greenland.Photograph: Lawrence Hislop/ArendalWith sensitivities such as these in mind, the Cambridge conference also features contributions onethics,governance,sustainabilityand publicengagement.Among theinterventionsidentified by Moore to slow, stop and reverse the effects of the climate emergency in the Arctic, some have been significantly researched already. But many ideas have barely made it off the drawing board, require enormous funds or have little chance of being done at sufficient scale.The conclusions, so far, are that ocean-based concepts come with far more uncertainty, limitations and risks, while a few scored so low against most criteria that the study declares them to be “unsuitable for further consideration”.One of these –modifying ocean currents– was first mooted during the cold war, when blocking off the Bering strait was suggested to make the Arctic more habitable. Years later, the climate activist Rolf Schuttenhelmmade a similar suggestionbut with the aim of increasing Arctic sea ice.View image in fullscreenOne small-scale solution already in use is pumping water over ice to refreeze it.Photograph: Real Ice/University of Cambridge“It’s very easy to go wrong, and no one knows the right path,” Moore says. “You proceed all the time with local benefits, and in the end, hope there can be global benefits.”Fitzgerald would not be drawn on which concepts he considers frontrunners, and says: “It’s really important that we maintain an open mind on different approaches.”Melting glaciers will harm us all. Yet still we watch, unmoved | Robin McKieRead moreHowever, much of the attention is on SAI and marine-cloud brightening (MCB).Prof Peter Wadhams, head of Cambridge University’s Polar Ocean Physics Group, calls MCB a “very potent” method. “It has the significant advantage that you can turn off the process if it appears to have a harmful effect, as it is implemented on a smaller scale,” he says.He is less enthusiastic about SAI, believing that it would be a dangerously long-lived intervention compared with MCB. Thickening sea ice, on the other hand, is impractical, he says, because of the huge amount of energy required. “It may work on a small scale,” he says. “But not on a scale that would make a difference. Marine-cloud brightening remains the best bet and the most carefully thought-out.”View image in fullscreenHunters return to the Greenlandic Inuit village of Kullorsuaq in Melville Bay.Photograph: REDA/Universal Images/GettyEarlier this year,UK scientists announcedthat they will launch outdoor geoengineering experiments, including into marine-cloud brightening, as part of a £50m government-funded programme. However, opposition is building in some quarters – in response to a petition, adebate was held in the UK parliamentthis week on making geoengineering illegal, while in the US, the Tennessee state legislature has banned it entirely.Tocritics who say potential catastrophes outweigh benefits, Fitzgerald says: “The risks of not doing something need to be compared against the risks of trying to do something. The research has to continue at pace because of the pace of climate change.”He adds: “If we think it’s bad now, we’ve got to think about the next 100 or so years.”Explore more on these topicsGeoengineeringSeascape: the state of our oceansClimate scienceClimate crisisPolar regionsIceUniversity of CambridgeEndangered habitatsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, global meat consumption is expected to increase in the coming decades amid rising demand from a newly wealthy cohort in countries such as China, placing additional stresses upon the land, waterways and theclimate.“We have limited resources and we need to devote them to the most promising alternatives,” said Dustin Crummett, the co-author of the study and executive director ofthe Insect Institute. “It turns out that farmed insects consistently score the lowest of any of the meat substitutes and the actual market for them is incredibly small, even in places that have a tradition of eating insects.”Crummett said that while some efforts have been made to put insects into items such as snack bars and bread, they aren’t being made into products that would actually dislodge meat consumption.“All the talk about eating insects has not made a big difference. People still have a strong adverse reaction to insects and there is no cultural history of that,” he said. “Changing longstanding culinary traditions and deep-seated disgust reactions is hard to do from the top down. If it were easy, more people would be eating plant-based foods.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Denmark, however, has provided a possible model of how to do this,unveiling a plan in 2023 to reduce meat eatingand bolster the supply of plant-based foods.“Plant-based foods are the future,” Jacob Jensen, Denmark’s minister for food, agriculture and fisheries, said at the time. “If we want to reduce the climate footprint within the agricultural sector, then we all have to eat more plant-based foods.”Crummett said that the Danish plan was a good starting point to craft an alternative to simply hoping that people will switch to insects.“You have to meet people where they are,” he said. “You need to make things easy and tasty, not just moralize and hector people. Once there are alternative products that are better based on taste, price and convenience, we will get some traction in reducing the impact of livestock.”Explore more on these topicsInsectsMeat industryMeat-freeClimate crisisAnimalsFarmingFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

There was a really good atmosphere in the queue, people were playing music.”This is their second Glastonbury – last year they came on their honeymoon – and they have a short list of acts they want to see, including Jorja Smith and AJ Tracey. “Raye is the big one,” said Troy. “Her style is incredible.”Liv Jones, from Liverpool, wearing her hair in rollers, was excited to see Lewis Capaldi – though he is not listed as playing the festival this year, after struggling with his mental health during his Glastonbury performance in 2023. “He’s playing a surprise set tomorrow,” she said. “On the Pyramid stage.”Paul McMenamy, from St Helens, arrived on Monday and will not be going home until next Tuesday, as part of the crew setting up and taking down one of the site’s three hospitals.“The lineup this year is not as good for us,” he said. He had been able to bring his wife, Melanie, along with him. Melanie said: “But it gives us the opportunity to see more. We’re not going from stage to stage, stuck in crowds.

Alongside the rock and pop stars, Glastonbury will feature talks on violence against women and girls, collective action, the Israel-Gaza conflict, racial equality and climate, featuring figures including the MP Zarah Sultana, the broadcaster Gary Lineker, the writer Reni Eddo-Lodge, the former Green MP Caroline Lucas and the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham.The spotlight is set to be firmly fixed on the Irish rap trio Kneecap, who have been subject to ongoing scrutiny over their position on the conflict in Gaza. One of the members, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, has beencharged under terror lawsfor allegedly displaying a flag in support of the banned terrorist organisation Hezbollah at a gig in London in November last year.Last week, the 27-year-old, who performs under the stage name Mo Chara, was cheered by hundreds of supporters as he arrived with his bandmates, Naoise Ó Cairealláin and JJ Ó Dochartaigh, at Westminster magistrates court in “Free Mo Chara” T-shirts. He was released on unconditional bail until his next hearing at the same court on 20 August.Keir Starmerhas said the group’s performance at the festival, taking place on the West Holts stage at 4pm on Saturday, is not “appropriate”, and the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said she thought the BBC “should not be showing” Kneecap’s performance.Performing in the coveted Sunday tea-time legends slot this year is Rod Stewart, who has said he would be joined by his former Faces band member Ronnie Wood as well as some other guests.Eavis has said the festival, which has capacity for 210,000 people, had sold “a few thousand less tickets” this year in an attempt toavoid overcrowding.Among the acts expected to draw large crowds is the alternative pop star Charli xcx, who will perform songs from her genre-defining sixth studio album Brat.The lineup also features a number of acts listed as TBA, as well as a mysterious act called Patchwork, who will take to the Pyramid stage on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalEmily EavisMusic festivalsSomersetEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It will also set up a new advisory panel drawn from the Jewish community, students and staff.Prof Frances Corner, vice-chancellor of Goldsmiths said: “The inquiry sets out a disturbing picture and I am sorry that our community and culture fell short of the behaviours we expect.“The report rightly states that we owe it to former, current and future Jewish students and staff to learn from our mistakes.“We share responsibility, as a community, to show Goldsmiths can be a place where Jewish students and staff feel valued, supported, and proud to be part of our university.”Corner added: “Today, we commit to lasting cultural change with respect to Jewish students and staff, and for all religions and beliefs, drawing on our intellectual heritage and our longstanding belief in social justice.”Sethi’s inquiry heard disturbing reports of far-right graffiti found in locations only accessible to Goldsmiths students or staff, while the college’s Jewish society effectively disbanded last year due to safety concerns and protests.Union calls for greater protection of Jewish students in UK universitiesRead moreOne Jewish student was forced to move out of their college residence because of hostility from other students, including the desecration of a mezuzah, a religious symbol at the entrance to a Jewish home.The report said: “The evidence set out above from students about the antisemitism they experienced at the college was also bolstered by the evidence of an academic, who informed me of the antisemitic tropes and conspiracies they had read in their students’ essays.“For example, that ‘Jews dominate media and culture and run New York and that’s why they could get musicals on to Broadway’ or that there are ‘Jews all over the BBC’.”Goldsmiths said it has appointed Prof Adam Dinham to lead atwo-year antisemitism action plan.It said: “This will build a culture of belonging for all Jewish students and staff, and for all religions and beliefs at the university, nurturing evidence-based dialogue, positive activism, and engagement.”Explore more on these topicsGoldsmiths, University of LondonAntisemitismStudentsUniversitiesHuman rightsHigher educationnewsShareReuse this content"

In a previous statement, they said they were “devastated by the loss of our beloved son Daniel” and were struggling to accept the reality that he would never come home.They described the Arsenal fan and hard-working pupil at Bancroft’s independent school as a “loving and precious brother” and “the most loved and amazing son”.Tom Little KC, for the prosecution, told jurors it was “miraculous” that more people were not killed as Arduini-Monzo slashed and chopped at whoever he came across in the 20-minute rampage.2:06CCTV shows Marcus Arduini-Monzo carrying out marauding attack in Hainault – videoAfterwards, Arduini-Monzo likened events to the Hollywood film The Hunger Games and claimed to have an alternative persona of a “professional assassin”. He had killed and skinned his pet cat, Wizard, shortly before the rampage.Giving evidence at his trial, he said he had no memory of what happened and claimed his mental state had diminished his responsibility for the crimes. After his arrest, Arduini-Monzo claimed his personality had switched and that “something happened, like a game happening”.He also said he had drunk ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic tea. However no trace of DMT – the class A drug in the brew – was detected in his system.His defence said he was vulnerable to “psychotic episodes with schizophrenia-like symptoms, prompted by his use of cannabis”. The prosecution argued that psychosis brought on by self-induced intoxication was no defence for murder.The court heard how Arduini-Monzo had made “stabbing motions” re-enacting the violence when he chatted about “killing films” with a member of staff at Broadmoor secure psychiatric hospital.Arduini-Monzo was cleared of one count of attempted murder in relation to one person, Henry De Los Rios Polania, but found guilty of the lesser offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.It can now be reported that Arduini-Monzo, a dual Spanish-Brazilian national who was living in Newham, east London, had an online profile revealing interests in violence, conspiracy theories and “incel” and far-right extremism, as well as figures such as Andrew Tate, Elon Musk and Adolf Hitler.At his trial at the Old Bailey, Arduini-Monzo told jurors he believed the world was flat and that the 9/11 terrorist attack in New York was “probably” a conspiracy. On social media, he had expressed interest in flat earth, chemtrail and anti-vax conspiracy theories.Arduini-Monzo’s social media accounts also underlined his fascination with traditional Japanese samurai and katana swords.In his defence, Arduini-Monzo described being bullied growing up in Brazil before his family moved to Britain in 2013. He practised mixed martial arts until an injury in 2016 led him to explore yoga and the “magical, miraculous and supernatural” aspects of spirituality, he said, leading him to follow a guru on YouTube and spend a year at a retreat in India.Arduini-Monzo said he was interested in martial arts, including Brazilian jiujitsu. His boxing coach, who asked not to be named, told the PA news agency that he was a recluse who struggled to fit in. Describing the former delivery driver, he said: “He was a bit different, but he was a nice guy. As far as I know, he did not have any friends.”Kirsty O’Connor, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “The CPS maintained throughout that Arduini-Monzo’s mental state was driven by his own cannabis misuse, which meant that he was fully responsible for the devastation he caused last year. The jury, by their unequivocal verdicts, have accepted the prosecution case.“Our hearts go out to Daniel Anjorin’s family and friends who have suffered his unimaginable loss in horrific circumstances, and our thoughts remain with all of the victims who continue to recover from their injuries and trauma.“The courage shown by PC Mechem-Whitfield, PC King, Inspector Campbell and others who selflessly sought to apprehend Arduini-Monzo whilst facing extreme personal danger was exceptional and undoubtedly prevented further loss of life. We all owe them a debt of gratitude.”Arduini-Monzo will be sentenced on 27 June.Explore more on these topicsCrimeLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

To overcome this, Lagrange and colleagues developed a telescopic attachment designed to reproduce the effect of an eclipse, masking the star to make it easier to observe surrounding objects that would otherwise be drowned out.This allowed them to observe the star TWA7 “pole on” – in effect looking down on its planetary disc from above.The images reveal three concentric rings of dust and debris around the star – structures that have previously been attributed to unseen “shepherd” planets carving through the disc. In this case, the astronomers were able to make observations of a planet itself, which appears as a brighter source within a narrow ring.The planet is thought to be a gas giant, about the mass of Saturn, making it by far the smallest-mass planet to be observed by direct imagery. Positioned about 50 times as far from its star as Earth is from the sun, TWA 7b has an orbital period of several hundred years.The finding is reported in the journalNature.The headline of this article was amended on 25 June 2025. An earlier version said the James Webb space telescope (JWST) had captured “the first direct images of an exoplanet”; in fact, as the article reports, exoplanets have been imaged previously but this is the first discovered by the JWST and the lightest by mass to be observed. Also, the exoplanet is 110 (not 110 million) light years from Earth.Explore more on these topicsJames Webb space telescopeAstronomyPlanetsSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

This year, as Donald Trump’s administration has sought to dramatically increase detention capacity as part of its crackdown on immigration, the company has received $10m in initial funding as part of a six-month contract,the Los Angeles Times reported.A new sign has been placed outside the facility and CoreCivic has listed two dozen jobs for the site on its website, including psychologists, nurses and maintenance workers.The development has fueled concerned among some southern California residents and advocacy groups. This week, people packed a city council meeting to voice their feelings in California City, a remote desert community of 14,000 people with historically high unemployment and poverty rates and limited economic opportunities. The issue was not on the agenda, but people traveled from as far as Los Angeles to express opposition.The Dolores Huerta Foundation shared a letter with the council urging the community to“make its voice heard and refuse to be complicit in a system built on incarceration, dehumanization, and profit from suffering”.“We urge you not to mistake short-term job offers for long-term economic health. California City deserves real investment – in housing, healthcare, education, and job training – not a facility that profits only when people are detained, dehumanized, and separated from their families,” said Camila Chávez, the executive director of the foundation.“ICE detention centers don’t exist in isolation. Every bed built becomes justification for more raids, more deportations, and more broken families. Expanding detention in California City directly fuels that harm.”Most people in attendance spoke in opposition to the project,KERO 23ABC reported, although John Fischer, a California City resident, argued that the site had been previously used as an Ice facility and significantly boosted the local economy.“What most people don’t know is the facility here started off as an Ice prison and it was very good for this town. It brought jobs to the economy. It brought other businesses into the economy,” he told the outlet. “Why do people support these criminal illegal aliens and allow them to remain here, costing us precious tax dollars?”The city’s mayor, Marquette Hawkins, has told media that he recently toured the facility and emphasized the city’s desire to have oversight.“From an economic standpoint, I’m told that it does have some benefits there,” he told theBakersfield Californian. “However, we understand that 40% of our residents are Latino. We want to make sure there is fairness, there. We talked about oversight and my office having the ability to do that.”Hawkins has encouraged people to continue sharing their perspectives on the facility at city council meetings.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaUS immigrationTrump administrationWest CoastUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Staff are said to have called police when they saw that the “bride” in a wedding dress was a nine-year-old girl.Jhaj, who prosecutors said was playing the role of the groom in the mock wedding, has been charged by an investigative judge in Meaux with offences including money laundering and identity theft. The nine-year-old girl, who is Ukrainian, was not harmed, police said.Jhaj was identified as the arrested manby the BBC, which has previously published investigations into him. French police and prosecutors have not named him, though prosecutors said the charged man had a criminal record in the UK for sexual assault offences.Jhaj is accused of organising a bizarre mock marriage ceremony that included an orchestra, a giant cake and a backdrop of a Disney castle. He had organised for more than 100 paid extras to be bussed from Paris. They believed they were playing the role of guests in a real wedding scenario.The French court also opened an investigation into the suspected corruption of a minor, designating the man as an “assisted witness” – a step before being indicted.Disneyland Paris is Europe’s most-visited theme park and can be hired for weddings outside opening hours at a very high price, with its Sleeping Beauty castle as a backdrop. The event had been scheduled to take place between 5am and 7am on Saturday for a price of about €130,000 (£111,000).The French state prosecutor in Meaux, Jean-Baptiste Bladier, said the British man played “the role of the groom after being professionally made up to display a face completely different from his own”.Bladier said French judicial authorities were informed by British police that the man “has been convicted in the past, notably for sexual offences against minors”.The Metropolitan police in London said a 39-year-old man was wanted for breaching a sexual harm prevention order and a breach of a sex offender register notification requirement. In a statement, the force said: “We are aware the man has been arrested in France for other matters and officers are in contact with the French authorities.”PA Media reported that the man was placed under supervision after being convicted of sexual activity with two 15-year-old girls in 2016.The French prosecutor said investigations had showed that the Disneyland “marriage” was in fact “a fictitious ceremony intended to be filmed privately”.The prosecutor’s office designated a 24-year-old Latvian woman, who played the role of the bride’s sister at the event, as an assisted witness in the investigation.The British man is suspected of “recruiting, with the help of a Latvian citizen, other Latvian nationals to ensure the smooth running of the event, as well as about 100 French extras, who were falsely presented to Disneyland Paris as wedding guests”, the prosecutor said.The Ukrainian child, who arrived in France two days before the event, suffered “no violence, either physical or sexual” and “was not forced to play the role” of bride, the prosecutor said at the weekend.According to the prosecutor, Disneyland Paris was deceived, with “the organiser impersonating a Latvian national and using false documents to secure the contract to hire the park”.Disneyland Paris has filed a legal complaint.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Although theTrump administrationand Kennedy developed aconflict of interest trackerspecifically for ACIP members, Kennedy’s appointees have not been added.The HHS spokesperson did not respond to Guardian inquiries about when and where new, written conflict of interest disclosures would be published.Instead, the spokesperson said the department has, “comprehensively reviewed all newly appointed ACIP members for conflicts of interests in accordance with federal law, regulations and departmental polices”, and that the members were provided “ethics training prior to discharging their duties”.The new members of the committee were asked to disclose conflicts of interest before the meeting began on Wednesday. The committee chair Dr Martin Kulldorff and committee member Dr Robert Malone omitted widely reported work in vaccine litigation, and nurse Vicky Pebsworth said she was “asked to read” a statement disclosed ownership of a healthcare stock but said it was below the government ethics office threshold for reporting.Ethics review of the new members was also the subject of Senate testimony on Wednesday.Under questioning by the Democratic senator Patty Murray of Washington, the Trump nominee to head the CDC, Dr Susan Monarez, said she was “not familiar whether or not the members that are participating in the meeting this week have or have not gone through the ethics review necessary to allow them to participate in those meetings”.“If it is known that they have not gone through the ethics process and they issue recommendations, would you accept them as valid?” asked Murray.“If they have not gone through an ethics approval process, they shouldn’t be participating in the meetings,” said Monarez.Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrVaccines and immunisationHealthTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But as Glastonbury kicks off this weekend and the season enters its peak, there are a growing number of controversies around crowd safety and management.In April, London Assembly member and Conservative mayoral candidate Susan Hall echoed Metropolitan police concerns about the potential for a “mass casualty event” at Notting Hill Carnival this year, and in May, the Mail on Sunday published an anonymous Glastonbury whistleblower’s allegation that the festival is a “disaster waiting to happen … Worst-case scenario, people are going to die.”Glastonbury 2024 had prompted widespread concerns about overcrowding and bottlenecks – particularly when big acts such as the Sugababes, Charli xcx and Bicep played relatively small stages. At the time, festival organisers underlined their commitment to crowd safety but said that such performances are “part of the magic of Glastonbury”. Now, festival organiser Emily Eavis has announced that Glastonbury has sold “a few thousand less tickets” this year in the hope of easing overcrowding. “Crowd management has become pretty much our biggest priority and the thing we spend most time on,” she tells me, with teams constantly “planning, tweaking and updating our crowd management operation” before and during the festival, “to make sure everyone is safe”.View image in fullscreen‘Focusing on individual behaviour and responsibility is misplaced’ … an ambulance is seen in the crowd during the Astroworld festival in Houston in 2021.Photograph: Twitter @onacasella/ReutersBut with recent fatal crowd disasters at Travis Scott’sAstroworld festival in 2021, the 2022 Asake concert at Brixton Academy wheretwo people died, and Seoul’s Halloween celebrations the same year, where 159 people died, music fans are understandably concerned about their safety at mass events. This has led to well-meaning but misguided explainers like that offered in a BBC video before 2023’s Notting Hill Carnival, titled “how to stay safe in a crowd”. The common suggestions of what to do if you are caught in an uncomfortable level of crowd density – have an exit plan, hold your arms out, breathe deeply – “mostly aren’t going to help”, says social psychology professor John Drury, who does training in crowd psychology and behaviour for the events industry (the BBC did not offer comment when these criticisms were put to them). “Focusing on individual behaviour and responsibility is misplaced,” he says. “By the time the crowd is so dense that a crush is likely or is happening, it’s too late.”Really, this kind of advice only serves to deflect attention from event organisers, venue owners, site designers, security, local authorities, health and safety inspectors and the emergency services – all organisations with the professional expertise, not to mention legal responsibility, that an individual crowd member is lacking. “The individuals within a crowd can’t possibly know what’s going on at the other end,” Drury continues. “It is poor management that leads to fatal crushes. It’s still too common to blame the crowd for decisions that should have been made weeks beforehand.”In the aftermath of the Astroworld tragedy in Houston, Texas, where 10 festivalgoers died of compressive asphyxia, it didn’t take long for attention – and the finger of blame – to turn to the crowd of enthusiastic young fans, headliner Travis Scott and rap culture in general. Lurid headlines and social media rumours spoke of crowd stampedes, criminal behaviour, toxic drugs, even Satanic rituals. Not one of these theories bears the slightest bit of scrutiny. “It was not an accident,” said Scott Davidson, a crowd safety expert in the new documentary Trainwreck. “It was an inevitability due to a lack of foresight and the abandonment of basic safety protocols.” (In a written statement, Astroworld’s promoter Live Nation told the documentary makers that the number of tickets sold was under the venue’s approved capacity, and that stakeholders such as Houston police “were aware of the event plans, which were developed in line with safety codes”.)Away from the doom-mongering and poor public awareness, crowd safety experts have a great deal of knowledge to draw on; they’re putting to bed pseudo-scientific ideas such as “mob mentality” or human “stampedes”, which are tired myths dating back to the 19th century, and long since debunked.When crowd scientist Keith Still is called in to investigate a crowd disaster, as happened after Astroworld, the first two documents he asks to see are the risk assessment and the crowd management plan. “The characteristics, the DNA of these accidents, are always the same,” Still says. “Insufficient preparation, lack of staff training, lack of wayfinding, poor signage, and allowing the volume of people-flow to exceed capacity, or throughput. They inevitably tend to point the finger at the crowd being at fault, rather than asking: what were the underlying fundamentals?”Density is traditionally monitored in terms of people per square metre – five is the upper limit for standing spaces. Above that, things get dangerous: people lose control of their movement, the crowd is susceptible to waves of motion and crushing and collapse become serious risks. At a large-scale festival with multiple stages you have more variables, and more potential for unsafe changes in density and pinch-points.View image in fullscreenThe audience watching Elton John performing on the Glastonbury Pyramid Stage in 2023.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PADrury says that understanding each crowd’s desires and behavioural norms is key. For example, he says, if you’re putting on a large punk festival, then of course you should account for a fairly lively moshpit: “People actually enjoy the density they get at the front of a gig, and they enjoy it at levels that the orthodoxy would say is unsafe.”He says that people in the live events sector have adapted well to shifting orthodoxies: “People understand now that crowd behaviour is dynamic and diverse, that they are capable of great cooperation, and to work with the crowd, not against them.” But, he says, “it’s hard [for festival organisers] to learn lessons if you don’t have an open environment for reflection on what went wrong … because these are businesses. But at the same time, there are many people in the industry who are trying to change that, and share what they’ve learned.”Anne Marie Chebib, chair of the UK Crowd Management Association (UKCMA), has been working in the industry for more than three decades. “The days of running a festival with a couple of radios and a clipboard are long gone,” she says, and “the types of risks we face now are more complex and more layered. Back in the 90s, things were a bit more organic and chaotic. Today’s risk landscape includes everything from weather to health scares to targeted violence” – she says one of the most worrying concerns to emerge in recent years is “the deliberate use of vehicles as weapons in crowded spaces”.There are many things festival organisers can do to mitigate excessive density – clear wayfinding, robust communication channels and real-time crowd monitoring are essential, and festival apps with site maps and real-time updates are not just helping fans navigate (when phone reception isn’t overloaded), but allow organisers to track interest in particular acts and forecast which will become busy: earlier this month, organisers at Manchester’s Parklife festival shut an entire stage down due to overcrowding concerns.View image in fullscreenThere are many things festival organisers can do to mitigate excessive density … Notting Hill carnival in 2024.Photograph: Ollie Tikare/The GuardianEavis says Glastonbury uses push notifications on their app as a way of communicating any updates to the masses, and she acknowledges some walkways “essentially have their own ‘rush hour’ where we sometimes need to restrict access or put in one-way systems”. Scheduling is also a critical component: placing two major artists with overlapping fanbases deliberately so that they clash might annoy some punters – as is the case with Charli xcx and Doechii at Glastonbury this year – but helps split up crowds across a festival site.Emergency protocols are also evolving rapidly. Astroworld has “become a touchpoint in training and planning conversations worldwide,” Chebib says. Travis Scott was criticised by some for continuing his headline show while fans screamed for him to stop; he has since said that he was unaware of any problems in the dark crowd below. In other cases, the message has got through and several major artists have stopped shows to ask fans to step back, and take a breather to reduce density. “The language around stopping shows has become more prominent but also more debated,” Chebib said. “The industry has always had the ability to stop shows but the culture around when and how to use that power is shifting, for the better.”Congestion doesn’t have to reach emergency levels to really ruin the day for audience members. To be sure, a festival is a complex organism with many variables which might influence the behaviour of its attendees: from their age to the day’s weather, from the exact running order of performers, to site location and design, to subcultural norms (rock and rap fans like moshing; trance fans might dabble in class A drugs). But these are hardly unpredictable in the way that say, an earthquake or a terror attack is.View image in fullscreenIdles’ guitarist performing in the Other Stage crowd at Glastonbury 2024.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PACharli xcx’s recent headline show at the new Lido festival series in London’s Victoria Park left some fans disgruntled – with a sold-out crowd of 35,000 squeezed into a space ill-equipped to handle the number of attendees they had sold tickets to. “It was a mess,” one friend told me, with waits of 30-45 minutes for the ladies’ toilets, and excessive density across the day undermining the fun and making mobile phone connection impossible. “To pay £68 for that is madness. It felt unsafe and it felt profiteering.” A spokesperson for Lido called the festival series “a great success” but acknowledged: “Unfortunately the new layout caused some toilets to be harder to find resulting in longer queues at other toilet blocks … we’ve taken steps to address it for next year’s event.”So what can ordinary festivalgoers do? Not much, except enjoy themselves, look after each other, and if it seems like event organisers are cutting corners to maximise profits, then they can vote with their feet and not come back.But as long as everybody is kept safe, then it’s worth remembering that the gathering of tens of thousands of strangers in a field appeals as much as the artists topping the bill. Eavis says that it used to be the case “that I couldn’t give Glastonbury tickets away” but today, in “a world that can feel quite bleak, having festivals that stand for positivity, unity, peace, joy, sustainability, new ways of thinking and just treating people decently is so, so important right now”.“Behind every risk assessment, every protocol, every camera feed, there is still a simple purpose – helping people come together to enjoy themselves safely,” Chebib says. “Helping people feel joy, bringing communities together, creating space for culture, that’s what festivals are really about. Let’s not lose sight of what we’re there for.”Explore more on these topicsMusicFestivalsMusic festivalsGlastonbury festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The fire devastated the Triumph’s electrical nerve center and crippled the auxiliary systems aboard the ship, from the wifi to the toilets – which literally backed up into cabins and spilled into the hallways. After three days adrift, the Triumph was towed to Mobile, Alabama – but not before the limits of socially conditioned behavior approached a breaking point.Poop Cruise review – a fascinating look at a toilet disaster that still haunts passengers 12 years laterRead moreTo widespread relief, however, the saga ended with passengers kissing the ground and laughing off the calamity as they disembarked – and the stricken Carnival cruise went from a potential Titanic epilogue unfolding in real time to the ultimate shaggy dog story. “When you hear ‘Poop Cruise’, you think ‘… OK’”, says Bafta-nominated director James Ross.“But actually there’s a lot more layers and twists and turns to the story.”His latest film, Trainwreck: Poop Cruise, follows recent documentaries in Netflix’s Trainwreck series on the fall ofToronto mayor Rob Fordandthe Astroworld festival tragedy. Poop Cruise doesn’t just dive head-first into the graphic details; it deftly walks the line between the serious and the side-splitting while reconstructing the epic yarn in 360 degrees.Right away, we’re introduced to a cross-section of Triumph cruise survivors: the bachelorette party looking to blow off steam, the nervous fiance traveling with his future father-in-law for the first time, the divorced dad who just wanted to have a nice vacation with his 13-year-old daughter. Their passive experience aboard the cruise – the bachelorette party ominously skipped the safety briefing upon boarding the ship and headed straight for the bar – is juxtaposed with perspectives from the cruise director, bartender and other non-Americans on the crew pulling 70-hour work weeks to keep the good times rolling. (Think Upstairs, Downstairs on the high seas, with bed-hopping above and below deck.) “It’s hedonism,” says Ross. “There’s this huge extreme of people on one end who are there just to really enjoy themselves and the crew who are there to facilitate that. But it was also important to show that this terrible scenario didn’t just happen to the passengers; the crew were in it as well.”Poop Cruise cleverly puts viewers back onboard the Triumph, setting its expert witnesses inside kitschy dining halls, bars and other backdrops that suggest locations on the actual ship. At one point during the interview with the nervous bachelor, Devin Marble, the lights flicker out – a fortuitous and poetic echo of real life, as it happens. “We were shooting in an arcade shop in a mall in Houston, and there was a power cut midway through,” says Ross.Poop Cruise also features one of the better applications of scene re-enactments in a documentary, especially when it comes to reconstructing anecdotes. (One memorable scene takes shape as one member of the bachelorette party recalls her disco-like endeavor to use a blacked-out cabin bathroom with a flashing beacon between her teeth.) Ross says he wanted the re-enactments to “not feeltooreal” but also signal to viewers that “you’re in this kind of hyper real place, because the real footage is the star of the show”.Ross had his pick from hundreds of hours of passenger-generated footage, each adding to this mosaic of civilizational collapse in miniature. Passengers go from cannonballing into the pool and hoofing around the disco to creating tent cities on deck and contemplating how long they can hold off on going No 2 before they have to break down and defecate in a crew-issued hazmat bag. Finding the footage of those critical story beats, says Ross, was just a matter of tracking down insiders such as Marble (whose vlogs became a critical window into the crisis) and sorting through the trove of video and photo evidence that was submitted for the disaster investigation. Ultimately, the fire was blamed on a fuel leak – a preventable failure that Carnivalknowingly sailed right past.Poop Cruise could have easily gone sideways again trying to shoehorn such a wide-ranging story into a tight 45 minutes. But it benefits from natural time constraints (five days) and legitimately earned twists that raise the stakes from scene to scene. A major inflection point sneaks up when the Triumph, which has drifted out of range for a Mexican rescue, crosses paths with a sister Carnival cruise liner – the Legend (which diverted its course to help). Triumph passengers go from thinking they’re saved to realizing there’s no way all 3,143 of them can be transferred over to the other ship safely. (The Triumph crew does manage to grab critical supplies from the Legend, and one passenger who required medical attention makes it across.)Worse, the passengers aboard the Legend shrug off the Triumph’s plight, gawking at the destitute ship as if it were a breaching humpback before resuming the good time that Triumph passengers had themselves signed up for. But when Triumph passengers realize they can “steal” the Legend’s working wifi, they throng to the deck with phones in hand and reach out to their loved ones. Shockingly, it was through those mayday calls that the world learned that Triumph was in crisis. Up to that point, Carnival corporate’s PR strategy was to relate as few details about the fire as possible – a scheme that kept the media uninterested at first. (“You give them what you believe they need,” says company spin doctor Buck Banks, “and no more than that.”) But once those Triumph distress calls started cropping up on Twitter and elsewhere online, Carnival was forced to reckon with a “complete media bloodbath”, says Banks.View image in fullscreenA passenger displays a message as he rides a bus from the cruise terminal.Photograph: John David Mercer/APCNN was one notable outlet that struggled to justify covering the Triumph fire story over Barack Obama’s State of the Union, Pope Benedict’s abdication, saber rattling in Pyongyang and other pressing news. But once the fuller picture of the situation aboard the ship came into focus, the network – which had just been placed under the management of former NBC Universal chief Jeff Zucker – went all-in on the story, and competitors swiftly followed their lead. Once the ship was under tow and within striking distance of shore, there was a mad scramble to intercept it in the air and go live with the first images of the deterioration. For many aboard the ship, that media onslaught was their first indication that their very own “three-hour tour” from hell was in fact drawing to a close.Of course there will be some who might not have the stomach for Poop Cruise. Besides holding the potential for inducing claustrophobia, it traffics – by necessity – in the scatological. (One of the cooks aboard the ship likened the desperate scene he found inside a god-forsaken lavatory to a “poop lasagna”.) But the thing most likely to turn off viewers is that Carnival didn’t really face any serious repercussions from the poop cruise. (In general, cruise passengers give up their right to sue when they purchase a ticket.) After a $115m clean-up effort, the Triumph was relaunched under a new name: the Sunrise. Buyer beware.The average person would never think to book a cruise again after surviving such an ordeal. But Poop Cruise is more than a deep rewind on 12-year-old clickbait. It’s a rollicking allegory for the precariousness of our modern world and the resiliency of the human spirit. “People were saying this was the best cruise they’d ever been on, I think because the crew worked so hard,” says Ross, who seized on the opportunity to make a different sort of documentary. “This was an opportunity not to tell a kind of dark sad story about a crime or whatever, but to do something where in the end nobody died. Yes, it was a terrible experience, and people learned from it. But it was also one of those ‘holy fuck’ stories.”Trainwreck: Poop Cruise is available now on NetflixExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryFactual TVTelevisionNetflixUS televisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rajan gradually realised that his mother, a practising Hindu, “seemed to have an emotional toolkit that I lacked”. Has this lack of faith made it harder to come to terms with bereavement? With this question in mind, he travels to India to take part in the Hindu festival Kumbh Mela. Initially, he’s slightly overwhelmed by the intensity of the pilgrimage, not to mention emotionally triggered by seeing so many older Indian men who remind him of his dad.

Dominique Thorne’s reprisal of her Wakanda Forever role is stunningly charismaticLucy ManganWed 25 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 00.01 EDTShareAmid the usual welter of pre-emptive criticisms, hopes, dreams, doubts and hostilities that suffuse the internet whenever a new addition to theMarvelCinematic Universe – or any other alternative world beloved of a fandom – is announced, Ironheart (the 14th TV series in the MCU and following on from the events in 2022’s film Black Panther: Wakanda Forever) has at last arrived.In the film, Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne, reprising the role on the small screen, which can barely contain her charisma or energy) was the genius MIT student who invented the vibranium detector that rather kicked off the whole vibranium power struggle, then the metal exoskeletal suit that aided the Wakandans in their face-off with Talokan. At the end, she returned to MIT and that is where we find her at the beginning of Ironheart, on a Tony Stark fellowship, and trying to wangle an extra year of grant money to refine the suit that could potentially transform emergency services provision. “Help would never be too late!”Unfortunately, she has provided herself with interim funding by completing assignments for stupider students and is duly kicked out. She returns to her mother’s apartment in Chicago with nothing but a battered prototype flying suit to show for her efforts, plus recurring flashbacks to the night five years ago when she lost her beloved stepfather Gary and her best and only friend Natalie in a shootout at the former’s garage.View image in fullscreenCreative capacity … Dominique Thorne as Riri Williams in Ironheart.Photograph: Marvel/PAWhat’s a traumatised genius inventor to do? Well, first she scans her own brain to upgrade her suit’s AI and this results in, effectively, the murdered Natalie (Lyric Ross) coming back to life and being able to accompany bestie on her new swathe of adventures. These adventures come courtesy of a gang of misfits who have assembled above a pizza parlour nearby and are bent on sticking it to The Man via one telegenic heist and/or caper per episode, accruing money and power as they go – with all of their plans facilitated by having someone in an impregnable, weaponised suit accompanying them.The group is led by the formerly petty and now much more ambitious criminal Parker “The Hood” Robbins (Anthony Ramos), owner of a mysterious cloak (with a hood, obvs) that enables him to become invisible – and who is also the sporter of a large tattoo that attempts to disguise a torso that is covered in scales. Is he the Big Bad or is he just the instrument of a Bigger Bad, possibly linked to the unearthly sumptuary powers hanging round him? I guess we will have to wait and see.Riri signs up to help the gang with three jobs to earn money to pay for improvements to her suit. Shopping for bionic and/or black market parts brings her into contact with Joe McGillicuddy (Alden Ehrenreich), an over-nice guy who lets people walk all over him until Riri starts giving him bracing life advice. His bunkerful of illegal tech and weaponry makes him feel closer to his father, an engineer, and Joe intends to use it not for bellicose purposes but for the betterment of humanity. Older, more jaded people might buy this story from a man with a bunkerful of illegal tech and weaponry slightly less readily than Riri does, but she is young and perhaps by episode three or so she will learn.Watch a trailer for IronheartWe all, in fact, must work quite hard to stay up to speed. Ironheart is a fast and furious business. Like Ms Marvel, it is clearly aimed at the younger end of the fan spectrum and the pace is relentless, as if the makers are desperate not to give the audience a second to look away. In keeping with the YA vibe, there is much weight given to loyalty and friendship rather than romance or sex (though there is a spark between Riri and Natalie’s sweet brother Xavier, played by Matthew Elam); no swearing, and plenty of flashy effects and cartoonish violence involving a lot of people being thrown against a lot of walls.There is also a very repetitive emphasis on The Choices We Make and how they Define the People We Become – how long you can hang out with criminals without becoming one, how often you can do the wrong thing for the right reasons without it corrupting you, at what point ignorance becomes wilful, and so on. To say it becomes preachy would be putting things too strongly. But “slightly tiresome” would not. At least until it’s time again to throw someone at a wall. And for that you rarely have to wait too long.Ironheart is on Disney+Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMarvelreviewsShareReuse this content"

Amy Heckerling’s high school romcoming-of-age masterpiece, inspired by Austen’s Emma, is now on re-release for its 30th anniversary and more than ever it feels like a complete joy, a deliciously movie-literate (and literate-literate) classic, with references to Stanley Kubrick, Oscar Wilde and William Burroughs to go with the Austen parallel.Clueless is something to compare with Bringing Up Baby and The Philadelphia Story – and Alicia Silverstone’s final, tearful scene matches, and even outclasses, Julia Roberts’ speech in Notting Hill about being just a girl standing in front of a boy. Like Withnail and I, it’s a film which is composed entirely of quotable funny lines and for each rewatch fans could lip-sync along with the entire film. Maybe some of the material wouldn’t fly now – Cher’s body-image jokes (“I feel like such a heifer!”) are … of their time … but what contemporary movie has this level of sustained wit and fun?Silverstone gives a lovely performance as the spoilt, yet innocent and sweet-natured not-quite-16-year-old Cher (like her friend Dionne, played by Stacey Dash, she is named after a star of the past who does infomercials). She is the daughter of a widowed, wealthy lawyer in Beverly Hills, played by the formidable Dan Hedaya, who had terrified audiences in the Coen brothers’ debut Blood Simple. Cher’s conceit is gently mocked, and yet we’re always laughing with, not at her. Silverstone is amazingly innocent and charming and her sublimely weightless screen presence has a kind of serenity and maturity that belongs to an instinctive comedy performer.Super-popular Cher, having already played matchmaker to her two teachers Mr Hall (Wallace Shawn) and Miss Geist (Twink Caplan), decides in her high-handed and meddling way to take a new student under her wing: maladroit suburban kid Tai (Brittany Murphy). But the endlessly considerate Cher, always thinking of others in her narcissistic way, finds it poignantly difficult to find a soulmate herself, having conceived a tendresse for the beautifully dressed Christian (Justin Walker) who seems to be more interested in hanging out with other guys. The awful truth is that Cher may have feelings for her goofy, annoyingly progressive stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd).Watched again 30 years on, it’s impossible not to marvel at the fact that eerily youthfulPaul Ruddreally doesn’t look much different now (really, it should be Rudd, not Sarah Snook, doing a stage version of The Picture of Dorian Gray). There is also, sadly, a tone of melancholy in savouring Murphy’s terrific performance; she died in 2009 of drug-related issues aged just 32 and like Silverstone, she was a natural comedy player and, also like Silverstone perhaps, she never got a role as good as the one in Clueless. There is great stuff also from Breckin Meyer as stoner skater-boy Travis, with whom Tai is really in love, Donald Faison as Dionne’s boyfriend Murray, Jeremy Sisto as the caddish Elton, and also Walker as the sleek gay exquisite Christian. Never was a title more misleading. This is sophisticated pleasure.Clueless is in UK cinemas from 27 June, and is streaming on digital platforms in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsCluelessPaul RuddBrittany MurphyJane AustenComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fries is a star on her home turf who deserves to be better known internationally than she is, although her role in TV’s Babylon Berlin brought her a global audience. (Before this, I had seen her only in theRobert Harris adaptation Munich: The Edge of War, in a not entirely dissimilar role.)Fries plays anti-Nazi resistance activist Hilde Coppi, a dental assistant in Berlin who falls in love with Hans Coppi, a communist who is hiding a Soviet parachutist; she listens to radio broadcasts from Radio Moscow, sends messages back via a hidden morse-code transmitter, and prints and distributes anti-Nazi leaflets and posters. She is finally arrested while pregnant, has to give birth in the prison hospital and then has to surrender the baby, Hans Jr (with a plea that her own mother looks after him), before she is led away to execution.Hilde’s story, told here by interspersing scenes of her grim prison life and the first summer of her love affair with Hans, is comparable to that oficonic anti-Hitler activist Sophie Scholl, but this is a more adult, passionate drama. Johannes Hegemann plays Hans; Lisa Wagner plays the hard-faced prison warder Fraulein Kühn, who softens towards her wretched prisoner as the dark day approaches; Alexander Scheer plays the diffident, sensitive prison-visiting pastor, who does his best to soothe her but is inscrutably present when the final sentence is pronounced and appears ineffectual and even blandly complicit. As Hilde’s condition deteriorates in prison, Fries’s portrayal is devastating.From Hilde, With Love is in UK and Irish cinemas from 27 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsSecond world warGermanyEuropeNazismreviewsShareReuse this content"

They explain their ‘no shame, no fear’ approach – and their ridiculous muscle suitsWed 25 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 18.26 EDTShareOver impeccable jazz-funk arrangements and Latin percussion, a man in a furry blue trapper hat raps like he’s inhaled a Benson & Hedges multipack, while his partner brings lip-curling, hair-twirling attitude to his own lyrical delivery. This is Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso’s Tiny Desk Concert, an online performance that turned the two Argentine vocalists into global sensations almost overnight after it came out last October. It has now racked up 36m views and Rolling Stone has called them“the future of music”.Some eyebrows were raised, though, by the English translations of their lyrics: crude, daft, often hilarious tales of parties, sex and girls – even, accidentally, goes one punchline,the same one. “We’re always having fun and trying to confuse people,” Amoroso explains on a video call from Madrid, during a 53-date tour that includes London, Glastonbury and Japan’s Fuji Rock. “Yesss, confuse!” his co-pilot pipes up, impishly. “Our life is like a TV show and we change in every episode. We have ourmeloso[schmaltz], our punky side, our rapper side.”The duo revel in “honesty, absurdity and contradiction”, they say. Some new fans lured in by their viral momentwere surprised to hear that their 2024 major label debut, Baño María, was far more electronic, with Charli xcx-rivalling electro-house, airy reggaeton, and – on La Que Puede Puede – a bolshy mix of dubstep, EDM and trap. In a South America still dominated by reggaeton, Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso are proudly, even subversively, unclassifiable.That genre-hopping spirit goes way back: the pair, now both 31, met at primary school, realised they had similar surnames (Ca7riel is Catriel Guerreiro; Paco Amoroso, Ulises Guerriero) and pursued music. Ca7riel became a guitar teacher, dreaming of being the next Steve Vai; Amoroso studied violin but switched to drums – “I wanted to be a rock star.” They tried for seven years with funk-rock band Astor, releasing a2017 EP to little fanfare. But soon trap was sweeping the nation – and the rest of South America – via YouTube. “We saw an opportunity to be seen by everyone,” says Amoroso. What do Argentinians do differently? “We have no shame and no fear,” says Ca7riel.They startedreleasing tracksas a duo, split in 2020, and reunited in 2023, though they still perform solo tracks in their shows. They agree they’re more “fearless” as a duo and write lyrics together like it’s a jam session. They’re also more famous, so much so in Spain that their Tiny Desk has been parodied on national television. Ca7riel has flown his 73-year-old mother out from Buenos Aires to Spain to experience the tour, the first time she’ll have seen him perform abroad. “She can’t believe it,” he says. “It’s weird to me but it’ssoweird to her.”You wonder what his mum made of their Madrid arena show. It flips through genres like a hyperactive TikTok feed, fromfunk-popto nu-metal, and, like their Tiny Desk, they sing sitting on stools like a boyband. When he’s on his feet, Ca7riel, who is also in the metal band Barro, has the strut of Freddie Mercury and a screamo howl; Amoroso, the Hansel to his Derek Zoolander. “We are giving everything on stage,” says Amoroso. The show ends with male bodybuilders who hoist them in the air, linking to the themes of their recent release, Papota. Argentinian slang for being pumped on steroids, the EP pokes fun at the music industry and image. The song #Tetas (direct translation: tits) depicts a fictional music producer in Miami who tells them they need to get buff, sing in English and go viral on TikTok – “to win a Latin Grammy”, says Amoroso. They’ve felt those pressures, but are setting their sights beyond the Latin pop world and collaborating with UK electronic producer Fred Again. “We don’t make music to win Grammys,” Amoroso says.View image in fullscreenDegenerados …Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso on stage.Photograph: @totoponsThe pair amplified their gym bro satire by wearing muscle suits on a recent Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon performance. But expanding later on email, the pair suggest they have a more serious message too. “There’s definitely a pressure for Latin men, especially artists, to look like action figures. Six-pack, perfect jawline, dripping in machismo,” they say through a translator. Mocking this, they’ve used a“chad filter”in their visuals,they appear naked in a hot tub on Baño María’s cover and they sometimes share a kiss at the end of their stage show. “We’re not anti-body, we’re anti-box,” they add. “Pop music can be so polished, so scared to offend, but we want to poke at expectations: of masculinity, of genre, of what a Latin artist should look or sound like.”Charli xcx and Neil Young to Juan Atkins and the Asian underground: what to see at GlastonburyRead moreNot that they shy away from polish: #Tetas has a knowingly saccharine chorus, worthy of Backstreet Boys. It’s the “most cheesy shit” they’ve done, says Ca7riel. But, adds Amoroso: “When the chords are right and the lyrics are fun, everything is possible.” Like video game avatars, they have “a skin that we put on and we’re able to change, musically and visually”. Lately they have taken to describing themselves asdegenerados– not just “degenerates” as it translates, but genre-less and gender-less too.As for Glastonbury? No word yet if they are shipping in the Chippendales but they are open to the great unwashed on Friday afternoon at West Holts. “It’s a special festival,” says Amoroso, “and the freaks will be watching us.”“And,” hoots Ca7riel, “we are freaks too!”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockRapDance musicElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What is education if not a prolonged process of copying, and isn’t the same true, Nell Stevens asks in her latest novel, of falling in love? Suddenly besotted with another young woman, her protagonist Grace begins to wear her scarf at the side of the neck as her lover does, and to feel “clearer and more deliberate and more like myself” as she does so. “When we fall in love with a person, we fall in love with the copy of them, inexpertly done, that we carry around with us whenever they aren’t there.”At its heart The Original has two strands of copying: both are preoccupations of the late-Victorian era the book is set in. There are the pictures made by Grace when she’s brought, penniless, to her uncle’s house aged 10 after her parents are sent to lunatic asylums (though her uncle and aunt may well be more dangerously mad than her loving parents). She copies her cousin Charles’s paintings so well that he declares her a magician – or possibly a machine – and then she makes her way to secret independence by creating clever forgeries and then successful copies of famous works of art, from Van Eyck’s Arnolfini Portrait to Velázquez’s Rokeby Venus. And there is cousin Charles himself, who is lost at sea only to return 13 years later, possibly as a brilliant fake, his jaw a little too heavy but his voice and manner so perfectly attuned to the original that his mother welcomes him delightedly back into the household. All this is playing out in a book that is at once a fake – a copy of the Victorian sensation novel – and distinctly idiosyncratic, the original the title proclaims.Stevens is one of a generation of writers finding new ways to queer the Victorians, who were themselves already pretty queer by the late 1890s, when Grace begins to have sex with women. Stevens has written one memoirabout not writing a noveland anotherabout not writing a PhD thesisthat were both rooted in fiction of the Victorian era; plus a novel,Briefly, a Delicious Life, about a ghost who falls in love with George Sand when she’s in Mallorca with Chopin. Despite its fantastical elements, Briefly is a sleek, conceptual 21st-century novel; loosely plotted, it takes its bearings from the unfolding of Sand’s own life. The moments of drama are made up of pianos arriving or failing to arrive, and doctors misdiagnosing patients. Stevens’s new novel is quite different in its flamboyantly Victorian plot. There are acts of murder and theft and betrayal and a narrator who never quite knows if she’s on the verge of total ruin or immense wealth and success.Stevens is showing herself to be that rare thing: a writer who we can think alongside, even while she’s making things upIt’s a risk, plotting luridly like this. One danger is that her talents will count for less than they did in Briefly, if the plot is so wilfully contrived. And her talents do lie in the realm of realism. Stevens is so casually magisterial at the hardest aspects of historical novel writing. These are bodies moving utterly convincingly through a world of solid objects: wet clothes prickling on skin; the thick, rotten smell of the Thames settling in the back of the throat; the shock of a lover’s cold fingers.But, of course, all fiction is contrived, and indeed Stevens is so preoccupied by how jarring this can be that she’s already written a book about failing to make things up. Now, having put realism aside, she’s able to explore what the contrivance of art can tell us about the contrivance of life – the authenticity that may be found through faking. Grace finds herself, happily, shaking off the Victorian era and emerging into the 20th century. Soon, Duchamp will scramble all ideas of originality in art by exhibiting ordinary objects as masterpieces, and Auden will praise man as “the only creature ever made who fakes”, urging poets to write lavishly and make “a rare old proper hullabaloo” in their verses.Throughout, the more Victorian-plotted chapters are interspersed with aphoristic lists of statements about copying, where some combination of Stevens and Grace declares that “the value of the copy is in the copyist’s powers of empathy” and that in preserving, recycling and disseminating, the copyist engages in “an act of tremendous generosity”. Generosity and love are what have been lacking in the house where Grace and Charles grew up; they find them through copying, accepting fakery as part of homage. The kind of porousness required by love may require us to bleed into each other in ways that make any notion of originality questionable. In book after book, Stevens is showing herself to be that rare thing: a writer who we can think alongside, even while she’s making things up. All the confection here in the end helps us to appreciate the steely and witty mind that seems, four books in, to have learned to delight in that hullabaloo of fakery.Lara Feigel is the author ofLook!

His new book is a bricolage of memoir, criticism and interviews with film-makers that explores the personal and political dimensions of this coupling. It opens with the author in Venice, preparing to give a lecture on cinema; writing in the third person, Gilbey describes himself as the “Gustav von Aschenbach of easyJet”, a reference to the ageing, lustful composer from Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice(played by a moustachioed Dirk Bogarde in Luchino Visconti’s 1971 film adaptation). Gilbey identifies with Aschenbach only because he remembers how his own once-hidden sexuality devitalised him: the closet “render[ed] him elderly before he had so much as touched puberty”. He employs the third person off and on throughout the book. Thinking of yourself as a fictional character, he says, is an “occupational hazard” for any film enthusiast. It can also be a survival technique for anyone queer, creating a distance between yourself and a hostile world.It Used to Be Witchesranges from the early 1980s – when “queerness in film started to become a commercial possibility” – to the present day. Its chapters centre on box office hits such as Call Me By Your Name,beloved independent films such as Chantal Ackerman’s Je Tu Il Elle, and less well-known releases. Thanks to Gilbey’s journalistic skills, his interviews with film-makers (François Ozon, Andrew Haigh and Peter Strickland among them) are engaging even if you are unfamiliar with the material. These conversations include illuminating observations on the art form (Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s remark that “film is a parallel life that keeps intersecting with real life”, for example) but Gilbey keeps the dialogue tethered to the book’s central questions: what is the history and future of queer cinema? How should queerness be represented on film? What, exactly, does “queerness” signify today? The voices he has assembled provide diverse answers, testimony that is valuable precisely because it is so often in disagreement.This is particularly true of the book’s strongest chapter, during which film-maker Jessica Dunn Rovinelli presents a compelling case for an anti-aspirational queer cinema, one in which queer and trans characters are free to be “vile subjects”. “If we can only exist as the best versions of ourselves,” she says, “we will die”. Portraying queerness exclusively in a positive light, Rovinelli argues, has the effect of designating only some queer and trans persons “deserving of participation” while others are left out. Gilbey segues into a discussion of the 2023 psychological thriller Femme (in which a drag artist is subjected to a brutally violent homophobic attack). After a screening at the Berlinale, transgender director Harvey Rabbit lambasted the film’s directors during a Q&A; a moment that may have affected their ability to secure distribution. Rabbit’s agenda (“More trans joy, more queer joy”) ran counter to Femme’s portrayal of queer violence. Weighing up these competing politics of representation, Gilbey notes that “a well-meaning liberal aversion to the dramatisation of trauma” can coincide with “a rightwing tendency to police or nullify challenging queer material”.He perceptively diagnoses the cinephile’s particular obsession (“sitting in the dark, staring secretly at strangers’ bodies on-screen”) and understands the chronic, vaguely paranoiac compulsion to keep watching, to collect and catalogue, as if some divine logic will become clear once you’ve seen everything there is to be seen. It Used to Be Witchesoccasionally overindulges in this stockpiling impulse, with some sections resembling a compendium of film titles and log lines – catnip for Letterboxd users, potentially onerous for the cinematic novice. This cataloguing mode fits with Gilbey’s commitment to blending different styles and forms across the book, a melange which confuses rather than facilitates his inquiry. As if to preempt such criticism, he expresses uncertainty in the book itself, a metatextual manoeuvre inspired by films which usemise en abyme(stories within stories) to acknowledge and thereby subvert their own artifice. He hopes his formal approach will push the book into “destabilised territory” – a natural place for “any queer work, an implicit acknowledgment that identities are not stable or fixed”.It’s a nice idea, but the persistent self-referentiality (“What he intends to do in this book …”, “I explain where she fits into my book …”) is distracting. Gilbey’s concluding revelation seems hard-won (“my research into queer cinema has begun to teach me how to be queer myself […] the options are infinite: I can choose any of them, or none, or I can invent my own”) but he follows it up with “I need to channel that sensation into the book somehow”. This device places the author in opposition to the reader, keeping us at a cold distance. Emotional sincerity in writing is always, to some extent, illusory – the form demands artifice – but it is possible, and often worthwhile, to commit to the illusion sincerely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We were mesmerised. Forty years later, I am playingDeath Stranding 2, Hideo Kojima’s sprawling apocalyptic adventure, and there are times I feel as if I’m back in that classroom. Most of the game takes place in a ruined Australia, the cities gone, the landscape as stark, beautiful and foreboding as it was in Roeg’s film.I’ve been playing for 45 hours and have barely made an impact on the story. Instead, I have wandered the wilderness, delivering packages to the game’s isolated communities. The game is set after a catastrophic event has decimated humanity and scarred the landscape with supernatural explosions. Now you pass through vast ochre deserts and on toward the coast, watching the sun set behind glowing mountains, the tide rolling in on empty bays. Usually in open-world games, the landscape is permanent and unchanging, apart from day/night cycles and seasonal rotations. But the Australia of Death Stranding 2 is mysterious and amorphous. Earthquakes bring rocks tumbling down hillsides, vast dust storms blow up and avalanches bury you in snow. As you go, you are able to build roads, electricity generators and even jump-ramps for cars. These can be found and used by other players, so each time you visit a place you may find new ways to traverse. Nothing is ever really still.Kojima named George Miller ashis idoland the influence of the Mad Max movies and their crazed, desolate energy is everywhere in this game: its interplay of technology and isolation; its feudal tribes and scarce resources, its weird sense of adrenaline. He has also seen Walkabout, and that film’s mythic energy is here, too, though perhaps lacking the strong undertone of colonial guilt. There is a rocky outcrop in a remote corner of the game map that reminds me a little of Peter Weir’sPicnic at Hanging Rock, with its labyrinthine crevices, the reddish glow, the unnerving silence.View image in fullscreenSun-stricken hallucinatory strangeness … Picnic at Hanging Rock.I’ve spent hours driving along highways in this game, picking up parcels and taking them to strange, inaccessible places – why? How have I been seduced into sitting in front of my screen until 2am ensuring an animal shelter gets its delivery of fluffy pyjamas? The answer is, in creating a version of Australia that is timeless yet subject to moments of extreme change, Kojima has played the same trick Weir did: this world is beguiling and threatening – and that’s what makes it seductive.Years ago, Weirsaid thisabout Picnic at Hanging Rock: “What I attempted was to develop the oppressive atmosphere of something which has no solution: to bring out a tension and claustrophobia in the locations and the relationships. We worked very hard at creating an hallucinatory mesmeric rhythm, so that you lost awareness of facts, you stopped adding things up, and got into this enclosed atmosphere. I did everything in my power to hypnotise the audience away from the possibility of solution.”That, in short, is my experience of Death Stranding 2. It is a game of hallucinatory mesmeric rhythms; you drive and drive, then hours later you’re back in the same place – except now there is a road, or a sign left by another player who passed in the night. What Grand Theft Auto has always tried to do with American cities, Kojima has succeeded at with the Australian outback: to interpret and distill the feeling of a place from an outsider perspective. That’s why, when I do actually make progress in the game and open up a new area for exploration, I get the same feeling I had when I first saw Walkabout on that rainy afternoon in Manchester as a teenager – it feels as if I am seeing an impossible alien landscape, rife with beauty, possibility and danger. I think it will be months before I escape.What to playView image in fullscreenMetaphorical comedy … Quantum Witch.Photograph: Nikki JayA few months ago,I interviewedthe creator ofQuantum Witch, a wildly idiosyncratic pixel art adventure about a shepherdess who loses her flock and then gets tossed into a metaphysical battle between duelling gods. Nikki Jay was raised in a religious cult, but escaped to live her own life – and this game is heavily inspired by her experiences.Created with a little help from Paul Rose, who wrote Channel 4’s famed teletext gaming zine Digitiser, it’s partly a point-and-click adventure but also a postmodern deconstruction of genre, with queer undertones.

Does it earn its price tag? We asked the developer what went into itAlyssa MercanteWed 25 Jun 2025 05.30 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 05.31 EDTShareThe Outer Worlds 2, from RPG makers Obsidian, will be the first first-party Xbox game to cost $80 (£70). Given that Nintendo Switch 2 games are already priced at least that high, and Sony’s own PlayStation 5 games have been pushing towards it for a while, you might not expect this development to ignite a pricing debate among gamers – but it did. The increased cost of video games is a hotly contested topic, given the unsustainably ballooning budgets that most blockbuster games are working with these days. But I can say that The Outer Worlds 2 is a much larger, more in-depth game than the2019 comedy sci-fi original. If we’re going to talk about value, it can certainly be argued that its higher price point is justified.I loved The Outer Worlds, which was jam-packed with the kind of wry, sardonic humour you’d expect from an Obsidian RPG (this is the studio behindFallout: New Vegas, after all). Its super-saturated space world, populated by colourful flora, bumbling corporations and strange zealots, was a joy to live in for 20 or so hours, though its combat left much to be desired.According to game director Brandon Adler, Obsidian knew The Outer Worlds’ gunplay needed improvement even before the game launched, andespeciallyif they developed a sequel. “We did a full breakdown on Destiny, because we love how that felt,” he says during an interview held after an Outer Worlds 2 demo in Los Angeles. “We also talked to the Halofolks … They gave us a huge list of stuff and said, ‘You guys should target this … you should add that to your weapon configurations.’”Obsidian’s research has paid off: not only are there more weapons to play with in The Outer Worlds 2, but they all feel good to fire, and offer a variety of combat options depending upon the encounter (and that’sifyou want to fight, as a solid stealth approach will let you creep through rooms of foes without a trace). In the original game, I’d simply avoid large-scale combat, or preemptively sigh before getting into a firefight because the gunplay just wasn’t enjoyable. That has changed in the sequel – I relished each encounter, giggling manically as I hucked grenades and dropped down from above to take out a target.“We didn’t want small changes. Every weapon feels very different; every weapon has a cool, unique purpose,” Adler says. “You can even take those weapons and add mods on to them to do all kinds of crazy things.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Entering buildings no longer requires a loading screen that can take players out of the fantasy, for instance. “Little things like that give a big, immense feel,” Adler says. “Exploration is probably the thing that’s most important to me. I want the players as they’re going through this big world to feel like they should go to every nook and cranny and open every door and go behind every little thing, because it’s always gonna be a cool, fun thing for them to find.”The Outer Worlds 2 offers a larger world, improved combat and even more customisation options that deepen its role-playing features (such as more perks and flaws for your character, which can drastically change how you play).

Gloomy lighting, claustrophobic sound design and heavy mood can stylishly cover up a lack of clear ideas with faux gravity. And yet for choreographer Botis Seva, who started out dancing hip-hop in east London and now tours to acclaim across Europe, that darkness has become his cosmos and his material.The eerie echoes, whispers and intense frequencies of Torben Sylvest’s electronic soundscore are paired with Tom Visser’s always atmospheric lighting. On the dim, hazy stage Visser finds different timbres of shadow and sudden switches of tone, and never enough wattage to clearly illuminate faces or costumes. Amid all this, Seva’s dance is like the workings of the subconscious.View image in fullscreenDifferent timbres of shadow … Victoria Shulungu and Jordan Douglas in Until We Sleep at Sadler’s Wells East.Photograph: Tom VisserA cast of six are clustered around a central figure, Victoria Shulungu, a powerful dancer who has been performing with Seva since the early days. Like some sort of sage, she’s as arresting in her stillness as her urgent movement. It feels as if this might be the artist himself, someone asked to lead, looked to for vision, but also seeking his own answers and salvation, in a cycle of struggle, hope, confusion, revelation and reckoning.From quiet, sparse scenes, we keep circling back to amazing bursts of movement, like statements of resilience. The whole group dances tight little steps with wiry energy, a pure synthesis of body and beat. The dancers scuttle like critters, spring into the air, or are buffeted as if on high winds (hip-hop languages are deeply embedded in the movement, but also a nod to Hofesh Shechter, Seva’s one-time mentor).The stage is framed by a minimalist set of tall poles that turn out to be LED lights, flickering like stars or flames, creating a wall or a cage. At one point they look like the teeth of a whale, with the dancers’ bodies repeatedly spat out between them. Until We Sleep doesn’t give out a lot to its audience; it is a deliberately opaque but immersive hour. There’s a confidence in being so sure of the work’s own world, and sticking to it; this feels like a deep dive in the mind of an artist coming into his own.AtSadler’s Wells East, London, until 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsDanceSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a delightful jaunt down the East River that raises questions such as: who from your local music scene would you save in a Titanic scenario? Tipsy people totter across the Liberty Belle’s promenade decks,some partaking in the loosie cigarettes and poppers available for purchase. A magician is somewhere on board, blowing minds with sleight of hand tricks. Below deck, the band’s Rachel Brown and Nate Amos seem to have found their sea legs: a mosh pit erupts as they rip into Life Signs, the playfully proggy lead single from their forthcoming album, It’s a Beautiful Place.The band treat the annual excursion as a bit of a joke, albeit one they have actively participated in for three years. Sometimes it feels as if WFYE is all about pulling off harebrained ideas. “Nothing is more of a letdown in a creative scenario than achieving exactly what you set out to make,” says Amos. “Where’s the fun in that?” So, the next day, we head to the woods upstate. The band are noted Red Hot Chili Peppers fans and Brown, who studied film-making in college andmakes videosfor peers such as dance punksModel/Actriz, is helping stage a video directed by the band’s friend James Dayton for new song Playing Classics – a dance track whose lyrics were inspired by Life Without Buildings and Charli xcx – that pays homage to the By the Way video. After following a long dirt road plastered with “do not enter” signs, we end up talking to a confused shopkeeper in a trailer filled with fireworks. “Do you know the Red Hot Chili Peppers? Not, like, personally,” Brown asks earnestly. “CanI show you a video andyou tell me the best way to recreate it?”Adventurousness and commitment to the bit is central to the WFYE ethos. Since forming in 2016, the duo have relished in twisting simple concepts towards playful ends. Brown and Amos started making music together – and dating – while living in Chicago back in 2016. Inspired by New Order, they made melancholic dance music, albeit written “from the perspectives of animals and background movie characters,” says Brown.No longer romantically involved by 2019, the pair were living in Brooklyn and performing regularly at DIY spots, experiences that encouraged them to make bolder choices. As Brown says: “Nate started bringing in 15-minute collages instead of little pop songs.” Their 2021 breakthrough, Structure, was a meticulously chaotic assemblage of glitchy post-punk, solemn orchestrals and Brown’s impressionistic poetry. Rolling Stone wrote: “The music they make is so shot through with the discordant energy of feeling hopelessly stuck in this miserable moment, yet it never strays far from the maxim: You gotta laugh.”View image in fullscreenBrown and Amos performing on their boat show.Photograph: Kalliopi MagnisIt’s a Beautiful Place is the band’s second record with venerable indie label Matador. It is the band’s most guitar-forward record yet, a natural consequence of the extensive touring behind its predecessor, 2023’s Everyone’s Crushed and an expanded live outfit, courtesy of guitarist Al Nardo and drummer Bailey Wollowitz, who play together as Fantasy of a Broken Heart. “Once we had a rock band together, it was like, OK, we can make a rock album now,” Amos says. “Almost every song has a guitar solo, which would have felt ridiculous in the environment that Everyone’s Crushed was made in.”Everyone’s Crushed was born from an exceptionally bleak time for the duo. When Black Lives Matter protests proliferated in 2020, says Brown, it “felt revolutionary. I genuinely thought we would see real changes regarding equity and equality.” But by 2021, they were exhausted and disillusioned, back to working long hours assisting on film sets. Meanwhile, Amos was prolifically creative during lockdown but struggling with sobriety from alcohol and other substances – the bulk of Everyone’s Crushed was made during a relapse. Amos laughs when recalling how he recorded the album on “a broken computer held together by a USB cable,” a fitting setup for the album full of uncanny electronic squall addressing alienation, consumerism and suburban decay.While basking in the mysteries of Stonehenge after a UK tour in 2022, Amos challenged himself totake a break from smoking weed. Back home, he wrote a “delayed recovery album” which became the first full-length from his solo project, This Is Lorelei – 2024’s Box for Buddy, Box for Star. Heartfelt and compulsively melodic, it’s a gem of whacked-out, country-tinged pop songwriting distinct from WFYE: “Singing about feelings is such a different headspace than shredding on electric guitar,” he says.Water From Your Eyes: Life Signs – videoMost of the musical ideas on It’s a Beautiful Place originate from the same prolific period as Everyone’s Crushed, arranged in a very different way. “I’m very happy to no longer be the person who was wasted, making music for 14 hours a day,” says Amos. “But I am also very grateful to that person.” Likening his role to that of an editor, Amos manipulates and distils the demos he made back then until they land somewhere beguilingly obtuse and disquietingly catchy. “We’re still releasing our five-year blended malts,” he jokes. “Wait until that shit’s sat on a dusty hard drive for a decade, there’s gonna be some crazy tasting notes.”The best albums of 2025 so farRead moreRecorded in Amos’s home studio, the freaky, full-bodied rock songs Nights in Armor and Born 2 gesture at humanity’s cosmic insignificance. “When I sat down to write the lyrics, it just so happened that we both were thinking about cosmic existentialism,” Brown says. “But maybe we always do that. We’re both very aware of time, I think because we’re Capricorns.” The duo cite pre-human geological history, the vast unknowns of space and sea, and the deep hue ofInternational Klein Blueas touchstones. “My working mindset for this album was ‘your favourite indie rock album is not as cool as any dinosaur,’” adds Amos. In a nice full-circle moment, he finished mixing the record near Stonehenge, at a hotel overlooking a statue of Bigfoot.Both agree that It’s a Beautiful Place is the most optimistic Water From Your Eyes project yet, a representation of the band’s omnivorous spirit. “Without hope there’s only defeat, and I don’t believe that that’s where we should land,” says Brown. “I think that humanity and the planet are worth fighting for because we’ve been gifted such a beautiful place.”It’s a Beautiful Place is released via Matador on 22 AugustExplore more on these topicsMusicIndiePop and rockNew YorkinterviewsShareReuse this content"

If not, be reassured that its chaotic, nonsensical banality is the pointElle HuntWed 25 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 12.20 EDTShareWhen one of Tim’s year 8 pupils asked him about his “favourite Italian brain rot animal”, he thought he’d misheard. “My hearing is not great at the best of times – I had to ask her to repeat this probably four or five times,” he says.Tim (not his real name) was familiar with the term “brain rot”, used to describe the sense of mental decline after too much time spent mindlessly scrolling online (and votedOxford University Press’s word of the yearfor 2024). But what was this about it being Italian?He told his pupil to get on with her work, sat down at his laptop – and immediately turned to Google.All in the mind? The surprising truth about brain rotRead more“Italian brain rot”, he discovered, refers to a series of absurdist animal characters, generated by artificial intelligence. They have ridiculous Italian-sounding names (like Bombombini Gusini and Trippi Troppi), and typically appear in videos on TikTok accompanied by fast-paced, AI-generated and Italian-ish (though also nonsensical) narration.It is, in short, a meme beloved by the emerging generation Alpha (born from 2010 to 2025) and the youngest members of gen Z (generally those born from 1997 to 2012). And if you are any older – even if you fancy yourself as highly online, or a meme connoisseur – it is all but certain to make very little sense to you, as Tim found out at his laptop.He shares his discoveries, sounding trepidatious. “So there’sChimpanzini Bananini, which is a chimpanzee fused with a banana.Bombardiro Crocodilo, which is a crocodile fused with a bomber plane. There’s one who’s just a cappuccino with legs …”View image in fullscreenBallerina Cappuccina.Illustration: TikTok/@aironic.funThat’sBallerina Cappuccina: a female ballet dancer spliced with a cup of coffee, often depicted as being in a relationship withCappuccino Assassino(you can figure it out).“There’s history – lore – behind all these animals,” continues Tim wonderingly. “Like, some of them are at war with each other. And there are songs about them.”And children in his class are into it on a scale he has not previously seen with a trend or meme. “As soon as it’s mentioned by one person, the entire class starts talking about it,” he says. “They are obsessively focused on Italian brain rot.”If, reading this, you can feel your own brain decaying, that’s understandable. Really, if you were born in a year that starts with the figure 1, “Italian brain rot” is not for you.Yet its massive popularity with young people is worth at least attempting to wrap your head around as an indicator of the direction of travel of online culture.View image in fullscreenTralalero Tralala.Illustration: TikTokThe first character to take off was a shark sporting Nike sneakers (three, one for each fin), calledTralalero Tralala. The audio – of a man’s voice, speaking garbled Italian – surfaced first, on TikTok in early January, before being paired with the AI-generated image a few days later.More characters swiftly followed, spreading across TikTok. Don Caldwell, editor-in-chief of the site Know Your Meme, namechecksBrr Brr Patapim, “a proboscis monkey that is also a tree”, as one who made it to YouTube.View image in fullscreenTung Tung Tung Sahur.Illustration: TikTok/@noxaashtThere is also Indonesian brain rot, notablyTung Tung Tung Sahur(“which is like a stick figure with a bat, telling people to wake up for a meal during Ramadan”) andBoneca Ambalabu(“a frog with a tyre for a body, and human legs”).Both are accompanied by an AI-generated voice speaking Indonesian that, like their Italian counterparts, seeks to confuse rather than convey meaning.“The audio is at least as important, if not more important than the imagery,” says Caldwell. “They’ll be doing it really over-the-top, like ‘Tra-la-lero! Tra-la-lala!’ – it really goes for the whole Italian sound.”Is it offensive to Italians? “It seems Italians have been all over this,” Caldwell says, “so I don’t think so.”Indeed, the appeal of Italian (and Indonesian) brain rot is not that it’s offensive, or even subversive – but that it’s so silly.After 15 years at Know Your Meme, Caldwell admits he doesn’t connect with all the online ephemera that crosses his desk – “but I really like this one,” he says. “The dumber the meme, the better, in my opinion.”View image in fullscreenBombardiro Crocodilo.Illustration: TikTok/@armenjiharhanyanThe ease and speed with which these videos can be produced on accessible tools such as ChatGPT has helped with the meme’s spread. You can prompt the AI to visualise Bombardiro Crocodilo (just for example!) in a setting or scenario of your choice, or come up with a new character in that Italian brain rot style. “You don’t need to have tons of video editing ability, or even to use your own voice,” says Caldwell.For adults tired or even afraid of the rapid advance of AI, Italian brain rot may be almost reassuring in its banality. “This is a non-threatening use of AI, not one that induces feelings of either doom or being replaced.”For young people, of course, it’s not that deep. They are spending more time online now than in past generations, and from younger ages, with the result that they are influencing digital culture. “Now you have children who are super-online,” says Caldwell, “raised by iPads and on TikTok all the time, creating content, determining what are the biggest cultural phenomena of the time.”The last evidence of this, before Italian brain rot, wasskibidi toilet: a similarly witless meme that spread from YouTube in 2023 to spark a sensation among the youngest members of gen Z. If you somehow missed it, it features (to quote from Know Your Meme) “an army of sentient toilets with men’s heads coming out of them, fighting for dominance against a bunch of men in suits with cameras for heads, and each video is gaining tens of millions of views”.Tim remembers that washing up in his classroom, too. “The kids love it so much, the word ‘skibidi’ is now part of gen Z and gen Alpha vernacular.”Its meaning, however, is far from straightforward, and steeped in ambiguous irony. “It can mean something good, something bad, something weird … If they call something ‘skibidi’, it’s both a good thing and they’re laughing at it the same time.”Taken together, skibidi toilet and Italian brain rot gleefully defy explanation, titillating young minds with their surrealist imagery and crude-seeming humour – and catch adults short in their feeble efforts at understanding.View image in fullscreenShrimp Jesus.“AI art” is no longer solely for fooling older people primarily active on Facebook, Caldwell says, givingthe example of Shrimp Jesus(look it up). It is developing its own shorthand, conventions and sense that will inevitably – increasingly – go over many of our heads.It’s tempting to say that memes were better in the old days. Look at the inventiveness of templates such asDistracted Boyfriend, the layered visual jokes, the endless possibilities for meaning-making. But Caldwell – himself a millennial – is more sanguine, suggesting that Italian brain rot is just another evolution of human creativity. “The AI is making the image, there’s a text-to-speech voice, but the joke itself is being invented by an actual person behind a computer.”Tim is not so sure. He’s noticed, when he sets his class creative writing assignments or another imaginative task, that they leap to their favourite Italian brain rot creature. “I think the AI generation is not having those moments of sitting down and letting their imagination run wild, because AI does it all for them – all they have to do is use ChatGPT,” he says. “I’ll say: ‘This has to be completely our own; I don’t want any Chimpanzini Bananini.’”But he has also started using the class’s enthusiasm for Italian brain rot to engage them in lessons. In multiple-choice quizzes, every now and again, one of the four possible answers will be Tung Tung Tung Sahur, Tim says – “just to try and grab their attention”.He also now has an answer to that year 8 pupil’s question. “My favourite isBlueberrinni Octopussini,” he says, “which is an octopus fused with a blueberry.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They met in the early 2000s in London and forged the Libertines in the fire of squat parties and guerilla gigs across the capital. The band defined the era’s guitar music – raw energy, bohemian lyricism, “the” band names, hats. Their 2002 debut album, Up the Bracket, produced by the Clash’s Mick Jones, remains a seminal release of the decade, with bleary-eyed garage-rock hits such as I Get Along, What a Waster, and the title single, which have lit up indie discos ever since.The co-frontmen stuck it out for a few years through thick and thin (thin being Doherty’s numerous arrests, drugs busts and that time he broke into Barât’s flat). It’s a love-hate brotherhood they cemented in the 2004 UK No 2 single Can’t Stand Me Now, which came alive when they performed, jostling for the same microphone.Eventually the Libertines disbanded in 2004, with Barât formingDirty Pretty Thingsand Doherty focusing on Babyshambles. There have been reunions over the years: the pair attempted to bury the hatchet in 2007 and 2009, and they released 2015 album Anthems for Doomed Youth. But the 2020s have marked a new chapter. The band returned with 2024’s All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade, which was recorded – completely sober, they say – at the studio they co-founded in Margate, Kent.Now’s your chance to ask them everything you’ve ever wanted to know about being the boys in the band. On Sunday 29 June at 12pm at the Astrolabe theatre, they’ll be speaking to music critic Miranda Sawyer with the help of this reader Q&A. Fancy finding out how they view their legacy? What the secret is to their songwriting? Or how they survived those early years? Post your questions in the comments below and the best will be read out onstage.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.A few months ago, I was at a playground just a couple of blocks from our home in Washington DC, when a mom I barely knew turned to me mid-conversation and said: “I think I might be the deep state.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It was mid-March. Doge was tearing through the city, dismantling federal agencies at dizzying speed. Donald Trump, re-elected on a promise to “shatter the deep state”, had fired thousands of longtime civil servants in his first weeks back in office.The job cuts have been top of mind in Washington. Most of my kids’ playdates these days begin with nap schedule updates and end in quiet dread.It isn’t just jobs. International students are being deported. Measles outbreaks are creeping closer. The climate crisis is at our doorstep: blizzards one week, wildfires the next.

I’ve lived in and reported on parenting across five continents, and what continues to astonish me is howuniquely punishing early parenthood is in the west, especially for those most committed to building a fairer world. Progressives are rightly vocal about how hard it is to raise kids, but too often, we forget to make the case for why it’s still worth it.In the face of so many overlapping crises, the decision to have children can feel reckless, or worse, like an act of denial.But parenting can also be something else entirely: a stubborn act of hope.Raising children offers a crash course in progressive values. It’s a way of tying ourselves more deeply to the future, of feeling the stakes of climate change, inequality and injustice – not as distant headlines, but as urgent matters affecting someone whose lunch you just packed.By failing to make a case for children and families, the left has surrendered these issues to the pronatalist right. We’ve handed over the “family values” agenda, allowing it to be defined by a rigid, exclusionary vision of parenthood.Project 2025, the policyblueprintshaping much of Trump’s current agenda, pledges to “restore” a Christian nationalist view of the family unit as “the centerpiece of American life”.Figures such as JD Vance and Elon Musk, as well as the conservative Heritage Foundation, have declared childbearing a moral and civic duty. Some have even proposed medals and cash for mothers. At this year’s March for Life, Vancecalledfor “more babies in the United States of America” and more “beautiful young men and women” to raise them.View image in fullscreenJD Vance at the March for Life rally in Washington DC on 24 January 2025.Photograph: Kent Nishimura/Getty ImagesWhen we see child rearing as a private project, we forget that many of the movements that shaped the left – civil rights, labour, climate justice – were powered by people who looked at the next generation and decided they were worth fighting for. In his most well-known speech, Martin Luther King Jr didn’t just dream of a better world for himself, he dreamed that hisfour little childrenwould grow up in a nation where they would be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. His vision was rooted in legacy.That’s what parenting does. It gives shape to our politics. It puts flesh on our ideals. It forces us to ask: what are we building and who is it for? Raising children doesn’t distract from that work; it clarifies it.Caregiving rewires our brains to connect more, care more and notice the needs of othersOf course, parenthood isn’t the only path to caring about the future – but it makes it harder to look away. It compels us to feel the weight of policy decisions in our bones. It blows open our empathy and softens the edges of individualism. Suddenly, every child becomes your child. Every policy becomes personal. You start noticing the stroller-unfriendly sidewalks, the unaffordable summer camps, the lack of paid leave – not just for yourself, but for all parents.There’s science behind this shift. Researchers have found that becoming a parent activates a “parental caregiving network” in the brain, lighting up areas tied to empathy, emotional processing and social understanding. It happens in both mothers and fathers. For dads especially, the extent of this neurological change is closely tied to how much hands-on caregiving they do. In other words, caregiving rewires our brains to connect more, care more and notice the needs of others. At its best, parenting strengthens the very instincts progressives say they want to build society around.I’ve seen this empathy in action. Before I had kids, I was reporting on the Rio Olympics and walking the beach one night with a colleague, a mother of two, when we were approached by a group of children begging for money. I clutched my purse and walked faster. But my co-worker slowed down, took off her blazer and wrapped it around a shivering child about her son’s age. “Get home,” she said gently. “Your mom is probably looking for you.”I could tell right away we were operating on different levels of empathy. She saw that child as an extension of her own kids. I wasn’t there yet. But eventually, I got there, too.When I finally became a mother, I began to see stories I covered differently. Now, when I interview parents who’ve lost children to gun violence in Brazil’s favelas, I understand their grief in a new way. I report with deeper urgency and deeper care, seeing myself in their shoes, and my children in theirs.View image in fullscreenChildren protest violence against Black people and mark the 25th anniversary of the Candelária massacre, in which eight Black youths were killed by police in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 23 July 2018.Photograph: Silvia Izquierdo/APThis rewiring of the brain creates a political opening. It expands our sense of who counts as “us”. It softens the boundary between self and other. In doing so, it changes how we interpret harm, not as something happening “out there”, but as something personal, urgent and unacceptable.Yet, the demands of caregiving can pull us away from political life. A 2022 UK study found that parenthoodtemporarily reducespolitical participation among mothers. The reason is obvious: we’re exhausted. Calling your representatives between diaper changes feels impossible. I get it. Some days, I fantasize about deleting all my news apps, retreating into a cozy, apocalypse-adjacent bubble with my kids, and calling it a day.View image in fullscreenParents demand better childcare, parental leave and flexible working policies in London in 2022.Photograph: Steve Taylor/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock“Generally, I think parents are the worst at advocating for themselves because they are just too damn tired. It’s one more thing in the lives of people who already have too much expected of them,” Jennifer Glass, professor at the University of Texas’s department of sociology and Population Research Center and an expert on parental happiness, told me.But parenting doesn’t have to distract from political work. It can fuel it. When we do organize, our sharpened parental empathy can translate into political power. Around the world, it’s progressive movements, often driven by the demands of parents, that have expanded what family support can look like. In Sweden, it was working mothers who pushed for what became the world’s most generous parental leave system, eventually adding incentives for men to take their fair share. In Singapore, multigenerational bonds are built into policy: the government gives housing grants to families who live near grandparents and tax breaks to elders who help with childcare. In France, parents helped lead the 1968 protests that birthed a cooperative childcare system.But when progressives step back from family values, conservatives fill the void.The broken systems you tolerated suddenly become intolerable when your child has to navigate them, tooThis is not a uniquely American phenomenon. According to the United Nations, theshare of countries with explicit pronatalist policieshas nearly tripled since 1976. But these visions often center on traditional gender roles and narrow definitions of family, excluding anyone who doesn’t fit the mold. We shouldn’t let the only cultural narrative around parenting come from those who see it as a tool for enforcing hierarchy and control.Progressives must also fight for a say in the values shaping the next generation. A 2023 Pew surveyfoundthat 89% of teenagers raised by Democratic parents identify with or lean toward the Democratic party. For Republican parents, the number is nearly as high, at 81%.That suggests political identity is often passed down through environment and lived experience: what kids hear at the dinner table, what they see modeled at home and which communities shape their worldview.From there, each new generation brings fresh ideas about justice. Social progress doesn’t only happen by changing the minds of the old; it happens through generational renewal. Throughout the country, youth raised in the shadow of mass shootings are leading the charge for gun reform. In Montana, young people took the government to court over climate changeand won. In Sweden, Greta Thunberg sparked a global climate movement at 15.These movements exist because someone raised those children to believe they had not just the right, but the responsibility, to shape the world around them. But if we step back from parenting, or treat it as apolitical, we leave that space wide open.View image in fullscreenStudents shout at state lawmakers inside the state capitol as they demonstrate against gun violence during the March for Our Lives walkout, a week after the mass shooting at Covenant school, in Nashville, Tennessee, on 3 April 2023.Photograph: Mark Zaleski/USA Today Network/ReutersThe right is more than ready to fill it. That’s why they’re fighting so hard to control what children are taught, whichbooksthey read, whose families are visible in their classrooms and which identities are allowed to exist.This is the moment for the left to reclaim family as a public good. Progressives shouldn’t just defend the right to abortion, we must fight for people’s ability to have families and raise them with dignity. That means paid leave, universal childcare, affordable healthcare and a livable planet.It also means rejecting the caricature that progressives are a party of “childless cat ladies” while conservatives corner the market on family values. We are, and always have been, the natural home of pro-family policy.After all, children tether us to the future, but also to each other. Progressive values thrive in that space of interdependence, where no one is expected to go it alone. Caring for kids – whether as parents, educators, neighbors or policymakers – demands a communal ethic of care.I’ve seen this ethic in action across the world. While writing my book,Please Yell at My Kids,I spent years studying how families around the world raise children in community. In the Netherlands, children as young as eight walk themselves to school. Parents trust that if they need help, a community member will step in. In Denmark, babies nap unattended in strollers outside cafes – not because parents are careless, but because they trust the society around them. In Mozambique, where formal support systems often fail, mothers rely on each other for food, childcare and safety, transforming neighborhoods into extended families. These cultures aren’t perfect, but they understand that raising a child isn’t a private endeavor. It’s a collective one.She compared motherhood in four countries. The US isn’t looking goodRead moreSome understandably hesitate to bring children into a world on fire. Others worry that parenting means stepping back from activism or ambition. But for many, becoming a parent doesn’t dilute that drive; it crystallizes it. Climate change isn’t just a policy failure – it’s the air your child will breathe. Gun violence isn’t abstract – it’s a possibility you carry every time you drop them off at school. The broken systems you tolerated suddenly become intolerable when your child has to navigate them, too.This isn’t about idealizing parenthood. It’s about refusing to surrender this human experience to those who would use it to divide us. So yes, the world is on fire. But refusing to bring children into it won’t put the flames out. What may, perhaps, is raising a generation bold enough to rebuild it.Marina Lopes is the author ofPlease Yell at My Kids: What Cultures Around the World Can Teach You About Parenting in Community, Raising Independent Kids, and Not Losing Your Mind, out nowExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingFamilyUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Smart casual was about making smart clothes look more relaxed; smart comfy is about making them feel more relaxed.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Smart comfy might not sound all that different to smart casual, but it is nothing short of a whole new perspective on getting dressed. Smart casual was about how to look smart, without looking stuffy. It was about how you looked to other people, more than how you felt in yourself. The goal was to appear chill, not to feel chill.Smart comfy starts from the opposite direction. It is about clothes that look polished, but don’t have any hard edges. The gateway drug that got me hooked, and that I can see on the street is doing the same for others, is a pair of travel trousers. If you don’t get the point of smart comfy yet, then I suspect you will when you get your first pair.This is a wardrobe category that didn’t exist a year or two ago – soon it will be everywhereDo you have them already? Travel trousers present as semi-formal trousers. They have the silhouette and detailing of trousers you might wear to the office with a shirt. The waistband doesn’t look elasticated (although it might be, more of which later) but instead has a button fastening, or belt loops, or both. They are not tight like leggings, but neither are they just shapeless, like tracksuit trousers. They drape. The fabric, too, is important. Not the traditional smart kind that demands you stay pert and upright to avoid the creases and bags that come with sitting down, but also nothing fluffy or fleecy or pyjama-adjacent. The new generation of technical fabrics can pass for silk or wool blend, but have the zero-crease factor of Lycra.View image in fullscreenVuori’s Villa trousersThe travel trouser is a wardrobe category that didn’t exist a year or two ago. It is happening right now, and soon it will be everywhere. It has legs, because it does what successful products in all categories do. It solves a real-life problem. That real-life problem being: sometimes we spend hours sitting down – on a plane or a train, or at a desk, on the sofa – and then need to be presentable enough to be public-facing, whether that’s presenting to a board or doing school pick-up. In travel trousers you can sit down, even nap, without your clothes digging in or getting too hot or otherwise getting on your nerves, and then you can stand up and not look like a crumpled slob.I bought myLululemon Daydrift High-Risetrousers (pictured) on a recommendation, because I was looking for trousers comfortable enough to wear on a long journey but nice enough to wear to work straight off the train or plane. They do that job perfectly, but it turns out I wear them all the time. They are blissfully comfortable. The waistband has concealed elastic inside which has a drawstring to adjust the size, so they stretch with you, and you don’t need to wear a belt unless you want to. You can throw them in the washing machine, they dry super fast and don’t need ironing. They aren’t cheap – £118 at full price – but they genuinely pass as dressy, which makes them feel worth it.Lululemon are best known for making leggings you see in the fancier kind of yoga class. Athleisure brands are leading the market on the travel trouser, which makes sense: like I said, smart comfy is about feel first and foremost. Lots of people recommendVuori’s Villa trousers(£130), which are similar to Lululemon’s Daydrift, although if I’m being picky I would point out that the elastic isn’t hidden on the rear view of the Villa, so you need a belt or untucked top to make them look polished. For a less expensive option, good old Uniqlo now appear to be getting in on the act, with a new style ofSmart Wide Trousers(£34.90) available from the end of June.Trousers that are comfortable enough to curl up in, but smart enough to pass when you need to look snappy. That feel like athleisure, but present as tailoring. It’s like a cheat code to life! The era of smart comfy has arrived.Main imageModel: Jen at Milk Management.

The lush green tops are turned into a punchy chermoula that is stirred into the sauce and used as a garnish.One-pan Moroccan-spiced carrots and chickpeas with carrot top chermoulaOne image has stayed with me ever since a journey through a small Moroccan village near Taghazout, just west of Marrakech, all of 12 years ago. Bright orange carrots lay in vast heaps on contrasting blue tarpaulin spread across the ground. I was especially struck by how the vast majority of each pile was green with the feathery foliage that was still attached to the roots we love. The carrot is so often robbed of its crowning glory before it reaches the supermarket shelf, but when you find a bunch with those vibrant tops intact, you’re getting two ingredients for the price of one. Those super-nutritious greens can be stirred into stews, tossed with other leaves, or blended into bright green sauces such as apestotoday’s punchy chermoula, a piquant North African herb sauce that adds brightness and depth to this warming stew.Serves4-6For the spiced carrots1 bunch carrots(about 600g), with foliage attached650g new potatoes, halved2 red or white onions, peeled and cut into thin wedges4–5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilJuice and finely grated zest of ½ organic unwaxed lemon6 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed5 tsp ras el hanout, or your own blend featuring cinnamon, turmeric, cumin, coriander, paprika and/or ginger2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes2 x 400g tins chickpeas, including their liquid (or 1 x 550g jar)50g toasted chopped almonds, or walnuts or hazelnutsCooked couscous, or barley or quinoa, to serveYoghurt, to serveFor the chermoula2 tsp cumin seeds2 tsp coriander seeds1 tsp sweet paprika1 tsp sea salt2 garlic cloves, peeled1 red chilli, diced, or 1–2 tsp cayenne pepper60g carrot tops(stalks and leaves)Juice and finely grated zestof ½ organic unwaxed lemon, or 1 tbsp chopped preserved lemon100ml extra-virgin olive oilHeat the oven to 190C (fan). Separate the carrot tops from the roots. Wash both thoroughly and set the tops aside for the chermoula. Put the carrots (about 450g), whole or halved if thick, 650g new potatoes and two red or white onions (cut into wedges) on a large tin. Drizzle with olive oil, cover with parchment and roast. After 35 minutes, remove the parchment and cook for another 15–25 minutes, until charred and tender. Mix in the lemon zest and juice (or the chopped preserved lemon), six lightly crushed garlic cloves and five teaspoons of ras el hanout (or your own blend) and roast for 10 more minutes. Stir in any leftover carrot tops (roughly chopped), the chopped tomatoes and the undrained chickpeas and roast for a final 15 minutes, until hot and bubbling.Meanwhile, make the chermoula: toast the cumin and coriander seeds in a dry pan, then grind to a powder. Add the paprika, sea salt, garlic and diced red chilli, pound to a rough paste, then smash in 60g chopped carrot tops. Mix in the lemon juice and zest and extra-virgin olive oil, then season to taste.Dot spoonfuls of chermoula on the carrots in the tray, scatter over the crushed nuts and a few extra sprigs of carrot tops, and serve with couscous and yoghurt on the side.Explore more on these topicsStewWaste notFoodFood wasteVegetablesNorth African food and drinkMain coursefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The simple truth is that all youreallyneed to create flavourful food at home is a capsule of flavourful pantry ingredients. This, for me, includes everyday staples such as toasted sesame oil, dark maple syrup and peanut butter, and bold taste-boosters such as tamarind, pecorino romano and gochujang. Another ingredient I turn to repeatedly is mango chutney, a beloved staple at the Punjabi table of my childhood upbringing in Leicester. Today, I use it in infinite different ways to enliven whatever I happen to be cooking, leaning into its characteristics as a sticky and vinegary, bustlingly tropical, flamboyantly spiced, sweet and mellow flavour hero. These recipes show you just a few ways that mango chutney, or indeed any ingredient in a thoughtfully stocked pantry, can be used when you liberate yourself to play with ingredients with creative joy.Mango chicken schnitzel with lime-leaf smashed peas (pictured top)Schnitzel and mushy peas both have a nostalgic 1970s Fanny Cradock-meets-Wimpy-diner charm that I’m always drawn to – they’re also crying out for the addition of pineapple rings, piped green mashed potato and silver jugs of parsley sauce on the side. My flavour-elevated take on these culinary relics uses mango chutney to add tropical pizzaz to the chicken, and lime leaves to bring south-east Asian fragrance to the peas.Prep10 minMarinate30 min+Cook20 minServes2For the schnitzels5 tbsp mango chutney, plus extra to serve3 fat garlic cloves, peeled1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce2 tbsp apple cider vinegarFine sea salt andblack pepper2 large boneless and skinless chicken breasts(2 x 250g)Cornflour, for dredging1 large egg, beaten60gpanko breadcrumbs1 tbsp nigella seeds2 tbsp sesame seedsSunflower or vegetable oil, for fryingLemon wedges, to serveFor the peas400g frozen peas12–14 fresh makrut lime leavesAbout 30 fresh mint leavesJuice and finely grated zest of 1 small lemon20g butterA splash of olive oil, for frying2spring onions, trimmed and finely choppedPut the chutney, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and a teaspoon each of salt and ground black pepper in a small blender and whizz to a fine paste.Put one chicken breast between two sheets of baking paper, then gently flatten it with a rolling pin into a 3-4mm-thin steak – don’t bash hard, though, or the meat will tear. Repeat with the other breast. Put the flattened breasts in a large bowl, smother in the mango chutney paste, and leave to marinate for at least 30 minutes.Meanwhile, cook the peas in a pan of boiling salted water for three minutes, then drain and set aside. In a small blender, whizz the lime leaves, mint, lemon juice and a teaspoon of zest to a very fine paste.Melt the butter and a splash of oil in a pan over a medium heat, then add the green paste and fry, stirring, for two minutes. Add the spring onions, cook for a minute, then add the peas and a teaspoon of salt, and cook for a minute more. Mash the pea mix with a potato masher until rough and chunky (or blend to a puree), and keep warm while you cook the chicken.Put the cornflour in one large bowl, the egg in another and the breadcrumbs, nigella seeds and sesame seeds in a third bowl. Dredge one schnitzel in the cornflour, flipping it to coat all over, leave for 30 seconds, then dredge again so it’s completely covered. Shake off any excess cornflour, dip into the egg, and then into the breadcrumb mix so it’s coated liberally. Repeat with the second schnitzel.Put 2cm oil in a deep-sided frying pan on a medium heat (if you have a probe, you want it to reach 165C). Fry the schnitzels one at a time for six or seven minutes, turning occasionally, until crunchy and golden brown on the outside and cooked through.Serve with the smashed peas, lemon wedges and extra mango chutney on the side.Balinese mango pork crispy rollsView image in fullscreenGurdeep Loyal’s Balinese mango and pork crispy rolls.After a week of yoga, juicing and chanting at a Balinese jungle retreat in Ubud a few years back, I made the executive decision to undo all of that “wellness” by booking intothe Slow in Canggu. It is without doubt one of the most chic, stylish and cosmopolitan places I’ve ever stayed, with beautiful boho interiors, a tropical cocktail list of dreams and a Balinese-leaning, culture-crossing menu that read like poetry. These spiced pork crispy rolls are inspired by my stay there, with the mango chutney, lemongrass, fish sauce, peanuts and lime creating flavour acrobatics on the palate. Forget the yoga: cooking these is my kind of meditation.Prep15 minCook45 minMakes10 large or 20 mini rolls8makrut lime leaves, stalks removed20g lemongrass, roughly chopped10gknob of fresh ginger, roughly chopped6 garlic cloves, peeled1 tbsp fish sauce20g roasted peanuts1 tsp ground cinnamon½ tsp freshly grated nutmeg1 tsp chilli flakes3 tbsp vegetable oil, plus extra for brushing1 large red onion, peeled and finely diced500gpork mince(at least 5% fat)100g mango chutneyJuice and finely grated zest of 2 limesFine sea salt10 sheets filo pastryNigella seeds, to finishIn a blender, whizz the lime leaves, lemongrass, ginger, garlic, fish sauce, peanuts, cinnamon, nutmeg, chilli flakes and a splash of water to a very fine paste.Put the oil in a large pan on a medium heat, then fry the onion for five to six minutes, until softened.

How socks became cool – and controversialTwenty years ago, it looked as if it was all but over for the humble accessory. Then, during the pandemic, everything changedHilary OsborneWed 25 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTShareOn a bright summer’s day recently I found myself facing a quandary. Choosing a top and trousers to wear wasn’t a problem, but my whole outfit was in danger of being derailed by a mis-step: the wrong socks.Should it be a pair that matched the rest of my outfit, or with a pattern that stood out? Did a frill look fussy, or bring just the right amount of detail? Was the fact they didn’t have a four-letter word on them going to expose me as woefully out of touch? The only thing I was certain of is that they should be on show.Yes, the young and the fashionable have known this for a while, but for the rest of us it’s taken time to notice the sock’s shift to centre-stage. Maybe it took seeing Natalie Portmanwearing black socks with high heels, or Lauren Laverne postingpictures of her “Fucking Legend” socks on Instagram.View image in fullscreenFun socks from Socktopus.Photograph: Isabel Raffaelli/SocktopusAlmost20 years since Sock Shop closed in the UK, hosiery has suddenly been returning to the high street – and online specialists have been popping up too. The independent retailerSocktopushas seven shops around the UK but has plans to add more – it sold 640,000 pairs last year and expects to sell 1m this year. Marks & Spencer says sales of women’s socks are growing each year, and the accessory is increasingly on offer as a souvenir: atGlastonburyandWimbledonthey make up part of the merchandise collection.My Guardian colleague Jess Cartner-Morley says socks are fashion’s “hottest topic of the decade”, while Lynne Hugill, a senior lecturer for the BA in fashion at Teesside University, says “people of both genders are embracing socks with all kinds of footwear – whether it’s flat shoes, a sandal or now a heel”.At M&S, where hosiery is a stock in trade (19m pairs of women’s socks are sold there every year), the menswear director Mitch Hughes says there is a “strong appetite for statement socks” among male shoppers. “[Socks have] had a 2025 glow-up, left behind their functional underdog status and are now attention-seeking and stylish – a key style contender within a man’s wardrobe and definitely not an afterthought.”View image in fullscreenNatalie Portman in black socks and high heels.Photograph: Tom Nicholson/ShutterstockHappy Socks, a sock maker that launched in Stockholm in 2008, has taken part in four international fashion weeks in the past year. “We did Berlin as our own show, but for Copenhagen, Paris and New York we partnered with designers who came to us and said: ‘Hey, we need socks on our runway. Can we work together?’,” says the chief marketing and design officer Fiona Murchison. “That shows the move into the fashion world – if they’re on the runway, then, of course, it trickles down.”While shrinkflation has been a big issue in consumer goods, the opposite has hit socks. No-show trainer socks are out, and fabric is slowly rising up the shin. “We’ve extended that length higher than the average retailer,” says Murchison. “Which only the most in-tune sock buyer would maybe notice, but it’s an important shift for us because while ankle socks are staple, we see this growing enthusiasm for higher lengths.”The look is highlighted with a word or detail near the cuff. This means “people are more inclined to pull it up that little teeny bit more,” she says. “It’s a bit more important as a piece … a bit like wearing a giant necklace or something.” When we speak on Zoom, she takes off a sock to show me: it’s from a collaboration withAwake NYand in a sports style with a little “A” near the top.This rising trend isn’t just true on bare legs. Lois Woodcock, the head of design at the athleisure companyGymshark, says: “One trend that stands out is the growing love for crew socks, which are halfway between ankle socks and knee-high socks, particularly with our gen Z community.”Woodcock says these buyers are “styling their socks very intentionally, often layering crisp white crew socks over leggings”.But while gymgoers may go for plain white, elsewhere there is a move towards pattern and detail. At M&S, female shoppers are looking for sheer, ribbed, lace and embellished socks, and there’s “a huge demand for playful details like ruffles and bows”.View image in fullscreenThe festival sockHappy Socks makes a huge choice of patterned socks, with this year’s designs including tomatoes, hibiscus flowers and racing cars, although Murchison says fewer colours are being used across the range as it moves to be “more fashion relevant”.Socktopushas thousands of designs, from the whimsical to the artistic, via the F-word. Popular choices include a range of capybaras in cowboy hats – originally suggested by a customer. The firm also makes Henry VIII and his wives socks, which Josie Starsmore, the creative director, is wearing when we speak. Starsmore says people love to come into the shops and try to “marry the exact sock with the exact person”. Her husband and co-founder Nick (wearing frog socks), says, “If people think the pattern on a sock looks anything like their dog, they come in and they say, ‘You’ve got Billy socks!’ because we’ve got a sock with a border terrier and luckily it looks like Billy.”In Socktopus branches, the sweary socks are concealed with cardboard. You can have a matching pair or, from an odd-socks pile, make up your own: you could have “Cock” emblazoned in silver on black on your left leg and “Twat” in gold on white on your right, or other family-unfriendly combinations.Nicksays profane socks “are quite interesting because the lady who is wearing a floral dress and has two spaniels and comes to our stand at Badminton Horse Trials, and the kind of younger customer at Comic Con, both love socks that say ‘fuck off’ on them.”You can buy a single sock for 12 euros – it doesn’t break the bank to change up a lookJosie says her mum helped at a show and was originally disapproving of the sweary socks but, “after the second day of asking, ‘What is it about these socks that you like so much?’, people were really opening up to her, saying it’s almost like by wearing these socks to work or in a difficult situation or with my boss who I can’t stand I’m having a minor rebellion.” She says: “That really changed my mum’s point of view because then she was like, my God, I actually think there’s a real place for this, it’s like a tiny little empowerment.”Shorter trouser lengths mean that socks are generally more on display than they were, and are a factor in their rising popularity. But the main reason we all have more time for socks, say those in the know, is the pandemic. “What really moved it on is Covid,” says Hugill. “We were looking for comfort, and it changed the way people dress for work. People got used to being at home and wearing their Birkenstocks or their sliders with socks.”The pandemic led to a decline in suit sales, and to the more general acceptance of trainers as office-wear, and so the traditional black or navy blue sock for men, and maybe tights for women, have been reassessed.The financial climate may also have played a role. “I think there’s an element of the lipstick effect,” says Murchison, referring to the theory that in economic downturns consumers look to low-cost indulgences. “It’s a very affordable element to change your outfit. We would consider ourselves, I suppose, a little bit more on the premium end, pricing wise, but nevertheless, you can buy a single sock for 12 euros. So it doesn’t break the bank to change up a look.”Josie at Socktopus says rising costs elsewhere may be driving purchases among gift buyers. “I think the £12 bottle of wine means we’ve benefited from an £8 pair of gift socks.”She suggests the kidulthood trend, with grownups embracing cute things, and social media have both helped drive sales of patterned and fluffy socks. The thing about socks is they’re very inclusive, she says. It doesn’t matter what size you are, or what age.View image in fullscreenComposite: SvetaVo/Getty ImagesThat said, at a certain age, it’s difficult to know how far to take it – both towards the knee and in terms of pattern.Cartner-Morley says that, generally, she thinks black-and-white socks look better than patterned with shorts or skirts or over leggings, but adds: “I love a colourful sock if you just get a flash of it, for instance with loafers and trousers.”Of sweary socks, she says, “I’m not a big fan of anything novelty-adjacent, but on the other hand, any sock that cheers you up or makes you smile is a good sock.”If you want to go for something plain but a bit different from the socks you wore at school, Murchison says solid colours have sold well. Red was in, but now things have moved on and the hot colour is a “really poppy vibrant blue”.Or, to spruce up an outfit of a dress and trainers she suggests an “extra fine … a kind of more dainty sock”.She says no one’s too old for knee-length socks: “If you wear a longer length skirt, then you wear it like a tight, basically. It’s like wearing a pair of tights, but you can wear it in the summer.”Some will cleave to the no-show trainer sock which, after all, was for many years the agreed-on way to wear hosiery in the summer months and is a sock-drawer staple.Cartner-Morley says that in a recent WhatsApp group chat between friends, someone asked if it was OK to wear trainer socks with a dress and trainers to a party or if she had to wear socks as decreed by fashion. “After a heated debate we decided that, so long as there wasn’t likely to be anyone under 35 at the party, she was safe to wear trainer socks,” she says.Otherwise, I’m afraid there are no excuses. We all need to pull our socks up.Explore more on these topicsAccessoriesCoronavirusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The star and her husband, and nephew Julez Smith, joined a starry front row, which included Omar Sy, Steve McQueen, PinkPantheress, Spike Lee, Emile Smith Rowe and Victor Wembanyama.View image in fullscreenBeyoncé and Jay-Z attend the Louis Vuitton show in Paris.Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersEven without a megastar, the show was worth the wait. Williams took over as creative director of menswear in June 2023 and his spring-summer 2026 collection was his best yet – with louche retro tailoring and unusual combinations such as cargo pants and a shrunken sweater.The collection excelled when performing one of luxury’s current favourite tricks – making premium versions of everyday items. Here, that included a striped polo shirt, a boxy work shirt and chinos. This look, worn with a ribbed vest, is likely to be copied by those who like fashion but lackLouis Vuittonbudgets.View image in fullscreenThe strength of this collection shows that Williams’s vision is now coming through more in his work at Louis Vuitton.Photograph: Teresa Suárez/EPAEntitled Paris to India, Williams was inspired by what the press release called “the multifaceted sensibilities of present-day Indian sartorialism”. In practice, the influence of India’s aesthetics could be seen most clearly in ornate decoration on the trunks some models wheeled down the runway.The show’s set was created by Bijoy Jain, the founder of the architecture practice Studio Mumbai. A giant rendering of snakes and ladders – an Indian game that dates to the second century – was hand-painted on the catwalk. A Punjabi track called Yaara, co-produced by the Indian composer AR Rahman, featured on the soundtrack played by a live orchestra.View image in fullscreenThe influence of India’s aesthetics could be seen most clearly in ornate decoration on the trunks wheeled down the runway.Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersIf collaboration with Indian creatives gave voice to the culture that provided inspiration to a collection by a European megabrand, there were also some slightly more reductive tropes, as with the embroidered exotic animals. These made use of imagery originally created by Louis Vuitton in 2007 for Wes Anderson’sThe Darjeeling Limited, a film set in India but remaining, as the critic Ellen E Joneswrote last year, a “whimsically white nostalgia-world”. However, items such as striped ties were a nod to India’s beloved cricket, while a trekking-adjacent backpack with camping roll felt more playful and relevant to now.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He dressed celebrities attending the Met Gala, including Doechii, Future, Sabrina Carpenter and Jeremy Allen White.Not all of Williams’s work here was celebrated. The symbolism of a LV monogram on Doechii’s cheek wascriticised by some online. “LOVE me some Doechii … I’m absolutely not into this European logo ‘branded’ on her skin for a night celebrating the labor and ingenuity of Black culture and Black men,” wrote a Threads user.View image in fullscreenLouis Vuitton will be hoping that Williams’s combination of glitzy friends and pop culture-friendly designs will ensure a boost in sales.Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersThis is not the first time Williams has faced some backlash at Louis Vuitton, a $1m (£734,705) bag made from crocodile skinwas describedas “an insensitive declaration of global north privilege” by the fashion commentator Caryn Franklin in 2023, while his continued use of fur prompteda Peta protesterat the premiere of his animated film Piece by Piece in 2024.Louis Vuitton’s parent company, LVMH,reportedthat revenue in the group’s fashion and leather goods divisions fell by 11% and 3% respectively in the first quarter of 2025.

It’s tinted, which provides instant gratification and is helpful in providing a visible guide for application and blending. The addition of glycerin gives a plump, hydrated finish. My only minor gripe is that it doesn’t love all of my concealers, and pills slightly under anything more vigorous than a tap, but it looks so nice on its own that I am happy to go lightly thereafter.They give me a summery, glowing look and allow me to enjoy light or no makeup in the heatCelebrity tanner James Read closed his eponymous brand years ago, but is back with a new line, Self Glow, which takes a more natural, eco-conscious approach.Sunbright Tinted Tan Drops(£39) are so easy to use that I can confidently recommend them to a total beginner. Just add three drops to any other product – serum, moisturiser or foundation – and mix before applying as normal. The brown guide colour adds enough tint to prevent missed patches and develops into the real thing – subtle, glowy and believable – in a few hours.Also back from hiatus is Vita Liberata, my pre-holiday and Glastonbury tan of choice. This Northern Irish brand makes some of the best tanners around (I never go to a photoshoot, festival or holiday destination without their Body Blur, an instant tanning cream removed only by soap and water) and their newest launch isTanning Anti-Age FaceSerum(£32), which can be mixed like the James Read or applied neat after cleansing.

And beyond the full English breakfasts and pub crawls, there’s an authentic Spanish side to itLeah PattemWed 25 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 10.29 EDTShareLast year, Benidorm welcomed close to 3 million visitors. Despite its reputation as a British holiday mecca – nearly 900,000 UK travellers visited the city in 2024 – it was actually Spanish nationals who made up the largest share, with more than one million domestic visitors flocking to the Costa Blanca resort, according toBenidorm city council. I have a feeling that these visitors did not come for the stereotype of full English breakfasts and pub crawls, but for something often overlooked by international tourists: the authentic, everyday rhythm of Spanish coastal life.Map for BenidormIn a country where tourism makes up about15% of GDPbut has also spurred ahousing shortage and countermovements, Benidorm offers a contrast to cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where tourism pressures are acute. The city’s mid-20th-century reinvention as a purpose-built resort might once have been controversial, but today it looks surprisingly sustainable in the context of a national housing emergency.Benidorm was designed and built to handle industrial numbers of visitors – including me. My first visit was in the early 1990s, aged eight, on a classic package holiday with my family. I vividly remember staying up late to play billiards with a rotating cast of kids, and language barriers didn’t matter. Their mothers – and what felt like every other señora in our 20-storey hotel – took turns pinching my cheeks.The city’s reinvention as a purpose-built resort now looks sustainable in the context of a national housing emergencyThe coastal city has long accommodated large numbers of domestic and international travellers without displacing residents at the same rate as elsewhere. Unlike the “live like a local” model that has backfired in Spain’s big cities – such that more and more apartments once meant for residents are now exclusively for tourist use, especially in Madrid, where I’ve lived for 12 years – Benidorm has absorbed demand with ease while still offering an authentic Spanish experience. I’m here to explore exactly that.Before the sun has fully risen, I walk to Poniente beach, the quieter, more local stretch just west of the old town. It is already full of life. A dozen elderly señores are taking a refreshing, pre-breakfast dip and a group of señoras are easing into the day with a free session of group yoga. As the weather heats up, the Spanish crowd moves away from the main beach to the nearby Cala Almadraba or, further along, to Cala del Tío Ximo. In these two secluded coves beyond the headland, pine trees frame crystal-clear shallows. Even in peak season, these smaller spots remain largely undiscovered by foreign visitors.View image in fullscreenCala Almadraba.Photograph: AlamyBy the time the sun is at its highest, many Spaniards are already retreating to long lunches of local cuisine. AtLa Fava, I find a serene space where chef Fran Burgos serves elegant dishes rooted in Alicante’s coastal traditions – such as grilled aubergine with honeycomb, parmesan soup and seasonal fish – in a tranquil, whitewashed interior. For a classic Iberian diner,Casa Toniboasts Andalusian tiles and legs ofjamónhanging above the bar. For paella, a must in the Valencia region, refined seafood restaurantDucadohas an array of rice dishes.There’s room too for cross-cultural comforts. Ray’s 1, a longstanding British chippy run by a mother and daughter team (both called Teresa), earned a new Spanish fanbase when I wrote about it for Spain’s leading national newspaper,El País. Since then, Teresa senior tells me, they’ve had a regular flow of Spanish customers. Nearby, on my way to theajuntament(town hall), I spot a queue outsideBar El Puente, a chicken rotisserie run by the same family since 1968 and attracting a mostly Spanish clientele.View image in fullscreenLocal social documentary photographer María Moldes captures the city’s idiosyncrasies through saturated, surreal portraits of Spanish sunbathers.Photograph: María MoldesAnyone who has visited Benidorm will be familiar with Calle Santo Domingo, a pedestrianised alley in the old town. Here, a global clientele are drawn to the bustling Basquepintxobars, especially in the evening. But farther inland lies a no-frills and more authentically Spanish tapas destination, just off Avenida Ruzafa. I squeeze intoTaperia La Mina, where a bottle of house wine and six tapas costs €11.Restaurant AitonaandEl Rincón de La Croquetaoffer an equally simple experience. For a slightly quieter but still lively meal,La Mejillonerais known for its large plates of juicy orange mussels, and is worth the wait for a table.But beyond sun, sea and food, Benidorm is a real Spanish city with real stories. For example, Marina Sanchis openedCasa Cremà, a pottery workshop for locals and visitors alike, having returned to her home town after being forced out of Madrid by soaring rents, and has turned her creative retreat into a thriving community space. She tells me Benidorm has given her something she’d lost in the capital: space, time, and a connection to community.Spanish culture, local gastronomy and a deeper sense of place – this is the side of Benidorm that is enjoyed by more than 1 million domestic visitors each yearMany more Spanish artists have been inspired by the coastal metropolis, and their work has featured in the free and often overlookedMuseo Boca del Calvariin the old town.María Moldes, who exhibited there a few years ago, is a local social documentary photographer whose photos of Benidorm echo the works of the lateCarlos Pérez Siquier. Both photographers capture Spain’s idiosyncrasies through saturated, surreal portraits of Spanish sunbathers. Despite being taken decades apart, their images are almost indistinguishable.View image in fullscreenLa Fava restaurantEven online, Benidorm has become something of a Spanish cult favourite.Erik Harley, a satirical influencer from Barcelona, tells me that Benidorm is his favourite place in the universe and he will soon be launching new tours of the city’s most iconic skyscrapers. And then there’s Mulero Ok, as he’s known here, a smartly dressed pensioner whose niche is playing Spanish pop music on his speaker andfilming passersby dancingalongside his decorated, slow-gliding mobility scooter.Among Spanish youth, the city’s cultural relevance is also on the rise.Benidorm Festis Spain’s official competition to choose its Eurovision entry. Unlike the UK’s often half-hearted approach to the contest, Spain makes a big deal of the selection process and I regularly hear Melody’sEsa Diva, which was chosen as Spain’s entry this year, playing on the radio and in bars. Still only in its third year, the festival has become a defining highlight of the city’s cultural calendar, earning Benidorm a new identity as the country’s unofficial capital of pop.Beyond the bustle of Benidorm, the nearby area is home to several charming villages that make for a perfect day trip, such as the colourful coastal town of La Vila Joiosa, a short tram ride away. Inland, the ancient hilltop village of El Castell de Guadalest is home to no fewer thaneight eclectic museumsand boasts stunning views of the Guadalest reservoir – one of Benidorm’s main sources of fresh water.Benidorm wears its tourist-resort reputation with pride, but it offers far more than the stereotypes suggest. As a Brit abroad occasionally longing for home, I’m not going to deny that the British stereotype of Benidorm has its appeal for me. But I’m also here for what has become even more familiar to me: Spanish culture, local gastronomy and a deeper sense of place – the side of Benidorm that is enjoyed by more than 1 million domestic visitors each year.In a country grappling with overtourism, Benidorm’s purpose-built design shouldn’t be dismissed as inauthentic. It’s a uniquely Spanish solution to a modern global challenge – and a city with space for everyone.Explore more on these topicsSpain holidaysBeach holidaysEurope holidaysCity breaksShort breaksCultural tripsFood and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A few years ago, he reached his lowest point. Then he began working towards an extraordinary goalWed 25 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 05.12 EDTShareDay three of Marcus Skeet’s epic run from Land’s End to John o’Groats was a low point. It had been a sunny April morning when he set off. Marcus was in shorts and a T-shirt – bright yellow so he could be easily seen running beside the A30. But then, 18 miles (29km) in and just a few miles before the end of the day’s leg, it started to rain. “Absolutely bucketing down, then hailing really heavily, hailstones right into my face.”Marcus, who had been sweating, got cold very quickly. He tried to call his friend Harry, who had gone ahead in the support car to check in to that night’s Airbnb, to get him to come back with a coat, but the phone had got wet and wasn’t working. He managed to reach a layby where there was a breakdown van. He asked the driver if he would make a call for him (Marcus didn’t know Harry’s number from memory, but he knew his mum’s, and she could ring Harry). “And he looks at me and goes: ‘Mate, I’m working, bore off.’”The breakdown man drove away. As did the car he had been attending to – they didn’t even open their window when Marcus knocked on it. Maybe they were frightened, he suggests: “It probably looked really weird because I was crying at this point.View image in fullscreenMarcus nears journey’s end last month.Photograph: @thehullboy/Instagram“I sat down, I was really cold, I started getting the shivers, and I was like: I can’t do this. I was screaming, asking for my mum, my grandma, all the family. There were all these cars going by but no one stopped.” Eventually, a lorry driver pulled up, got Marcus into the cab to warm up, dry off, dry the phone and call Harry to come and pick him up. The following day, he and Harry returned and Marcus started from the layby. There were still 56 days to go, and about 790 miles.At some points it took me an hour to get out of the house, because I had to put my foot in the right place or think the right thingIt was a low point of the challenge, but there had been lower points in Marcus’s life.From the age of about 11 to his mid-teens, Marcus was hit with a salvo of diagnoses, physical and mental: type 2 diabetes, depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. The OCD caused him to have intrusive thoughts: “At some points it took me an hour to get out of the house, because I had to put my foot in the right place or think the right thing. A 10-minute trip to the shops would end up taking a couple of hours because if I didn’t do the right thing at the right time, tap a wall however many times or whatever, I was going to die. I was really badly suffering.”On top of that (and certainly a contributing factor, he says), Marcus’s dad, Philip, was diagnosed with dementia. His mum, Jayne, had to add caring duties to her full-time job, and Marcus added the role of young carer to everything else he was dealing with.How did all of the above affect school for Marcus? “You either really enjoy school, or you go through a horrible time, and I experienced a bit of both. I enjoyed it in certain parts …” he begins, before interrupting himself seamlessly, with perfect comic timing. “That’s a lie, no I didn’t.”“I was going to say, I must have missed that day,” Jayne chips in, reminding him that his attendance was roughly 3% one year, and 0% the next.View image in fullscreen‘Mental health is such a big thing, everyone is different but I find running helps mine.’Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianWe are in the living room of the family home in Norton-on-Derwent, North Yorkshire. It doubles as Jayne’s office; she has cut down to 16 hours’ work a week, from home, in order to look after Philip. He is here, too, sitting in an armchair in the corner, less present mentally now that the dementia is quite advanced. Also present, in separate cages, are two rabbits, Oreo and Booper – brothers apparently, although they look very different and, says Marcus: “They really don’t like each other.” Hence the separate cages, and the evil eyes.Marcus is dead funny. It is evident on his YouTube channel where he posts football videos asThehullboyabout his beloved Tigers, Hull City FC. And from some ofhis social media postsfrom the Land’s End to John o’Groats challenge: taking on a herd of deer in a running race (Bambis 1, Marcus 0), then cattle (same result, Marcus admits he’s not the quickest). And he was funny when he told Naga Munchetty and 6 million BBC Breakfast viewers that he had popped into Lidl for a sneaky poo.He also speaks with a thoughtfulness and an eloquence that belie his age. It is hard to believe he only turned 17 in February. He talks about his mental health with an honesty and openness that has to be helpful, to himself and to others. In December 2023, aged 15, Marcus attempted suicide, after which he “had an overwhelming feeling of guilt, and regret, that to me shows that deep down I still did want to be here”.He has a message about that. “Life is brutal, sometimes you feel like you’re in a place you can’t get out of. But I promise you, every road may have speed bumps but you’ll get over them.Mental healthis such a big thing, everyone is different but I find running helps mine.”View image in fullscreenMarcus on his UK-long run.Photograph: @thehullboy/InstagramMarcus never liked running before. Hated it in fact. “I always had a lot of anxiety when it came to running in front of people. I was always quite on the tubby side of things. I felt they would laugh at me. Any time at school, whether running or in PE, I used to fake injury or illness.”But after the suicide attempt, he started – a walk first, then a longer walk. “And I realised how beautiful nature was, and I thought to myself: ‘You know what, I can’t run but I want to give this a go. I’m going to run one mile a day.’”So that’s what he did, a mile a day. He posted about it on social media. Marcus, who had weighed 145kg (22st 11lb), lost three or four kilos that first month. “I kept going up in distance,” he says. “You can become obsessed with the process but that’s what makes it proper.”Marcus hooked up withRuss Cook,nicknamed “the Hardest Geezer”, who has run the entire length of Africa. Cook had seen what Marcus was doing and sent him a message of encouragement. They made contact and Cook helped Marcus with his training, to build up the distance. They ran a marathon together, round and round Hyde Park in London. Marcus raised some money for the mental health charity Mind, which he had contacted before. “When I was at my lowest, I rang them. They were really helpful.”Mind was also helpful to Philip, who was diagnosed with depression before being diagnosed with dementia. “I feel I’ve always wanted to give back what they’ve done,” Marcus says.The marathon, and the ultramarathon that followed, were always going to be stepping stones to the big one Marcus had set his sights on. On 1 April this year, he set off from Land’s End. “I remember that first hour of the run, just jogging away, and I was like: ‘Yeah, this is really it, I am running the entire length of the country.’ It was magical.”View image in fullscreenEmotional reunion … Marcus with his father at John o’Groats.It wasn’t wall-to-wall magic the length of Britain. There was the hailstone battering and layby meltdown just a couple of days later, but then it became routine. “I didn’t see it as a chore, but it was just very repetitive. Me and Harry had our ups and downs, we both lost our minds a bit.”Harry, “an absolute legend” whom Marcus met at a Liam Gallagher concert, quit his job to come and drive the support car, organise their accommodation, cook and get Marcus up and running in the morning (not always easy). Some weekends, Jayne would drive Philip in the family car to wherever they had got to, to give Harry a break. The support car Marcus and Harry were using was donated by the company Jayne works for, but then they crashed it. That was another low point. After that, Jayne’s brother lent them an old truck he had on his farm. Everything else – accommodation, food, fuel – went on Jayne’s credit card. She now has a £15,000 bill to pay off.Then there was the physical exhaustion. Marcus remembers one 27-mile day: “I was in the middle of the countryside somewhere, trying to find Harry, and I was like: if you can do this, run through this when your legs are going through the worst pain you’ve ever felt, you can do anything.” Then, looking at me, he adds: “And I can get out of bed, come downstairs and do an interview with you.”Was that difficult? “I do get nervous sometimes,” he admits. “Going on the BBC was nerve-racking.” But today was mainly hard because he had been up till dawn, with mates, in a field.There were loads of good times on the challenge, too: the scenery, Wales, the Lakes, Scotland. Marcus ran mainly alongside A and B roads, headphones on, listening to Oasis, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Sam Fender, a lot of indie stuff, but then a whole day listening to Brazilian rap. Also true crime podcasts. “The Moors Murders. I was running past Bolton, thinking: ‘I’m near this!’ That’s a bit odd.”View image in fullscreenMarcus’s commemorative T-shirt.Photograph: @thehullboy/InstagramWere the Lidl toilets a highlight? Would he recommend them? “Do you know what? I would. I think Lidl toilets are brilliant. There were loads of Lidls, loads of Asdas, also Waitrose toilets, quite nice … When you need to go you need to go.”As well as the few not-so-great people who didn’t stop or drove off when he needed them, he met a lot of really great ones, who invited him in, fed him, donated. On the way into Warrington, he says: “This guy just came bombing down the road, he had a massive beard and a hat, and he runs up to me, shakes my hand, is like [adopting I think a quite decent scouse accent]: ‘Hello mate, how ya doing, I’m Rob.’ Sorry, that’s a horrible scouse accent,” he says. (He means his, not Rob’s.) “We were just talking, and he’s the English Forrest Gump. It was the ultramarathon runner Rob Pope.You can search him up, he’s quite famous. He ran across America five times.”Marcus was joined for a day by Colson Smith, who was PC Craig Tinker in Coronation Street. Sir Mo Farah sent him a message on X: “Keep going champ. Anything is possible.” An invitation to the pub in Lockerbie turned into one of the best evenings of Marcus’s life. “The people were so lovely.”The first sign to John o’Groats was a highlight; that’s when it sunk in that he was actually going to do it. He had a special playlist for the last few miles, including Lover, You Should’ve Come Over by Jeff Buckley, Walkin’ After Midnight by Patsy Cline (his dad’s favourite), and finally his own favourite, Live Forever by Oasis.His mum and dad were there, of course, to cheer him over the line. Aged 17-and-a-quarter, and after 58 days, he had become, on 29 May, the youngest person to run the length of the UK – 874 miles. Plus £111,000 raised for Mind …I’ve had a comedown. But it’s all about learning how to deal with that. It was such a buzz, the sense of freedomThat was then. A couple of weeks later and it’s £156,000 … £157,000 Jayne corrects, showinghis GoFundMe pageon her phone. It will probably be more by the time you read this. Sarah Hughes, chief executive officer of Mind, said it was also a record for a single fundraising activity for Mind. “What Marcus has achieved is nothing short of extraordinary. We cannot thank him enough for pushing himself to the limit. We hope what Marcus has achieved inspires other young people to make a positive difference in other people’s lives and encourages anyone struggling to be open about their mental health. Every pound he raised will make a real difference.”View image in fullscreenOver the line at John o’Groats.Photograph: Courtesy of Marcus SkeetOn pounds he lost, Marcus now weighs around 109kg. It’s been tough, since finishing, though: “I’ve had a comedown, that was always gonna happen. But it’s all about learning how to deal with that. It was such a buzz, the sense of freedom.” It is good to be back home, seeing mates, going to gigs; he bought himself an electric guitar and is trying to learn to play it. “Keeping my head busy because, deep down, I do miss the challenge,” he says.On the plus side, he doesn’t have to run 20 miles a day. He took a couple of weeks off, to recover, now he’s getting back into it, slowly. Five miles, six miles.Any plans? “I’m not going to do anything crazy for a while. I obviously want to do America, things like that.” Do America, what does that mean? “Run across, left to right or right to left, 4,000 miles, why not?” And he laughs.

Could I find stability and rootedness with a new life on an island?Georgina MooreWed 25 Jun 2025 01.55 EDTShareIf you’d told me when I was in my early 30s that, by the end of that decade, I would be living in a houseboat, I would never have believed you. I was a devoted Londoner, born and bred, and very wedded to my city lifestyle. I’d got a 100% mortgage and bought a tiny flat with a balcony, where I would host parties – and defy gravity – every weekend.Romantically, I was jumping from one emotional disaster to another, falling for unsuitable people, closing my ears to those who dropped hints about biological clocks. I had my dream career in publishing and most weeknights could be found stumbling out of the Groucho Club and into a cab. In the early 00s, publishing was all about “networking” and there was always someone keen to go for “just one” – code for a late night of heavy drinking, often culminating in karaoke. I’d get out of bed at 9am the next day, get on the tube and be at my desk by 10, with my boss shaking his head knowingly at my “breakfast meeting” alibi. Then I’d do it all again.I was a total ageing party girl cliche. My parents had given up on the idea of me settling down and, luckily, I had a younger sister who was getting married, which took the pressure off. I spent her wedding determined to be the last one on the dancefloor in my bright pink dress and feather boa, so that no one would guess I was as worried about my future as they all seemed to be.And then I met James. We’d actually crossed paths some years earlier, but our mutual friends began to nudge us towards each other around 2008, after we each went through a breakup.View image in fullscreen‘Everything sparkled on the river’ … Georgina and James’s home on Taggs Island.Photograph: Courtesy of Georgina MooreSomething in me knew that I needed to tread carefully with him. James was super-smart and intuitive, didn’t like arguments and stood up to me when I behaved carelessly. He challenged me in a way I hadn’t encountered before.He also had a rootedness about him, seeming settled and happy on Taggs Island in Hampton, south-west London, where he lived. I’d heard some time before that James lived on an island houseboat, a place where you woke to the swans and the geese, and the rowers, with an eccentric and wonderful community, like a floating village. At that stage, I hadn’t been interested in swans, or rowers, or community, but when he invited me to lunch at his home, I thought I’d better go and see what all the fuss was about, swallowing the expensive 40-minute cab ride to get there. That July day, everything sparkled on the river. We sat in the garden, surrounded by climbing roses, watching the boats going past, with friendly neighbours dropping in to say hello. We even swam in the river. By the end of the date, I didn’t want to go home.Things became serious between us very quickly and we decided to try for a baby, but that didn’t mean I wanted to give up my flat or my work-hard-play-hard lifestyle. Even though I could be in Waterloo in 40 minutes, Taggs Island felt like a long way from city life – and I was looking at an hour and a half’s commute to work. When I became pregnant, I knew that living between our two homes was no longer feasible, but I found it hard to let go.View image in fullscreenMoore on her houseboat with children Sonny and Daisy in 2013.Photograph: Courtesy of Georgina MooreI finally moved to the houseboat the summer before our son was born, after James convinced me that it would be an amazing place to bring up children: the freedom, the river, going to school by boat, a huge park on our doorstep. James was already a devoted islander but I found the change hard at first. I wasn’t used to the lack of privacy, the island WhatsApp group that pinged all day long or the long commute as I got enormous and tired.And then, something magical happened. On one of the first days of my maternity leave, I was feeling lost and out of place, miles away from the “real world”, when I received an invitation from a lovely neighbour, who also had a baby, asking me for tea. We had a lot in common: she was also an older mum, a writer, and had previously led a Soho life. That tea on her balcony led to us spending most of our maternity leave exploring local child-friendly cafes together, and forging friendships with other mothers on the island. Some of them had grown up there themselves and had wanted to return with their own kids.It gave me a sense of the legacy and the unique appeal of this extraordinary place where I now live. After that, there was no stopping me: I leaned into island life, joining the local book club and even taking up kayaking. I began to discover what community means and how important it can be in supporting you when you feel like a fish out of water. I now have a floating office in a canal boat and enjoy working from there more than I ever did in the city – even if there are fewer opportunities for post-work drinks and late-night karaoke.River of Starsby Georgina Moore is published by HQ on 3 July (£16.99).

However, it is the lack of application of a basic procurement principle that is the underlying cause of the HS2 debacle.On a major project likeHS2, the first question a procurement professional should ask is: “What is the business need?” The time spent establishing a clear need, signed off by all stakeholders, is time well spent. My experience is that quality procurement expertise is not sought before the project specification is defined and this question is fudged. Why scupper a glamorous ill-defined (and therefore inevitably costly) project for a dull and precisely defined one?I would suggest that the actual business need was not to build a high-speed connection to the Midlands and north, but to increase passenger capacity, for which there were many solutions. However, matching the TGV (France’s intercity high-speed rail service) was not one of them, but it became adopted as such in the minds of the proponents of the project and the politicians. That being the case, the project signed off by the politicians was entirely inappropriate.Bruce WhiteCambridgeHS2 has the flaw that it has always had since conception (The Guardian view on HS2 delays: a chance to break the cycle of costly failure, 18 June). The time gained from high speed over a short run is minimal. This is not Madrid to Barcelona (approximately 320 miles). The argument that it will relieve capacity on existing lines is false – it does not stop anywhere along the way. People must travel into London or Birmingham to get on, wasting time and money as well as loading the existing lines. People will prefer the overall quicker route from where they live, rather than schlepping into the city. It doesn’t even serve the two international airports that it conceivably could have reached.Think of the transport projects that could have been if those billions had not been poured away on political vanity. For example, I live in Cornwall. Our connection to the National Rail network is a single-track bridge that was opened in 1859 and a line that clings to the edge of the land except when it gets washed away. A fraction of those billions could be well spent down here. Instead, Old Oak Common degrades the GWR line into Paddington that serves not only us, but a huge commuting contingent from Berkshire, Wiltshire etc. Just stop throwing good money after bad and give it up.Alan PeabodyFeock, CornwallThe HS2 project is a national disgrace. Spiralling costs, massive environmental destruction, loss of homes, and for what? Reducing the journey from London to Birmingham by a few minutes, with no doubt expensive tickets as well.This vanity project, started by the Conservatives, does not appear to have any justification, and nobody is taken to task for its current failures; nor do we know who is profiting from it, whether consultants or managers. The cost to the taxpayers is unacceptable, especially given the need for better and cheaper rail services in so many other areas. There should be a public inquiry into this.And yet this government is apparentlygoing to continuepouring money into it, at a time when Rachel Reeves claims that there is a lack of resources to fund pressing mattersin other areas, policing, the arts and social services. No other European country would have botched such a project, nor indeed considered it.Tanya FirthLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Yet immigrants are still fighting to be seen that way, 22 June).The contribution of Caribbean nurses to the NHS is now, thankfully, acknowledged. My Jamaican mother was among that early cohort, but so too were a great many Irish nurses, whom she numbered among her close work colleagues and personal friends. Their shared acknowledgment of the petty prejudices of everyday racism that “othered” workers from the Caribbean andIrelandwas mutually supportive both in and outside work, at a time when such things received no recognition more generally.There are many more nuanced stories of postwar migration to be told.

However, having read Ofcom’s research and the Guardian’s article on it (Society may have overestimated risk of the ‘manosphere’, UK researchers say, 13 June), we wish to stress that the manosphere poses a very real risk to society and that underestimating the problem will only contribute to it.Theresearch consistedof 39 interviews with people who have seen and/or created manosphere content. While there is value in such a study, both Ofcom and the Guardian acknowledge that those with more extreme views may refuse to participate. Interviewees may also aim to present themselves, and their community, in a more positive light, downplaying misogynistic views.Interviewees’ claims – such as finding “entertainment” in the videos ofAndrew Tate– were not questioned by the Ofcom study. Promoting traditional gender roles and discussing perceived immutable differences between men and women was also seen as merely “ambiguous[ly]” misogynistic. But misogyny is more than explicitly declaring to hate women.The article’s headline uses the results of a small-scale study to draw conclusions about “society” as a whole. This is untenable; indeed, the original report states that findings “point to a range of risk factors that may increase the likelihood of harm”. That the harm has been overestimated appears to be the interpretation of the managing director of the research agency, who spoke separately to the Guardian.Online misogyny and its mainstreaming is apervasive issuethat is difficult to identify and monitor, and requires a whole-society solution. Ofcom should work with academics and safeguarding professionals: together, we have a chance to address the risks posed by the manosphere – but only if they are taken seriously.Prof Veronika KollerLancaster University,Dr Jessica AistonQueen Mary University London,Dr Alexandra KrendelUniversity of Southampton,Dr Mark McGlashanUniversity of LiverpoolExplore more on these topicsMenMen's healthInternetAndrew TateOfcomWomen's healthViolence against women and girlslettersShareReuse this content"

They also blocked off access to key buildings, including the parliament and the official residence of the president, William Ruto, with razor wire.View image in fullscreenFires were lit in the streets and central business district of Nairobi.Photograph: EPAIn the city centre, where many businesses were closed, thousands gathered for the march, waving Kenyan flags and placards with images of victims of last year’s protests.Others lit street fires and chanted slogans against Ruto. Later, violence ensued, with police firing teargas and water cannon and hitting protesters with batons, while protesters threw stones and other objects.A source at Kenyatta national hospital in Nairobi told Reuters the facility had received 56 people, most of them with injuries from rubber bullets.The planned marches also developed into clashes between civilians and police in the cities of Mombasa, Nakuru and Kisumu and other parts of the country. Protesters torched parts of court buildings in Kikuyu town in Kiambu county.The communications authority of KenyaorderedTV and radio stations to stop live coverage of the protests, threatening those that failed to follow the directive with regulatory action. The TV stations NTV, KTN, K24 and Kameme were later taken off air.Lawmakers left parliament buildings in Nairobi, and protests continued to intensify in the city centre. Elsewhere, throngs of people marched along major roads towards the capital.1:43Police fire teargas at protesters in Kenya – videoOutrage has been growing in Kenya over the past few years due to corruption, unemployment, government excesses and rising living costs.Wednesday’s protests come against a backdrop ofdemonstrations last yearprompted by proposed tax increases, in which dozens of people died and many more disappeared.The street protests reduced over time, but killings,arrestsanddisappearancescontinued, triggering more anger towards the authorities.Two incidents this month – the death of the teacher Albert Ojwangin police custodyafter reportedly criticising a senior police official on social media, and the police shooting of the vendor Boniface Kariuki at close range during a protest over Ojwang’s death – have further inflamed public anger.Stephanie Marie, a young protester in Nairobi, said she was at Wednesday’s march because of Ojwang. “It could be my brother, it could be my cousin, it could be anyone,” she said. “These are just normal boys, doing normal things.”She called for leaders to heed what they were saying: “The people voted. You’re here for the people. You’re working for the people … we just want you to listen to the people. That’s it.”Another young protester in Nairobi, Innocent, was commemorating the loss of his friend in last year’s protests. He said he’d been exposed to a lot of teargas from police on Wednesday but he was relentless.“The youth are unstoppable,” he said. “Because we’ve come to fight for our rights.” He added: “We don’t want bad leadership.”Explore more on these topicsKenyaProtestHuman rightsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The judge ordered a full hearing to take place on 4 August.Lungu, who led Zambia from 2015 to 2021, died inSouth Africathis month aged 68 after an undisclosed illness. His family said he had made a specific request that the current president, Hakainde Hichilema, should not attend his funeral. The government had planned a state funeral presided over by Hichilema.The attorney general, Mulilo Kabesha,toldthe Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation that state funerals with full military honours were required by law, citing a previous local court ruling on the burial of Zambia’s first president, Kenneth Kaunda.Kabesha said: “The high court ruled that a former president is not a private arrangement, is not private property, is national property and his burial should be handled by the state. The moment that a national mourning is declared, the law kicks in.”Court papers filed by Kabesha said a grave had been prepared for Lungu in the national cemetery where all other former presidents are buried. A state funeral for Lungu has already been cancelled twice.Hichilema defeated Lungu in a bitterly fought electionin 2021, having lost to him in 2016. In 2017, Hichilema was sent to prison for four months on charges of treason after his convoy did not give way to Lungu’s presidential motorcade. The charges were dropped and Hichilema released after an international outcry.After Hichilema took power, Lungu accused his successor of targeting him and in effect placing him under house arrest. In 2023, policestopped Lungufrom going out for runs, saying they were “political activism” and needed to be approved beforehand to “ensure public safety”.Lungu’s wife, Esther Lungu, and their children have faced various corruption charges. She has pleaded not guilty to charges of stealing cars, which she was due to face in court this week.Last year, Edgar Lungu attempted to return to frontline politics but was barred from running again for the presidency in next year’s election. Zambia’s constitutional courtruledthat when Lungu took over as president after the incumbent, Michael Sata, died in 2015, the period until the 2016 election counted as a full first term in power.Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsZambiaSouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They started peacefully on 18 June but later turned chaotic after a violent police response, and people accused of being involved in the protests disappeared and were killed. The demands of the protests then widened to calls for reform and the resignation of the president, William Ruto.In reaction, Rutoscrapped the finance billthat contained the proposed tax increases and restructured his cabinet to include opposition figures and create a “broad-based” government.The street protests started declining from September, but killings,arrests,disappearancesand public resentment towards the authorities continued.A recent series of demonstrations were triggered by the death of a teacher, Albert Ojwang, this month while he was being heldin police custodyafter reportedly criticising a senior police official on social media. Public anger erupted further as an officer shot a vendor, Boniface Kariuki, at close range during another round of protests last week.In addition to concerns about police brutality, issues Kenyans protested about last year – including corruption, unemployment, government excesses and rising living costs – persist.Mikhail Nyamweya, a political analyst, said the trust of many Kenyans – especially younger people – in the government remains low and they view the administration as “unresponsive and detached from everyday struggles”.“Despite promises of reform, the Kenyan youth view the state as incapable of delivering and always quick to suppress dissent through coercive means,” he said. “Continued reports of human rights violations and inadequate accountability have reinforced the perception that little has changed.”Wednesday’s plan includes peaceful processions in different parts of the country, and digital campaigns using hashtags. In Nairobi, people are expected to walk towards the parliament and the president’s office, laying flowers along the road and light candles outside the premises. Vigils were scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday.Recent demonstrations, including those over the death of Ojwang, have been infiltrated by men whom protesters have described as hired goons who disrupt protests by beating and robbing peaceful demonstrators.Last week, Nairobi’s regional police commander, George Seda, called for calm from those who participate. “What I would like to urge the public is, let’s restrict ourselves to what we call ‘peaceful demonstrations’,” he said. “Let’s not have demonstrations that are going to interfere with other people who may not be part of the demonstrators.”But some of Ruto’s allies and pro-government politicians have made threats against younger Kenyans. David Ndii, the chairperson of Ruto’s council of economic advisers,postedon X: “You allow yourself to be weaponised by self seekers, there’ll be casualties”, beforetelling a user: “Wewe tokea [You show up], and say your goodbyes before you leave home just in case you catch a stray.”Rights activists have called for solidarity. “Let’s stand together as brothers and sisters tomorrow, united in solidarity,”said Hanifa Adan on X. “Let’s look out for one another and protect each other. May the Lord shield us from violence, political interference, and most of all, from the brutality of bloodthirsty police.”Ina joint statement on Tuesday, envoys from 12 countries including the US and the UK stated its support for “every Kenyan’s right to peaceful assembly and to express themselves” and urged all parties “to facilitate peaceful demonstrations and to refrain from violence”.The Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops called for peaceful activities on Wednesday and criticised excessive use of force by police during demonstrations.“A society that instils fear in its youth for simply speaking out is a society walking away from justice,” Nyeri archbishop Anthony Muheria said at a press conference. “The government’s primary responsibility is to protect its citizens, not to threaten, silence, or punish them.”Explore more on these topicsKenyaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

There are hopes the precisely targeted technology could eventually reduce reliance on antibiotics and other generalised medicines.The tiny devices are part of the expanding field of micro- and nano-robots for use in medicine. They have also been developed to deliver drugs and to remove bacteria from medical implants such as stents and hernia meshes.Experts believe they could be in clinical use for treating infections in bladders, intestines and sinuses in five to 10 years. Scientists inChina, Switzerland, the US and the UK are developing more sophisticated versions capable of moving through the bloodstream.The latest development came from a collaboration of academics at the Chinese University in Hong Kong, and universities in Guangxi, Shenzhen, Jiangsu, Yangzhou and Macau.sinus graphicResearchers in the emerging field acknowledge risks include some of the tiny micro-robots being left behind after treatment which could cause longer-term side effects.Another potential problem, cited by technology experts, is public suspicion at the thought of welcoming robots into the human body and conspiracy theories arising around fears the robots could be activated without consent.The latest breakthrough, based on animal rather than human trials, involves magnetic particles “doped” with copper atoms which clinicians insert with a catheter before guiding to their target under a magnetic field.The swarms can be heated up by reacting to light from an optical fibre that is also inserted into the body as part of the therapy. This allows the micro-robots to loosen up and penetrate viscous pus that forms a barrier to the infection site. The light source also prompts the micro-robots to disrupt bacterial cell walls and release reactive oxygen species that kill the bacteria.The study,publishedin Science Robotics, showed the robots were capable of eradicating bacteria from pig sinuses and could clear infections in live rabbits with “no obvious tissue damage”.The researchers have produced a model of how the technology could work on a human being, with the robot swarms being deployed in operating theatre conditions, allowing doctors to see their progress by using X-rays. Future applications could include tackling bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, stomach, intestine, bladder and urethra, they suggested.“Our proposed micro-robotic therapeutic platform offers the advantages of non-invasiveness, minimal resistance, and drug-free intervention,” they said.Prof Sylvain Martel, director of the Nano Robotics Laboratory at the Polytechnique de Montréal in Canada, who was not involved in the research, said the science seemed effective.“It’s like a rocket that you can direct with a magnetic field,” he said.He predicted micro-robots could be available for treatments in three to five years but possibly not for another decade, as regulators still need to approve their use and the manufacturing processes, which differ from those of standard pharmaceuticals.“The main advantage with micro-robots is the targeting,” Martel said. “Instead of taking medicine that goes into the bloodstream and a small quantity goes to the right location, you can target.”He said the public would soon set aside any fears over the idea of having robotic devices in their bodies.“Maybe at the beginning [they will be afraid],” he said. “But they will get used to it pretty quickly.”Dr Andrea Soltoggio, a reader in artificial intelligence at Loughborough University, said: “The public may be suspicious about non-biological objects like nano-robots being inserted into our bodies. It may even trigger conspiracy theories.“But it is important to look at what nano-robots are designed for. In this case, we see an example of a targeted intervention to reduce or eradicate an infection with a localised action.“Nano-robots’ behaviour is often simpler and more targeted than many drugs and they could effectively complement a wide range of therapies.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchChinaAsia PacificHong KongnewsShareReuse this content"

Like his British counterpart, Aonishiki discovered sumo as a boy, practising judo and freestyle wrestling before encountering sumo athletes who were visiting his gym in Ukraine from Japan.The Minato stable, based in Saitama prefecture, confirmed that Tarasenko had been accepted as a trainee and said he could make his professional debut at the springbasho, or major tournament, in Osaka in March next year provided he passes his Japanese exams.Tarasenko will be expected to perform cooking and other duties andlive alongside his fellow wrestlersas he adjusts to regimented stable life. He will also have to fit his Japanese studies around early-morning training sessions and twice-daily meals ofchanko nabe– a protein-rich hotpot – to help him gain weight. The crewcut he sported during his amateur career will eventually give way to achonmagetop-knot.“He will have to adjust to lots of things, such as diet and lifestyle, but he’s an earnest and honest boy, and his Japanese ability has improved considerably, so we are not particularly worried about him settling in,” a Minato stable spokesperson told the Guardian.“He has already made friends with the other wrestlers and gets plenty of support from the people around him. We hope he’ll continue to work hard at his sumo and live up to everyone’s expectations.”Explore more on these topicsJapanSumo wrestlingAsia PacificHullEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It would help developers’ cashflows … if there were to be such a tax that it’s done at the occupation certificate stage.”The industry had identified financing mid-rise projects as a challenge, he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I suspect the nimby wing of the Liberal party will intervene,” he said, singling out the shadow attorney general and MP for Wahroonga, Alistair Heskens.Wahroonga, on Sydney’s upper north shore, is slated for several low to mid-rise development areas under the government’s Transport Oriented Development zones.Heskens has warned the TODs “will dramatically increase local congestion”.Speakman said they had held meetings with the government over the reforms and that these had been constructive.Explore more on these topicsNew South Wales politicsNew South WalesChris MinnsHousingCost-of-living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Moderate users were also just as likely to seek help from parents as low users (63%) compared with high users (52%), and reported less difficulty in socialising (26%) than low users (28%).Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThose who reported higher social media use also reported worse mental health and wellbeing, such as feeling negative about the future, no control over their lives and feeling lonely, the report found.This was higher among gender diverse participants who reported high psychological distress (64%) at a higher rate compared with females (35%) and males (20%).Youth mental health body Orygen said the report suggested moderation was key when it came to social media use, arguing moderate users of social media tend to fare better or very similarly to low users, “indicating that social media is not, in itself, a problem for all young people”.High daily social media use (over 3 hours) by Indigenous youth“There obviously been a dominant narrative that all social media use is bad for young people but actually what we found is that moderate users were faring better or the same as low users,” lead survey author and Orygen research fellow Dr Louise La Sala said.“We saw that in terms of their sense of control over their lives, the hope they had for their futures, the way they were more likely to reach out to family or friends or take part in exercise in sports.“It challenges the assumption that many of us hold that social media is inherently bad.”High daily social media use (over 3 hours) by genderLa Sala said gender diverse people often sought community, support and connection in online spaces, and the study could not state whether people experiencing more distress were spending more time online to seek help, or whether more time online was affecting that distress.When instituting the social media ban, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, talked up the benefits of children being off social media in order to spend more time on the football field or netball court.But the survey reveals more than half (55%) of the cohort who say they spend more than three hours per day on social media take part in sports.That rises to 67% for both moderate and low use of social media.High social media use (over 3 hours) by CALD youthLa Sala said there was not a lot of evidence for the claim that social media use was displacing other activities.“There are many other platforms or many other parts of the internet that will be available to young people.”Those surveyed will not be affected by the incoming ban on under-16s – with the majority aged 16 or over already. The report recommends increasing digital literacy to ensure when the ban comes into effect that teenagers aged 14 and 15 can be equipped to navigate social media when joining.Should YouTube be included in Australia’s under-16s social media ban? Here’s what you need to knowRead moreLa Sala said the ban should not be the end point of making social media safer for all users.“It doesn’t really matter if you’re 16 or 26, you shouldn’t be exposed to harmful content. The ban is one attempt at trying to mitigate some of these harms for young people but there is so much more we need to be doing, and the conversation doesn’t stop there.”The federal government is due to receive a long-awaited report on technology to check ages of all users of social media and adult websites by the end of July. The communications minister, Anika Wells, will then need to decide which platforms it will apply to, and which technology should be used before the ban comes into effect in December.The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said on Tuesday that she has recommended to Wells that the expected carve out of YouTube from the regulations should not go ahead.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaAustralian politicsLabor partyDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

In her testimony to fire brigade investigators she admitted she had thrown a cigarette that had ignited one of [the five] fronts.”Witnesses also reported seeing the incident.More than 400 firefighters, backed by water-dumping aircraft and hundreds of volunteers, have been battling blazes on Chios since Sunday, forcing authorities to call a state of emergency and dozens of villages to be evacuated.View image in fullscreenA firefighting helicopter on Chios this week. Firefighters say the wildfires are still not under control.Photograph: Kostas Kourgias/EPABlazes broke out in different areas of the island simultaneously. As the fires spread, fuelled by gale force winds, officials raised the spectre of some of the conflagrations being started deliberately, saying it was otherwise hard to explain how they had erupted in such diverse areas at the same time.Giorgos Toumbos, president of the Chios Mastic Producers Union, told the Greek daily Kathimerini late on Tuesday that efforts were focused on putting out flames raging across a prime plateau to prevent the fires engulfing mastic villages – 14th-century fortified villages famous for their production of mastic resin – farther south.A reported 40,000 hectares have been reduced to ashes on the island. It is unclear how many tourists were visiting Chios when the conflagrations erupted on 22 June.Kozanis said the fires were receding but were by no means “entirely under control”.“They have yet to be fully contained,” he added. “Yes, they are in recession but they have not been extinguished.”A Mediterranean hotspot, Greece is on the frontline of the climate emergency with the countryexperiencing a dramatic uptick in wildfiresbecause of higher temperatures and ever-drier conditions in recent years.Faced with a dramatic increase in forest fires, Greece’s centre-right government has toughened penalties for arson and ecological destruction with the criminal code foreseeing prison terms of up to 20 years and fines of up to €200,000 for such crimes.Greece is experiencing its first heatwave of the summer with temperatures expected to nudge 40C in the coming days.Explore more on these topicsGreeceWildfiresEuropeGeorgianewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump may like to take the credit for almost all of the 32 allies agreeing to asharp increase in defence spending, but the reality is that the dramatic change in the Nato mindset was as much brought on by Vladimir Putin.The Russian president’s full-scale invasion ofUkrainein February 2022 was the first jolt, but there is a second uncomfortable reality. If there is a sustainable ceasefire in Ukraine, it will mean the deployment of a European-led peacekeeping force in the country – and after a while, Russia’s military might will inevitably recover.Mark Rutte’s sycophantic, but effective, handling of Trump, certainly helped bring about a positive summit in The Hague, though even the Nato chief had to concede that describing Trump as “daddy” – a father figure who had to tell Iran and Israel to stop fighting – was perhaps “a question of taste”.The manoeuvres were not subtle, but they were nevertheless effective. A late schedule change gave Trump a night in King Willem-Alexander’s palace, complete with breakfast, leaving Trump to remark on how well he had slept, though what particularly seems to have hit home was hearing each of the alliance’s other 31 leaders give a three-minute speech, something that might be assumed to have bored him.“I came here because it was something I’m supposed to be doing, but I left here a little bit different,” he said as he reflected on the morning meeting in an upbeat press conference.Even Trump’s complaints that US media had been reporting that Iran’s nuclear sitesmay not have been destroyed, according to initial Pentagon assessments, did nothing to puncture his tone of warmth to his Nato allies.Make no mistake, after Trump’s re-election and particularly in February, the alarm across Nato was real. That month, Trump started talking to Putin about Ukraine, androwed with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in the Oval Office – while his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth,made a speechthat was interpreted as a warning that in the not too distant future Europe might have to defend itself.But what helped persuade Nato’s other leaders to spend more was a worry about Trump’s commitment.Natoplanners believe that if Russia were to agree to a ceasefire, it could quickly, within perhaps three, five or seven years, pose a serious threat to the alliance’s eastern flank.The Kremlin could maintain an army of 600,000 soldiers and, by spending 6.5% of GDP on defence, begin to restore its stock of munitions and equipment.The Guardian view on the Nato summit: Europe must take the path of strategic self-reliance | EditorialRead moreRutte told the Guardian on the eve of the summit that, faced with this threat, it was clear that Nato hada series of “capability gaps”– for example, the alliance needed a fivefold increase in air defence to protect its cities from the kind of bombing that Ukraine is currently suffering daily. It was easy, he argued, to persuade other leaders to sign up to increasing spending because the purpose was clear.The remiltarisation to come is substantial. Calculations from the Royal United Services Institute thinktank estimate that Nato defence spending in Europe andCanadawill increase from $500m (£366m) today to $1.1tn in 2035, when the combined defence budget of the other 31 allies will essentially equal the Pentagon’s.Already there are signs of what this will look like in practice, though it is uncertain how much will be spent appropriately.Britain will spend at least £1bn on restoring an air-launched tactical nuclear weapon capability to complement Trident, which is intended to deter a full-scale Russian land invasion ofEurope, the kind not envisaged since the 1980s – and which remains highly unlikely.If there was a moment when the post-cold war dividend was reversed, The Hague summit was certainly it.Explore more on these topicsNatoDonald TrumpVladimir PutinMark RutteUkraineEuropeNetherlandsanalysisShareReuse this content"

We, the Heads of State and Government of the North Atlantic Alliance, have gathered in The Hague to reaffirm our commitment to NATO, the strongest Alliance in history, and to the transatlantic bond.We reaffirm our ironclad commitment to collective defence as enshrined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty– that an attack on one is an attack on all. We remain united and steadfast in our resolve to protect our one billion citizens, defend the Alliance, and safeguard our freedom and democracy.2. United in the face of profound security threats and challenges, in particularthe long term threat posed by Russia to Euro-Atlantic securityand the persistent threat of terrorism,Allies commit to invest 5% of GDP annually on core defence requirements as well as defence-and security-related spending by 2035to ensure our individual and collective obligations, in accordance with Article 3 of the Washington Treaty. Our investments will ensure we have the forces, capabilities, resources, infrastructure, warfighting readiness, and resilience needed to deter and defend in line with our three core tasks of deterrence and defence, crisis prevention and management, and cooperative security.3. Allies agree that this 5% commitment will comprise two essential categories of defence investment.Allies will allocate at least 3.5% of GDP annually based on the agreed definition of NATO defence expenditure by 2035 to resource core defence requirements, and to meet the NATO Capability Targets.Allies agree to submit annual plans showing a credible, incremental path to reach this goal. And Allies will account for up to 1.5% of GDP annually to inter alia protect our critical infrastructure, defend our networks, ensure our civil preparedness and resilience, unleash innovation, and strengthen our defence industrial base.The trajectory and balance of spending under this plan will be reviewed in 2029, in light of the strategic environment and updated Capability Targets.Allies reaffirm their enduring sovereign commitments to provide support to Ukraine, whose security contributes to ours, and, to this end, will include direct contributions towards Ukraine’s defence and its defence industry when calculating Allies’ defence spending.4. We reaffirm our shared commitment torapidly expand transatlantic defence industrial cooperation and to harness emerging technologyand the spirit of innovation to advance our collective security. We will work to eliminate defence trade barriers among Allies and will leverage our partnerships to promote defence industrial cooperation.5. We express our appreciation for the generous hospitality extended to us by the Kingdom of the Netherlands. We look forward to our next meeting in Türkiye in 2026 followed by a meeting in Albania.Share"

Our stations are very busy, and we advise you to cancel or postpone your trip.”Eurostar advised all passengers on Wednesday to either change their journey or cancel it and request a free exchange or refund.But by the afternoon, the company said “full repairs are now completed” and trains had resumed.The situation caused chaos for travellers at London St Pancras station.Ed and Paul, 41 and 37, work in renewable energy and were due to travel to Paris for a meeting. “It has been a nightmare. It’s been pretty shocking,” said Ed.“The app basically said: ‘Your journey is being disrupted’, but they didn’t say: ‘Your train is definitely cancelled’, so it’s been quite confusing and we’re wondering if we will still get our money back.”A couple in their 70s from Coventry who had their holiday plans disrupted said: “We had our train cancelled this morning and we’ve been waiting most of the day for Eurostar to make alternative arrangements.” The couple intended to instead take a flight to Spain from Gatwick.By 4pm calm had been restored to St Pancras with just a 35-minute delay to a train to Brussels.Police have launched an investigation, with forensic teams on the scene outside Lille that has disrupted dozens of high-speed services.Dutch authorities were also investigating disruption in the Netherlands on Tuesday after a power outage on around 30 rail cables affected trains from Schiphol airport, about 50km away from the Nato summit in The Hague.The justice minister of the Netherlands, David van Weel, said the damage could have been an attempt to sabotage the two-day meeting of Nato leaders. “The question is who is behind it. It can be an activist group, it can be a country,” he said.The French regional train network TER Hauts deFrancesaid 15 cable installers and specialists had been mobilised to repair the line at Lille Europe.The company said the theft occurred along the track bordering Mont-de-Terre station, between Lille and Lezennes, on signal cables laid in gutters on the ground.It said agents from the French national rail company, SNCF, were carrying out repairs by bringing in new cables. “As is always the case in this type of operation, the task involves connecting, one by one, around 15 wires making up each cable. This is meticulous work,” it said.The delays follow disruption on Tuesday after two people died in separate incidents on the line between Lille and Paris, causing the line to be shut for most of the day.In May, Spain’s transport minister said the country’srail network had suffered “an act of serious sabotage”after vital signalling cable was stolen over a busy bank holiday weekend, bringing severe delays to high-speed services between Madrid and Seville that affected more than 10,000 people.Explore more on these topicsEurostarFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The big party was originally supposed to take place in a 16th-century building in the centre of the city but was switched due to security concerns.The wedding, said to be costing €40m-€48m (£34m-£41m), is the most high-profile to take place in Venice sinceGeorge and Amal Clooneywere married in the city in 2014. But while the Clooneys were welcomed, the Bezos nuptials have been far more contentious, with posters featuring Bezos’s head on a rocket blasting into space – in reference to hisBlue Originspace tourism venture – pasted on walls across the city.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It could’ve been very severe. That’s what the intelligence suggests.”The president then appeared to revert to his claim that “it was very severe. There was obliteration”. Later in the day, he claimed that was the conclusion from “collected intelligence”, and that the Iranian programme had been set back “decades”.Trump also likened the US use of massive bunker-buster bombs on the Fordow and Natanz uranium enrichment sites to the impact of the US nuclear weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the second world war, using the comparison specifically in reference to their impact in ending a conflict.Over the course of the day, Trump’s claims became more far-reaching, even rejecting reports from the nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), that Iran’s 400kg stock of 60% enriched uranium could no longer be accounted for, and appeared to have been moved.Earlier in the week, the vice president, JD Vance, had appeared to admit the US did not know where the highly enriched uranium was, and said it would be a subject of discussions with the Iranians.Late on Wednesday, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said credible intelligence indicated that Iran’s nuclear programme had been severely damaged and would take years to be rebuilt.“This includes new intelligence from a historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years,” Ratcliffe said in a statement.Trump claimed there would be a US-Iran meeting next week to negotiate once more about Tehran’s nuclear programme. “We’re going to talk to them next week with Iran, we may sign an agreement, I don’t know,” he said, before adding: “I don’t care if I have an agreement or not.”Trump was also markedly less confident on Wednesday aboutthe ceasefire he had previous declared was “unlimited” and “going to go forever”, even suggesting that a return to conflict could be imminent.“I dealt with both and they’re both tired, exhausted … and can it start again? I guess someday, it can. It could maybe start soon,” he said.Accompanying Trump to the summit, Hegseth also seemed to downgrade his earlier declaration that Iran’s ability to make nuclear weapons in the future had been “obliterated”.A satellite image of the Fordow facility on 19 MarchA satellite image shows the Fordow nuclear facility on 19 MarchOn Wednesday the defence secretary described the damage to Iran’s nuclear facilities by US and Israeli bombing as “moderate to severe”. He pledged there would be an FBI investigation of Pentagon leaks, but also claimed the leaked information was false.Meanwhile the Israeli military said it was still trying to assess the damage inflicted by the bombing campaign, but a senior officer insisted: “We pushed them years backward.”Satellite images of the Fordow facility on 19 June, 20 June and 22 JuneSatellite images of the Fordow nuclear facility on 19 June, 20 June and 22 JuneA statement issued on behalf of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC), said the strikes had destroyed Fordow’s “critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable”. It added that the combined US and Israeli strikes “set back Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years”.On Tuesday nightCNN reportedon a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) initial assessment, which tentatively concluded that the deeply buried Fordow site and the underground facilities at Natanz had not been destroyed, and key components of the nuclear programme, including centrifuges, were capable of being restarted within months.The CNN account of the leak was independently confirmed as accurate by the Guardian and other outlets. The Washington Post noted that it was categorised as “low-confidence”, though a source told the Guardian that further analysis could find even less damage than the initial DIA estimate.The DIA assessment also found that much of Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, which would provide the fuel for making any future nuclear warhead, had been moved before the strikes and may have been moved to other secret nuclear sites maintained by Iran.For several years, a new facility has been excavated under a mountain, just to the south of the original Natanz facility.Providing an Israeli perspective on Wednesday, the IDF spokesperson Brig Gen Effie Defrin said the results of the air force’s bombing sorties had been “even better than we expected”.“I can say right now that the estimate is that we struck a significant blow to [Iran’s] nuclear infrastructure,” Defrin said. “I can say that we pushed them years backward.”CNN reported that Israeli intelligence estimates of the setback inflicted on Iran’s nuclear aspirations were two years.The IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, rejected what he described as an “hourglass approach” involving different assessments of how many months or years it would take Iran to rebuild, arguing it distracted from finding a long-term solution to an issue that had not been resolved.“In any case, the technological knowledge is there and the industrial capacity is there. That, no one can deny. So we need to work together with them,” Grossi said, adding that his priority was the return of IAEA inspectors to the nuclear sites, the only way he said they could be properly assessed.Nuclear experts described the development asa potential disaster for nonproliferation efforts, and warned of the dangers of Iran deciding to eject the remaining IAEA inspectors in the country and leave the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT).The treaty obliges Iran and other non-nuclear weapon countries to refrain from any efforts to make a bomb, and to undergo monitoring and verification.Iran’s parliament is preparing a bill clearing the way for a departure from the NPT.Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpPete HegsethNuclear weaponsIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Iranian state media reported three were executed on Tuesday in Urmia, near the Turkish border, and the Iranian-Kurdish rights group Hengaw said they were all Kurdish.Iran’sforeign and interior ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.One of the officials briefed on security said troops had been deployed to the borders of Pakistan, Iraq and Azerbaijan to stop infiltration by what the official called terrorists. The other official briefed on security acknowledged that hundreds had been arrested.Iran’s mostly Sunni Muslim Kurdish and Baluch minorities have long been a source of opposition to the Islamic Republic, chafing against rule from the Persian-speaking, Shi’ite government in Tehran.The three main Iranian Kurdish separatist factions based in Iraqi Kurdistan said some of their activists and fighters had been arrested and described widespread military and security movements by Iranian authorities.Ribaz Khalili from the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (KDPI) said Revolutionary Guards units had deployed in schools in Iran’s Kurdish provinces within three days of the beginning of Israel’s strikes, going house-to-house looking for suspects and arms.Israel, US and Iran all claim to have won the war, but who has really gained?Read moreThe Guards had taken protective measures too, evacuating an industrial zone near their barracks and closing major roads for their own use in bringing reinforcements to Kermanshah and Sanandaj, two major cities in the Kurdish region.A cadre from the Free Life Party of Kurdistan (PJAK), who gave her nom de guerre of Fatma Ahmed, said the party had counted more than 500 opposition members being detained in Kurdish provinces since the airstrikes began.Ahmed and an official from the Kurdish Komala party, who spoke on condition of anonymity, both described checkpoints being set up across Kurdish areas with physical searches of people as well as checks of their phones and documents.Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaKurdsMEK (People's Mujahedin of Iran)newsShareReuse this content"

The vote is a sign that Iran wants to harden its negotiating position on cooperation with the west in the wake of 12 days of attacks mounted byIsraeland the US, but supported by European governments only with varying degrees of enthusiasm.The decision to suspend cooperation with the IAEA is likely to be passed for final approval to the Guardian Council, a body empowered to vet legislation.The defiance is just one part of an internal debate insideIranabout the lessons to be learned from the past fortnight. Some analysts fear that the government’s relief at its survival, and absence of any grassroots revolt, will turn into a triumphalism that blinds its leaders to the country’s strategic weakness and the need to make concessions.Esmail Baghaei, a spokesperson for the Iranian foreign ministry, accepted that Iran’s nuclear facilities had beenseverely damaged, the first Iranian politician to make such an admission.No date has yet been set for a resumption of diplomatic talks between the US special envoy Steve Witkoff and the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, but Witkoff said contacts were being made and Donald Trump claimed there would be a meeting next week.The sixth round of their talks, due to have taken place on 15 June, were called off by Iran two days in advance when it came under what it regarded as a US-sponsored attack by Israel.A provisional internal US government assessment says the Iranian nuclear programme had been set back by only a few months, but Trump insisted it had been obliterated.The parliament’s move to suspend cooperation with the IAEA was passed with no opposing votes. Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the speaker of the parliament, said the IAEA had “not fulfilled its duties and become a political tool”. Resumption of cooperation would be dependent on a report from the Iranian Atomic Energy Authority and the national security and foreign policy committee. Guarantees would be needed about the safety of Iranian nuclear facilities.The national security committee recommended suspension of cooperation on Tuesday after it described the IAEA’s recent report criticising Iran’s lack of cooperation with the agency as false and the pretext for an attack on Iran. MPs shouted “down with the US and down with Israel” after passing the motion.Qalibaf said Iran’s civil nuclear programme would continue “at a rapid pace”, contradicting a claim by Trump that Iran “would not want to go near” another nuclear programme or domestic enrichment of uranium.The motion said activities such as “installing surveillance cameras, inspections and reporting to the agency will be halted unless the future security of Iran’s nuclear facilities is guaranteed”.The IAEA had criticised Iran in its latest report for lack of cooperation with the inspectorate, leading to a censure motion last month being passed by a majority of member states on the IAEA board. The censure motion sets in train a chain of events likely to lead to the restoration of UN sanctions this October.The parliament also heard calls for Rafael Grossi, the director general of the IAEA, to be sued for providing false reports and for his staff spying on nuclear facilities on behalf of the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency.Grossi said the international community could not accept Iran ending cooperation over its nuclear facilities. He admitted the IAEA could not know the location of Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium.The Kremlin attacked the lost credibility of the IAEA and said the Iranian decision was a cause for concern. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said the chances of reviving talks on a new nuclear deal had receded.Iran’s vice-president, Mohammad Reza Aref, said: “We will no longer allow bargaining over enrichment within our country’s territory because we have entered a new space and the enemy has also realised that it is not facing the same Iran as before.”Debate is already swirling over whether the government should take the next step and leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, a move that would signal Iran is intending to be free of the treaty’s constraints and like Israel will build a nuclear deterrent.Akbar A’lami, a former MP from Tabriz, said: “If our membership in the NPT cannot defend us against military attack or economic sanctions, and in practice becomes a tool of inspection and constant threat, what is the justification for remaining in it?”Iran has always insisted a nuclear bomb is unIslamic. It may be that Iran will try to remain in a state of ambiguity about its nuclear intentions in an attempt to ward off further attacks from Israel.The overall narrative in government circles is that Iran defiantly held out against the attacks of the US and Israel, prompting a new unity across Iranian society that the country’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has long wanted to nurture.But critics say this new consensus is born of anger with Israel, and not faith in the government. A crackdown on dissidents is under way, often under the guise of tracking down a network of Mossad agents.Centrist politicians are urging caution about claims of a historic victory. The former Iranian president Hassan Rouhani wrote: “We must be prepared not for warmongering but for a lasting and powerful peace, which comes at a cost and is achieved through rationality, deterrence and the pursuit of strategic depth in the hearts and minds of Iranians, not through baseless and reckless wishful thinking.”Experts are already discussing how Iran’s air defences were so exposed and Russia’s role in failing to supply Sukhoi-35 jets as contracted in 2023.Others claim arrivals of refugees, especially those from Afghanistan and the Kurdistan region of Iraq, have led to a weakening of the country’s security, which must be reviewed in the postwar reconstruction period.Explore more on these topicsIranInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)Iran's nuclear programmeIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It was, he said, “something that no one really thought possible. And they said: ‘You did it, sir, you did it’. Well, I don’t know if I did it … but I think I did.”Though the headline commitment is for Nato members to commit to increasing defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, it will consist of 3.5% in core military spending and the rest in infrastructure, intelligence, cybersecurity and other spending that allies can already match. It means a real-terms increase of about £30bn in the UK after 2027.Wednesday briefing: Why N​ato is rolling out the red carpet for Donald Trump at key summitRead moreTrump described this as “the Hague defence commitment”, saying it was “a monumental win for the United States, because we were carrying more than our fair share” and “a big win for Europe and for actually western civilisation” because Europe would now be “stepping up to take more responsibility”.The US president has long been a sharp critic of the low levels of defence spending by other Nato members, and at the 2018 summit hinted the US might quit the alliance. During his 2024 election campaign, Trump suggested the US might not defend a country being attacked if it were spending less than previously agreed targets.Those concerns sharpened after Trump’s election win, as Europe and Canada feared that he would reduce US engagement with Nato, shift closer to Russia, abandon Ukraine and rapidly move troops out of Europe. Though the White House is cooler on Europe and Ukraine than its predecessor, a sharp rift has been averted for now.Earlier on Wednesday, Rutte offered sycophantic praise of the US president in his presence, saying that “Daddy sometimes has to use strong language” – a reference to Trump’s foul-mouthed outburst about Iran andIsraela day before. Just before heading to The Hague, Trump had accused both countries of not knowing “what the fuck they’re doing” after reports of breaches by both of a ceasefire he had imposed.The Nato secretary general defended his tone towards Trump and denied it was demeaning, though he acknowledged it was “a bit of a question of taste”. Rutte said that Trump was “a good friend” and added: “Would you ever think that this would be the result of this summit if he would not have been re-elected president?”Asked about Rutte’s comments, Trump reacted positively: “He did it very affectionately. ‘Daddy, you’re my daddy.’”A day earlier, Trump had also released a series of flattering texts from Rutte. “You are flying into another big success,” said one, linking the Nato spending commitment with the bombing of the Iranian nuclear enrichment site at Fordow, showing him buttering up the president before the meeting.The significant concession on defence spending, with most Nato countries spending a little over 2% of GDP now, was “not about US taxpayers paying more”, Rutte said – with the US nearly in line with the 3.5% military spending target – but about “Europe and Canada paying more” to, in most cases, increase their defence budgets.Trump said he had a lunchtime meeting with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, “to see how he is doing” and said in response to a question from a Ukrainian journalist that he pledged to supply Kyiv with Patriot anti-missile interceptors, some of which had been sent to Israel.“We’re going to see if we can make some available,” Trump added, after asking the reporter where she and her family were living and sending his regards to her husband, a soldier. Later when he was asked if the US would restart military aid to Ukraine, stopped under his administration, he did not rule it out entirely. “We’ll see what happens,” the president said.LiveTrump shows concern for worried BBC Ukraine reporter during press conference – videoIn his account, Zelenskyy described the meeting as productive, and said his priority was “the purchase of American air defence systems to shield our cities, our people, churches, and infrastructure” and said that Ukraine was willing to buy the equipment and “support American weapons manufacturers”.However, in his closing press conference Trump continued to emphasise, with not much more than rhetoric, that “Vladimir Putin really has to end that war” and said he would try to speak to the Russian president again “to see if we can get it ended”.The short summit communique, just five paragraphs long, did not repeat previous commitments to Ukraine’s “irreversible path” to Nato membership, reflecting the White House’s position. Trump continues to hope to persuade Moscow and Kyiv to agree to a ceasefire to halt the war, which is now in its fourth year.Criticism was reserved for Spain, which said it believes it can meet its Nato commitments by spending only 2.1% of its GDP on defence. “I think it’s terrible,” Trump said, and he threatened to “make them pay twice as much” through trade sanctions, though this is an issue negotiated at EU level.Trump digressed and failed to answer a question about the US commitment to Nato’s article 5, which says that an attack on one alliance member is considered an attack on all. Flying out to the summit on Air Force One, Trump had said “There’s numerous definitions of article 5, you know that, right?” but he never elaborated.Explore more on these topicsNatoDonald TrumpUS foreign policyIranIsraelMark RutteMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It often requires hospital admission. Symptoms include severe pain in the abdomen, nausea and fever.Patient information leafletsfor GLP-1 medications list pancreatitis as an “uncommon” reaction, affecting around one in 100 patients. To date, the scheme has received nearly 400 reports of acute pancreatitis from patients who have used Mounjaro, Wegovy, Ozempic and liraglutide, with nearly half (181) involving tirzepatide (Mounjaro).NHS begins mass rollout of weight-loss jabs to patients in EnglandRead moreMore than one quarter of these cases have been reported in 2025. Since the beginning of the year, there have been 22 reports of acute pancreatitis after taking semaglutide (Ozempic and Wegovy), and 101 after taking tirzepatide (Mounjaro) to the Yellow Card scheme.An MHRA spokesperson said: “Alongside increased usage, we are seeing an upturn in the number of Yellow Card reports mentioning GLP-1 medicines and acute pancreatitis.”Due to the impact of this serious disease on patients, the MHRA said it wanted to understand whether there were any genetic factors at play. It has encouraged anyone hospitalised with acute pancreatitis suspected to be related to taking these drugs to report it to the Yellow Card scheme.Healthprofessionals are also urged to report to the scheme on behalf of their patients.The MHRA will then invite those patients to take part in theYellow Card Biobank study, run by Genomics England. Participants will be asked to provide further information, alongside a saliva sample, which will be analysed by scientists.Although there is no known genetic link that increases the risk of acute pancreatitis while taking GLP-1 medicines, the MHRA said: “Sometimes genes can influence the side-effects an individual experiences when taking a medicine, so in the context of the increasing usage of these medicines and the reports of acute pancreatitis we have received, we are exploring this further.”Studies have shown that adverse reactions to medication account for one in six hospital admissions.Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA’s chief safety officer, said: “Evidence shows that almost a third of side-effects to medicines could be prevented with the introduction of genetic testing. It is predicted that adverse drug reactions cost the NHS more than £2.2bn a year in hospital stays alone.”A spokesperson for Lilly, the maker of Mounjaro, said: “Patient safety is Lilly’s top priority.“We take reports regarding patient safety seriously and actively monitor, evaluate and report safety information for all our medicines. Adverse events should be reported under the MHRA’s Yellow Card scheme, but may be caused by other factors, including pre-existing conditions.“The Mounjaro (tirzepatide) patient information leaflet warns that inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis) is an uncommon side-effect (which may affect up to 1 in 100 people). It also advises patients to talk to their doctor or other healthcare professional before using Mounjaro if they have ever had pancreatitis.”Explore more on these topicsHealthDiabetesObesityDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

Billionaires pay “effective tax rates close to 0.3% of their wealth, well below what average workers contribute”, Oxfam said.The charity called on the UK to work with other governments to oppose “extreme inequality”, with private wealth growing eight times faster than the net wealth of governments between 1995 and 2023.Rachel Noble, a senior policy adviser at Oxfam, said: “This government is in danger of careering way off course on international development if it does not recommit to proven approaches to tackle poverty through public investment and fair taxation.“The government must fairly tax the trillions of pounds that are locked away in the bank accounts of the super-rich and prioritise the fight against inequality, gendered oppression and the climate crisis.”View image in fullscreenMinisters from Spain, Brazil, Germany and South Africa have called for a levy to counter the use of tax havens such as Monaco.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/AlamyLast year Spain, Brazil, Germany and South Africa signed a motion at the G20 fora minimum 2% taxon the super-rich to reduce inequality and raise public funds.

So we are very, very pleased.“The reason we got justice for Harry in the end was no thanks to the United Kingdom government; it was thanks to the British public and the media on both sides of the Atlantic, who spoke truth to power and made sure that we held them to account.”Last week, Northamptonshire police apologised for “clear and significant shortcomings” in its investigation into Dunn’s death after areviewfound the force “failed his family on a number of fronts”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsPoliceNorthamptonshireEnglandUK criminal justiceForeign policyHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

A number of cabinet ministers are now said to believe the bill has no chance of passing in its current form, though some are still being deployed to speak to angry MPs in an attempt to win them over.Keir Starmer is expected to begin speaking to MPs directly after returning from the Nato summit on Wednesday evening.The prime minister fuelled further anger within the party after he appeared to shrug off mounting Labour unrest over the proposed reforms, dismissing the backlash as “noises off” and insisting his party remains “pretty united” behind the need for change.Starmer is facing thebiggest revoltof his premiership over the welfare reform bill, which would make it harder for people to access Pip, the main disability benefit.Labour whips admitted privately they were having no success convincing MPs to withdraw their names from an amendment which would effectively kill the welfare bill next Tuesday.The rebellion is being led by select committee chairs including the Treasury select committee chair Meg Hillier and many previously loyalist Labour MPs concerned about the scale of the disability cuts.At least two more MPs were expected to sign the reasoned amendment overnight – making it at least 126 rebel Labour MPs by Thursday morning.Just one MP has withdrawn their name, despite significant pressure from whips and cabinet ministers. The chair of the environmental audit select committee Toby Perkins, a former shadow minister, is among the latest to sign the amendment.Both Starmer and the deputy prime minister,Angela Rayner, have insisted the vote will go ahead. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is understood to be particularly opposed to pulling the vote.Sources said there was a considerable difference of opinion within government. “There is a camp for pulling it, a camp for concession and a small but insane camp for ploughing on,” one said, suggesting Reeves was in the latter camp.Starmer is expected to begin speaking to MPs himself on Thursday when he returns from the Nato summit. But ministers and MPs have told the Guardian they do not believe the government has the option to press ahead with the bill in the face of such unrest.One frontbench source said: “I don’t believe there is a way to win this vote without offering a concession that can peel away a big chunk of those rebels.”Angela Rayner says welfare cuts vote will go ahead as Labour rebellion growsRead moreChief whip Alan Campbell has been telling MPs the government needs to “ameliorate” the situation. “That’s not going to be enough,” one rebel said.MPs have said they expect ministers and other frontbenchers to resign if no changes are made.One said: “The PM’s determination to push ahead has gone down like a cold cup of sick. The [frontbenchers] who were hoping that today [Wednesday] would see some kind of concession are now being put in a difficult position by him – and the whips know about some of them.”One senior government source said concessions would be presented to MPs by Friday at the latest, in order to give the PM time to consider them and then to give MPs time to reflect on them over the weekend.Speaking at the Nato summit in The Hague, Starmer rejected suggestions he lacked political instinct, pointing to Labour’s landslide election win as proof of his judgment.Asked if he had failed to read the mood of his MPs on welfare, he said critics had made similar predictions before and had been proved wrong.“I’m comfortable reading the room and delivering the change the country needs,” he said.“We’ve got a strong Labour government with a huge majority to deliver on our manifesto commitments. And that’s the work that we did over many years to win the election.“Now we start the work over many years to change the country. Having changed the party, we now change the country.“And is it tough going? Are there plenty of people and noises off? Yes, of course, there always are, there always have been, there always will be.

If they are joined by the Liberal Democrats, it further increases the likelihood of selection.But MPs say the intention of the amendment was to demonstrate the breadth of opposition to the bill – and that it should be taken as an indication of those prepared to vote against the government on the entire bill.It is so far unclear whether the Tories would abstain, as the government views their conditions for backing the bill as undeliverable. They have asked for an undertaking from Starmer that the bill will reduce the welfare budget, get people into work and not necessitate a rise in taxes.1:06PMQs: Rayner confirms welfare cuts vote will go ahead next week – videoAt his press conference, Starmer defended the proposals as necessary to build a “fairer and more efficient” system and said they were squarely in line with Labour’s manifesto mandate.He said Labour was the best party toreform welfare. “The argument I would make is that it is a Labour government that should reform welfare,” he said.“If the welfare system isn’t working for those that need it, and it is not, it’s a Labour government that should make it work for the future.“Just as it was a Labour government that created the welfare system, it falls to this Labour government to make sure we’ve got a welfare system that’s sustainable for the future to come.“We created the health service, and now we have to ensure that it’s fit for the future. Same with welfare.

As Secretary Kennedy has eloquently stated, opposing mercury in fish doesn’t make you anti-fish, and opposing mercury in vaccines doesn’t make you anti-vaccines,” Kulldorff continued, referring to one of the issues the panel would consider.View image in fullscreenDr Martin Kulldorff and Dr Mina Zadeh, the ACIP executive secretary at the panel in Atlanta, Georgia.Photograph: Megan Varner/ReutersKulldorff also quickly announced the formation of two new working groups, in addition to the 11 that already serve the panel. One would study the interaction of vaccines and the cumulative childhood vaccine schedule – issues that have for years been talking points of anti-vaccine advocates including Kennedy – and another to reevaluate vaccines that have not been looked at in more than seven years. The latter would provide the committee’s new members an opportunity to change recommendations for long-approved vaccines.The panel, the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), develops recommendations for how to administer vaccines to the American public.The ACIP meeting is high-stakes and will be widely watched within the scientific community, as former membersarguethat the nation’s vaccine approval, research and distribution systems are being dismantled.The panel’s decisions are highly influential in deciding which vaccines the CDC ultimately recommends for children and adults. In turn, those recommendations form the basis ofhow health insurersdecide which vaccines to cover, and thus have a direct impact on the price and availability of vaccines to the American public.Experts consider the current situationso direthat outside groups are attempting to develop a system to provide vaccines to Americans in spite of Kennedy’s attempts to disrupt the system.“What we’re seeing today, and if this were to continue, the medical public health professionals and the entire country are no longer going to trust ACIP,” said Dr Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on SchoolHealth. “That’s very clear.”US experts fear all vaccines at risk as Trump officials target mRNA jabsRead moreThe panel met in spite of lack of clarity about a seemingly fundamental issue: conflicts of interest. Kennedy fired the 17 previous members of the panel afterarguingthey had “been plagued with persistent conflicts of interest”.Before the presentations of the meeting started in earnest, the new members were asked to introduce themselves and verbally describe any conflicts of interest.It’s unclear whether the new members have had conflict of interest disclosures published in writing ahead of the meeting. The new members did not appear on the Trump administration-developed conflict of interest trackerspecifically for ACIP membersas of Wednesday morning.A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) told the Guardian that the new members had undergone ethics review but did not respond to inquiries about when and where these disclosures would be published. The spokesperson also said one of the eight Kennedy-appointed members had dropped out on Tuesday evening after a government financial review.A spokesperson told the Guardian last week: “Before they start their work on ACIP, the new members’ ethics agreements will be made public.”Somemembers did not address any conflicts of interest, seeming to focus only on their introduction. Others, like Kulldorff, did not disclose past involvement withlitigationagainst vaccine makers. Similarly, Dr Robert Malone did not appear to disclose his work in the litigation against theMerck vaccine.View image in fullscreenCody Meissner and Vicky Pebsworth speak remotely during the ACIP meeting.Photograph: Mike Stewart/APInstead, Malone said: “Any potential conflicts of interest have been analyzed and vetted and declared lacking both internally by HHS and specifically by CDC.”Vicky Pebsworth, a nurse who holds a doctorate degree and has worked for decades as the volunteer research director for one of the oldest high-profile anti-vaccine groups in the country, said she was “disclosing I hold stock to a healthcare sector fund including vaccine manufacturers; however, the amount of that stock holding is under the office of government ethics regulatory de minimus amount. I understand I therefore can fully participate in the ACIP meeting.”The agenda for the panel was also remade before the committee met. Previously, experts on the panel were scheduled to consider a recommendation for Covid-19 boosters.That vote was removed from the agenda – leaving experts to hear planned presentations on Covid-19, but not to vote – because the CDC was unable to hold a final working group call. It is unclear why the call was not held.CDC scientists explained how the Covid-19 “does remain a substantial burden among youngest and oldest age groups”. After the presentations, members of the ACIP asked whether the low uptake of the vaccine – that some had actively sown doubt about – should be considered a reason not to recommend it.“The fact [that uptake is] so low is a reflection of the lack of trust many parents have with the Covid vaccination recommendation that the ACIP has been giving,” said Kulldorff.In another exchange, Pebsworth suggested that the CDC should be looking at “animal studies” and “reproductive toxicity” in relation to Covid-19 vaccines, arguing that only “10% of adverse events are reported”.Dr Sarah Meyer, a researcher with the CDC’s immunization services division who presented on the topic, said the numbers referenced by Pebsworth were misleading because they included even the most minor “adverse events”, such as sore arms. “For serious reports, we are confident we get a majority of those reported” to surveillance systems such as the Vaccines Adverse Event Reporting System.Instead, members were scheduled to only vote on whether to recommend a second monoclonal antibody, called Clesrovimab, for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for all infants younger than eight months old born during respiratory virus season. The vote was postponed because the meeting ran late. The committee is scheduled to meet again on Thursday.Other advisers joining the meeting reflect the way that Kennedy has remade the federal health department. Representing the Food and Drug Administration wasTracy Beth Høeg, a sports medicine physician and epidemiologist who has called for more scrutiny of vaccines. One of the experts scheduled to present to the panel on Thursday is nurse Lyn Redwood, the ex-president of Kennedy’s anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, according toPolitico.Key Republican Dr Bill Cassidy, whose vote helped assure Kennedy’s confirmation to HHS, called for the meeting of the panel to be delayed, citing the new members’ “lack of experience” with vaccines and, in some cases, “preconceived bias against them”, according toSTAT News.Further, the panel’s new agenda cited a study that the cited author said he did not conduct or publish, according toReuters, continuing a pattern of Kennedy’s health department producing references togarbled or nonexistent studieseven as Kennedy repeatedly touts “gold-standard” science.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationRobert F Kennedy JrVaccines and immunisationUS healthcareHealthUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This year, as Donald Trump’s administration has sought to dramatically increase detention capacity as part of its crackdown on immigration, the company has received $10m in initial funding as part of a six-month contract,the Los Angeles Times reported.A new sign has been placed outside the facility and CoreCivic has listed two dozen jobs for the site on its website, including psychologists, nurses and maintenance workers.The development has fueled concerned among some southern California residents and advocacy groups. This week, people packed a city council meeting to voice their feelings in California City, a remote desert community of 14,000 people with historically high unemployment and poverty rates and limited economic opportunities. The issue was not on the agenda, but people traveled from as far as Los Angeles to express opposition.The Dolores Huerta Foundation shared a letter with the council urging the community to“make its voice heard and refuse to be complicit in a system built on incarceration, dehumanization, and profit from suffering”.“We urge you not to mistake short-term job offers for long-term economic health. California City deserves real investment – in housing, healthcare, education, and job training – not a facility that profits only when people are detained, dehumanized, and separated from their families,” said Camila Chávez, the executive director of the foundation.“ICE detention centers don’t exist in isolation. Every bed built becomes justification for more raids, more deportations, and more broken families. Expanding detention in California City directly fuels that harm.”Most people in attendance spoke in opposition to the project,KERO 23ABC reported, although John Fischer, a California City resident, argued that the site had been previously used as an Ice facility and significantly boosted the local economy.“What most people don’t know is the facility here started off as an Ice prison and it was very good for this town. It brought jobs to the economy. It brought other businesses into the economy,” he told the outlet. “Why do people support these criminal illegal aliens and allow them to remain here, costing us precious tax dollars?”The city’s mayor, Marquette Hawkins, has told media that he recently toured the facility and emphasized the city’s desire to have oversight.“From an economic standpoint, I’m told that it does have some benefits there,” he told theBakersfield Californian. “However, we understand that 40% of our residents are Latino. We want to make sure there is fairness, there. We talked about oversight and my office having the ability to do that.”Hawkins has encouraged people to continue sharing their perspectives on the facility at city council meetings.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaUS immigrationTrump administrationWest CoastUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Nearly a year later, seated in the vice-president’s residence on the grounds of the US naval observatory, Vance reflected on how significantly her life has changed in ways big and small. “People call you ma’am,” she said. “No one’s ever called me ma’am before this.”Until last summer, Vance, the daughter of immigrants and a one-time Democrat, worked as a lawyer at a progressive law firm, raising her three young children in Ohio. Now, as second lady, she is escorted by Secret Service and can’t leave a gym class without being recognized in Washington.During the nearly hour-long interview, Vance was not asked to weigh in on the political or policy agenda of theTrump administration– the president’s decision to strike Iran, the immigration raids that have roiled her native California or the crackdown on colleges and law firms.Instead, Vance spoke about how the second couple is working to create a sense of normalcy for their three young children, and how she hopes to use her role to “make things just a little bit better for other people”. She talked about missing Ohio, trying to keep her kids off screens, her husband’s love for baking, and losing “that sense of being anonymous in public”.Asked about being a first – Vance is the nation’s first south Asian and Hindu second lady – she said it has “not been something that people are hyper-focused on”.“Maybe we’ve just sort of moved beyond trying to count firsts of everything,” she said, while also noting that many people have told her “how proud they are and how excited they are for this”.“That does give me a little bit of a sense of purpose,” she said.At the end of the interview, McCain, a former host of The View and daughter of the late Republican senatorJohn McCain, raised what she called the “elephant in the room” and asked whether Vance had considered the prospect “that you could be our first lady in a few years”.“I’m not plotting out next steps or really trying for anything after this,” Vance said. “In a dream world, eventually, I’ll be able to live in my home and kind of continue my career and all those sorts of things. And if that happens in four years, I understand. If that happens at some other point in the future, I understand. [I’m] just sort of along for the ride and enjoying it while I can.”Vance so far refrained from choosing a single social cause or project to champion, as her predecessors have done, worried that the response would be to “attribute some kind of political motive or start to polarize around it”. Still, she offered a glimpse of the issues that she may want to focus on in her role. Her office is hosting the “Second Lady’s 2025 Summer Reading Challenge”, which she described as “the first of many small attempts” to encourage reading and help draw “children into the world of things and not of devices”.At one point in the conversation, McCain revealed that she was expecting a third child – a boy – and asked Vance to “share with me and women in America why having three kids is good”. Vance congratulated McCain warmly, and described how her children operated as a “pack”, playing together and taking care of each other. She assured McCain that the transition from two to three children was “shockingly, the easiest of all”.Explore more on these topicsJD VanceRepublicansUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The proposed $20m figure aligns with recent settlements between Trump and other major media companies.Disneypaid $15mto the Trump presidential foundation and another $1m for his lawyer fees to resolve a defamation case involving ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos in December, while Meta agreed to a$25m settlementover Trump’s social media account suspension following the 6 January riot at the Capitol.The legal pressure has contributed to mass upheaval at CBS News, with both longtime 60 Minutes producer Bill Owens and news division chief Wendy McMahon announcing their departures earlier this year amid tensions over the network’sresponse to the lawsuit.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpCBSKamala HarrisUS television industryTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

However, they did not say whether talks had previously taken place.Shell doesn’t need to bid for BPRead moreMarket commentators have in recent months speculated that Shell might use its record-high profits to buy BP, which has long been marked by analysts as a potential takeover target as its failed green energy plan, disappointing financial results and boardroom turmoil have sent its share price tumbling.The company has lost almost a third of its market value in the past year, and is now worth about £58bn, after a turnaround plan by its chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, failed to convince investors that it could recover from a botched attempt to become a net-zero energy company.The embattled oil company has already emerged as a target for the feared activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which amassed a stake in BP earlier this year to call for a major strategic overhaul to rescue its flailing market value.BP’s doomed green strategy was first put in place in early 2020 by the former chief executive Bernard Looney, whose promise to cut BP’s oil production by the end of the decade backfired when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 led to soaring global energy prices.Looney was forced to backtrack on the company’s green ambitions before he was ousted by the BP board for failing to disclose personal relationships with his staff.BP’s shareholders have since turned on the company’s chair, Helge Lund, who appointed Looney and oversaw the share price plunge. Lundannounced plans to step downfrom the company in April amid shareholder pressure.Auchincloss has since promised investors to cut more than £4bn from its low-carbon investment plans in favour of a return to growing fossil fuel production.The plan has angered green groups and has done little to appease BP’s investors. Auchincloss has also warned that his plan would include cutting thousands of jobs from BP’s global workforce,amounting to 5% of its staff.Shell’s chief executive, Wael Sawan, pledged to grow its oil and gas business leading to record profits during the global energy crisis as well as hefty shareholder payouts for investors and a market value of more than £150bn.Sawan wasforced to deny Shell’s rumoured plansto take over its smaller rival earlier this year, saying the company was more interested in buying back its own shares than buying another company.He told the Financial Times earlier this year: “We will always look at these things, but you are also looking to see what is the alternative. Right now, buying back Shell [shares] for us continues to be absolutely the right alternative to go for.”A Shell spokesperson said: “As we have said many times before we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification.”BP declined to comment on the reports of a takeover.Explore more on these topicsOilOil and gas companiesCommoditiesEnergy industryShellBPnewsShareReuse this content"

Ken Martin, the new DNC chair, and his allies told the Guardian that the party was focused on doing exactly that.Weingarten, president of the 1.8-million-member American Federation of Teachers, resigned after Martin did not renominate her to serve on the DNC’s important rules committee. In her resignation letter, Weingarten wrote that education, healthcare and public service workers were in “an existential battle” due to Donald Trump’s attacks and that she did not “want to be the one who keeps questioning why we are not enlarging our tent”.Saunders, the long-time president of the 1.3-million-member American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, also issued a critical statement. “These are new times. They deserve new strategies,” he said. “We must evolve to meet the urgency of the moment. This is not a time to close ranks or turn inward … It is our responsibility to open the gates [and] welcome others.”View image in fullscreenLee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, earlier this month.Photograph: Bryan Dozier/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty ImagesSeveral DNC officials asserted that the two departures were a “tempest in a teapot”, insisting that Martin is working to have the DNC welcome more people and battle against Trump. Weingarten and Saunders evidently felt sore that their candidate for DNC chair, Ben Wikler, the head of Wisconsin’s Democratic party, lost to Martin, the officials suggested.Steve Rosenthal, former political director of the AFL-CIO, the main US labor federation, said the resignations were an inarguable blow to the DNC.“When something like this becomes public, there’s clearly a spotlight on it,” he said. “Giving the longstanding leadership role that Randi and Lee have played in the Democratic party, and at a time when the party is trying to desperately improve its image with working-class voters and remake itself in a lot of ways, this is really unacceptable.”In an interview, Weingarten said she wished the DNC was conducting an all-out nationwide mobilization to defeat the Trump/GOP budget bill, which would throw an estimated 11 million Americans off health insurance, cut food stamps to millions of families and cause the federal debt to soar by over $3tn.DNC chair Martin told the Guardian that, under his leadership, the DNC was already doing what Weingarten and Saunders were calling for. “I’ve always called myself a pro-labor progressive,” Martin said, noting that he had been a union member and labor organizer. “My family grew up on programs that would be cut if Trump’s tax scam passes. Winning back the working class and stopping Trump from harming families is exactly where our focus is.”Martin added that in his nearly five months as DNC chair, the committee has held 130 town halls and launched an “aggressive war room” to take on Trump. “My first action as DNC chair was pledging to have strong labor voices at the table,” Martin said. “Our job is to win in 2025, 2026 and beyond.”But their resignation statements signal that Weingarten and Saunders have a very different view from Martin of what the DNC is doing on his watch. Several DNC officials said the pair might not be up to date with the DNC’s activities across the 50 states.Weingarten told the Guardian that Martin and the DNC are not showing nearly enough urgency in opposing the Trump/GOP budget bill. “The number one issue in the next two weeks is: how do we help fight the GOP budget bill that faces almost two-to-one public opposition,” she said, adding that the DNC should be going all out to help House and SenateDemocratstorpedo the bill.“We can be the voice and be out there with stories about how the budget bill will hurt, and the DNC is a perfect place for doing that,” Weingarten said. “You got to win hearts and minds now, not in October 2026. That’s the kind of thing that we’ve been looking for since January. We have to be a party that wins on the ground.”Artie Blanco, a union activist and DNC vice-chair, said that under Martin, the DNC had been fighting hard against the budget bill.“There are over 16,000 Democratic volunteers making phone calls across the country in targeted congressional districts about the GOP budget, and how it will be devastating to working people,” Blanco said.Weingarten voiced dismay about not being renominated for the rules committee. “It was definitely a sign that my input was not sought any more and [not] appreciated,” she said, stressing that the AFT “will continue to be a leader in electing pro-public education, pro-working family candidates” and planned to be “especially engaged” in the 2025-26 elections.Jane Kleeb, president of the Association of State Democratic Committees, said that Weingarten’s and Saunders’s “claims that Ken and the DNC are not standing up for working people and not standing on the side of unions and union members is laughable”.“Ken has been on the front line to bring unions back to our party,” added Kleeb, who is also chair of the Nebraska Democratic party. “He has appointed more union leaders than any other [DNC] chair” – and put unions at the forefront while chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor party, before he assumed the DNC’s helm, she said.Stuart Appelbaum, the DNC’s labor chair, and president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, took issue with the statements Weingarten and Saunders made about Martin.“I am thrilled that Ken Martin is prioritizing the importance of having labor at the table and has ensured that there is strong labor representation in every part of the DNC,” Appelbaum said. He added that Martin “understands that working people are the backbone of the party”.Michael Podhorzer, a political strategist and former AFL-CIO political director, said the Democratic party has for decades not focused enough on working-class voters. He said Democrats would have a tough battle winning back blue-collar voters. “The experience of many American working people is they feel left off the radar,” Podhorzer said.Democrats, Podhorzer noted, have suffered the greatest loss of support in communities that were “gutted” after the 2008-09 recession; from the signing of Nafta, a trade deal with Canada and Mexico; and from normalized trade relations with China. Nafta and normalized trade with China were ratified under President Clinton, a Democrat.Arlie Russell Hochschild, a sociologist who has studied Trump’s success in wooing working-class voters, said the decline of US labor unions over the past 50 years has necessarily meant that unions have less sway in the Democratic party.Rosenthal, the former AFL-CIO official and also a former DNC deputy political director, called on the DNC and Democrats to work far more closely with unions.“Among working-class voters, support for unions is through the roof, and the Democratic party and the Republican party have no credibility with working-class voters,” he said. “They don’t trust the parties, but they trust the labor movement. It’s incumbent on the party to build bridges and put the labor movement front and center in everything it does.”“From that standpoint,” he continued, the tension that led to Weingarten and Sauders quitting “is mind-boggling”. Several labor leaders said Martin should have done more to keep prominent and powerful union leaders like Weingarten and Saunders satisfied and on the DNC, even if they backed one of his opponents for DNC chair.Responding to Weingarten and Saunders’ concerns, Martin said: “The DNC and our partners are leading the fight against Trump’s budget bill, investing unprecedented dollars into states so Democrats can win elections from the ground up, and reaching out to voters in working-class districts.”Martin told the Guardian that he’s trying hard to build bridges with the broader labor movement, and increase its role in the DNC and in the Democrats’ efforts. “Winning back the working class and stopping Trump’s budget bill isn’t a political goal, it’s personal,” he said. “Labor runs through my family’s veins.”Explore more on these topicsUS unionsDemocratsUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its stock has tumbled since the firm went public in 2021.Founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, who stepped down as CEO in 2024 but returned earlier this year, said Bumble needed to take “decisive action” in order “to restructure to build a company that’s resilient, intentional, and ready for the next decade” in an email to staff.“We’ve reset our strategy, and are going back to a start-up mentality – rooted in an ownership mindset and team structures designed for faster, more meaningful execution,” she wrote.Shares in Bumble rallied some 24% during early trading in New York on Wednesday.Dating apps face a reckoning as users log off: ‘There’s no actual human connection’Read moreBumble said it will incur non-recurring charges of between $13m and $18m for employee severance, benefits and related charges, primarily during the third and fourth quarters of 2025.The company expects to generate “up to” $40m in annual cost savings, which it plans to reinvest in initiatives such as product and technology development, according to a stock market filing.The company also raised its second-quarter revenue forecast to a range of $244m to $249m, up from the prior view of $235m to $243m.“In recent months, we’ve been rebuilding – returning to what makes us trusted, unique, and deeply human,” wrote Herd. “But intentional rebuilding requires hard decisions. Today, we are marking one of the most difficult: we are reducing the size of our team. This decision is not a reflection of any individual but rather where we are going as a company and what we are building for.”Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsBusinessOnline datingAppsnewsShareReuse this content"

They wore military fatigues at the swearing-in ceremony but will not be full-time soldiers.The recruitment is a sign of the increasing importance of technology in modern warfare and growing commercial and research links between some of the largest tech firms and the military. The US army said it was “just the start of a bigger mission to inspire more tech pros to serve without leaving their careers”.In an interview withPirate Wires, Bosworth said he was joining in a personal capacity, but that some people at Meta had “reservations” about the move. He said he was approached to join by Sankar.“I don’t think I waited 10 minutes,” Bosworth said. “I was like, ‘Yes, I would love to, it’d be the great honor of my life to do this.’”Meta recently began apartnershipwith the defence technology company Anduril to develop augmented reality devices, such as headsets, for battlefield use, but Bosworth said his recruitment was separate from that project.Even before he was sworn in, Bosworth said he and the three other tech executives had visited Fort Irwin in California to observe what theUS militarycalls “next generation command and control”.“We reviewed a large number of new technology initiatives they’re developing, which I can’t talk more about,” he said. “Then we got in a helicopter and flew into what they call ‘the box’, which is where army battalions do training exercises. And they had a training exercise going where these battalions were using some of the next gen technology they’d been developing at the Army Futures Command … There’s tanks driving by, going through a field that has anti-tank impediments set up, and they figure out: how can they use new tools to overcome those? And like, instead of firing missiles or rockets, what if these things fire drones?”He said that on the drive back from the “box” the army chief of staff’s chief technology officer, Dr Alex Miller, gave them “a lot of intelligence on what the army’s trying to do, what has and hasn’t been effective, and how he sees things going forward. At that point, even though none of us had been commissioned yet – we were still just private citizens who had been invited to observe the exercises.”Asked about the types of projects they might work on, Bosworth said: “Some of those problems, the ones journalists like to write about, are around lethality and survival, but some of them are just logistical problems.”Sankar, meanwhile, said technologists were “rediscovering Silicon Valley’s roots in national defense during the second world war and cold war”.“Wars in Europe and the Middle East and, above all, the threat of a war in the Pacific have focused the national mind and initiated a scramble for mobilization,” hesaidearlier this month. “Exploding pagers and long-distance drone strikes from shipping containers prove that technology has once again changed the battlefield. Our military has to change with it.”Meta was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS militarySilicon ValleyArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingMetaOpenAIPalantirnewsShareReuse this content"

In apress release at the time, the Department of Justice emphasized that the convictions were part of a strategy to defeat the opioid crisis.But the plea agreement did not include restitution for opioid victims, reasoning that it would not be “administratively feasible” to distribute the funds. Since then, opioid victims have been unable to seek settlements from Purdue, as the company’s 2019 bankruptcy filing stayed civil lawsuits against the company, and will likely instead be settled in bankruptcy court as part of the reorganization plan.Proposed Republican cuts could undo opioid epidemic progress in AppalachiaRead moreCreighton Bloyd – a plaintiff in aclass-action suitagainst Purdue demanding the company pay for prescription opioid victims’ recovery treatment – objected to the disclosure statement in the bankruptcy court this month.In his objection, he alleged that the disclosure statement omitted relevant information about US government plans to seize $225m that could instead go to prescription opioid victims under theMandatory Victims Restitution Act(MVRA), which requires prosecutors to financially compensate victims of criminal cases.Purdue agreed to forfeit $2bn for the value of “misbranded” drugs that may have led patients to become addicted. Bloyd argued that $225m of that should go to opioid victims under the MVRA, because a federal attorney acknowledged these misbranded drugs harmed individuals.Instead, the New Jersey plea deal gives that money to the Department of Justice, citing administrative hurdles to distributing the funds as restitution. Information about the MVRA and the possibility of using the $225m as restitution is not included in the bankruptcy disclosure statement.Val Early III, an attorney representing personal injury claimants in the bankruptcy case, said the disclosure statement was a “frustrating” read, because “a lot of it was in brackets in the body of the document. Brackets, meaning ‘to be determined’, right?”Despite the omission in the disclosure statement, a New York bankruptcy judge approved it on Friday, and set a September deadline for creditors, including personal injury claimants, to vote to approve or reject the plan.“If you’re asking me to vote on something, and you don’t even know what you’re asking me to vote on, then how can I possibly vote on it?” Early said.Adam Zimmerman, a law professor at the University of Southern California, said it was unlikely that a judge would find the MVRA applies in this case, because there are “a variety of exceptions” to the law, including for cases that are large or complex.“We might call [Purdue’s case] a ‘mega mass tort’, because of the size and scope of the problem it’s trying to address here,” Zimmerman explained, adding: “We’re not dealing with a product that just affected a small group of people … We have not just private parties suing, but we have cities suing, Native American tribes suing. We have counties suing. We have states suing. We even have foreign countries that are suing.”Zimmerman added that “bankruptcy is a really powerful tool for defendants [such as Purdue]” because it allows them to reach what’s called a global settlement with all the parties all at once, rather than litigating every claim separately in court. This also means that plaintiffs have fewer opportunities to negotiate individual settlements.Frank Ozment, another lawyer representing personal injury claimants, disagrees that the case is too complex for the MVRA to apply. He says that, since all personal injury claimants had to file claims in the bankruptcy court by a specific deadline along with their names and addresses, it should be relatively simple to identify victims and compensate them.Ozment also rejects the argument that it would be too administratively difficult to ensure prescription opioid victims use payouts for treatment and nothing else. He says the money could be distributed via reloadable payment cards, which allow victims and no one else to purchase medication and nothing else from a pharmacy located in the victim’s zip code, similar to how people receive certain Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) payouts.Purdue Pharma and the Department of Justice did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.Explore more on these topicsOpioids crisisPharmaceuticals industryLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Dynamic pricing is an iteration of Uber’s “surge pricing” that increased fares during periods of peak demand.The Columbia paper, which focused on24,532 trips made by a single US Uber driver, concluded that the introduction of the new algorithm had allowed Uber to “significantly increase its take rate – the per cent of rider fares net of driver pay captured by the company – from about 32% at the start of upfront pricing to upwards of 42% by the end of 2024”.Last week’s University of Oxford research found that, since the launch of dynamic pricing, Uber’s median take rate per UK driver had “increased from 25% to 29%, and on some trips … is over 50%”.The pair of papers add to the series of controversies that have plagued the technology company over the years. They include a2021 UK supreme court rulingthat Uber drivers are entitled to the minimum wage and paid holidays, as well as the 2022 release ofthe Uber files, a global investigation that revealed how the company duped police and regulators, and secretly lobbied governments across the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Upfront pricing gives riders clarity before they book and allows drivers to make informed decisions based on full visibility into pay, distance, and expected duration.“Our dynamic pricing algorithms help balance real-time supply and demand to improve reliability across the platform. Upfront prices are not personalised – our pricing algorithms do not use information about an individual rider or driver’s personal characteristics.

Our stations are very busy, and we advise you to cancel or postpone your trip.”Eurostar advised all passengers on Wednesday to either change their journey or cancel it and request a free exchange or refund.But by the afternoon, the company said “full repairs are now completed” and trains had resumed.The situation caused chaos for travellers at London St Pancras station.Ed and Paul, 41 and 37, work in renewable energy and were due to travel to Paris for a meeting. “It has been a nightmare. It’s been pretty shocking,” said Ed.“The app basically said: ‘Your journey is being disrupted’, but they didn’t say: ‘Your train is definitely cancelled’, so it’s been quite confusing and we’re wondering if we will still get our money back.”A couple in their 70s from Coventry who had their holiday plans disrupted said: “We had our train cancelled this morning and we’ve been waiting most of the day for Eurostar to make alternative arrangements.” The couple intended to instead take a flight to Spain from Gatwick.By 4pm calm had been restored to St Pancras with just a 35-minute delay to a train to Brussels.Police have launched an investigation, with forensic teams on the scene outside Lille that has disrupted dozens of high-speed services.Dutch authorities were also investigating disruption in the Netherlands on Tuesday after a power outage on around 30 rail cables affected trains from Schiphol airport, about 50km away from the Nato summit in The Hague.The justice minister of the Netherlands, David van Weel, said the damage could have been an attempt to sabotage the two-day meeting of Nato leaders. “The question is who is behind it. It can be an activist group, it can be a country,” he said.The French regional train network TER Hauts deFrancesaid 15 cable installers and specialists had been mobilised to repair the line at Lille Europe.The company said the theft occurred along the track bordering Mont-de-Terre station, between Lille and Lezennes, on signal cables laid in gutters on the ground.It said agents from the French national rail company, SNCF, were carrying out repairs by bringing in new cables. “As is always the case in this type of operation, the task involves connecting, one by one, around 15 wires making up each cable. This is meticulous work,” it said.The delays follow disruption on Tuesday after two people died in separate incidents on the line between Lille and Paris, causing the line to be shut for most of the day.In May, Spain’s transport minister said the country’srail network had suffered “an act of serious sabotage”after vital signalling cable was stolen over a busy bank holiday weekend, bringing severe delays to high-speed services between Madrid and Seville that affected more than 10,000 people.Explore more on these topicsEurostarFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Then, after listening to the hit from Zootropolis, she will try to chase down the impossible.The 31-year-old from Kenya is already a three-time Olympic champion, the world mile record holder, and arguably the greatest female middle-distance runner in history. And now she intends a spectacular encore, by becoming the first woman to crash throughthe four-minute mile barrier.Gout Gout breaks his own 200m national record in latest stunning runRead moreEvery scientific instinct suggests it won’t happen – at least not yet. Kipyegon’s world record for the mile is 4min 7.64sec, which means she will have to find nearly eight seconds. In a sport decided by fractions, that is a chasm.Yet Faith certainly has faith that she can emulate Sir Roger Bannister, who was the first man to achieve the feat in 1954. “You can’t limit yourself,” she says. “You have to dream, to go for that risk and just believe in yourself in everything you do. We all have the same dreams. And what a man can do, a woman can do.”They are powerful words. But biology may deliver a blunt reality check. As the top track and field coach Steve Magness points out, to be capable of a sub-four mile an athlete needs to be capable of running the 800m in about 1min 53sec – four seconds quicker than Kipyegon has ever gone.While she will be armedwith several new pieces of kit, including a special aerodynamic skinsuit with “3D-printed aeronodes”, which draws on similar technology used by British Cycling and British Skeleton when they dominated the Summer and Winter Olympics, it is unlikely to make a substantial difference.One scientist involved in the British Cycling skinsuits told the Guardian they were never used by Team GB in track and field because the benefits did not translate. “I expect the suit to have negligible effect. At world-class level, we’d expect a 10% reduction in drag to have around a nine times greater performance advantage for cycling compared to running.”So what else is there? Well, Kipyegon has new super spikes, whichNikesays are lighter and more propulsive than ever before. Even so, they are unlikely to be worth more than a second over a mile.View image in fullscreenKipyegon will have to bridge a huge gulf to reach her goal.Photograph: Remo Casilli/ReutersThat brings us to drafting. When Kipyegon runs she will have a team of pacers surrounding her to block out the wind and make her run faster. But how much faster? According to the scientist, it is hard to see anything more than a two- to three-second improvement from “perfect” drafting in real-world conditions. That would still leave Kipyegon several seconds short of her dream.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That, acknowledges Tucker, would still not be enough, but he wonders whether Nike might yet have another trick up its sleeve. Perhaps. Or maybe the reality is more prosaic. There is no magic bullet, yet, to get Kipyegon all the way to 3min 59sec.Certainly Nike is not making the sort of bullish noises it did when it fundedEliud Kipchoge’s first attemptat a sub-two hour marathon distance in 2017. Back then, Nike also gave detailed specifics when it came to the improvement from its super shoes. This time around its experts have been far more vague.Still, a question remains. Would Nike really be doing this if Kipyegon didn’t have a shot at the impossible – even if it won’t count as a world record under WorldAthleticsrules as it is not an official race? It all makes for a highly intriguing four minutes. So what is it? Nike PR stunt or groundbreaking moment for women?

But, even in retirement, he is discovering new tricks. For more than an hour he has little kids from West Byfleet junior school transfixed as he coaches them through the joys of mini-tennis. There are swings and wild misses, gentle advice and high fives. In fact Murray is so locked in, he even makes his familiar power-exhale noise while he gently lifts the ball over a tiny net.In short, he is a natural – even if he doesn’t quite see it that way himself. “I think they were just buzzing to get a few hours out of the classroom to be honest,” he says, typically self-effacing, as he chats during a quick break. “But it’s great. I love seeing kids on a tennis court having fun.”That includes his four children. Although he indicates that none of them have the desire or talent to be the next Andy Murray.Andy Murray hopeful Wimbledon statue will not repeat Shanghai’s terracotta gaffeRead more“They’re not good tennis players,” he says, smiling. “But my eldest daughter had her first school match yesterday. I hit a couple of balls with her in the morning. She was saying to me, ‘oh, I’m terrible’ and she was laughing about it. But she actually went undefeated. She and her partner won their matches. We were a bit surprised at her level being that high. So they all hit a little bit, but not a whole lot.”Murray is in West Byfleet to promote an LTA and government initiative that has led to more than 3,000 dilapidated park tennis courts being brought back to life in three years. It is something that clearly matters deeply to him.“When I was growing up, a lot of the park courts around where we lived were almost unusable with broken nets and weeds growing out the ground,” he says. “So to have 3,000 more courts just gives more people an opportunity to play. If you want more players at the top, this is where it starts.”With that, Murray’s thoughts inevitably turn to Wimbledon. Although he admits that now his playing days are behind him, and hiscoaching stint with Novak Djokovic has ended, it will take something special to lure him back to the All England Club this year.View image in fullscreenAndy Murray says he won’t be giving public advice to Jack Draper with Wimbledon about to start.Photograph: Christopher Lee/Getty Images for LTA“I don’t have any plans to go,” he says. “I’m not working there. I don’t go to watch tennis as a fan. But if one of my kids wanted to go along and watch, I obviously would take them. Or if a British player made the final I would go. I went to theDjokovic v Alcaraz finala couple of years ago, just because I had a feeling it was going to be a great match. But I won’t be there otherwise.”Given Jack Draper’s form, Murray may have to change his mind and he is clearly impressed with the 23-year-old’s development.“I’m not surprised that he’s up there,” he says. “I trained with him quite a bit when he was younger, and he’s very good. He has a brilliant game. He’s a big guy, lefty, with a big forehand and a really consistent backhand. He also moves really well for a big guy.“He just had lots of niggles and various injury issues. But this year he’s been fit for the majority of the season and his ranking is where it should be and where it deserves to be.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And sometimes that advice is contrary to what your coach is telling you. But I would obviously speak to him and his coach privately.”However, Murray is optimistic about the state of British tennis, with Jacob Fearnley also coming through and three women – Emma Raducanu, Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal – all in the world’s top 50.“We’re going well at the moment,” he says. “Jack’s done very well. Emma’s a grand slam champion. Sonay’s had a brilliant year. And what Jacob has done in the last year is not quite unprecedented, but it’s very impressive. To come out of college and be around the top 50 is great to see.”View image in fullscreenAndy Murray (left) embraces Jack Draper after the pair played at Indian Wells in 2023.Photograph: Ella Ling/ShutterstockFor now, though, Murray admits he is likely to spend more time working on his golf game than watching tennis. Especially now his handicap, which was seven last year, has come down.“It’s not seven any more,” he says. “I’m two now. I was a bit better than that, but recently I’ve been struggling. So yeah, my handicap is going in the wrong direction.”But didn’t he nearly win his club championship recently? “I don’t know about nearly won,” he shoots back. “I was one shot behind the leader on the middle of the 13th fairway on the second and final day. But I didn’t manage to get it done.”When it comes to ex-players Murray reckons that Tim Henman, who is off scratch, is the one to beat. “I played with him on Monday,” he says. “Wimbledon had a golf day with some of the players. He played, along with Alcaraz, De Minaur and Lleyton Hewitt. We were in different groups but Tim played very well. He’s really, really good.” Before he leaves, Murray wants to get a final message across: that he is backing the LTA’s call for more government funding to provide 40 covered tennis, padel and multisport facilities, especially in areas of highest social deprivation.“It is essential in this country for the winter months,” he says. “Because the weather is not great, particularly up north. It’s tough. It’s not easy to go out and want to run around when it’s freezing cold and raining. So more covered courts will make a big difference.”It is a message that is soaked in Murray’s upbringing in Scotland. But, as you watch him high five another excited child, you realise it comes from the heart too.Explore more on these topicsAndy MurrayWimbledonTennisinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Even if it may not give any one team an advantage, it puts players, fans and officials at riskBeau DureWed 25 Jun 2025 05.30 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 05.31 EDTShareIn the 31 years since the United States last hosted the men’sWorld Cup, a few things remain unchanged.Recent politics notwithstanding, the US population is diverse and air travel is relatively easy, so international games tend to attract supporters no matter where they live. As long as ticket prices are reasonable, a good crowd is a good bet.Also – it still gets really hot in the summer. This, of course, is not news. It was a major subplot of the 1994 World Cup, it will be a major subplot of the 2026 edition – which the US will co-host with Canada and Mexico as the climate crisis makes heatwaves more likely – and it’s amajor subplot of the Club World Cup this summer.Chelsea training cut short due to ‘impossible’ heat in PhiladelphiaRead moreThe 19th-century Englishmen who wrote the first official Laws of the Game probably didn’t anticipate the brutal heat that players often have to endure in a US summer, but everyone else should. Some rules of basic mathematics and climate are incontrovertible. A southern US venue plus a midday start time equals 22 players broiling in the sun, and it’s odd that Fifa, in charge of theClub World Cupand next year’s World Cup, does not appear to have foreseen that playing in blistering heat isn’t much fun.So who benefits from this scheduling and heat? And who appears to worry about it the most? The answer to both questions: Europe.Games aren’t starting at noon and 3pm local time on weekdays for the benefit of fans in the US. Those games land neatly in the evening for European viewers. Yes, Fifa could schedule more games to start at 9pm local time when temperatures are much cooler, but that’s well past midnight in Europe, which makes fans, broadcasters and sponsors less happy.But Europeanteamsaren’t quite as happy about those earlier kick-offs. Consider Chelsea, whocut short their training sessionin the run-up to their game against Espérance. They’re not the first European squad to come to the east coast and notice, in the words of Jimmy Buffett, changes in latitude and changes in attitude. Philadelphia is 10 degrees closer to the equator than London – and Philly is one of the more northerly venues in this summer’s Club World Cup. It is, in the organizers’ defense, not usuallythishot in Philadelphia or New York, and the one hot game in Pasadena was an aberration.Still, temperatures in the mid-30sC/mid-90sF are hardly unusual in Orlando or Charlotte. (Nor are they unusual in Atlanta, but teams assigned to play there are breathing comfortably in the air conditioning under the dome of Mercedes-Benz Stadium.) And even with cool Seattle in the mix, the median temperature through Monday’s games was 81F (27C), with a median heat index of 87F (31C) and the dewpoint at a muggy 68F.This suggests European teams will have a problem with temperatures this summer and at next year’s World Cup; that Chelsea were at a disadvantage against the Tunisian champions even before they kicked off. And that’s the reason why teams from Brazil, where the state leagues play in the southern hemisphere’s summer,have impressed so farin this tournament. Perhaps that could be a function of the long-held stereotype that Latin America plays possession football to conserve energy in the heat while Europeans run around like maniacs, afraid that they’ll freeze if they stand still too long.View image in fullscreenBotafogo are among the Brazilian clubs who have thrived at the Club World Cup.Photograph: Ryan Sun/APBut the limited data from major tournaments in the US doesn’t support the notion that European teams are doomed to wilt in a North American summer.Seven of the eight quarter-finalists at USA 1994 were from Europe. Sweden helped themselves to a 3-1 win at high noon in Dallas against Saudi Arabia, a team, one would presume, who would cope a little better in the heat. Romania and Switzerland advanced from group play at the expense of a heralded side from Colombia. In all, 10 of the 13 European teams advanced to the knockout stage in 1994, while only two of the four South American teams made it out of the group stage. Concacaf, featuring the host USA and nearest neighbor Mexico, advanced both of its teams. Asia and Africa combined to have two of their five teams advance.That performance by Europe’s best was an improvement from four years earlier on their home continent. In Italy, all four South American sides reached the knockout stage, along with Costa Rica and Cameroon. Eventual finalists Argentina were the only South American team in the quarter-finals, but Cameroon joined them. In group play, Scotland and Sweden found themselves eliminated by Brazil (expectedly) and Costa Rica (unexpectedly).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And we have very little to go on for club games, aside from the pre-season friendlies in which European clubs sleepwalk their way through steamy matches that rake in money from US fans drawn to the stadiums by celebrity and cosplay.This Club World Cup has seen a handful of notable upsets, but they don’t seem attributable to the weather. Inter Miami beat Porto indoors in Atlanta. Botafogo stunned Paris Saint-Germain on a mild night in Pasadena, also the site of the Mexican side Monterrey’s draw against Italy’s Inter. Auckland City drew with Boca Juniors, but, if anything, it’s the Argentinians who are more used to the heat.That leaves us with Chelsea, who lost to the Brazilian side Flamengo in warm Philadelphia. But is that a function of the weather, Flamengo being better than was first thought, or Chelsea not giving this tournament the same sense of urgency as their opponents?The heat also isn’t hindering attendance, or teams’ offensive power. PSG’s four-goal outburst took place in the best-attended match, with more than 80,000 fans nearly filling the Rose Bowl in the one unusually hot Pasadena game. More than 70,000 fans gathered in Charlotte to see Real Madrid dispatch Pachuca 3-1 despite a temperature in the mid-90s fahrenheit. Plotting all of the games’ scores, attendance figures and reported temperatures shows little to no correlation – if anything, attendance and scoring have gone slightlyupas the temperature rises. It appears people turn up to watch good matches, and stay away from bad matches, no matter what the temperature.But it would be stupid to deny playing in extreme heat can be dangerous. At last year’s Copa América, hosted by the US, an assistant refereecollapsed during a matchplayed in suffocating heat in Kansas City. Heat also limits players’ ability to play full-throttle football. One vivid example was the 2008 Olympic men’s soccer final, played at midday in the cauldron of Beijing’s Bird’s Nest so that thestadium would be cleared in timefor the evening’s track and field events. Temperatures in the heat-trapping venue soared well above 100F (38C), and players were granted hydration breaks, common today but novel at the time. The lone goal was assisted by one Lionel Messi, playing alongside his current Inter Miami manager, Javier Mascherano, which perhaps bodes well for Inter’s chances in the knockout rounds. The scorer was Ángel Di María, who got another game with a heat index in the mid-100s on Tuesday in Charlotte with Benfica.At some point, southern heat overcomes southern hospitality, and organizers can surely do better with scheduling. Why play a game at 3pm local time in Charlotte? Surely Fifa can work with US organizers at next year’s World Cup to make sure that afternoon games are played in cities such as Seattle, San Francisco or Vancouver (although the climate crisis means even those cities endure their share of sweltering days).And yet, after Benfica took a shock 1-0 lead against Bayern in the blistering heat Tuesday in Charlotte, both teams could be seen pressing far into the opposition half. Today’s elite players can, mostly, endure harsh conditions. But that doesn’t mean Fifa should keep requiring them to do so when alternative schedules exist.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupWorld Cup 2026US sportsWorld CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, the Arsenal full-back Laura Wienroither – who can also play on both sides – has been linked with a move away following her loan spell at Manchester City in the second half of last season.Hinds received widespread praise and support in March after she spoke up about being subjected to “sexually inappropriate comments” from a spectatorduring Liverpool’s Women’s FA Cup win at Arsenal. The incident occurred while Hinds was receiving treatment on the pitch and a member of the crowd was removed from the stadium by stewards. Both clubs offered her their “full support”, while Hinds said at the time: “Together we can continue to make our sport better both now and for the years to come.”Meanwhile, Liverpool are understood to be getting closer to appointing a new manager, having been without a long-term replacement for Matt Beard since his departure in February.Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenLiverpool FC WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Dave Winter/Icon Sport/Getty ImagesIn the first of our exclusive Euro 2025 interviews, the midfielder talks about France’sbelief and being a role modelByAnna CarreauWed 25 Jun 2025 14.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 14.59 EDTShareGrace Geyoro has suddenly become one of the most experienced players in France’s squad for the Euros. Last month the head coach, Laurent Bonadei, made the controversial decision to drop the captain Wendie Renard, the vice-captain Eugénie Le Sommer, who also happens to be the most capped female player in France of all time, as well as Kenza Dali. Geyoro was left standing and the Paris St-Germain midfielder is going into her sixth major tournament with the national team and has a clear objective: “To win.”As we sit down for an exclusive interview in Nancy as the Euro preparations get underway she says she is optimistic about France’s chances in Switzerland. “We have a great team, we have young players, we have more experienced players,” says the 27-year-old, who has 98 caps and 19 goals for her country. “We score goals, we win important matches. We have players who have won titles this season, in England for example.”France drop Renard, Le Sommer and Dali in shock cull before Women’s EurosRead moreGeyoro describes the France team as very technical, very powerful and very fast, saying: “There are a lot of strikers who are able to play. Our weak points are that we may have less experience because we have not won any titles [at international level]. In difficult times we have to be able to be better because we have had disappointments.”Disappointment is an understatement. France go into most Euros and World Cups among the favourites, but have never reached a final, even falling short at last year’s home Olympics. At the last Euros, in England,they lost 2-1 to Germany in the semi-finals.“Since we prepare competitions one year, two years in advance, when you arrive in the competition and you get eliminated quickly, it has an impact on the mind,” she says. “It can be exhausting at some point, especially when you see the team you have.”Bonadei prefers to see France as outsiders, reminding his players that they will face the past two winners, England and the Netherlands, in the group stage, along with Wales. “I know that he believes in us more than anyone else,” Geyoro says. “He pushes us and knows we are capable of going over mountains. I would say we remain part of the favourites. I know the talents we have, I train with these girls. Honestly, we have nothing to envy in other nations.”View image in fullscreenGrace Geyoro says she did not have a female role model when she was growing up.Photograph: Zoe JeulinBut Geyoro must be fearfulof facing England, the holders? “No, no, no,” she says. “At PSG, Mary Earps told us about the talents the English team has. And we see their championship [the Women’s Super League], they [Arsenal] won the Champions League… we know it is a very great nation and we are prepared for that. But we must look them straight in the eyes so that we do not lower our heads.“I might prefer to play badly and win than to play very well and lose at the last-eight stage,” Geyoro goes on to say and she believes the squad shares the same mantra. We used to count on individual talent, to count on the difference-making of just one player. Today, we rely on the collective side. We need a whole group and those who come in, those who do not start the competition, maybe they will be the ones who will finish it.”Asked about Bonadei’s decision to exclude Renard, Le Sommer and Dali, she says: “When you know they’ve been in the French team for so many years, it can be a bit surprising. He [Bonadei] gave us explanations and justified his choice. We are players and the coach makes his own choices.”Many thought Geyoro would replace Renard as captain, but that responsibility has been given to Griedge Mbock, also of PSG, with Geyoro named one of the vice-captains, along with Sandie Toletti and Sakina Karchaoui. “An armband is what’s on the arm,” Geyoro says. “The most important thing is to have this leader on the field and to push the team in and outside the locker room.”View image in fullscreenGrace Geyoro became captain of PSG at the age of 24.Photograph: Melanie Laurent/DPPI/ShutterstockGeyoro became captain at PSG at 24. “I also had it when I was young. They didn’t ask me if I was ready or not. It’s you and that’s it. That helped me become more confident in myself. I told myself that to be given the armband is no small thing.”Confidence was something she needed as a young girl who started playing football surrounded by boys, back in Orléans, a city 100km south of Paris. “It was not easy,” she says. “You have to show strength of character. When I was a little girl there were not all of the things you have now for the development of women’s football. I was just passionate. I played without thinking about what I could have tomorrow. I just believed I could succeed by being a girl who wanted to play football.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I missed a female role model.Women’s Euro 2025 team guides: BelgiumRead more“Unfortunately, that was normal back then. To find a female football match at the time was difficult and I’m not even that old. Today, it’s easier, little girls arrive at PSG in incredible conditions.”Geyoro was born in Kolwezi, in the southern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and moved to France with her family at the age of two. “I was a child who was very protected by her parents, overprotected, even,” she says. “And when you have to go to boarding school [Clairefontaine, France’s national centre of football] at 13 years old, it’s complicated.“You arrive with girls you don’t know and you have to adapt quickly to the schedule: in the morning you go to school, in the afternoon you train. You’re also responsible for all your stuff. It makes you grow up so fast. You have no choice.”Geyoro’s route to the top has shaped the person she is now and that is why she wants to be a role model for the next generation, or a pioneer as she puts it. “My dream would be to win a competition with the national team, no matter which one, and to be remembered for what I represented. To be part of the legends you can easily cite when talking about women’s football.“We know that our careers are going to stop so it’s all about what you’re going to leave as a legacy, what you’re going to leave as a footprint.

He stressed the need to relax during time off at the tournament. “The end of the season was so demanding emotionally,” said Guardiola. “It wasn’t the best for consistency and results. I decided we’d do good training but let the players relax for the rest of the day.“If they want to play golf, go to the pool, on a day off be with their families [fine] – otherwise it would be so difficult mentally. It’s to keep it fresh in the training sessions, not expending energy before the games because it would be so tough.

I decided for them to do whatever they want.”Rodri is not yet ready to play a full game after his comeback from a season-long injury. “Not for 90 minutes but he played the last [two] games 30 minutes or 35 minutes,” said Guardiola. “He’s making steps forward.

After featuring at the 2017 and 2022 European Championships, as well as the 2023 World Cup, the “Navigators” think that the time has come to do more than just taking part. This time they want to do something unprecedented for the women’s team: to get out of the group and Switzerland, a country with a large Portuguese community, is an ideal place to make history.The qualifying campaign fuelled this sense of expectation. Portugal did not lose any of the 10 games they played – six in the first phase and then four more in two playoff rounds against Azerbaijan and the Czech Republic.The recent Nations League campaign was a wake-up call though and old doubts have resurfaced: are Portugal really ready to fight against the strongest teams on the continent? After a promising start, with adraw at home against Englandand a win in Belgium, Francisco Neto’s team endured four consecutive defeats – conceding 20 goals and scoring only three – and ended up relegated to League B.The results also reflected the absence of some of the team’s key figures: Kika Nazareth (Barcelona) sustained a serious injury in March; Lúcia Alves (Benfica) missed more than half the season and Jéssica Silva (Gotham) had an eye problem. They are all in the squad but there are question marks over how match-ready they will be.“We are not in the cycle we want to be, where we deserve to be, and where we have worked to be,” Neto said recently. “There is no other way to turn things around than through hard work and focus. It’s worth remembering that not everything is fine just because we win and not everything is wrong when we lose. These are difficult times for us as the team have got us used to success.”Now it is up to Neto to get the squad back on track but the first assignment couldn’t be tougher: Spain in Berne on 3 July.PortugalThe coachFrancisco Netois only 43 years old, but has been in his position for over a decade. Having started in 2014, when Portugal were 43rd in the Fifa rankings, he has overseen a rise to 22nd and historic appearances at the World Cup and two European Championships. He has played a big part in this improvement, partly through his work as national coach but also ensuring that the sport has grown as a whole, in close collaboration with the clubs.He has had a core of players on his journey but has never been afraid to bring in younger squad members, leading to a constant evolution of the group. He will always have his legacy but the latest results indicate that we may be nearing the end of a cycle. The European Championship will tell whether Neto is still the right coach to take Portugal to new heights or whether it is time for a shake-up. “The development of Portuguese women’s football is much more than the Nations League,” he said before the tournament.Star playerKika Nazarethis the reference point in a new era of Portuguese women’s football. This is the new, more professional, more competitive and more capable era. More captivating too. Now there are children in Portugal who are named after her – that is the impact she is having. She is not the first Portuguese female player to join a top European club – others have played for Barcelona, ​​in fact – but now the context is different, even in financial terms. Benfica received €500,000 for Nazareth, who immediately conquered Catalonia with her footballing quality but also her joy and smile. A serious injury in March threatened her place at the Euros but she made the squad and even the presence of a half-fit Nazareth will give the other players a boost. “But wait for me: because no matter how long the road, I will return,” she wrote on social media after the injury, quoting a poem by Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It took her a while to pluck up the courage to leave her native island, but last summer she moved to Sporting and scored 12 times. She’s only 23 and is still establishing herself as the main focal point for the Portuguese attack. It looks as if she will be around for some time.Probable lineupView image in fullscreenStatus of domestic top flightThe results of the national team reflect the evolution of the domestic competitions, helped along the way by a development strategy launched by the former FPF board, and supported by clubs. The number of licensed players has tripled in the last decade, and is now close to 15,000. As a result the number of teams and competitions/games has grown, and young players have conditions that their older colleagues could only have dreamed of. About 50% of the players in the top flight are professionals but it is a very different picture between the haves and the have-nots in the league. In March 2023 a new record for women’s domestic football was set with 27,000 watching the Benfica v Sporting game. That was beaten last season as Porto, who had only formed their women’s team at the start of the campaign, attracted 31,000 fans to their first game. Also at Dragão, the national team had the support of 40,000 supporters against Czech Republic in the qualifying playoff for the Euros.Realistic aim in SwitzerlandTo get past the group stage for the first time at a major tournament.The Portugal team guide was written by Nuno Travassos forA Bola.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euros 2025: Guardian Experts’ NetworkWomen's Euro 2025Portugal women’s football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Brazilian is believed to earn a basic £150,000 a week, so Mbeumo’s salary would at least match this.

When the top order batting sets itself for launch of late, the results tend to be less Nasa, more SpaceX. Which is to say, the whole thing blows up. Ten days after scraping past 200 in both innings of the World Test Championship final, the specialist bats had another rapid unscheduled disassembly in Bridgetown, bowled out by West Indies for 180 to start the first Test. No Australian team in the Caribbean has ever made so few after choosing to bat.Australia lose stability without batting axis but could find a future against West Indies | Geoff LemonRead moreYou can trace a line back to the last time Australia played West Indies, in Brisbane. That first month of 2024,Shamar Joseph tore them up for 209 and won the match. In the 18 months since, Australia have been bowled out for 164 in Wellington, 256 in Christchurch, 104 and 238 in Perth, 234 in Melbourne, and 181 in Sydney. The fact that they managed to come back and win most of those Tests is impressive, but has relied on late-order runs and late-game rallies. It shouldn’t disguise the fact that the batting hasn’t delivered.Australia brought three innovations into this Test: Sam Konstas in a bid to be the long-term opener, Josh Inglis in the middle order to replace Marnus Labuschagne, and Cameron Green getting a second Test at No3 though his career has been spent further down. All fell for single figures, gone with 22 on the board. After a recovery between Usman Khawaja and Travis Head of 89, the second part of the slide totalled 69-7.It was Joseph who set this up, seeming to pick up exactly where he’d left off in Brisbane. Bowling from the Joel Garner End, he has half the height but can project as much presence, generating pace, constantly testing players with a line that twitches off the seam and bounce that can variously skid or jump. In no time at all he was smashing Konstas on the knee roll, reviewing it to show three reds, then drawing edges from Green and Khawaja.View image in fullscreenShai Hope attempts to take a catch off Shamar Joseph.Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesJoseph was on the heater, but for a time there was the painful sense that this magic spell of possibility would be wasted. Both those edges were dropped in the cordon: Green’s was the first touch of the ball for Brandon King on debut, Khawaja’s the first touch for Roston Chase as captain. The omens were bad. Joseph buttered up to get a second nick from Green, going hard at the ball as he does in defence, and Inglis made a rare bad decision in Australian colours, deciding that the end of Joseph’s spell was a good time for a Test No4 to manufacture a six over square leg. Wicketkeeper Shai Hope collected the high top edge, Jayden Seales the wicket.But Khawaja was still there, settling in, reprieved once, then a second time as King dived past a catch at gully. Travis Head was there, with his peculiar record against West Indies: two golden ducks, a 38 not out, then a 99, a 119, and a 175. To put it another way, as per the figures when he walked in, if Head gets off the mark against West Indies he averages 143. He soon drove the first four of the day, Khawaja took on a hook for six, and while the latter mostly batted time, Head’s bursts of aggressive driving kept reaching the boundary that a slow outfield otherwise put beyond reach, scoring nine fours while the rest of his team managed ten.But as they built, through a curiously long spell after lunch for medium pacer Justin Greaves, Joseph was gathering steam for his next burst. What a burst it was: Khawaja beaten for pace to edge a pull behind for 47, then Webster on 11 getting a work of art, angled in, seaming away, made to look even better by a clueless push across the line while the ball took middle and off stumps.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After Head slashed at the ball and a not-out review found a bottom edge on the sound graph, a catch that carried clear as day to Hope was ruled not out, despite replays showing the ball rolling up the keeper’s fingers into the glove. One frame where the squashed padding was obscured drew the umpire’s interpretation. This prevarication from ICC officials is something the governing body has to address.Luckily for West Indies, it wasn’t costly. Three balls before tea, then two balls after it, two South Australian left-handers fed cut shots to the cordon, good bounce sending the ball off the top edge. Alex Carey on 8 let Chase redeem himself with a good grab at first slip before Hope took the next chance from Head for 59, with Seales and Greaves the beneficiaries. Then it was Seales charging to a late five-for, more bounce accounting for Starc’s edge on 0, Pat Cummins smacking 28 fast runs before drilling to mid off, and Josh Hazlewood snorted out off the glove for 4.With a surprising hour and a half left to them on day one, Australia’s bowlers made some amends, with three top-order wickets and the nightwatchman shared between the fast bowlers, leaving West Indies 57-4, still 123 runs behind. The guilty fielders, King and Chase, are the not out players with the chance to make amends with the bat. Australia’s bowling strength and West Indies batting weakness may well combine to make this another match that the visitors can rescue, but when they leave Barbados, they will take their batting troubles with them.Explore more on these topicsCricketAustralia cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Just going through some stuff and I need to do my best to get my head in the game ahead of next week,” she told the BBC. “Realistically, the turnaround is pretty soon – it’s only four days away really that Wimbledon starts.“I think I’m just going to start with [a day off] tomorrow and then hopefully I can get on the court on Friday.”View image in fullscreenA seagull flies past as Raducanu prepares to return a serve.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty ImagesRaducanu lost the opening two games of the match but battled back to gain control, breaking serve twice to take the opening set 6-4. Then things started to go wrong as Joint, ranked No 51 in the world, found her groove and won 11 out of the next 14 games to put herself on the verge of victory.However, Raducanu sensed nerves. She broke on Joint’s first attempt to serve it out and then, after holding her own serve, did it again to level at 5-5. A see-saw contest continued and Joint recomposed herself to break Raducanu and serve for the match for the third time at 6-5.But Raducanu took it into a tie-break before Joint steeled herself again, winning four consecutive points and sealing it with an ace.Joint said: “Today was really tough, there was a lot of ups and downs. I was happy I was able to tough it out at the end. I am really glad I was able to win this match.”View image in fullscreenJodie Burrage let three match points slip and then lost against Barbora Krejcikova.Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/ShutterstockJodie Burrage become the second Briton in two days to fail to convert match points against the current Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova.Twenty-four hours after Harriet Dart spurned her chances, Burrage, the world No 164, was 40-0 up on the Czech’s serve at 6-5 in the deciding set, but she could not get over the line, with Krejcikova winning the tie-break.In the men’s draw, Dan Evans’ recent upturn in form continued with a standout win over world No 13 Tommy Paul.

They’ve just wonthe Test at Headingley. They’ve set themselves up nicely for the series. If I was in their situation, my honest answer would be that I would save him for the third Test match. You have to be careful that he’s only bowled 18 overs of red-ball cricket.”England ease off Bazball big talk but continue to embrace thrill of the chaseRead moreWhether or not England decide they need to boost their firepower before Edgbaston will depend somewhat on their assessment of Archer at the end of the championship game. “When I’m asked,” said Farbrace, “I’ll report back that he looks in great rhythm, he bowled very nicely.”He added: “Rather than playing back-to-back games and then straight into a Test match, probably the best scenario would be to not play in our game but then be ready for the third Test match. But that’s their call.”Archer returned to first-class cricket for the first time in four years on Sunday, in Sussex’s County Championship game against Durham at Chester-le-Street – though curious spectators had to wait as his captain, John Simpson, did not throw him the new ball.He looked in tip-top shape and after a precautionary first spell sent down a fiery second set of six overs, including the wicket of Emilio Gay and some sharp short stuff. There was also a decidedly nippy four overs on Tuesday morning. Neil Killeen, the England bowling coach, watched on from the balcony approvingly and Archer finished the innings with figures of 18 overs, one for 32 – though like all fast bowlers in these midsummer rounds of championship cricket, he was handicapped by the soon-to-go-soggy Kookaburra ball, as well as a placid Durham pitch.“The whole point of this was that he got some red-ball overs,” said Farbrace. “He bowled with good pace, he bowled with good accuracy, his body is in good shape, which is fantastic. We’d all love to see Jofra playing for England, because England having Jofra available makes England a much better team, and gives us a much better chance of winning the big series. So let’s look after him and be careful with him. But it is fantastic to have him back.”The coach caused something of a stir last weekend when he chose not to announce Archer’s presence in the Sussex squad. “What I failed to understand is quite the significant media interest there is. Rob Key rang me on Saturday when we were driving here to practise … and said: ‘Where’s Jof?’ I said: “He’s sitting here behind me on the bus.’ He said: ‘Why’s he not in your squad?’ And I said: ‘I was trying to be clever and look after him.’skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also broke the Duke supervillain stereotypeEtan ThomasI played alongside – and greatly respected – Christian Laettner. His fellow Blue Devil is attracting love in the same measure his predecessor attracted hateWed 25 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 10.29 EDTShareThe NBA draft takes place on Wednesday night, and Cooper Flagg – the phenom out of Maine – is the clearcut, consensus No 1 pick, held by theDallas Mavericks. And it’s not just his game that’s earned him near-universal praise; it’s the way he carries himself.In his freshman year at Duke, Flagg accomplished something remarkable: he became the first player in the last 25 years to tally 500 points, 100 assists, and 30 blocks in a single ACC regular season. He led the Blue Devils to both the ACC Championship and the Final Four, averaging 19.2 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. But stats alone don’t capture the 18-year-old’s impact. He was relentless on both ends of the floor – disruptive with cat-like reflexes, explosive with athleticism, and committed to the little things: diving for loose balls, celebrating teammates, talking trash, flexing after dunks, and scoring from anywhere on the court.Flagg dominated college basketball and has been universally praised all season, even by those who have historically hated everything Duke.The question is why? Why is Cooper Flagg embraced by all and not hated like most white Duke superstars?First, it’s worth looking at WNBA phenom Caitlin Clark. There has been speculation that racial animosity and jealousy is at play due to the fact that Clark is excelling in the traditionally Black space of the WNBA. But there seems to be no accusations of backlash, jealousy or animosity against other elite white WNBA players such as Breanna Stewart, Sue Bird, Kelsey Plum, Diana Taurasi, Sabrina Ionescu and Paige Bueckers.So what makes Clark different? One could argue it’s less about her race and more about her demeanor. Take, for example, her recent game against the Connecticut Sun. When Jacy Sheldon told Clark, “You can’t do that,” Clark fired back with a defiant stare and snapped, “I can do whatever the [expletive] I wanna do,” before shoving her. She’s also been seen repeatedly yelling at referees – often without receiving a technical.Fox Sports’ Nick Wright put it plainly: she “picks fights, then plays the victim.” Podcaster Trysta Kick said on her show, that it “kind of feels like Caitlin Clark is one more cheap shot away from becoming the villain everyone tried to make her out to be her rookie year. She’s about to become the female Bane”These sentiments have brought an unfortunate cloud of resentment over the head of an incredibly talented player. Not for her color, but more for her exhibited attitude (in addition to the portion of her fanbase who use her tofurther their own bigotry and racism, something Clarkhas consistently pushed back on).Flagg, by contrast, has neither been used as a symbol of bigotry and hate, nor has he exhibited any of the on court demeanor of Clark. Even after a questionable over-the-back call against Houston in the Final Four of this year’s NCAA Tournament – a moment that helped end Duke’s season – he didn’t pout or throw a tantrum. Sure, he looked frustrated, but he quickly moved on.This is part of what makes Flagg so admired. He’s not just appreciated across fanbases; he’s practically celebrated – something that’s been historically unthinkable for many white Duke superstars.View image in fullscreenChristian Laettner was seen as the embodiment of the white Duke villain.Photograph: John W McDonough/Sports Illustrated/Getty ImagesThat distinction matters. Because very few people hated Duke stars such as Grant Hill, Elton Brand, Nolan Smith, Sheldon Williams, Paolo Banchero, Kyrie Irving, Quinn Cook, Carlos Boozer and Marvin Bagley III. But when it comes to many white Duke stars, the vitriol has been almost a rite of passage.Let’s look at some of the most well known.Grayson Allen: The Dirty PlayerAllen gained a reputation for cheap shots and dirty play – most notably for tripping opponents multiple times. After each incident, he’d act surprised, as if it were accidental. But the pattern was undeniable. He earned a suspension – and widespread hate.Flagg though? No dirty play. No theatrics. Just hard-nosed basketball.JJ Redick: The Arrogant SharpshooterRedick, who is now the head coach of the Lakers, was a sniper on the court and a lightning rod off it when he was at Duke. While his shooting wowed fans, his apparent arrogance and media overexposure rubbed many the wrong way. He seemed to enjoy playing the villain – embracing the boos rather than trying to win over the crowd.Flagg, again, is different. Confident but not cocky. Intense but not insufferable.Danny Ferry: The Smug ProdigyFerry was a great player – but also the blueprint for the “rich, smug, entitled Duke kid” archetype. He slapped the floor on defense, barked at refs, and carried the swagger of a country club brat. Think Topper or Rafe from Outer Banks – golf shirts tucked in, collar popped, dripping with entitlement.Flagg? A humble kid from Maine, couldn’t be further from that image.Christian Laettner: The Ultimate VillainLaettner was so hated that ESPNeven made a documentary on the subject. I met Laettner when we became NBA teammates, and the first thing I said to him was that I grew up hating him. He laughed and said, “Yeah, all the brothas hate me.” I said, “No, all jokes aside, I always said if I ever met you, I was going to punch you in the face on sight.” In a flash, he replied: “Well, if you still feel that way after two months, I’ll give you a free shot.”Turns out, Laettner was one of the coolest cats on the team. Later, when we were traded to the Washington Wizards together, his locker was right next to mine and we talked all the time. He was the nicest guy. Got along with everyone in the locker room. Played hard every night. Mentored the young guys. Encouraged young guys who were having a difficult transition to the NBA as many did, including myself.When guys back home asked about who I liked on the team and I would include Laettner, they’d always stop me short.TheChristian Laettner?DukeChristian Laettner? The preppy, privileged Christian Laettner even white people hate? “Yup,” I would say, “and everything we thought about him all these years is wrong.”But at Duke, he was the perfect villain. On the court,he stomped on Kentucky’s Aminu Timberlakeand got a slap on the wrist. He elbowed, bumped, and jawed his way to villainy – and yet he was never punished. That’s what made him Laettner. He got away with it, like Duke always did, and then had the privilege of hitting the game-winning shot.Flagg though? He’s just not the guy Laettner was perceived to be by many when he was at Duke. He’s not dirty, arrogant, smug or elitist. He doesn’t whine, throw tantrums when he doesn’t get his way, he doesn’t flop, doesn’t bark at refs or exude white privilege. He just hoops. And he respects the game.And when his name is called with the first pick for the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night, there will be no hate, no eye rolls, no animosity, no boos, no: “Oh I can’t stand that white boy” there will be nothing but respect, and admiration for the player and the person he is.And that’s not just about stats, that has just as much to do with his personality, his demeanor and how he carries himself.Etan Thomas played in the NBA from 2000 through 2011.

The trade isn’t expected to be finalized until the start of the new league year on 6 July.SGA v Jokić, dynasty death and justice for Doris Burke: 20 things we learned from the NBA playoffsRead moreESPN first reported the trade, which was later confirmed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.The move is the second major one by Boston of the week, after the team agreed to trade Jrue Holiday to Portland. The combination of those moves still has Boston past the tax line for next season but out from under the second apron, which gives the Celtics – who will be without Jayson Tatum for, at minimum, a significant portion of next season because of an Achilles tear – more flexibility moving forward. Getting under the second apron is important; that threshold, once exceeded, limits ways that teams can trade for or sign players.Porzingis – who, like Holiday, was part of the team that helped Boston win the 2024NBAtitle – will make $30.7m next season on an expiring contract. He was slowed by illness at times in the second half of this past season, as well as in Boston’s playoff run this spring. But he intends to play for Latvia at EuroBasket this summer, a good sign.“Thanks for all the support and questions about my health,” Porzingis posted on social media this week. “I’ve been feeling excellent all offseason and look forward to a healthy and strong European championship tournament.”Porzingis averaged 19.5 points, 6.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 42 games this season.The Nets now technically have five picks in Wednesday’s first round. They own the Nos 8, 19, 26 and 27 selections already, and the Hawks will essentially be picking for the Nets now at No 22, as well.Elsewhere on Tuesday, sources indicated that theDallas Mavericksand Kyrie Irving have agreed on a $119m, three-year contract with the All-Star guard still recovering from a torn ACL that will sideline him into the 2025-26 season.The new contract will align Irving with co-star Anthony Davis, who joined the Mavericks in the seismic trade that sent Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers in February. Davis has three years remaining on his contract, with a player option that now will be the same season as Irving, 2027-28.The agreement with Irving came on the eve of the NBA draft, with the Mavericks poised to take former Duke star Cooper Flagg with the No 1 overall pick.Explore more on these topicsNBABoston CelticsAtlanta HawksDallas MavericksBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Dynamic pricing is an iteration of Uber’s “surge pricing” that increased fares during periods of peak demand.The Columbia paper, which focused on24,532 trips made by a single US Uber driver, concluded that the introduction of the new algorithm had allowed Uber to “significantly increase its take rate – the per cent of rider fares net of driver pay captured by the company – from about 32% at the start of upfront pricing to upwards of 42% by the end of 2024”.Last week’s University of Oxford research found that, since the launch of dynamic pricing, Uber’s median take rate per UK driver had “increased from 25% to 29%, and on some trips … is over 50%”.The pair of papers add to the series of controversies that have plagued the technology company over the years. They include a2021 UK supreme court rulingthat Uber drivers are entitled to the minimum wage and paid holidays, as well as the 2022 release ofthe Uber files, a global investigation that revealed how the company duped police and regulators, and secretly lobbied governments across the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Upfront pricing gives riders clarity before they book and allows drivers to make informed decisions based on full visibility into pay, distance, and expected duration.“Our dynamic pricing algorithms help balance real-time supply and demand to improve reliability across the platform. Upfront prices are not personalised – our pricing algorithms do not use information about an individual rider or driver’s personal characteristics. Suggestions that our systems manipulate pricing unfairly or discriminate are simply false and not supported by evidence.”Last week the company said: “We do not recognise the figures in [the University of Oxford] report.” It added: “Every driver is guaranteed to earn at least the national living wage.”Explore more on these topicsUberTechnology sectorGig economyAppsLiving wagenewsShareReuse this content"

From his apartment in northern Tehran, the 23-year-old has spent his nights searching for proxy links, fragile digital lifelines that briefly break through the internet blackout.For 13 days Iran was under a near-total internet shutdown, severely limiting access to information, from the beginning of the Israeli strikes until later on Wednesday. A group of young Iranians are, however, worked non-stop to ensure their voices reach the outside world.“We can’t use VPNs any more. To get around this internet blackout, we are using special proxy links, essentially ‘secret tunnels’ that route messages through servers outsideIran,” said Amir, speaking this week, and adding that he had managed to build a system to give proxies to his friends.“These links are a part of one of the app’s features […] they route Telegram traffic from an internal server. Each of them does this for a few hours and then fails. So I constantly try to find new ones to send to my folks.”The Iranian government shut down access to the internet during the war with Israel, accusing its adversary of exploiting the network for military purposes. Local sources told the Guardian no one had access to the internet except correspondents working for vetted foreign media.Domestic messaging apps continued to work, but young Iranians have little faith in their security.Amir said: “We have domestic apps, but they’re bullshit. The government uses every opportunity it gets to spy on us, especially student leaders.”Last week, Amnesty International called on the authorities to lift the communications blackout, stating it “prevents people from finding safe routes, accessing life-saving resources and staying informed”.Another student leader, Leila*, 22, who lives in Abbas Abad in north-central Tehran, said she only managed to reconnect during the shutdown after receiving help from abroad. “My boyfriend in Europe sent me configuration links via text. Without that I would still be completely cut off. The internet suddenly works for a few minutes here and there, but goes off before I can use any websites.”The blackout not only severed contact with the outside world, but made life under Israeli bombardment even more difficult. “It’s like being walled in,” said Arash*, a student in Tehran, also speaking this week. “We’ve lost access to each other, to independent news, to help. There’s just state media and silence followed by the sounds of bombs.”For Amir, the most frightening part was how the war is becoming normal. “We’re starting to act like this is normal,” he said, though “war is not normal”. He said they now recognised shaking windows as air raids or explosions.While the war terrified him, the blackout added to his worries. “That’s what erases us … makes us invisible. And still, we’re here. Still trying to connect with the free world.”*Names have been changedExplore more on these topicsIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

The region’s relentless warming means many of those no longer exist. With theArctic heating up four times fasterthan the global average, they have simply melted away.Forty years on, Moore’s research network, the University of the Arctic, has identified61 potential interventionsto slow, stop and reverse the effects of the changing climate in the region. These concepts are constantly beingupdatedand some will be assessed at aconference in Cambridge this week, where scientists and engineers will meet to consider if radical, technological solutions can buy time and stem the loss of polar ice caps.View image in fullscreenDr Shaun Fitzgerald drilling through ice.Photograph: Real Ice/University Of Cambridge“We want to get them down to maybe 10 [ideas] that it’s possible to proceed with. No one is talking about deployment yet,” Moore says, insisting that research is about “excluding the non-starters, the hopeless ideas”. “But we may have ideas that work if we start them now; if we don’t do something for 30 years, it could be too late.”The best way to do that, he says, “is by evaluating them in a rational manner; otherwise it’s just guesswork or religion”.Fromsunlight reflection methods(SRM) bybrightening Arctic clouds, stabilising ice sheets withhuge underwater curtainsto stop warm water melting glaciers, and evenbuilding vast mirrors in space, ideas that were once closer to science fiction have become increasingly mainstream.“None of these ideas are going to fix everything,” says Moore,adding that part of the issue will be to weigh up the potential cost against the perceived benefit.For Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of Cambridge University’s centre for climate repair, which is hosting the conference, it has been a 30-year journey – from working in emissions reduction to exploring more radical ideas to save the Arctic – as he became aware of “our futile progress” in slowing the climate crisis.The risks of not doing something need to be compared against the risks of trying to do somethingDr Shaun Fitzgerald, Cambridge University“I felt an obligation to further our knowledge in these other areas,” he says. Some of the more outlandish sounding ideas to be debated include the use of 10km-wide sunshades suspended between Zeppelin-sized airships andcreating corridors of anchored raftsto help Arctic wildlife that require ice floes. Other measures are already under way. Last year,British startup Real IceandDutch company Arctic Reflectionsundertook projects that pumped water on to the ice to refreeze it.For many critics, the ethical and legal questions around many of these interventions make geoengineering a fraught subject. In 2021, for example, theSaami Council, which represents the interests of the Saami people across Finland, Norway, Sweden and Russia, joined NGOs incriticising the proposed pilotof a Harvard-ledprojectthat wanted to test plans forstratospheric aerosol injection(SAI). This methodinvolves introducing aerosols into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight and cool the planet by mimicking the effect of a large volcanic eruption. The plan was, the Saami Council wrote, a “real moral hazard”.View image in fullscreenAn Inuit hunter rides a skidoo through meltwater in Uummannaq, West Greenland.Photograph: Lawrence Hislop/ArendalWith sensitivities such as these in mind, the Cambridge conference also features contributions onethics,governance,sustainabilityand publicengagement.Among theinterventionsidentified by Moore to slow, stop and reverse the effects of the climate emergency in the Arctic, some have been significantly researched already. But many ideas have barely made it off the drawing board, require enormous funds or have little chance of being done at sufficient scale.The conclusions, so far, are that ocean-based concepts come with far more uncertainty, limitations and risks, while a few scored so low against most criteria that the study declares them to be “unsuitable for further consideration”.One of these –modifying ocean currents– was first mooted during the cold war, when blocking off the Bering strait was suggested to make the Arctic more habitable. Years later, the climate activist Rolf Schuttenhelmmade a similar suggestionbut with the aim of increasing Arctic sea ice.View image in fullscreenOne small-scale solution already in use is pumping water over ice to refreeze it.Photograph: Real Ice/University of Cambridge“It’s very easy to go wrong, and no one knows the right path,” Moore says. “You proceed all the time with local benefits, and in the end, hope there can be global benefits.”Fitzgerald would not be drawn on which concepts he considers frontrunners, and says: “It’s really important that we maintain an open mind on different approaches.”Melting glaciers will harm us all. Yet still we watch, unmoved | Robin McKieRead moreHowever, much of the attention is on SAI and marine-cloud brightening (MCB).Prof Peter Wadhams, head of Cambridge University’s Polar Ocean Physics Group, calls MCB a “very potent” method. “It has the significant advantage that you can turn off the process if it appears to have a harmful effect, as it is implemented on a smaller scale,” he says.He is less enthusiastic about SAI, believing that it would be a dangerously long-lived intervention compared with MCB. Thickening sea ice, on the other hand, is impractical, he says, because of the huge amount of energy required. “It may work on a small scale,” he says. “But not on a scale that would make a difference. Marine-cloud brightening remains the best bet and the most carefully thought-out.”View image in fullscreenHunters return to the Greenlandic Inuit village of Kullorsuaq in Melville Bay.Photograph: REDA/Universal Images/GettyEarlier this year,UK scientists announcedthat they will launch outdoor geoengineering experiments, including into marine-cloud brightening, as part of a £50m government-funded programme. However, opposition is building in some quarters – in response to a petition, adebate was held in the UK parliamentthis week on making geoengineering illegal, while in the US, the Tennessee state legislature has banned it entirely.Tocritics who say potential catastrophes outweigh benefits, Fitzgerald says: “The risks of not doing something need to be compared against the risks of trying to do something. The research has to continue at pace because of the pace of climate change.”He adds: “If we think it’s bad now, we’ve got to think about the next 100 or so years.”Explore more on these topicsGeoengineeringSeascape: the state of our oceansClimate scienceClimate crisisPolar regionsIceUniversity of CambridgeEndangered habitatsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If not, be reassured that its chaotic, nonsensical banality is the pointElle HuntWed 25 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 12.20 EDTShareWhen one of Tim’s year 8 pupils asked him about his “favourite Italian brain rot animal”, he thought he’d misheard. “My hearing is not great at the best of times – I had to ask her to repeat this probably four or five times,” he says.Tim (not his real name) was familiar with the term “brain rot”, used to describe the sense of mental decline after too much time spent mindlessly scrolling online (and votedOxford University Press’s word of the yearfor 2024). But what was this about it being Italian?He told his pupil to get on with her work, sat down at his laptop – and immediately turned to Google.All in the mind? The surprising truth about brain rotRead more“Italian brain rot”, he discovered, refers to a series of absurdist animal characters, generated by artificial intelligence. They have ridiculous Italian-sounding names (like Bombombini Gusini and Trippi Troppi), and typically appear in videos on TikTok accompanied by fast-paced, AI-generated and Italian-ish (though also nonsensical) narration.It is, in short, a meme beloved by the emerging generation Alpha (born from 2010 to 2025) and the youngest members of gen Z (generally those born from 1997 to 2012). And if you are any older – even if you fancy yourself as highly online, or a meme connoisseur – it is all but certain to make very little sense to you, as Tim found out at his laptop.He shares his discoveries, sounding trepidatious. “So there’sChimpanzini Bananini, which is a chimpanzee fused with a banana.Bombardiro Crocodilo, which is a crocodile fused with a bomber plane. There’s one who’s just a cappuccino with legs …”View image in fullscreenBallerina Cappuccina.Illustration: TikTok/@aironic.funThat’sBallerina Cappuccina: a female ballet dancer spliced with a cup of coffee, often depicted as being in a relationship withCappuccino Assassino(you can figure it out).“There’s history – lore – behind all these animals,” continues Tim wonderingly. “Like, some of them are at war with each other. And there are songs about them.”And children in his class are into it on a scale he has not previously seen with a trend or meme. “As soon as it’s mentioned by one person, the entire class starts talking about it,” he says. “They are obsessively focused on Italian brain rot.”If, reading this, you can feel your own brain decaying, that’s understandable. Really, if you were born in a year that starts with the figure 1, “Italian brain rot” is not for you.Yet its massive popularity with young people is worth at least attempting to wrap your head around as an indicator of the direction of travel of online culture.View image in fullscreenTralalero Tralala.Illustration: TikTokThe first character to take off was a shark sporting Nike sneakers (three, one for each fin), calledTralalero Tralala. The audio – of a man’s voice, speaking garbled Italian – surfaced first, on TikTok in early January, before being paired with the AI-generated image a few days later.More characters swiftly followed, spreading across TikTok. Don Caldwell, editor-in-chief of the site Know Your Meme, namechecksBrr Brr Patapim, “a proboscis monkey that is also a tree”, as one who made it to YouTube.View image in fullscreenTung Tung Tung Sahur.Illustration: TikTok/@noxaashtThere is also Indonesian brain rot, notablyTung Tung Tung Sahur(“which is like a stick figure with a bat, telling people to wake up for a meal during Ramadan”) andBoneca Ambalabu(“a frog with a tyre for a body, and human legs”).Both are accompanied by an AI-generated voice speaking Indonesian that, like their Italian counterparts, seeks to confuse rather than convey meaning.“The audio is at least as important, if not more important than the imagery,” says Caldwell. “They’ll be doing it really over-the-top, like ‘Tra-la-lero! Tra-la-lala!’ – it really goes for the whole Italian sound.”Is it offensive to Italians? “It seems Italians have been all over this,” Caldwell says, “so I don’t think so.”Indeed, the appeal of Italian (and Indonesian) brain rot is not that it’s offensive, or even subversive – but that it’s so silly.After 15 years at Know Your Meme, Caldwell admits he doesn’t connect with all the online ephemera that crosses his desk – “but I really like this one,” he says. “The dumber the meme, the better, in my opinion.”View image in fullscreenBombardiro Crocodilo.Illustration: TikTok/@armenjiharhanyanThe ease and speed with which these videos can be produced on accessible tools such as ChatGPT has helped with the meme’s spread. You can prompt the AI to visualise Bombardiro Crocodilo (just for example!) in a setting or scenario of your choice, or come up with a new character in that Italian brain rot style. “You don’t need to have tons of video editing ability, or even to use your own voice,” says Caldwell.For adults tired or even afraid of the rapid advance of AI, Italian brain rot may be almost reassuring in its banality. “This is a non-threatening use of AI, not one that induces feelings of either doom or being replaced.”For young people, of course, it’s not that deep. They are spending more time online now than in past generations, and from younger ages, with the result that they are influencing digital culture. “Now you have children who are super-online,” says Caldwell, “raised by iPads and on TikTok all the time, creating content, determining what are the biggest cultural phenomena of the time.”The last evidence of this, before Italian brain rot, wasskibidi toilet: a similarly witless meme that spread from YouTube in 2023 to spark a sensation among the youngest members of gen Z. If you somehow missed it, it features (to quote from Know Your Meme) “an army of sentient toilets with men’s heads coming out of them, fighting for dominance against a bunch of men in suits with cameras for heads, and each video is gaining tens of millions of views”.Tim remembers that washing up in his classroom, too. “The kids love it so much, the word ‘skibidi’ is now part of gen Z and gen Alpha vernacular.”Its meaning, however, is far from straightforward, and steeped in ambiguous irony. “It can mean something good, something bad, something weird … If they call something ‘skibidi’, it’s both a good thing and they’re laughing at it the same time.”Taken together, skibidi toilet and Italian brain rot gleefully defy explanation, titillating young minds with their surrealist imagery and crude-seeming humour – and catch adults short in their feeble efforts at understanding.View image in fullscreenShrimp Jesus.“AI art” is no longer solely for fooling older people primarily active on Facebook, Caldwell says, givingthe example of Shrimp Jesus(look it up). It is developing its own shorthand, conventions and sense that will inevitably – increasingly – go over many of our heads.It’s tempting to say that memes were better in the old days. Look at the inventiveness of templates such asDistracted Boyfriend, the layered visual jokes, the endless possibilities for meaning-making. But Caldwell – himself a millennial – is more sanguine, suggesting that Italian brain rot is just another evolution of human creativity. “The AI is making the image, there’s a text-to-speech voice, but the joke itself is being invented by an actual person behind a computer.”Tim is not so sure. He’s noticed, when he sets his class creative writing assignments or another imaginative task, that they leap to their favourite Italian brain rot creature. “I think the AI generation is not having those moments of sitting down and letting their imagination run wild, because AI does it all for them – all they have to do is use ChatGPT,” he says. “I’ll say: ‘This has to be completely our own; I don’t want any Chimpanzini Bananini.’”But he has also started using the class’s enthusiasm for Italian brain rot to engage them in lessons. In multiple-choice quizzes, every now and again, one of the four possible answers will be Tung Tung Tung Sahur, Tim says – “just to try and grab their attention”.He also now has an answer to that year 8 pupil’s question. “My favourite isBlueberrinni Octopussini,” he says, “which is an octopus fused with a blueberry.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We were mesmerised. Forty years later, I am playingDeath Stranding 2, Hideo Kojima’s sprawling apocalyptic adventure, and there are times I feel as if I’m back in that classroom. Most of the game takes place in a ruined Australia, the cities gone, the landscape as stark, beautiful and foreboding as it was in Roeg’s film.I’ve been playing for 45 hours and have barely made an impact on the story. Instead, I have wandered the wilderness, delivering packages to the game’s isolated communities. The game is set after a catastrophic event has decimated humanity and scarred the landscape with supernatural explosions. Now you pass through vast ochre deserts and on toward the coast, watching the sun set behind glowing mountains, the tide rolling in on empty bays. Usually in open-world games, the landscape is permanent and unchanging, apart from day/night cycles and seasonal rotations. But the Australia of Death Stranding 2 is mysterious and amorphous. Earthquakes bring rocks tumbling down hillsides, vast dust storms blow up and avalanches bury you in snow. As you go, you are able to build roads, electricity generators and even jump-ramps for cars. These can be found and used by other players, so each time you visit a place you may find new ways to traverse. Nothing is ever really still.Kojima named George Miller ashis idoland the influence of the Mad Max movies and their crazed, desolate energy is everywhere in this game: its interplay of technology and isolation; its feudal tribes and scarce resources, its weird sense of adrenaline. He has also seen Walkabout, and that film’s mythic energy is here, too, though perhaps lacking the strong undertone of colonial guilt. There is a rocky outcrop in a remote corner of the game map that reminds me a little of Peter Weir’sPicnic at Hanging Rock, with its labyrinthine crevices, the reddish glow, the unnerving silence.View image in fullscreenSun-stricken hallucinatory strangeness … Picnic at Hanging Rock.I’ve spent hours driving along highways in this game, picking up parcels and taking them to strange, inaccessible places – why? How have I been seduced into sitting in front of my screen until 2am ensuring an animal shelter gets its delivery of fluffy pyjamas? The answer is, in creating a version of Australia that is timeless yet subject to moments of extreme change, Kojima has played the same trick Weir did: this world is beguiling and threatening – and that’s what makes it seductive.Years ago, Weirsaid thisabout Picnic at Hanging Rock: “What I attempted was to develop the oppressive atmosphere of something which has no solution: to bring out a tension and claustrophobia in the locations and the relationships. We worked very hard at creating an hallucinatory mesmeric rhythm, so that you lost awareness of facts, you stopped adding things up, and got into this enclosed atmosphere. I did everything in my power to hypnotise the audience away from the possibility of solution.”That, in short, is my experience of Death Stranding 2. It is a game of hallucinatory mesmeric rhythms; you drive and drive, then hours later you’re back in the same place – except now there is a road, or a sign left by another player who passed in the night. What Grand Theft Auto has always tried to do with American cities, Kojima has succeeded at with the Australian outback: to interpret and distill the feeling of a place from an outsider perspective. That’s why, when I do actually make progress in the game and open up a new area for exploration, I get the same feeling I had when I first saw Walkabout on that rainy afternoon in Manchester as a teenager – it feels as if I am seeing an impossible alien landscape, rife with beauty, possibility and danger. I think it will be months before I escape.What to playView image in fullscreenMetaphorical comedy … Quantum Witch.Photograph: Nikki JayA few months ago,I interviewedthe creator ofQuantum Witch, a wildly idiosyncratic pixel art adventure about a shepherdess who loses her flock and then gets tossed into a metaphysical battle between duelling gods. Nikki Jay was raised in a religious cult, but escaped to live her own life – and this game is heavily inspired by her experiences.Created with a little help from Paul Rose, who wrote Channel 4’s famed teletext gaming zine Digitiser, it’s partly a point-and-click adventure but also a postmodern deconstruction of genre, with queer undertones.

Does it earn its price tag? We asked the developer what went into itAlyssa MercanteWed 25 Jun 2025 05.30 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 05.31 EDTShareThe Outer Worlds 2, from RPG makers Obsidian, will be the first first-party Xbox game to cost $80 (£70). Given that Nintendo Switch 2 games are already priced at least that high, and Sony’s own PlayStation 5 games have been pushing towards it for a while, you might not expect this development to ignite a pricing debate among gamers – but it did. The increased cost of video games is a hotly contested topic, given the unsustainably ballooning budgets that most blockbuster games are working with these days. But I can say that The Outer Worlds 2 is a much larger, more in-depth game than the2019 comedy sci-fi original. If we’re going to talk about value, it can certainly be argued that its higher price point is justified.I loved The Outer Worlds, which was jam-packed with the kind of wry, sardonic humour you’d expect from an Obsidian RPG (this is the studio behindFallout: New Vegas, after all). Its super-saturated space world, populated by colourful flora, bumbling corporations and strange zealots, was a joy to live in for 20 or so hours, though its combat left much to be desired.According to game director Brandon Adler, Obsidian knew The Outer Worlds’ gunplay needed improvement even before the game launched, andespeciallyif they developed a sequel. “We did a full breakdown on Destiny, because we love how that felt,” he says during an interview held after an Outer Worlds 2 demo in Los Angeles. “We also talked to the Halofolks … They gave us a huge list of stuff and said, ‘You guys should target this … you should add that to your weapon configurations.’”Obsidian’s research has paid off: not only are there more weapons to play with in The Outer Worlds 2, but they all feel good to fire, and offer a variety of combat options depending upon the encounter (and that’sifyou want to fight, as a solid stealth approach will let you creep through rooms of foes without a trace). In the original game, I’d simply avoid large-scale combat, or preemptively sigh before getting into a firefight because the gunplay just wasn’t enjoyable. That has changed in the sequel – I relished each encounter, giggling manically as I hucked grenades and dropped down from above to take out a target.“We didn’t want small changes. Every weapon feels very different; every weapon has a cool, unique purpose,” Adler says. “You can even take those weapons and add mods on to them to do all kinds of crazy things.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Entering buildings no longer requires a loading screen that can take players out of the fantasy, for instance. “Little things like that give a big, immense feel,” Adler says. “Exploration is probably the thing that’s most important to me. I want the players as they’re going through this big world to feel like they should go to every nook and cranny and open every door and go behind every little thing, because it’s always gonna be a cool, fun thing for them to find.”The Outer Worlds 2 offers a larger world, improved combat and even more customisation options that deepen its role-playing features (such as more perks and flaws for your character, which can drastically change how you play). Though Adler declines to comment on the $80 price tag, it’s clear that this sequel justifies itself.The Outer Worlds 2 is released on 29 October for Xbox,PlayStation 5and PC.Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsXboxAction gamesRole playing gamesGame cultureMicrosoftPlayStation 5featuresShareReuse this content"

It can turn its back on the dreams of a younger generation which, if we don’t change that system, will likely be worse off than their parents.It can continue to depend upon billionaire donors and out-of-touch campaign consultants and spend huge amounts of money on dumb 30-second ads that fewer and fewer people respond to.It can ignore the tragic reality that tens of millions of Americans are giving up on democracy because they don’t see their government understanding their struggles and the realities of their lives or doing anything about it.Why establishment Democrats still can’t stomach progressive candidates like Zohran Mamdani | Arwa MahdawiRead moreOr it can learn the lesson that theZohran Mamdanicampaign taught us on Tuesday.And that is:Have the courage to address the real economic and moral issues that face the majority of our people, take on the greed and power of the oligarchy and fight for an agenda that can improve life for working families.Some may claim that Mamdani’s victory was just about style and the fact that he is a charismatic candidate. Yes. He is. But you don’t get a Mamdani victory without the extraordinary grassrootsmovementthat rallied around him. And you don’t get that movement and thousands of enthusiastic people knocking on doors without an economic agenda that speaks to the needs of working people. The people of New York and all Americans understand that, in the richest country on earth, they should not have to struggle every day just to put food on the table, pay their rent or pay their medical bills. These are the people the Democratic consultants don’t know exist.Mamdani has been criticized for his “radical” and “unrealistic” economic policies:Demanding that, at a time of unprecedented income and wealth inequality, the rich and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes.Demanding that, when many New Yorkers are no longer able to find affordable housing, there should be a freeze on rent hikes.Demanding that, when commuting to a job takes a big toll out of a worker’s paycheck, public transportation should be free.Demanding that, when many low-income and working people are unable to access good-quality food for themselves and their kids, publicly owned neighborhood grocery stores should be created.These ideas, and more, are not radical. They may not be what billionaires, wealthy campaign contributors and real estate speculators want, but they are what working people want. And maybe, just maybe, it’s time to listen to them.Mamdani’s victory was not about “star power”. It was very much about people power, about revitalizing democracy and opening the door for ordinary people to gain control over the decisions that impact their lives.Importantly, he did not run away from the moral issue that is troubling millions in New York and around the country: the need to end US military support for a rightwing extremist Benjamin Netanyahu government in Israel that is obliterating the people of Gaza and starving their children. Mamdani understands that antisemitism is a disgusting and dangerous ideology, but that it is not antisemitic to be critical of the inhumane policies of the Netanyahu government.The lesson of Mamdani’s campaign is that it is not good enough just to be critical of Trump and his destructive policies. We have to bring forth a positive vision and an analysis of why things are the way they are. It is not good enough to maintain a status quo that is failing most Americans. At a time when hope is in increasingly short supply, people must have the sense that if we work together, if we have the courage to take on powerful special interests, we can create a better world – a world of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.Will the current Democratic party leadership learn the lessons of the Mamdani campaign? Probably not. Too many of them would rather be the captains on a sinking Titanic, rather than change course.Then again, it doesn’t matter what they think. The establishment threw everything they had against Mamdani – millions in Super Pac money, endorsements from “important people”, a hostile media – and they still lost.The future of the Democratic party will not be determined by its current leadership. It will be decided by the working class of this country. Increasingly, people understand that our political system is corrupt and that billionaires should not be able to buy elections. They understand that we should not have an unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality; that we should not be the only wealthy country not to guarantee healthcare for all; that we should not deny young people the right to a higher education because of their income; that we should not have a major crisis in affordable housing; that we should not have a minimum wage that is a starvation wage; that we should not allow corporations to illegally prevent union organization – and much, much more.The American people are beginning to stand up and fight back. We have seen that in the many Fighting Oligarchy events that we’ve done around the country that have drawn huge turnouts. We have seen that in the millions of people who came out for the No Kings rallies that took place this month in almost every state. And yesterday, we saw that in the Democratic primary in New York City.We’re going forward. And no one is going to stop us.Bernie Sanders is a US senator, and ranking member of the health, education, labor and pensions committee.

He also broke the Duke supervillain stereotypeEtan ThomasI played alongside – and greatly respected – Christian Laettner. His fellow Blue Devil is attracting love in the same measure his predecessor attracted hateWed 25 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 10.29 EDTShareThe NBA draft takes place on Wednesday night, and Cooper Flagg – the phenom out of Maine – is the clearcut, consensus No 1 pick, held by theDallas Mavericks. And it’s not just his game that’s earned him near-universal praise; it’s the way he carries himself.In his freshman year at Duke, Flagg accomplished something remarkable: he became the first player in the last 25 years to tally 500 points, 100 assists, and 30 blocks in a single ACC regular season. He led the Blue Devils to both the ACC Championship and the Final Four, averaging 19.2 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. But stats alone don’t capture the 18-year-old’s impact. He was relentless on both ends of the floor – disruptive with cat-like reflexes, explosive with athleticism, and committed to the little things: diving for loose balls, celebrating teammates, talking trash, flexing after dunks, and scoring from anywhere on the court.Flagg dominated college basketball and has been universally praised all season, even by those who have historically hated everything Duke.The question is why? Why is Cooper Flagg embraced by all and not hated like most white Duke superstars?First, it’s worth looking at WNBA phenom Caitlin Clark. There has been speculation that racial animosity and jealousy is at play due to the fact that Clark is excelling in the traditionally Black space of the WNBA. But there seems to be no accusations of backlash, jealousy or animosity against other elite white WNBA players such as Breanna Stewart, Sue Bird, Kelsey Plum, Diana Taurasi, Sabrina Ionescu and Paige Bueckers.So what makes Clark different? One could argue it’s less about her race and more about her demeanor. Take, for example, her recent game against the Connecticut Sun. When Jacy Sheldon told Clark, “You can’t do that,” Clark fired back with a defiant stare and snapped, “I can do whatever the [expletive] I wanna do,” before shoving her. She’s also been seen repeatedly yelling at referees – often without receiving a technical.Fox Sports’ Nick Wright put it plainly: she “picks fights, then plays the victim.” Podcaster Trysta Kick said on her show, that it “kind of feels like Caitlin Clark is one more cheap shot away from becoming the villain everyone tried to make her out to be her rookie year. She’s about to become the female Bane”These sentiments have brought an unfortunate cloud of resentment over the head of an incredibly talented player. Not for her color, but more for her exhibited attitude (in addition to the portion of her fanbase who use her tofurther their own bigotry and racism, something Clarkhas consistently pushed back on).Flagg, by contrast, has neither been used as a symbol of bigotry and hate, nor has he exhibited any of the on court demeanor of Clark. Even after a questionable over-the-back call against Houston in the Final Four of this year’s NCAA Tournament – a moment that helped end Duke’s season – he didn’t pout or throw a tantrum. Sure, he looked frustrated, but he quickly moved on.This is part of what makes Flagg so admired. He’s not just appreciated across fanbases; he’s practically celebrated – something that’s been historically unthinkable for many white Duke superstars.View image in fullscreenChristian Laettner was seen as the embodiment of the white Duke villain.Photograph: John W McDonough/Sports Illustrated/Getty ImagesThat distinction matters. Because very few people hated Duke stars such as Grant Hill, Elton Brand, Nolan Smith, Sheldon Williams, Paolo Banchero, Kyrie Irving, Quinn Cook, Carlos Boozer and Marvin Bagley III. But when it comes to many white Duke stars, the vitriol has been almost a rite of passage.Let’s look at some of the most well known.Grayson Allen: The Dirty PlayerAllen gained a reputation for cheap shots and dirty play – most notably for tripping opponents multiple times. After each incident, he’d act surprised, as if it were accidental. But the pattern was undeniable. He earned a suspension – and widespread hate.Flagg though? No dirty play. No theatrics. Just hard-nosed basketball.JJ Redick: The Arrogant SharpshooterRedick, who is now the head coach of the Lakers, was a sniper on the court and a lightning rod off it when he was at Duke. While his shooting wowed fans, his apparent arrogance and media overexposure rubbed many the wrong way. He seemed to enjoy playing the villain – embracing the boos rather than trying to win over the crowd.Flagg, again, is different. Confident but not cocky. Intense but not insufferable.Danny Ferry: The Smug ProdigyFerry was a great player – but also the blueprint for the “rich, smug, entitled Duke kid” archetype. He slapped the floor on defense, barked at refs, and carried the swagger of a country club brat. Think Topper or Rafe from Outer Banks – golf shirts tucked in, collar popped, dripping with entitlement.Flagg? A humble kid from Maine, couldn’t be further from that image.Christian Laettner: The Ultimate VillainLaettner was so hated that ESPNeven made a documentary on the subject. I met Laettner when we became NBA teammates, and the first thing I said to him was that I grew up hating him. He laughed and said, “Yeah, all the brothas hate me.” I said, “No, all jokes aside, I always said if I ever met you, I was going to punch you in the face on sight.” In a flash, he replied: “Well, if you still feel that way after two months, I’ll give you a free shot.”Turns out, Laettner was one of the coolest cats on the team. Later, when we were traded to the Washington Wizards together, his locker was right next to mine and we talked all the time. He was the nicest guy. Got along with everyone in the locker room. Played hard every night. Mentored the young guys. Encouraged young guys who were having a difficult transition to the NBA as many did, including myself.When guys back home asked about who I liked on the team and I would include Laettner, they’d always stop me short.TheChristian Laettner?DukeChristian Laettner? The preppy, privileged Christian Laettner even white people hate? “Yup,” I would say, “and everything we thought about him all these years is wrong.”But at Duke, he was the perfect villain. On the court,he stomped on Kentucky’s Aminu Timberlakeand got a slap on the wrist. He elbowed, bumped, and jawed his way to villainy – and yet he was never punished. That’s what made him Laettner. He got away with it, like Duke always did, and then had the privilege of hitting the game-winning shot.Flagg though? He’s just not the guy Laettner was perceived to be by many when he was at Duke. He’s not dirty, arrogant, smug or elitist. He doesn’t whine, throw tantrums when he doesn’t get his way, he doesn’t flop, doesn’t bark at refs or exude white privilege. He just hoops. And he respects the game.And when his name is called with the first pick for the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night, there will be no hate, no eye rolls, no animosity, no boos, no: “Oh I can’t stand that white boy” there will be nothing but respect, and admiration for the player and the person he is.And that’s not just about stats, that has just as much to do with his personality, his demeanor and how he carries himself.Etan Thomas played in the NBA from 2000 through 2011.

It’s a confirmation that progressive politics, when pursued with discipline, vision and vigor, can resonate broadly – even in a city known for its entrenched power structures.This was no ordinary primary. Andrew Cuomo, a former governor whose political fall from grace seemed irreparable only a few years ago, had positioned himself as the overwhelming favorite. Backed by millions from corporate interests, super PACs, and billionaire donors such as Michael Bloomberg and Bill Ackman, Cuomo relied heavily on institutional inertia and top-down endorsements. Yet Tuesday night, it became clear that this alone couldn’t carry him across the finish line.Mamdani, a 33-year-old legislator from Queens, ran a relentlessly disciplined campaign built around cost-of-living issues, zeroing in on essentials such as housing, transport, childcare and groceries. Repeated attempts to define Mamdani as merely a “Muslim socialist” with radical ideas, to force divisive identity politics to the fore, or to make the election a referendum on Israel, failed.But it wasn’t simply messaging discipline that made Mamdani successful. Mamdani has a political talent rooted in genuine charisma. His fluency with language, clarity of purpose, and authenticity allowed him to speak convincingly to voters from many different backgrounds. He wasn’t just another activist-politician; he proved himself to be a natural leader – someone capable of communicating moral truths without sounding moralistic.Meanwhile, Cuomo’s attempt to reinvent himself in New York City politics was flawed from the outset. His candidacy was perceived by many voters as an arrogant power grab, a rehabilitation project rather than a serious commitment to addressing the city’s challenges. He neglected to engage seriously with New York’s relatively new ranked-choice voting system, stubbornly isolating himself rather than building coalitions, even among centrist figures.The difference in campaign styles was stark and instructive. Mamdani’s campaign was fundamentally grassroots, driven by committed volunteers, including young activists from the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). It was also modern and intelligent, recognizing that an ever-growing share of the electorate forms its opinions through social media and finding innovative ways to communicate policy proposals. Remarkably, almost one quarter of the early vote in this primarycame fromfirst-time voters in New York elections.Yet the results make clear that his voting base wasn’t limited to young, college-educated voters most engaged by his campaign. Notably, Mamdani succeeded in neighborhoods like Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights, Sunset Park, and Brighton Beach – all areas that swung rightward in the 2024 presidential election.This was a reward for his consistent efforts to reach out to young, working-class voters who felt alienated by the Democratic party; Mamdani’s first viral video of this campaign came in November, when he interviewed New Yorkers who had voted for Trump about their cost-of-living frustrations. In the face of a skeptical public, Mamdani was even able to communicate democratic socialism as a universal politics rather than a niche identity or a dangerous ideology.Yet coalition-building factored in just as much as political resolve. Crucial to Mamdani’s broad success was the principled support of progressive figures like Comptroller Brad Lander. Lander advocated for himself as the person best suited to be mayor but accepted the nature of rank-choice voting and the imperative of defeating Cuomo by cross-endorsing Mamdani. Lander’s approach helped forge a coherent, united front – something increasingly rare in fractious progressive circles – and it proved decisive.Voters, for their part, proved that they were ready for change. They refused to succumb to cynical fearmongering about a supposed tide of crime and antisemitism that would come from a Mamdani victory. Instead, they took a clear-eyed look at their lives, assessed the failings of the Democratic party, and chose something fresh, new, and fundamentally different over a failed political establishment.Still, Tuesday’s results carry deeper questions about the future. Mamdani’s victory in this primary, significant as it is, must now be tested against Eric Adams and likely Cuomo again in the November election. Beyond that lies a far more challenging test: governing. Progressives across the US have watched closely as Chicago’s Brandon Johnson, another promising leftwing mayor, has stumbled against entrenched opposition and due to his own administrative failings. Mamdani will need to navigate obstacles better if elected.Historical precedent may offer some reassurance for those who wish New York’s mayoral frontrunner well. The tradition of successful municipal socialism in the US, including in cities like Milwaukee under the “sewer socialists” and, more recently, in Burlington under Bernie Sanders, serve as real examples of socialist governance marked by competence, effectiveness and popularity. Sanders’ legacy in Burlington, especially, stands as a template Mamdani could follow: pragmatic yet deeply principled governance that steadily builds broader legitimacy among skeptics and opponents.New York mayors have traditionally been considered men who come from nowhere and go nowhere, politically speaking. But Mamdani could break that mold, following Sanders’ trajectory from effective municipal leadership to becoming a durable voice in national politics.However, to succeed, Mamdani must trust his own judgment – one that has already proved incisive and strategically sound. He must maintain independence from two city establishments: the corporate one, which opposed him at every turn, and the NGO-driven progressive establishment, whose political instincts failed them in recent election cycles.Mamdani’s platform, which couples a supply-side focused “abundance agenda” with demands for equitable redistribution and expansive public-sector investment, offers precisely the kind of social-democratic governance model New York desperately needs. There’s nothing fundamentally radical about these demands; rather, what’s genuinely radical is the excitement they have inspired among voters, including many who previously disengaged from local politics altogether.On Tuesday, Mamdani undoubtedly delivered a major victory in America’s largest city. But we must be sober about the challenges ahead. Electoral wins are meaningful only if they translate into tangible improvements in people’s lives, and political momentum can dissipate quickly if governance falls short. Mamdani faces an enormous responsibility – not only to his immediate constituency but also to a broader progressive movement watching closely from across the country and the world.Bhaskar Sunkara is the president of The Nation, the founding editor Jacobin, and the author of The Socialist Manifesto: The Case for Radical Politics in An Era of Extreme InequalitiesExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionNew YorkcommentShareReuse this content"

I may not do it,” the president said to reporters on the White House lawn. “Nobody knows what I’m going to do.”The question was about joining Israeli air strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Days later, US bombers were on their way. Some expected it to happen. Others, including Keir Starmer, had gone on record to say they didn’t. No one had known. The unpredictability doctrine wouldn’t have been violated either way.It applies also in economic and domestic policy. Trump’s boast of inscrutability could have been made about tariff rates, or adecision to deploy marinesagainst US citizens who defy his immigration agency.Volatile inconsistency is a trait of the presidential personality, but also a learned management technique. Keeping everyone around you guessing, lurching from charm to menaces, swapping and dropping favourites on a whim – these are methods of coercive control. They generate disorientation and vulnerability. People who are braced for sudden mood swings must hang on the leader’s every word, looking for cues, awaiting instruction. Individual agency is lost, dependency is induced. It is something cult leaders do.A method that works with a quasi-monarchical entourage is poorly suited to international affairs. Foreign leaders are not White House courtiers. They might seek the US president’s favour in trade or fear his military wrath, but always with competing national interests in the background. On the world stage, Trump will never feel the unalloyed devotion he gets from worshippers at a Maga rally, which is one reason why he hates to travel.That tension is palpable at this week’s Nato summit in The Hague. Trump makes no secret of his disdain for European democracies. He resents their reliance on the Pentagon for security. He is unconvinced that defending their continent, especially the corner of it under violent assault from Russia, is the US’s problem. The threat he briefly made in his first term to pull out of Nato if other members didn’t start paying their way still hangs over the alliance. European leaders must strive to keep Trump onside while contingency planning for the day he decides to abandon them.Matthew Whitaker, the US’s permanent representative at Nato,tried to be reassuringon that point at the summit, declaring that it “has never been more engaged”. But he also conceded ignorance of what Trump might actually do. “I don’t want … to claim to be able to read his mind and know what he’s going to say.”That is the doctrine: nobody knows. This forces Nato members into an awkward dance, performing for Trump’s benefit while also working around him. They want to impress him with their financial ambition, pledging tospend 5% of their national GDPon defence by 2035. But they know also not to expect any reciprocal commitment, or none that can be trusted.War in the Middle East ramps the uncertainty up to new heights. European leaders need to stay focused on Ukraine and the prospect of Russia turning its territorial aggression on some other portion of Nato’s eastern flank. Vladimir Putin sees no legitimacy in borders that were drawn by the collapse of the Soviet Union. He has also geared Russia’s economy, political apparatus and propaganda machinery to assume perpetual war with the west. One lesson from Ukraine’s plight is to assume that when Putin says he is going to fight, he means it. Another is that, while deterrence is expensive, it is cheaper than the war that comes when the Kremlin feels confidently undeterred.These calculations keep Europeans up at night, but not Trump. He doesn’t recognise Russia as the aggressor in Ukraine and would happily see the war end on terms that leave Nato humiliated and Putin emboldened, and signal an epoch-defining shift in the balance of global power away from democracy.But framing the choice in grand geostrategic terms obscures pettier motives, which are often the salient ones with Trump. He doesn’t want to take Kyiv’s side because that is what Joe Biden did. It isn’t his cause and so he thinks it is dumb.This is not the case withIran. US allies are required, in public at least, to judge Trump’s military intervention as though it were made according to a conventional diplomatic and strategic calculus: the prospect of Tehran wielding powers of nuclear apocalypse is truly abhorrent; negotiation was not bearing fruit. Maybe there was reason to dispute US intelligence assessments that said the threshold of weapons-readiness was not imminent. Maybe the time to act really was at hand.But those are rationalising arguments, retrofitted to a choice that Trump made as much from vanity as any more sophisticated motive. He was bounced into war by Benjamin Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister appears to have gamed the US president’s aversion to looking weak and his limitless appetite for glory. Early Israeli success – an extraordinary feat of military intelligence that took out senior Iranian commanders and assets – offered Trump the prospect of climbing aboard a winning operation and grabbing credit for victory.Hints that regime change was on the agenda may have prodded Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, towards a ceasefire on the basis that early capitulation with some power retained, while unpalatable, is preferable to assassination. Senior White House officials insisted the war aims were limited to containment of the nuclear threat, but since they hadn’t even known a war was coming their authority on the matter is questionable.Trump’s supporters say this is proof that his volatile style works. In strategic studies it is known as the “madman theory”. Discarding guardrails, looking ready to do something irrational, forces an enemy to choose caution. The obvious risk is that it also teaches the rest of the world the merit of madness. Iran’s rulers will be more convinced than ever that only nuclear weapons can guarantee their sovereignty. (That view would persist through regime change, since none of the viable scenarios result in a flowering of pro-western democracy in the region. Tehran’s atomic ambitions may be set back by years, but the cause of negotiated, multilateral non-proliferation is also in tatters.)That doesn’t interest Trump. He thinks in terms of easy wins, not complex consequences. Hence hispalpable irritation with Israel and Iranfor violating the ceasefire and generally not knowing “what the fuck they’re doing”. He is aware that he looks played by Netanyahu, much as he once showed aflicker of frustration with Putinfor “tapping” him along in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. He promised US voters deals. He gets cross when the world withholds them from him.This is a natural function of the unpredictability doctrine. Telling other countries they can never know what you’ll do makes them less responsive to diplomacy; less biddable to the whim of a US president. A vicious cycle then begins. Trump relies on his volatile persona to assert control in situations that he doesn’t understand, generating chaos that exposes his impotence, which in turn provokes him to tug in more arbitrary fury at his levers of power.For European democracies this is debilitating. It is hard to coordinate defence against external threats when the paramount power in your alliance is the origin of so much instability. But Nato leaders will get no respite from the uncertainty as long as Trump sits in the White House. The thing they most need from him – reliability – is the one thing he is destined by personality and doctrine never to provide.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelcommentShareReuse this content"

Why isn’t Katy Perry going? And how is Eva Longoria still on every guest list, despite not having been famous since 2012? – but the one I keep sticking on in this: as the world’s third richest man, Bezos could, we assume, charm almost any woman on the planet into some sort of marital arrangement with him. In which case, and with all due respect, why Sánchez?I don’t mean this to be as rude at it sounds. Lauren Sánchez, a 55-year-old former TV presenter and licensed pilot, is, I’m sure, funny and clever and up there with Peter Ustinov as a great dinner party guest. Her betrothed, on the other hand, doesn’t appear to be a man comfortable with making anything but the most obvious choices. Bezos got rich, built a rocket, and turned himself from a weedy tech nerd into a comic-book Mr Universe so that these days he looks like a man wearing an Amazon cardboard box under his polo shirt. That this person would choose not only a woman a mere six years younger than himself but one who, stylistically speaking, edges closer every year to theJocelyne Wildensteinschool of bizarre beautification speaks either to the loveliness of a genuine soul match or something else altogether.By which I mean: the strange aesthetic that many women inside the Maga world seem enthusiastically to have taken up as the norm. If there is a Maga look for women it is the one exemplified not only by Sánchez but by Kristi Noem, the head of Homeland Security mockingly nicknamed ICE Barbie for her combination of pageant-style looks and heavy-handed immigration policing, and by Melania Trump, whose eyes are creeping slowly but inexorably up the sides of her temples in what is informally known as “Mar-a-Lago” face.What’s odd about this style isn’t that it’s augmented, but that it’s an aesthetic which seems deliberately to draw attention to its own artificiality in a way that, in other contexts, might be referred to as “bad work”. People with money can make poor choices about cosmetic surgery too, of course, but the uniformity of this particular look – so heavy on the filler, silicone and Botox as to make its wearers seem not younger, but weirder, and in a state of constant discomfort – suggests something closer to design. If you were the type of person to make liberal references to The Handmaid’s Tale, you might even speculate that this aesthetic has been tailored by the world’s richest men to symbolise just how completely – almost derisively – they can control the bodies of the women around them.But let’s focus on the wedding, which has provided us this week with welcome respite from the news from Iran, with the spectacle of a man worth $223bn being frightened off by the threat of angry locals coming at him with pool floats. The wedding on Saturday was originally planned to take place in the centre ofVeniceat the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, a 16th-century meeting hall surrounded by canals, raising the spectacle of notable guests including Oprah, the Kardashians and Ivanka Trump arriving on public waterways via open-air taxi.It is safe to say the Venetians weren’t happy. After a group calledNo Space for Bezoslightly threatened to disrupt the guests’ arrival withinflatable alligators, Bezos changed venues to a less accessible hall outside the centre. (It should be noted that No Space for Bezos is not the same as Everyone Hates Elon, a different but equally energised group that unfurled a huge banner in the Piazza San Marco bearing the legend, “If you can rent Venice for your wedding then you can pay more tax.” Let’s hope Mark Zuckerberg, who will reportedly be at the wedding, gets his own bespoke group along these lines.)“We are very proud of this!” said Tommaso Cacciari, No Space for Bezos’s spokesperson,to the BBCon Tuesday. “We are nobodies, we have no money, nothing!” Meanwhile, protest groups including Greenpeace are still planning on demonstrating in the city centre on Saturday to draw attention to the obscenity of a projected 90-odd private jets flying in for the event. As for Bezos and Sánchez, let’s end on a gracious note and wish them all the happiness in the world as they marry in a city that doesn’t want them, in front of 200 people who don’t know them, in a celebration of money over sense.

Mainly because I was thereVan BadhamIt’s easy to see why some on TikTok are yearning for this kind of nostalgia. But as someone who lived through it, here’s why that’s a bad ideaWed 25 Jun 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 19.48 EDTShareA recent piece inUS publication the Cuthas picked up on a curious sentiment seen floating around TikTok; public yearning to recreate a“90s summer”.One can see the temptation of nostalgia for Americans, given the present they’re trapped in – and, perhaps, the El Salvadoran gulag they’re trapped in – is hardly so rosy. But as bombers fly over Tehran and their out-of-his-depth president handles a fragile situation by swearing at Benjamin Netanyahu on TV, it’s worth asking if the promptings of nostalgia may be what got us all into this mess in the first place.Millennials are now parents. As the Americans of this generation have preoccupied themselves with scheduling activities for their summer holidays, the Cutrelates stated longing for youthful experiences they remember as “going to the public pool by themselves, biking around aimlessly, watching daytime TV with elderly relatives, and taking no-frills family road trips”.Parts of Australia are suffering another devastating drought, but you wouldn’t know it in the cities | Van BadhamRead moreSome Australians, no doubt, concur – given the interminable circulation of Facebook’s like-harvesting slop insisting on a never-had-to-lock-your-door, none-of-this-woke-rubbish paradise that was supposedly once lying around in the stubby shorts of Australian back yards past.Personally, the idea of inflicting a “90s summer” on children makes me anxious. It’s only because I was there. As a flanno-wearing, Nirvana-bothering resentful ex-smoker whose character retains something of a black beer tang, I am gen X, purely distilled. It has been affirming to watch younger generations lambast us as “the worst generation” onTikTokbut, sadly, in this Era of Failure to Ask Follow-up Questions, the youngsters haven’t been asking us why.Kids, the 90s are a significant part of it.A fantastically bleak epoch of pop culture archives gen X’s cold war terrors of the 1980s, but the youngest of us were only nine when the 1990s kicked off with the first Gulf war. Bombs rained on the Middle East, with American boots on the ground and genuine fear of nuclear escalation. I was 15 and finally phoned that boy I liked only because I’d been watching the news and was convinced I had nothing to lose, we were all going to die.If your trips to the pool were unchaperoned, it was because in the wake of stagflation and globalisation male-breadwinner models of household income were suddenly unstable and it wasn’t so much feminist destiny asneoliberal necessitythat drove even white ladies from the suburbs en masse into full-time work. Highlights of the TV news kids watched with their grandparents included: Iraq, an entire decade of Yugoslav wars, the LA riots (1992), the standoff at Waco (1993), the OJ Simpson trial, the Oklahoma City bombing and Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination (all 1995) and Pakistan becoming a nuclear state (1998).Biting neoliberal doctrinesof mass casualisation, smashed unions, public service layoffs and privatisation meant that “no frills” car trip holidays were all many working- and middle-class families could reasonably afford. And if you were biking around aimlessly, it was because Francis Fukuyama had announced in 1992 it was never going to get better than this … and turned out to be wrong inthe worst possible way.Kathryn Jezer-Morton pinpoints “90s summer” nostalgia as simply grasping for the memory of unstructured time before the “gaping maws” of mobile internet and social media swallowed it; she rightly identifies “anxiety over screen management” as the modern parenting crisis. Australia’s upcoming social media ban for kids iswildly popularand yet may become even more so, given Jezer-Morton’s revelation that American families now drop up to $5,500 US on two-week summer camps to just keep their kids screen-free.There’s something even more insidious about the relationship of our phones to nostalgia. “Remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were,” as a man once said to a madeleine. The main character of our memories is ever a subjective take our earlier selves.Our obsession with spoiling pets has gone too far: your dog doesn’t care if its collar is from Burberry | Van BadhamRead moreIf gen X remembers the 90s with stark contrast to millennials, it may be because the handheld doom machines are profoundly affecting the way we understand – or don’t understand – the past.An emerging body of scholarship has identified the corrupting effects of new tech on memory and recall. Digital photographycollapses the boundary between past and present, rendering the past as immediate, retrievable, portable and available. It places viewers in a loop of ongoing memory reactivation. The irony of this is that distance – and, with it, reflection –become harder to achieve, an effect made worse by thequantitative overloadof storing so much material. Meanwhile, knowing it canoutsource its histories, the brain encodes fewer details. The combined result makes memory less about accuracy and more about theemotional management of the overwhelm; suppressing trauma, reinforcing denial or romanticising difficult realities. The photographs don’t teach history to the viewer; they are recruited to the viewer’s narrative.The selective exclusions and recontextualisations are how millennials might remember the era of the Srebrenica genocide (per The Cut) as “the last time ‘things were good’”.They’re also why “Make America Great Again” is so mobilising as a political mission and so disastrous as a policy framework. Weaponising nostalgia can grip a psychology but it can’t change the facts underneath.Alas, one glance at today’s headlines and no one should wonder why Americans might want to escape back to their “90s summers”. The past is,after all, another country. They do things differently there.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaOpinionTikTokcommentShareReuse this content"

But it is the truth.The way superannuation is mostly covered by the media in this country is about how to avoid paying tax and how to use it to fund inheritance.Takethe headlinethis week in Nine newspapers “money column”: “We have $8m in an SMSF. How can we avoid the new super tax?”You could hardly find a more pointed example of everything wrong with Australia’s media and economic system.What could Albanese do to improve productivity? Here is a short, non-exhaustive list | Greg JerichoRead moreI look forward to the SMH and others providing advice on how people on jobseeker can work for cash to avoid losing any benefits and paying extra tax.Similarly, it doesn’t take long for any story about the proposed changes to the tax breaks on superannuation balances over $3m to mention inheritance. That’s because $3m is so far beyond what anyone needs to retire comfortably that only the most self-delusional think they need more than that to survive. Heck, the main way Peter Dutton criticised the changeswas to label thema “quasi inheritance tax”.The best one of the genre is anAFR headline: “New $3m super tax is ‘stealing my children’s inheritance’”. You might expect that from the AFR but you would hope for better from the ABC.On Tuesday night,ABC’s 7.30 reportedon a pair of farmers who were worried about the changes to the superannuation tax breaks because the combined balances of the couple was $5.5m and so might soon have a combined $6m (ie more than $3m each).The 7.30 story had no mention of inheritance but the written versionnotedthat “the money isn’t only being used to fund their retirement. The plan is for it to help fund the inheritances of their other children without necessitating selling off the family farm.”Let’s stop right there.We don’t give tax breaks on superannuation so that you can fund the inheritance of your children.Tattoo that on your eyeballs.Superannuation tax breaks are designed to encourage you to save so you do not need to rely on the age pension. It is not so your kids can get a head start in life. That might be a nice thing for you to do but there is zero public benefit in giving you a tax break to do it.5:26Are Labor's proposed superannuation tax changes a super big deal? – videoThe story also contained the claim by the couple’s son that “Mum and Dad will be up for an extra $120,000 a year”.According to the report, the extra tax was due to the anticipated unrealised capital gain of the farming assets (the wind turbines and the agricultural chemical businesses) once the couple’s super balance passed $6m (ie $3m each).Well now. If your Spidey senses are tingling, you should be a journalist. Because that seems a rather bold claim.Consider that to pay $120,000 in tax on just plain old income you need to earn $342,000 a year.If the graph does not display click hereGiven the average tax on that is 35.1%, we know that cannot be the case for super, because super earnings are only taxed at 15% until the balance goes above $3m and then the earnings attributable to the amount above $3m are taxed at 30% – both below 35%.So, for that claim to be true, the earnings on their superannuation (including unrealised capital gains) would need to be well over $342,000.How much? Well, the Treasury has given us a handyfact sheetthat lets us work it out.For one person with a $3m super balance, their fund would need to increase by $2m for them to have to pay an extra $120,000 (yes, just a 6% tax rate).But what if the $120,000 is combined?In that case, both their funds would need to grow in a year from $3m to $4.3m. Each would pay$60,035 on that $1.3m unrealised gains. Yep, a tax rate of just 4.6% each.If the graph does not display click hereConsider as well that an ordinary income earner pays an average tax rate of 4.6% when they earn just $25,500.Those with super balances of over $3m arestillgetting a tax break because if it was taxed like normal income they would pay 45% tax not 30%. These tax breaks cost money. Money that the government has decided it is better to spend than, for example, to include dental in Medicare.Let’s do some maths.The cost of putting dental in Medicare, which would include “preventative and therapeutic dental services, including regular check-ups and teeth cleans, crowns, orthodontic treatment, oral surgeries, periodontics and prosthodontics” is estimated bythe Parliamentary Budget Officeto be $13.63bn in the first year.That is a lot of money.But not compared to how much each year the government gives in tax breaks to the richest 10% on their superannuation – most of whom will not be eligible of the age pension, and thus are getting a tax break for no public good, and much of which will go towards inheritance.In 2025-26, the Treasury estimates these breaks will cost the budget $22bn.If the graph does not display click hereWhen the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, was asked about dental in Medicare during the election campaignhe told reportersthat “we’ve got to make sure that we can afford it and make sure there’s room for it in the budget”.OK, then. Let’s not cut all the super tax concessions for the richest 10%. Let’s still give them $8bn a year in tax breaks to help ensure they have stonks more money than they need for retirement.Great, we have now found room in the budget to pay for dental in Medicare.Dental in Medicare or tax breaks to the richest so they can give money tax-free to their kids?Budget and governing are about choices, and so too is how the media covers it.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsTaxGrogonomicsAustralian economySuperannuationMedicare AustraliacommentShareReuse this content"

It was a passionate speech, laced with detail. His target was the serving conservative PM, Mariano Rajoy, and his central argument for ousting Rajoy was the widespread corruption in the governing party,which Spain’s highest criminal courthad confirmed just days earlier.“Corruption acts as a corrosive and profoundly harmful force for any nation. It erodes society’s trust in its leaders and consequently weakens the authority of the state. But it also strikes at the very root of social cohesion,”Sánchez said. “Corruption undermines faith in the rule of law when it is left to run rampant or when there is no political response commensurate with the harm caused. Ultimately, corruption destroys trust in institutions, and more profoundly, in politics itself, when there is no decisive reaction grounded in exemplary conduct.”Sánchez promised “democratic renewal” and higher standards. But seven years on, here we are, facing yet anothercorruption scandal, this time implicating senior figures in his own party. Allegations against party and government officials include kickbacks from companies that were awarded public contracts. Some ofthe business figuresinvolved even worked for corporations named in the cases that toppled Rajoy.To make matters worse, the affair has exposed worrying levels ofmachismo, with leaked audio tape emerging in which crude remarks about women andsex workersare exchanged.Sánchez has apologised to the public repeatedly,distancing himselfand the Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE) from those under investigation and launching an internal audit. He insists this is not a party-wide issue. But the damage is already done.We still don’t know the full scope of the scandal, whether those alleged to have been involved acted for personal enrichment, for the benefit of the party, or both. Crucially, it’s still unclear whether the prime minister had any knowledge of what was going on. Sánchez firmly denies any knowledge and has dismissed the two figures at the centre of the scandal, both longtime allies: José Luis Ábalos, a former minister and now independent MP, and Santos Cerdán, one of the prime minister’s closest associates and a leading figure in the PSOE. Both men have denied any wrongdoing.Whatever comes next, it is staggering that nearly 50 years after Spain’s return to democracy – this November marks the anniversary of Francisco Franco’s death – corruption keeps polluting politics.‘The final countdown’: Spanish PM Pedro Sánchez fights for his political lifeRead moreThe first big political scandals of the democracy era happenedunder the socialist prime minister Felipe González, at a time when the new administration was still immature. There was a low bar for public scrutiny and a poor regulatory framework for the booming economy of the 80s and early 90s.But, even after public contrition and supposed lessons learned, the list of corruption scandals has kept growing – particularly, but not only, within Spain’s two mainstream parties. What’s the excuse now?Beyond the kickbacks affair, Sánchez is also contending withinvestigations related to his wife and his brother. They all deny wrongdoing, and these claims appear thinner than others, but the political toll adds up.Meanwhile, the conservative People’s party (PP) is still tainted by very serious scandals. The most notorious isGürtel, a vast corruption networkinvolving kickbacks for public contracts that led tohigh-profile convictionsof party officials and businessmen.In Madrid, the regional president’s partner is beingprosecuted for tax fraud and other charges. This case has also morphed into alegal battle with the attorney generalover media leaks.So why does this keep happening in Spain?Part of the answer lies in the lack of strong rules and independent oversight to hold politicians and other public officials accountable. Parliamentary checks are weak, transparency standards are low and the sanctions against companiescomplicit in corruption are insufficient. Oversight bodies are frequently toothless or politicised, and ethical codes are either vague or unenforced. This vacuum creates fertile ground for impunity.Sánchez continues to speak of “democratic renewal”. However, like his predecessors, he has made no real effort to establish independent bodies to oversee public appointments, regulate lobbying, enforce transparency rules or protect whistleblowers. Even a basic register of lobbyists remains absent.Sánchez is right when he says that not all politicians are the same. But his coalition government, now with only a slim majority in parliament, has fallen short in delivering the kind of reforms needed to make people see that tarring every politician with the same brush is unfair.Sánchez has often expressed concerns about misinformation and low-quality journalism – certainly issues in Spain, as in many European countries – but he has failed to strengthen the independence of the public broadcaster, as he promised in his speech in 2018. In fact, the oversight boardhas been further politicised.Civio, anews outlet focused on transparency, is taking the government to court over its refusal to disclose the names of political advisers.Spanish PM apologises to voters after MP resigns over corruption allegationsRead moreThese shortcomings were highlighted just weeks ago by theCouncil of Europe’s anti-corruption watchdog, Grecowhich criticised Spain’s slow pace in adopting previous recommendations, such as tougher oversight of “revolving doors” and party financing.The PP hasn’t even been particularly eager either to strengthen transparency or public scrutiny, perhaps calculating that the system could serve its interests if it returns to power.Miriam González Durántez, founder of the civic group España Mejor, which advocates for reform, submitted a draft ethics code to 400 public institutions and officials after touring regional and local government across Spain for months of research. As of March, not a single one had committed to adopting her proposals,she said.No wonder there has been a collapse in public trust. Surveys consistently show that Spaniards, more than people in other European democracies, view political parties and politicians among theleast trustworthy of their institutions. According to theReuters Institute 2025 Digital News Report, 57% of Spaniards identify politicians as the main source of disinformation, 10 percentage points above the global average of the 48 countries in the study.This pervasive disappointment must weaken political engagement, fuel apathy and feed populist and even authoritarian movements.As the PSOE grapples with its current troubles, a familiar question remains unanswered: is this a case of a few rotten apples, or evidence of deeper rot? But the answer may not even matter to such a disillusioned public. Spain doesn’t just need a wave of resignations or dismissals, but structural reforms – oversight of public officials, tighter party finance rules, effective enforcement and a culture shift toward real accountability.Without that, this won’t be the last scandal. It will simply be the last one before the next.María Ramírez is a journalist and the deputy managing editor of elDiario.es, a news outlet in SpainDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Don’t dare do this in our nameWed 25 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 06.59 EDTSharePride has never been apolitical, but in recent years, particularly after the Israeli occupation’s onslaught on the Gaza Strip after 7 October 2023, the coalition of queer rights in the west has felt increasingly fractured.In Berlin, the city I call home, Pride events have splintered along political lines as Palestine has been a recurring point of contention.According to organisersof Internationalist Queer Pride Berlin (IQP Berlin), a split between two major alternative Pride events followed an incident in which the initial organisers called police to the event after participants expressed solidarity by chanting “free Palestine”. Meanwhile, at Berlin’s official Pride parade, attenders have previouslywaved rainbow and Israeli flagsas they marched through Berlinalongside an Israeli embassy float.At last year’s IQP Berlin, the Palestine bloc was one of the largest. Jews and Arabs walked side-by-side, wrapped in Palestinian keffiyeh scarves, flanked by German police.The eventfaced police pushback, including officers in full riot gear wielding batons and shields. At least 25 people were detained, with the Palestine bloc being key targets for the police.Despite these displays of solidarity, and the risks of repression protesters have faced, there have been those who have sneered at the idea that queer people can find common cause with Palestine and advocate for liberation. The most popular example of this came last year when US pop star Chappell Roan criticised the Biden administration for its arming of the Israeli military. On stage at theGovernor’s Ball festival in New York, the singer, who is a lesbian with a drag persona,turned down an offerfrom the White House to perform for Pride month, saying: “We want liberty, justice and freedom for all. When you do that, that’s when I’ll come.”Roan’s show of solidarity drew the ire of talkshow host Bill Maher, who suggested the singer would be “thrown off a roof in Gaza”, invoking an oft-used cliche based on a video that has been debunked byReutersandAFP,among others.He went on to make punchlines about Roan’s career “blowing up” like pagersin Lebanon,referring to Israeli attacksthat killed 12 people and wounded thousands. Hundreds of children were killed in the following months in Lebanon, thousands in Gaza. Maher postured as the liberal hero of queer people, but it seemed easier for him, like many in the west, to point fingers at Palestinian society than to confront the systems his own countries support – systems that bomb, displace and isolate queer Palestinians in Gaza.WhenBenjamin Netanyahu addressed congress in July 2024, the Israeli prime minister said that pro-Palestine protesters holding up signs saying “gays for Gaza” might as well call themselves “chickens for KFC”, suggesting our existence is mired in contradiction.That attempt to sever solidarity between queer people and Palestine has been deadly. A year earlier, an Israeli soldierheld up a Pride flag in Gaza, with “in the name of love” scrawled on it in English, Hebrew and Arabic. The state of Israel’s official X accountboasted of this achievement, “the first ever pride flag raised in Gaza”. As a queer Palestinian, it is enraging to see my identity used as an instrument of war, but what I find most strange is the cognitive dissonance: for the “love” of whom is this flag raised? Certainly not of the queer Palestinians living in Gaza, who have faced 19 months of terror, and a lifetime of occupation.In Jerusalem, the city where I was baptised, there is a very small organic scene of queer Palestinians. Some Palestinians from the city even visit Tel Aviv for Pride if they are allowed to travel there. Most are not. Queer Palestinians all face different obstacles based on where they live and how visible they are; their pain lives precariously in the crossfire of multiple struggles.One friend inGazatold me he only wished to live in peace, away from conservatism, religious extremism and war. I later discovered he lost both of his parents and his brother, as well as cousins, in Israel’s onslaught. Another friend from Jerusalem told me he had a message for the west: that freedom comes in many layers. “We are under occupation and facing an ongoing genocide,” he said. “So the first layer is simply to exist.”We can imagine and hope for a just, safe world for queer Palestinians to flourish in. Though there are some vibrant, if quieter, queer communities across the Middle East, there is still persecution. But if the goal is for queer Palestinians to live in an open, tolerant society, then they need first to survive Israel’s aggression. There can be no Pride under occupation.There are Palestinian LGBTQ+ organisations such asalQawsandAlwanwith aspirations to shape a Palestinian society based on tolerance, equality and openness. An ambition that is made so much harder, if not impossible, by occupation.You can’t see rainbows from underneath the rubble. Equally, you cannot in good conscience celebrate Pride in the west while knowing that many of our countries are supplying the arms and funds that are killing queer Palestinians, along with their families. Despite attempts to position the struggles of queer rights as in opposition to Palestinian liberation, I have been moved to see queer people not fall for the trap.

There are two broad, competing theories. The natural-origins hypotheses suggest the pandemic began when a close relative of Sars-CoV-2 jumped from a wild animal to a humanthrough the wildlife trade. In contrast, proponents of lab-leak theories argue that the virus emerged when Chinese scientists became infected through research-associated activities.A perplexing aspect of the controversy is that prominent scientists continue to publish studies in leading scientific journals that they say provide compelling evidence for the natural-origins hypotheses. Yet rather than resolving the issue, each new piece of evidence seems to widen the divide further.In many parts of the world, includingthe US,Franceand Germany, public opinion is increasingly shifting towards lab-leak theories, despite the lack of definitive evidence. In other words, a growing number of people believe that research-associated activities are just as likely, if not more so, to have caused the pandemic.A new documentary by the Swiss film-maker Christian Frei, titled Blame: Bats, Politics and a Planet Out of Balance, places the blame for this divide squarely on the so-called “rightwing fever swamp”, including the likes of Steve Bannon and Fox News. According to Frei, it promotes misinformation and conspiracy theories about the origins of Covid-19 for political gain, thereby confusing and misleading the public.As a participant in the film and a journalist who has spent the past five years writing a book on the origins of emerging diseases, I must respectfully disagree.At its core, the controversy is not a left-right issue, but a symptom of deeply entrenched public distrust of science. By framing it along the political divide – and by cherrypicking extreme examples to suit its narrative, the documentary does a disservice to the public interest.This is not to deny that the question of the pandemic’s origins has been politicised from the outset. It was indeed challenging for left-leaning scholars such asthe biosafety expert Filippa Lentzos of King’s College London to speak openly about the plausibility of lab-leak scenarios, because they risked being perceived asaligning with a rightwing agenda.However, many outspoken left-leaning researchers like Lentzoshave been key drivers of lab-leak theories. While researching my book, I encountered numerous credible and well-respected experts on emerging diseases who also believe the question of Covid-19 origins isfar from settled. Their views are grounded in decades of professional expertise.Far from a rightwing fever swamp, these scholars have lent scientific legitimacy to the debate. They are not convinced that the studies published in leading scientific journals supporting natural-origins theories are as compelling as the authors have claimed. Plus the studies are based on limited data as a result of China’s lack of transparency and limited political will to investigate, making significant uncertainties unavoidable.Few people would claim with absolute certainty to know how the pandemic began. Both sides are gathering evidence to support their case, yet neither can fully rule out the possibility put forward by the other. This lack of clarity is not unlike what we see with most emerging diseases. For instance, we still don’t know how the devastating Ebola outbreak in west Africa began in 2014.The core issue behind the Covid-19 origins controversy is fundamentally a crisis of trust rather than a mere information problem. It reflects longstanding public anxieties over virus research. Strong emotions such as fear and distrust play a crucial role in human cognition. Simply presenting more facts doesn’t always lead to a converging of opinions – and can sometimes even widen the divide.Indeed, the storm of public distrust in virus research had been gathering long before the pandemic. In 2011, two research teamssparked public outcryby announcing thecreation of more transmissible variantsof H5N1 (bird flu). This led to a pause in US federal funding for research that makes viruses more transmissible or virulent, known as gain-of-function studies, and the establishment of a new regulatory framework.However, a profound sense of unease persisted, driven by the perception that virologists, funding agencies and research institutions had failed to sufficiently address public concerns and anxieties, coupled with a lack of transparency and inclusiveness in decision-making. The Covid-19 origins controversy sailed straight into the middle of this brewing storm.Did the virus originate from the kind of gain-of-function research that critics had long warned about? How might even the slightest possibility of this have influenced the behaviours of virologists, funding agencies and research institutions – prompting them to protect their reputations and preserve political backing?Some scientists assert evidence supporting natural-origins hypotheses with excessive confidence and show little tolerance for dissenting views. They have appeared eager to shut down the debate, repeatedly and since early 2020. For instance, when their work was published in the journal Science in 2022, they proclaimed the case closed andlab-leak theories dead. Even researchers leaning towards natural origins theories, such as the virus ecologist Vincent Munster of Rocky Mountains Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana, told me they lamented that some of their colleagues defend their theories “like a religion”.No one embodies the crisis of trust in science more than Peter Daszak, the former president of EcoHealth Alliance. A series of missteps on his part has helped to fuel public distrust. In early 2020, for instance, heorganised a statementby dozens of prominent scientists in the Lancet, which strongly condemned “conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin”, without disclosing his nearly two-decade collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Virology as a conflict of interest.Similarly, he denies that hisown collaboration with the Wuhan lab involved gain-of-function research, even though Shi Zhengli – the Chinese scientist who led the bat-borne coronavirus studies – has openly acknowledged thatthe lab’s work produced at least one genetically modified virus more virulent than its parental strain. (That work is not directly relevant to the origins of Covid-19.)The documentaryclaims that attacks on EcoHealth Alliance and the spread of lab-leak conspiracy theories have fuelled distrust in science. In reality, it’s the other way round: public distrust in science, fuelled by the unresolved H5N1 gain-of-function controversy and by lack of transparency and humility from scientists such asDaszak, has driven scepticism and increased support for lab-leak theories.Such errors of judgment and inappropriate behaviour, not uncommon among scientists and not limited to the Covid-19 origins debate, can affect how the public perceives scientists and the trustworthiness of their claims, and how people interpret evidence.As the social scientist Benjamin Hurlbut of Arizona State University puts it: the problem isn’t an anti-science public, but rather a scientific community that labels a sceptical public grappling with legitimate trust issues as anti-science or conspiracy theorists.A recentScience editorialstates that “scientists should better explain the scientific process and what makes it so trustworthy”. This reflects the persistent influence of the traditional “deficit model” of science communication, which assumes that trust can be built by providing mere information. But the public’s relationship with science goes beyond understanding facts or methods.Trust cannot be manufactured on demand. It must be cultivated over time through transparency, accountability, humility and relationship-building. Scientists must do more to earn it.Jane Qiu is an award-winning independent science writer in Beijing.

The role of senior managers is to stoutly resist that pressureSign up for Guardian Australia’s free weekly media newsletter hereWed 25 Jun 2025 00.49 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 01.29 EDTShareI can’t remember who said it, but I’ve never forgotten it.Someone was once being invited by a journalist to buy into a controversial issue. “Surely you must have a view!” demanded the journalist.“Of course I have a view,” came the reply. “What I don’t have is a comment.”Federal court rules ABC unlawfully terminated Antoinette Lattouf after ‘orchestrated campaign by pro-Israel lobbyists’Read moreI thought of that exchange again this morning as I considered the judgment in theAntoinette Lattouf case, a case comprehensively lost by the ABC after it was found to have terminated Lattouf from her on-air role at least partly because of her political opinions.At the centre of the case was a social media post from Lattouf described by the judge as “ill-advised and inconsiderate”. It shared the findings of a Human Rights Watch report about the use of starvation as a “weapon of war” by Israel in Gaza.Sometimes silence is golden, particularly when trying to maintain the impartiality of the ABC on controversial issues. And there is no doubt that, in the wake of the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas and the subsequent Israeli attack on Gaza, social media posts on the topic by ABC presenters are bound to be controversial. My advice, when I was the editorial director of the ABC, was generally that journalists and presenters should let their on-air work speak for them as far as possible.And so it’s understandable that Lattouf’s social media activity caused controversy and consternation. It is possible for people of good faith and common sense to differ in their views on whether Lattouf’s posts undermined the ABC’s impartiality. I happen to think they didn’t, and I also happen to think employing her in the first place was not a mistake.Sign up to get Guardian Australia’s weekly media diary as a free newsletterBut ultimately, none of that matters. The simple facts are that her on-air performance for the few days she presented the ABC Sydney morning program was impeccable, and none of her social media posts were ever found to have breached ABC policy.What did take place, however, was a campaign of complaints from the moment she began in the role, accusing her of being biased against Israel. That campaign was described by the judge in the case as “an orchestrated campaign by pro-Israel lobbyists to have Ms Lattouf taken off air”.The key issue was how the ABC behaved in the face of that campaign.1:29Antoinette Lattouf wins wrongful termination case against the ABC – videoThe ABC’sfirst editorial standardis about maintaining the broadcaster’s independence and integrity above all else. That means ensuring that editorial decisions are not improperly influenced by any outside interests, including political, sectional or commercial ones.In my years as the editorial director of the ABC, I saw many attempts to pressure or influence the ABC into making decisions. Often, they were decisions about what content the ABC ran, but sometimes they were about who the ABC employed, or who they should stop employing. I should hasten to add that there are many people who would argue that I was part of management decisions that buckled under that pressure. I hope that’s not the case, but that’s for others to judge.One thing I did try to do though, without exception, is to urge that decisions should be made calmly, carefully, and after following due process. That usually meant allowing the established complaints handling processes to deal with any allegations of bias, and ensuring that any staff accused of wrongdoing were given ample opportunity to respond, defend themselves and, more often than not, be provided with opportunities to learn and improve rather than being shown the door. Based on today’s judgment, that didn’t happen in the Lattouf case.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWeekly BeastFree weekly newsletterAmanda Meade's weekly diary on the latest in Australian media, free every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One of the reasons for the decision being made so quickly was pressure from both the then managing director, David Anderson, and the then chair of the ABC, Ita Buttrose, who wrote in an email about Lattouf that “we owe her nothing”.Put simply, the process failed all those involved. It failed the presenter herself, and it failed the test of law. Today’s judgment makes that painfully clear.People often laugh at the ABC’s sometimes cumbersome and slow-moving processes when dealing with complaints. And they are often right – they can always be improved and streamlined. But when the ABC, as so often is the case, becomes a pawn in the culture wars and is subjected to intense political or sectional pressure, those calm and considered processes are often all that stand between the ABC and perceptions of caving in to that pressure.Often, the biggest pressure I perceived inside the ABC was the pressure to make problems go away as soon as possible. At the highest levels of an organisation, the demand for a quick solution can be loud and insistent, all the more so as those calling for a quick fix don’t have to administer it themselves.In those situations, being able to point clearly to a policy that has been found to be breached after a process that is consistent and fair to everyone is the only thing preventing the perception of an organisation in retreat from its values and its people.The wheels of justice turn slowly, and so most of the key players involved in this sorry affair have now left the ABC. What lessons remain for the ABC itself, and for those who believe in brave and principled public broadcasting?Only to redouble the efforts in defence of independence, integrity and calmness under pressure. The world these days is filled with those who seek to control, bully and pressure public interest journalism in all its forms. The role of senior managers is to stoutly resist that pressure, and protect journalists from it as much as possible. A quick fix is rarely a good fix, and never the right fix.Alan Sunderland is a former editorial director of the ABCExplore more on these topicsAustralian mediaOpinionAustralian Broadcasting CorporationIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

The home price to income ratio, a key indicator of housing affordability, reflects this shift with stark clarity: today,Lisbon topsEurope’s housing unaffordability rankings. This trend extends to the national level. In 2015, Portugal ranked 22nd out of 27 EU countries for housing unaffordability. Today, it ranks first. In a country where 60% of taxpayers earn less than €1,000 a month, finding a rental below that price in the Portuguese capital is only possible if you’re willing to live in 20 sq metres – or less.To understand how Lisbon reached this point, we need to look back to the years following the 2008 global financial crisis. As part of its shock plan to revive the economy,Portugalembraced a strategy of aggressive liberalisation, aiming to put Lisbon – and the country – on the global map for real estate investment and tourism. The government implemented a familiar neoliberal formula: rental laws were relaxed, making evictions easier and tenancy agreements shorter; generous tax incentives were introduced for non-resident buyers, including the now controversial “golden visa” and “non-habitual resident” programmes; and investment funds were actively encouraged to enter the property market, benefiting from additional tax exemptions.At the same time, both the hotel industry and the short-term rental sector were promoted, alongside initiatives to attract visitors, digital nomads, international students, and transient young professionals from other countries. In the historic centre of Lisbon, Airbnb-style rentals havereached dramatic levels: half of all homes hold a short-term rental licence, and in the most tourist-saturated neighbourhoods, that figure climbs to 70 out of every 100. When measured against the city’s population, the number of short-term rentals in Lisbon represents a density six times higher than in Barcelona and 3.5 times higher than in London. Meanwhile, the number of hotels has tripled since 2010 – from around 100 to 300 – and the city council has already approved plans for around 50 more. This is a trend playing out across European cities and in southern Europe residents are pushing back as seen in the recent protests.Graphic of least affordable citiesThese changes happened in a global context of low interest rates in which affluent people increasingly turned to housing as a place to park their savings. For this type of individual investor, buying properties in Lisbon was a win-win: they could acquire assets to use as second homes in an attractive destination and obtain rental income while they are not in the city, while benefiting from both the appreciation of the property value and tax benefits. Storing of wealth in housing drives up prices as investors are willing to pay premium prices for safe assets – the median price of transactions made by foreign buyers in Lisbon is 82% higher than the price paid by domestic buyers.Before 2008, gentrification was largely absent from many central Lisbon neighbourhoods – areas primarily inhabited by poor, elderly residents living in deteriorating buildings. Investment certainly brought building rehabilitation, but it didn’t translate into residential stability. Despite the improvements, the centre of the city lost 25% of its population between 2011 and 2021. Across the municipality, of the dwellings built or renovated between during this period, only 56.5% serve as primary residences. The rest are either vacant, used as second homes, or converted into short-term rentals.All this contradicts the neoliberal supply and demand story as theescalation of property pricesis not linked to an actual demand for homes to live in and the formation of new households. Instead, what we see is that Lisbon is now on the radar of investors who use housing as a financial asset: a process where real estate is produced not to meet residential needs, but to maximise returns. In a context shaped by a flexible rental law, local landlords have capitalised on this shift, engaging in rentier practices by steadily raising rents and extracting increasing value from a shrinking pool of habitable homes.‘I have no neighbours’: overtourism pushes residents in Spain and Portugal to the limitRead moreThe result is a city that welcomes foreign wealth but excludes many of its own citizens, prioritising the desires of global consumers over the needs of local communities. The current housing crisis reflects a stark disconnect between wages and property prices – with housing costs approaching those of global cities in a country where salaries remain among the lowest in Europe. Beyond tourists, central Lisbon is now primarily occupied by a transnational class of young, mobile professionals – the new gentrifiers. Meanwhile, locals are increasingly being pushed out or forced to adapt by renting rooms instead of entire flats. At the same time, a growing share of household income is being consumed by housing costs, deepening social inequality and widening the gap between landlords and the broader population.Contrary to the neoliberal myth that the market alone can meet the needs of the population, Lisbon offers yet another example of market failure – at least for those who see housing as a place to live with dignity.Agustín Cocola-Gant is a research fellow at the Institute of Geography and Spatial Planning, Centre of Geographical Studies, University of LisbonExplore more on these topicsPortugalThe housing crisis in EuropeEuropeInequalityHousingcommentShareReuse this content"

What – whenit disappears– can set back children’s education, damage mental wellbeing, drive conflict within communities and become a vector for racial hatred?The humble donkey has rarely been in the spotlight. Yet Chinese demand for its skin proved so destabilising that African governments agreed toa continent-wide banon the slaughter of the animal for its hide last year. This week, officials are meeting in Ivory Coast to discuss implementation.A recentpaperby Dr Lauren Johnston of the University of Sydney outlines the extraordinary rise and fall of the Sino-African trade in donkey skins, and its repercussions. Ejiao – donkey hide gelatine – was first developed around 3,000 years ago and is used in traditional Chinese medicine, and more recently in beauty products. Longstanding demand was supercharged by growing prosperity and media influence, reportedly surging after characters in a popular Chinese TV period drama, Empresses in the Palace, were shown taking it. But while production of ejiao had been industrialised, a problem soon emerged: donkeys are notably hard to breed. Ejiao consumption equates to 4m to 5m hides per year, equivalent to almost a tenth of the global donkey population. China’s stock of animals plummeted from 11 million in the early 1990s to just 2 million – and attention turned to African hides.The continent is home to almost two-thirds of the world’s 53 million donkeys. Their use as beasts of burden there dates back even further than the invention of ejiao; owners describe them aspriceless. Despite governments’ attempts to regulate the trade in hides, there were repeated complaints not only of inhumane treatment but also crime; on one estimate, as many as a third of the exported hides were stolen. Families woke to find their animals had vanished, or been slaughtered and skinned on the spot.Many could not afford to replace them, because the price of new animals had soared. Without the creatures, women are often forced to carry heavy loads of firewood or water; children may be kept home to help with chores; families can no longer rent donkeys to neighbours, reducing their incomes. Former owners reported reduced wellbeing and increased stress. Some suspected their neighbours of stealing their donkeys, and in South Africa, online posts about Chinese gangs involved in the illicit trade attracted commentsinciting racial hatred. The African Union ban may tackle some of these problems. But it may also be shifting them. In Pakistan, the price of the animalshas rocketed.The case of the missing donkeys may sound like a niche concern but is really a particular instance of a pressing global issue. Oil and minerals may get the attention, but growing competition for resources – driven by increasing prosperity in economies such as China and India and the pace of consumer culture – can pop up in unexpected areas, hit the poorest hardest and create new diplomatic, social and economic tensions. Addressing such cases will take not only determination but ingenuity and a willingness to work with unlikely allies: Africa’s ban was driven by a coalition of farmers, animal rights campaigners, economists, gender activists, religious leaders and others. It will also need to be done at speed. The donkey shock is not a one-off, but a warning of other potential flashpoints ahead.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For some, it was simply too timely. After all, it’s one thing to release a film about tech billionaires fighting over the remnants of a world ravaged by war and AI, but quite another to do it while that exact thing was really happening.For others, Mountainhead marked the point where ultra-rich antiheroes reached full saturation. Writing in theAV Clublast week, Saloni Gajjar made the argument that – between Mountainhead, Your Friends & Neighbors, The White Lotus and Nine Perfect Strangers – we have now arrived at a moment where television seems unable to tell stories that are about anything but the badly behaved rich.Tech-bro satire Mountainhead is an insufferable disappointmentRead moreGajjar’s point is well made, but I think the truth might be a little bit more insidious than that. Yes, we do appear to be in the middle of an unceasing wealth glut on television, but the problem isn’t just rich antiheroes. It’s the rich, full stop.If you watch enough TV, you might have noticed a slow creep of aspiration. Houses are getting bigger. Clothes are becoming more stylish. Home furnishings have become so universally luxe that no matter what I’m watching – Shrinking, maybe, or The Four Seasons – I’ll almost always find myself detaching from the plot to wonder where the characters bought their nice lamps.And once you start to notice it, you’ll see it everywhere. The Better Sister is a generic murder mystery that is impossible to engage with because everyone lives their lives in a heightened state of monied comfort. Sirens is a whirlwind of impeccable interiors and not much else.View image in fullscreenSarah Jessica Parker in And Just Like That.Photograph: HBONobody on And Just Like That has spent even a second worrying about money, even though Carrie Bradshaw has basically got the exact same job as me and I can barely make it halfway around Lidl without having a panic attack about exceeding my overdraft. When I watched Good American Family, my first thought wasn’t ‘How awful that these people abandoned their infant daughter alone in an apartment while they moved to Canada,’ but ‘How the hell did these people afford an entire separate apartment for their infant daughter?’And this is the problem. At least when the rich people are the baddies you can argue that the shows are attempting to make a point about them. Succession essentially trapped its characters within the confines of their wealth. They might have it all, the show said, but only because they had to cash in their souls. And whileThe White Lotushas to return to the same well too many times by dint of its format, it still has plenty to say about the wealthy. This year, especially, it was the newly wealthy. Watch how quickly Belinda, a lowly spa manager in season one, traded in all of her defining traits the moment a windfall hit her account.I’d even argue that Mountainhead didn’t qualify as wealth porn, because every single character was caught up in a frantic, exhausting status game to the exclusion of everything else in their lives. True, it featured a massive house but, as Variety’s recentgroup interviewrevealed, they only chose it because it made the cinematographer want to kill himself. I’m no expert, but I don’t think that the appeal of porn is how many suicidal tendencies it triggers.View image in fullscreenRamy Youssef in Mountainhead.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All Rights Reserved.In other words, depictions of extreme wealth on TV are OK if they have a point. All these shows had a point. Billions had a point. Even Schitt’s Creek managed to say something about money. The problem is when this wears away and characters are only rich because producers want to give the viewer something nice to look at. Sometimes this shift even happens on the same series. The Morning Show might have started as a glossy satire about Reese Witherspoon’s plucky reporter being thrust into the well-to-do world of New York media, but it lost that bite long ago. Now it exists as a weird kind of internal competition to see which character can have the shiniest hair.And it’s this Selling Sunset-ification of television that needs to stop. When we’re confronted with such an unyielding parade of upscale comfort, the effect isn’t as aspirational as producers probably think. We aren’t left with a growling envy of how the other half lives; we’re instead left worrying that they wouldn’t know what real life was like if you bonked them over the head with a Poundland flipflop. Although if anyone from The Four Seasons does want to get in touch to tell me where all their nice lamps came from (and, where possible, some acceptable Temu dupes) I’d appreciate it.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionUS televisionThe White LotusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had only shotOasisat the Q awards and live shows. In 2001, I was commissioned by a US publication for a feature about The US tour of Brotherly Love, with Oasis, the Black Crowes and Spacehog. All the bands had two brothers in them, and I had been asked to photograph the Gallaghers and the Robinsons from the Black Crowes together.The shoot was at the Scala in King’s Cross, London. It was peak Oasis, but there was no entourage, nobody watching over my shoulder. There was also literally nowhere to shoot in the venue. I ended up finding a corridor with a white wall and I thought: “I’ll try and make this look as much like a studio as possible.”I think Liam was holding a can of Red Stripe and they were smoking. I started taking shots of them all together and then, being a savvy photographer, made sure I did lots of the Gallaghers on their own. It is very rare that you see pictures of them laughing: Noel’s almost rolling his eyes. I wasn’t really tuned into what they were saying – and I might not have even been able to hear. I certainly wasn’t the one making them laugh.I was chuffed to get the chance to shoot them, but I felt like Liam had quite a front, and I couldn’t really connect with him. I remember thinking: “The shots are OK.” Now they feel a lot more classic – black and white, very contrasty – but that’s something that only happens with the passing of time.‘I thought Noel was the tour manager’Chris FloydView image in fullscreen‘Every phone call was the same: “All right, seen our kid? OK, bye”’ … Noel in 1994 by Chris Floyd.Photograph: Chris FloydBack at the very start of my career, when I was 25, I knew an art director who was working on a new magazine called Loaded. In May 1994, he rang and said: “I’ve got a job for you.” He gave me the address of a hotel somewhere in Manchester and told me to meet a guy called Noel Gallagher. I thought he was a tour manager, at first. Nobody said he was actually in the band.The hotel was like an Edwardian house: the place was so depressing. The receptionist had that Mancunian ambivalence, very downbeat. I said I’m here to see Noel Gallagher and she gesticulated with her thumb. So I go down this corridor, knock on the door. He answers and just goes: “All right?” That’s it, devoid of any warmth.He’d split up with his girlfriend and they’d shared a flat, so the record company were paying for him to live at the hotel. He had this little pocket address book and was making phone calls. Each one was the same: “All right, seen our kid? OK, bye.” I was sitting there like a lemon thinking: “What is ‘our kid’?” So I thought: “I’ll just take some pictures.” Then he got up and said: “Let’s go.” As we were leaving, he stopped and said: “What do you think of Blur?” And I went: “I quite like them.” “Second-best band in Britain,” he said.We walked to this street corner and then four guys came from the opposite direction. You could identify the leader from 200 yards away, because he had this unbelievable walk. It was mad experiencing that walk. I quickly gathered Noel and Liam were brothers. They spoke to each other in such a relentlessly passive aggressive way. Noel would tut and roll his eyes at everything Liam said.Liam asked me what football team I supported. I said Arsenal. He put his hand up to my face and went: “I can’t even look at you.” For the actual shoot, we went to Maine Road [then Manchester City’s home]. I got on the ground and he made as if he was kicking a football at the camera.Before that day, I had been living a very precarious existence. Afterwards, I started to get a lot of well-paid work. My wife’s best friend knows Noel and a couple of years ago we both went to a birthday dinner at her house. I said to Noel: “I often think of that photo as the day my career started.” He goes: “I’ll tell you why that’s the day your career began – because that’s the day you met Oasis.”‘They weren’t yobby – I found them quite sensitive’Kevin CumminsView image in fullscreen‘In Tokyo, fans were wearing Man City shirts’ … Liam in 1994 by Kevin Cummins.Photograph: Kevin Cummins/Iconic ImagesBands – especially ones with a pretty boy singer or a female singer – can get really nervous that the singer gets all the attention. Noel was never like that. He said: “You’ve got to use the assets you’ve got.” Liam was a really attractive young boy at the time. You put that on the cover of a paper, you’re going to sell a lot.Early on, I was asked by their label, Creation, to get Oasis used to being photographed and work out what kind of image suited them – whether we wanted a modern look or a 1960s vibe. I was from Manchester originally and Noel, Liam and I supported Manchester City, so the label thought I was the person to ease them into it. Bands are normally a little bit cocky when they first start, but Oasis weren’t. They were like: “Oh, I love those pictures you did of Joy Division.” So they were kind of in awe of me initially.In July 1994, we went to Manchester to do a big session for the NME. A couple of people at the NME were obsessed with the Beatles and wanted Oasis to be a bit like that, but I didn’t really see that in them. They weren’t yobby – they were quite sensitive, I felt – but by the same token, they were lads who went to watch football. And those were the people who liked the band.We went to Maine Road to do some photographs. This picture was taken from the steps of the entrance to the stadium. I like it because it’s very monotone. Liam’s shirt is pretty much reflected in the painted brickwork around the ground. At the time, City were sponsored by Brother, a Japanese electronics company, and to have “Brother” on the shirts was an absolute gift. We did a lot of pictures of the band in the Manchester City shirts that day. That was meant to be the cover of the NME, but my editor said: “I don’t want them to be associated with losers” – because City were about to get relegated.Even now, people associate that shirt with the band. It was interesting because football wasn’t fashionable in the way it is now – and it wasn’t glamorous at all. It was very difficult for people outside the UK to get football shirts from English clubs but in Tokyo, fans in the front four rows of their shows were wearing Man City shirts. They must have written to the club and had them imported.‘Liam looked after a woman’s kid on the plane’Tom SheehanView image in fullscreen‘I think Liam bought the top in homage to John Lennon’ … Oasis in 1994 by Tom Sheehan.Photograph: Tom SheehanIn 1994, I was chief photographer for Melody Maker and that July I flew to New York for the Maker’s first Oasis cover. We were booked on the same flight, but the band were in club class and me and the hack were in goats-and-chickens. Liam came back to say hello. He was a garrulous guy, even pre-fame. He was standing at the back of the plane having a beer and this woman came by huffing and puffing with some kids and Liam offered to look after one of them. He pulled down one of those seats the flight attendants sit on and had the girl on his lap and chatted to her. After the tales I’d heard, I’d thought I was about to spend a few days with a nutcase. But he was sweet as a nut.We were out there for four days. They were shooting a video and doing a gig. This shoot was on the third day and we’d over-grooved the night before. It was punishingly hot. We got on the subway, we walked here, walked there, looking for a location, then this woman from the label said: “I know this place.” She took us to a disused bridge. It was amazing: you can see one of the greatest cities in the world behind the band. I think Liam bought the top in homage to John Lennon. There’s a picture that Bob Gruen took of Lennon wearing a similar shirt.They’re really good people. They had a tremendous professionalism, but they always had a cheekiness, too – and such a bloody great sense of humour. Especially Liam. He’s a good laugh, a tremendous piss-taker.‘How come you never fight when I’m around?’Jill FurmanovskyView image in fullscreen‘I was like a mother figure’ … Oasis in 1995 by Jill Furmanovsky.Photograph: Jill FurmanovskyI first met Oasis when I was finishing a book called The Moment. The book started with a picture of Paul McCartney taken on an Instamatic and I was looking for an up-and-coming band to end on. I sent Oasis all the live shots I’d taken of them at their gig at the Cambridge Corn Exchange and they really liked them. From then on, I started documenting them with their blessing.This was taken in Paris the first year I was working with them, at the end of 1995. We were supposed to meet them in Noel’s room but my assistant found Liam in the bar. It appeared he’d been up all night and was still drinking. Obviously, Noel was not in the greatest mood, having been kept waiting and then seeing that Liam was somewhat inebriated.I had done several shoots with them already, but never experienced the tension between the brothers that other photographers had recorded. I used to say to them: “How come you never fight when I’m around?” This wasn’t a fight, but it was a chance to document in a subtle way the dynamics. The brothers, who are looking in opposite directions, somehow they’re touching but they’re also so separate from each other.We were pursued by paparazzi, probably British, as we were walking along the banks of the Seine, which is where this was taken. Liam was a bit merry and was saying hello to French people. He is an unpredictable soul. He’s a joy to photograph, but a challenging person all round. I was very experienced – I’d worked with the punks – so wasn’t particularly fazed. I was quite a bit older than them, like a mother figure. That was useful because all of them were more or less brought up by their mums, so they were perhaps more likely to be cooperative with an older female.My brief from Noel was to just record stuff. They knew already that they couldn’t spend hours posing for shoots with fashion accessories and so on, but Noel had the intuition that whatever was happening to them should be documented. If it had been a band that were very protective of their public image, I think the shoot would have been cancelled that day. But Oasis weren’t like that. They permitted that closeness. I felt like part of the crew. That was the great joy of photographing them.Oasis: The Masterplan by Kevin Cummins is published by Cassell. Roll With it by Tom Sheehan is published by Welbeck.

But as Terry Deary tells me, with exactly the kind of relish you’d expect from the author of Horrible Histories, this particular drinks vessel belonged to the Victorian-era mass murderer Mary Ann Cotton. Believed to have killed 12 of her children, not to mention three husbands, she was finally caught after poisoning her stepson in 1872 with an arsenic-laced brew. “And in Beamish they’ve got the teapot!” says Deary. “I was blown away to hold it!”View image in fullscreenThe murderous drinks vessel … Mary Ann Cotton’s teapotPhotograph: Courtesy: Beamish MuseumHe’s talking about Beamish, the Living Museum of the North, an open-air site based in County Durham (just like Cotton herself, who was eventually hanged in Durham Gaol). Featuring an 1820s tavern, a 1900s pit village and colliery, a 1940s farm and a 1950s town – all populated by costumed staff – it’s something of a pioneer when it comes to immersive experiences, having first opened its doors 55 years ago. This year it’s one of five museums nominated for theArt Fund Museum of the Year award, a prestigious prize that has previously been won by The Burrell Collection in Glasgow, London’s Horniman Museum and Gardens and the Hepworth Gallery in Wakefield. With £120,000 available to the winner (and £15,000 to the other four finalists), it is the world’s largest museum prize.Deary’s love of Beamish, which is only down the road from him, extends to more than just a fascination with grisly murders. Back in the 1980s when he was working as an actor, he would take schoolchildren there and perform educational theatre in order to teach them “what war was about” – not the well-trodden story of the trenches but tales of bewildered soldiers returning home, and deserters.View image in fullscreenNot too nostalgic … a 1950s a electrical repair shop at Beamish.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianBeamish is considered important because it keeps alive memories of Britain’s industrial heritage. “But they’re not too nostalgic about it,” says Deary. “You can go into a pit, and it’s horrible! When I was a lad leaving school, they said I could become a coalminer, and after they sent me down a pit in the Sunderland area I was put off wanting to be a miner for life. I think Beamish dispels some of the glamour of the industrial era too.”From the humble teapot, then, to a piece of stone – although this is no ordinary piece of stone. “When you see it now, it glistens,” enthuses Scotland’s first minister John Swinney. He’s taking time out from a meeting in his Perthshire North constituency to tell me about Perth Museum and it’s prize possession: the Stone of Destiny.For almost three decades the stone had been on display at Edinburgh Castle, in rather dark conditions. Now it sparkles as pride of place in this museum that only opened in March 2024. “It’s one of the most epic symbols of the nationhood of Scotland,” says Swinney. Indeed, it was first recorded as being sat on by royalty in 1249, during the inauguration of the boy-king Alexander III. Fifty years later it was taken as war loot to Westminster Abbey by King Edward I of England – but now, 700 years later, it is finally back at its Perthshire home where it belongs.View image in fullscreen‘One of the most epic symbols of the nationhood of Scotland’ … the Stone of Destiny exhibition at Perth museum.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe museum is located in the former Perth City Hall, and Swinney remembers its previous life as the venue for the Scottish Conservative Conference, where Thatcher would turn up in her heyday to address the faithful. Now it has been refitted as the perfect venue to tell Perth’s – and Scotland’s – remarkable history. Inside you’ll find part of the Strathmore meteorite that exploded and scattered across Coupar Angus and Blairgowrie on a crisp December day in 1917. There’s the Pictish St Madoes cross-slab, which dates back to the eighth century. And for lovers of things that aren’t stones, Swinney is particularly fond of the Carpow logboat that is dated from around 1,000BCE. “It was found in the marshes of the River Tay and as you come into the museum it looks like it’s inside the river itself,” he says.Swinney thinks the museum shows us how “Scotland’s history is part of Scotland’s future” and it would be hard to deny it’s having an effect: Perth and Kinross Council have reported an average city centre footfall increase of 68% since the museum opened.Not all the museums on the list sell themselves on their exhibits. Cardiff’s Chapter has no historical stones or murderous teapots – in fact it has no permanent collection at all. And yet, as broadcaster Huw Stephens tells me, it’s been “at the heart of Cardiff’s creative scene since it opened in 1971”. Stephens talks me through the museum’s importance: how Pino Palladino (“the world’s greatest bassist”) would go and see live music there; Karl Hyde describing it as a key venue when he formed Underworld in the city with Rick Smith; the amazing work it does today with the city’s deaf community (Chapter hosts Deaf Gathering Cymru, Wales’ largest festival of D/deaf-led creative activity).View image in fullscreenAbsolutely integral to the city … Chapter in Cardiff.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianWith writers’ circles, artist’s studios, residencies, theatres and a cinema showing international films “that wouldn’t get shown in Cardiff otherwise,” Chapter is undeniably centred around art. From next week you will be able to see Jenő Davies and Iolo Walker’s Meadowsweet Palisade, an exhibition of film, sculpture and sound about renewal and rural spaces, whereas if you’ve got a little one you can currently have a go on the Feeding Chair, a touring artwork that invites parents and carers to feed their babies and young children in public venues.But speaking to Stephens makes you realise how much Chapter goes beyond that mandate. During school holidays they provide free meals to children, the museum has a no-questions-asked food bank and – in response to the cost of living crisis – they recently expanded their “pay what you can” pricing scheme.“This community spirit goes hand in hand with working alongside the creative sector in the city,” says Stephens. “You feel it instantly when you walk through Chapter’s doors.”In fact, so integral to Cardiff’s vibrancy is Chapter that Stephens struggles to imagine the city without it. “In many ways, it is our equivalent of the Southbank Centre. They have a busy garden, they host experimental music festivals … Cardiff would be a much duller, poorer place without Chapter.”Derry Girls star Tara Lynne O’Neill could say the same about Golden Thread inBelfast– not least because it helped her out during a difficult time. She had moved back to her home city 15 years ago following a period being a “very unemployed actor” in Dublin and she found that the museum’s free art workshops gave her an outlet to express her creativity and the chance to meet fellow art lovers. “It convinced me that I was very much in the right genre of art form,” she laughs. “I’m not talented visual-wise, but it was the community aspect of it, the meeting like-minded people. The accessibility was unbelievable, you know, because it was free!”View image in fullscreen‘ It makes such a difference for aspiring local artists’ … Golden Thread gallery in Belfast.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianGolden Thread opened in 1998, the same year the Good Friday Agreement was signed, and its collection doesn’t shy away from confronting the Troubles. Paul Seawright’s Sectarian Murder photography series visits spots where violent attacks took place and documents them as empty playgrounds, eerie grass verges and desolate fields. These unpeopled images, accompanied by text from local news reports documenting the attacks, serve as an act of remembrance – but also drives home the constant tension of the times and the chilling senselessness of it all.“It’s important that those stories are documented, but also that they have a permanent home,” says O’Neill. “The kids who watched Derry Girls don’t remember the Troubles. But looking at the paintings and how people expressed themselves during that time … I’d say art saved a lot of people. I think we forget a lot of the time that art isn’t just for sale. It’s not all about being a commercial thing.”Golden Thread, which recently moved to a new home in the city centre and boasts just one full-time staff member, is equally concerned with the city’s brighter future. O’Neill remembers seeing Susan Hiller and Shirin Neshat’s recent multimedia show Can You Hear Me? and thinking how wonderful it would have been to have had access to something like that when she was a working-class kid growing up in the city. “My idea of a museum was somewhere stuffy and full of old things,” she says. “I never would have thought a gallery would play video. It’s that whole thing of ‘if you can see it, then you can be it’. It makes such a difference for aspiring local artists to know that they can end up having their work on show in a gallery.”View image in fullscreen‘A cross between the Wallace Collection and White Cube’ … Compton Verney in Warwickshire.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianIf this list contains a variety of museums, from the traditional to the experimental, then Prue Leith believes her choice – Compton Verney in Warwickshire – touches all bases. “It’s like a cross between the Wallace Collection and the White Cube gallery,” she says. “They have this amazing collection of Chinese bronzes, probably one of the best in the world, and then you’ll walk a few rooms down and find some crazy installation. I remember going there once and there were all these upside down umbrellas stuck to the ceiling.” Currently on display is Emma Talbot’s multimedia extravaganza exploring the experience of life from birth to death.Leith is a fan of the museum’s serious collection of folk art (“which is normally considered as very inferior”) and recalls being beyond wowed by an exhibition of Picasso’s drawings there (“illuminating”). During a showing of Dutch sculptor Grinling Gibbons’ carvings, she was thrilled to get a peek at some of the works being transported in specially made boxes lined with “all sorts of padding and polystyrene.” That gets to the heart of her love for Compton Verney. It may be a Grade I-listed 18th century mansion showing international masterpieces, but it’s also small and friendly enough that you can ask staff questions about how the works travelled. “They’re receptive to telling you about behind the scenes stuff.”Leith says the activities for families and kids are exceptional – from stone carving to bat walks – and she raves about the grounds, which sets a sculpture park (featuring works by Sarah Lucas and Larry Achiampong) within 120 acres of Capability Brown parkland, proving once more that a great museum is about more than just what it has in its collection.“Everybody I’ve ever taken has been astonished,” she marvels. “I mean, even if you weren’t interested in art, it’s worth going there just for the trees!”The winner will be announced on 26 June at a ceremony at the Museum of LiverpoolExplore more on these topicsMuseumsExhibitionsAwards and prizesCardiffBelfastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a delightful jaunt down the East River that raises questions such as: who from your local music scene would you save in a Titanic scenario? Tipsy people totter across the Liberty Belle’s promenade decks,some partaking in the loosie cigarettes and poppers available for purchase. A magician is somewhere on board, blowing minds with sleight of hand tricks. Below deck, the band’s Rachel Brown and Nate Amos seem to have found their sea legs: a mosh pit erupts as they rip into Life Signs, the playfully proggy lead single from their forthcoming album, It’s a Beautiful Place.The band treat the annual excursion as a bit of a joke, albeit one they have actively participated in for three years. Sometimes it feels as if WFYE is all about pulling off harebrained ideas. “Nothing is more of a letdown in a creative scenario than achieving exactly what you set out to make,” says Amos. “Where’s the fun in that?” So, the next day, we head to the woods upstate. The band are noted Red Hot Chili Peppers fans and Brown, who studied film-making in college andmakes videosfor peers such as dance punksModel/Actriz, is helping stage a video directed by the band’s friend James Dayton for new song Playing Classics – a dance track whose lyrics were inspired by Life Without Buildings and Charli xcx – that pays homage to the By the Way video. After following a long dirt road plastered with “do not enter” signs, we end up talking to a confused shopkeeper in a trailer filled with fireworks. “Do you know the Red Hot Chili Peppers? Not, like, personally,” Brown asks earnestly. “CanI show you a video andyou tell me the best way to recreate it?”Adventurousness and commitment to the bit is central to the WFYE ethos. Since forming in 2016, the duo have relished in twisting simple concepts towards playful ends. Brown and Amos started making music together – and dating – while living in Chicago back in 2016. Inspired by New Order, they made melancholic dance music, albeit written “from the perspectives of animals and background movie characters,” says Brown.No longer romantically involved by 2019, the pair were living in Brooklyn and performing regularly at DIY spots, experiences that encouraged them to make bolder choices. As Brown says: “Nate started bringing in 15-minute collages instead of little pop songs.” Their 2021 breakthrough, Structure, was a meticulously chaotic assemblage of glitchy post-punk, solemn orchestrals and Brown’s impressionistic poetry. Rolling Stone wrote: “The music they make is so shot through with the discordant energy of feeling hopelessly stuck in this miserable moment, yet it never strays far from the maxim: You gotta laugh.”View image in fullscreenBrown and Amos performing on their boat show.Photograph: Kalliopi MagnisIt’s a Beautiful Place is the band’s second record with venerable indie label Matador. It is the band’s most guitar-forward record yet, a natural consequence of the extensive touring behind its predecessor, 2023’s Everyone’s Crushed and an expanded live outfit, courtesy of guitarist Al Nardo and drummer Bailey Wollowitz, who play together as Fantasy of a Broken Heart. “Once we had a rock band together, it was like, OK, we can make a rock album now,” Amos says. “Almost every song has a guitar solo, which would have felt ridiculous in the environment that Everyone’s Crushed was made in.”Everyone’s Crushed was born from an exceptionally bleak time for the duo. When Black Lives Matter protests proliferated in 2020, says Brown, it “felt revolutionary. I genuinely thought we would see real changes regarding equity and equality.” But by 2021, they were exhausted and disillusioned, back to working long hours assisting on film sets. Meanwhile, Amos was prolifically creative during lockdown but struggling with sobriety from alcohol and other substances – the bulk of Everyone’s Crushed was made during a relapse. Amos laughs when recalling how he recorded the album on “a broken computer held together by a USB cable,” a fitting setup for the album full of uncanny electronic squall addressing alienation, consumerism and suburban decay.While basking in the mysteries of Stonehenge after a UK tour in 2022, Amos challenged himself totake a break from smoking weed. Back home, he wrote a “delayed recovery album” which became the first full-length from his solo project, This Is Lorelei – 2024’s Box for Buddy, Box for Star. Heartfelt and compulsively melodic, it’s a gem of whacked-out, country-tinged pop songwriting distinct from WFYE: “Singing about feelings is such a different headspace than shredding on electric guitar,” he says.Water From Your Eyes: Life Signs – videoMost of the musical ideas on It’s a Beautiful Place originate from the same prolific period as Everyone’s Crushed, arranged in a very different way. “I’m very happy to no longer be the person who was wasted, making music for 14 hours a day,” says Amos. “But I am also very grateful to that person.” Likening his role to that of an editor, Amos manipulates and distils the demos he made back then until they land somewhere beguilingly obtuse and disquietingly catchy. “We’re still releasing our five-year blended malts,” he jokes. “Wait until that shit’s sat on a dusty hard drive for a decade, there’s gonna be some crazy tasting notes.”The best albums of 2025 so farRead moreRecorded in Amos’s home studio, the freaky, full-bodied rock songs Nights in Armor and Born 2 gesture at humanity’s cosmic insignificance. “When I sat down to write the lyrics, it just so happened that we both were thinking about cosmic existentialism,” Brown says. “But maybe we always do that. We’re both very aware of time, I think because we’re Capricorns.” The duo cite pre-human geological history, the vast unknowns of space and sea, and the deep hue ofInternational Klein Blueas touchstones. “My working mindset for this album was ‘your favourite indie rock album is not as cool as any dinosaur,’” adds Amos. In a nice full-circle moment, he finished mixing the record near Stonehenge, at a hotel overlooking a statue of Bigfoot.Both agree that It’s a Beautiful Place is the most optimistic Water From Your Eyes project yet, a representation of the band’s omnivorous spirit. “Without hope there’s only defeat, and I don’t believe that that’s where we should land,” says Brown. “I think that humanity and the planet are worth fighting for because we’ve been gifted such a beautiful place.”It’s a Beautiful Place is released via Matador on 22 AugustExplore more on these topicsMusicIndiePop and rockNew YorkinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s gritty and somewhat shocking, insofar as it’s not a highly discussed topic in film, yet it is also very tender. I watched it on a rainy Saturday afternoon without knowing anything about it. I was immediately hooked by how normal Max’s life was and intrigued by his decision to set up an online escort profile under the name of his alter ego, Sebastian, for the purpose of his novel, in which he details his varied sexual experiences. The film addresses issues such as shame, authenticity in fiction and consent with a refreshing lack of judgment on the topic of sex work. Ruaridh Mollica is fantastic as Max/Sebastian and I can’t wait to see him in more films.Ann-Marie, GlasgowBlue Road: The Edna O’Brien StoryBlue Road is an engrossing and hugely enjoyable documentary of Edna O’Brien’s enigmatic life of dizzying highs and haunting lows. Beautifully edited, it ultimately depicts how emotionally vulnerable we all are, regardless of any public persona. It’s a wonderful, inspirational documentary for any would-be writer or artist who wishes to stay true to their vision and who craves a life less ordinary. O’Brien rattled all the right cages all the time. At the height of her fame, she returns to County Clare and listens to her father sing Danny Boy. She stares at him with a stoical yet fearful expression – a powerfully resonant image. Edna, 93, watches it and loves that song. It reminded me of the Smiths song Back to the Old House. And, funnily enough, I noticed her image this week in a review of a Morrissey concert. He is using Edna as a backdrop on stage. What a woman she was.Ron, LondonParthenopeParthenope by Paolo Sorrentino is the best film I’ve seen this year. I’m surprised it’s been quite poorly received by critics and audiences. The problem seems to be Parthenope, the aloof, distant woman at the centre of the story. She is playful, innocuously flirtatious and happily uninterested in forging any deep connection with the many male admirers she’s surrounded by, her only real interest being in the writer John Cheever – whose homosexuality and ennui pose no threat to her – and, ironically, he gracefully declines her offer of company one night, not wanting to “steal a second of [her] youth”.We find that people are strange, mostly unknowable, and we are, one way or another, destined to fail any attempt to close (or even narrow) the gap between us and the rest of the world. The film is exceptionally beautiful to look at. Yes, it is long and meandering, and not a lot happens, but the overall feeling is that you’ve experienced what life is often like: a curious sense of removal from all the living going on around you; not feeling fully a part of it.Stephen, DublinHoly CowView image in fullscreen‘It perfectly captures the inertia of youth in a rural community’ … Holy Cow.Photograph: Laurent Le Crabe/Zeitgeist FilmsHoly Cow gets my vote. It’s an uplifting, funny ensemble piece from mostly untrained actors set in the bucolic Jura region of France. It perfectly captures the inertia of youth in a rural community where Totone, the local teenage delinquent, strives to make the perfect comté cheese to win prize money to prop up his ailing farm and family. Local rituals and rivalries vividly portray farming communities without sugarcoating the harsh reality of working the land day in day out. You end up rooting for Totone and his merry gang.Kate Franklin, HoveBring Her BackBring Her Back is my film of the year so far because it perfectly executes all of its genre conventions yet steps outside every single one simultaneously. It also has a central role from Sally Hawkins that deserves every recognition available. Finally, while much horror is trending on grief and trauma, Bring Her Back gives proper emotional weight while never once encouraging empathy towards evil. Genuinely brilliant.Michael Macaulay,Paraparaumu, AotearoaFlowView image in fullscreen‘Exquisite attention to detail in portraying the behaviour of animals’ … Flow.Photograph: Courtesy of Sideshow and Janus FilmsFlow has to be my favourite film released so far this year, and I have a strong feeling it may also be my daughter’s. We watched it on the big screen and were immersed in this seemingly post-apocalyptic world, where abandoned buildings reclaimed by nature are the only thing to suggest humans ever existed. It’s a lovely film about companionship, physical struggle, uncertainty and hope. It’s also beautifully illustrated, and the story is so urgent that, months on, we still urge all our friends to watch it. It’s evident that the makers of Flow have paid exquisite attention to detail when it comes to portraying the behaviour of animals, as they catch fish, sleep and ultimately try to survive.Dnieper,LondonI’m Still HereOne dark Sunday evening in February, I dragged myself out to watch I’m Still Here. It was theMubifilm of the week, I had no other plans, and I knew it had been nominated for some awards. And honestly, it was one of my best decisions of the year. I’m Still Here is a heady juxtaposition of beach life, sepia shots and easy, middle-class family life in Rio de Janeiro with the growing reality of a repressive military regime. I quietly sobbed through chunks of the second half: a masterclass in film-making, and Fernanda Torres deservedly won her Golden Globe for the portrayal of a woman trying desperately to hold it all together as life as she knows it falls apart around her.

Lots of films critique capitalism or patriarchy, but I struggle to think of any which do such a good job of showing how intertwined they are. And it tells that story in such an engaging and surreal way; as the main character loses his grip on reality in his self-destructive pursuit of this property, it feels as if you’re following him down the rabbit hole of delusion and insanity.Joe, LeedsSpitView image in fullscreen‘Unappealing but entirely human’ … David Wenham in Spit.Photograph: Vince Valitutti/Transmission FilmsMy choice is Spit, starring David Wenham. It’s a sendup of Australia’s criminal class, with more savage mockery of its immigrant detention system and a rather unappealing and entirely human protagonist.David Arthur,Maryborough, QueenslandThe Ballad of Wallis IslandAs widely reviewed, the film is a stark and humorous look at loneliness, but I would argue its perspective on nostalgia and letting go of the past is even more compelling. We all suffer from nostalgia-baiting and can all meander down memory lane at times, but this film can show the danger of living in the past. It is wickedly funny, with the conservatory scene a particular highlight. (I still chuckle when I think of: “Oh yes, unbearably hot.”)Eddie, LondonSinnersSinners is a marvellous film reminiscent of the Coen brothers’ O Brother, Where Art Thou? The music alone is incredible. There is an amazing scene based around a blues song, where the genres that inspired the tune combine with the genres it continues to inspire. I loved the story and the relationship between the anti-hero and his wife. It encapsulates what community does, and is capable of, when it needs to come together. It felt real. This is something a lot of films miss the target on. A belter of a movie.Lee Keith, SunderlandA Real PainView image in fullscreen‘A complex relationship’ … Kieran Culkin (left) and Jesse Eisenberg in A Real Pain.Photograph: APOf the 35 films I have seen this year, it is Jesse Eisenberg’sA Real Painthat stands out for me. Rightly known and celebrated for Kieran Culkin’s turn as Benji, cousin to David (Eisenberg), this movie offers so much more. A sensitive, delicately formed homage to Eisenberg’s family history, it explores their complex relationship, the essence of trauma tourism and the history and beauty of Poland. It also has a haunting score of Chopin’s intricate piano pieces.David Reid, Mirfield, West YorkshireExplore more on these topicsFilmBest culture of 2025 so farI'm Still HereSinnersA Real PainfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’ve been cancelled by promoters and venues all over the world.”Agee reportedly also said the band was aware that Tait was having “personal struggles”, but was shocked by investigations published bythe Roys Reportandthe Guardian.“It was so shocking to us, because that’s not the guy we knew,” he said. “The guy that we knew, that we’ve been on the road with, he was our family. He was our brother, and a friend to our families, to our kids …“It just has been devastating to us, and our families have felt like our names [have] been dragged through the mud because of all this, and it’s really, really hurt our kids.”While most Christian artists have remained silent on the matter, Hayley Williams of the band Paramore condemned the Christian music industry that “enabled” Tait.View image in fullscreenMichael Tait during the Newsboys concert on 15 June 2018 in Rome, Italy.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesNewsboys being dropped from their label came only weeks after the band released their new album, World Wide Revival (Deluxe). This came on the heels of K-LOVE Radio, the largest Christian radio station on the air,pulling the Newsboys catalogue from its circulation, and a Canadian promotercancelling datesfrom Newsboys’ current world tour.Members of Newsboys did not respond to a request for comment. Capitol Christian Music Group did not respond to a request for comment.Throughout the 90s, Tait’s first band, DC Talk, redefined the contemporary Christian music (CCM) genre, selling 8m albums and winning four Grammys. In 2009, Tait became the new frontman for the CCM legacy band Newsboys, whose hit song God’s Not Dead became a Maga anthem and spawned a series of popular Christian films of same name, which featured cameos by Tait. The majority of Tait’s music infused Christian right talking points with rock sounds, culminating in Tait’s influential support for Donald Trump’s presidential campaigns.Last January, Tait was accused by a former colleague on TikTok of being secretly gay. The following day,Tait stepped downas Newsboys singer, offering little explanation. Six months later, the Christian media site the Roys Reportrevealedallegations that Tait had sexually assaulted two young men while secretly abusing cocaine and alcohol. This was followed by Taitconfessingin a post published on Instagram that he’d been living “a double life”, and had, at times, “touched men in an unwanted, sensual way”.In the Instagram statement, Tait also wrote: “I am ashamed of my life choices and actions and make no excuses for them. I will simply call it what God calls it – sin.” He added: “While I might dispute certain details in the accusations against me, I do not dispute the substance of them”.“Even before this recent news became public, I had started on a path to health, healing, and wholeness … I accept the consequences of my sin and am committed to continuing the hard work of repentance and healing – work [which] I will do quietly and privately, away from the stage and the spotlight.”The Guardian published its own months-long investigation into Tait on 13 June, revealing the stories of three young men alleging Tait sexually assaulted them, including two who said they believed he had drugged them beforehand (and one of whom was a minor at the time). Four others claimed Tait was sexually inappropriate with them, one of whom was 13 when Tait allegedly exposed and fondled his penis before him in a restaurant bathroom.Tait did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment at the time, and has not responded to a second request for comment in connection to the Newsboys being dropped by their record label.Williams, of the band Paramore, posted an Instagram story of the Guardian’s headline, overlaid with text that read, in part: “I hope the CCM industry crumbles. And fuck all of you who knew and didn’t do a damn thing.”While Paramore is not a CCM band, Williams – who has 4 million followers on Instagram – grew up around the Christian music industry, and the band’s former guitarist Justin York performed with Tait on his solo projects. Both he and his brother Taylor York, the band’s current guitarist, are the sons of the former chairman and CEO of Capitol Christian Music Group.“The amount of things I have to say and the amount of people I know who were likely changed forever by this man and by the industry that empowered/enabled him … ,” Williams wrote in her IG story.Michael Sweet, singer of the 80s Christian metal band Stryper, made a vague reference to Tait ina Facebook post, where he stopped short of naming the singer, but mentioned “what’s going on in the Christian music world lately”, adding: “It’s important to understand (and I’m not condoning any bad behavior or wrong doings), that Christians are sinners. Once you accept Christ, you still have to deal with a lifetime of temptations, frustrations and weaknesses.”Just after the Roys Report story broke (but before Tait’s confession), his former bandmates in Newsboys released a statement, saying in part: “Last night our hearts were shattered when we read the news alleging drug abuse and inappropriate sexual actions by our former lead singer, Michael Tait … We are horrified, heartbroken, and angry at this report and in many ways, we feel as if we and our families have been deceived for the last fifteen years.”Questions about what the band may have known about Tait’s alleged behavior – including allegations of sexual assault – quickly circulated online. Some pointed to a Facebook comment by Agee, Newsboys guitarist who replaced Tait as singer, posted before Newsboys’ official statement. He wrote: “We have obviously heard the rumors over the years … We asked Tait each time something would come up and he would deny it emphatically.” The post has since been deleted.Darren King, the drummer for the Christian rock band Mutemath, released a video on Instagram on Tuesday and described what he alleged was an uncomfortable encounter with Tait, who he claimed touched him inappropriately during a dinner about 20 years ago. In the post, King said he had contributed to reporting in both the Guardian and the Roys Report.“Someone could only engage in this level of predation over this length of time – potentially over two decades – with the help of a team of helpers,” said King, who has worked in the Christian music industry for 20 years. “I believe Tait has a team of people who spend their time and money clearing his reputation and suppressing criticism, suppressing the truth.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

Concepts that would have enthralled readers in the times of Mary Shelley, HG Wells or, of course, Sir Arthur C Clarke, but refreshed and reimagined for the 21st century by our six nominated authors,” said the prize’s director, Tom Hunter. “But what might we be reading in the post-human future? A concept we’re still struggling to imagine even as it looms over our lived reality. Perhaps, if we ask nicely, Annie Bot might just show us the way.”Clarke co-wrote the screenplay for the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey as well as nearly 100 works of science fiction and nonfiction. Margaret Atwood was the first to win the award he established, for The Handmaid’s Tale. Subsequent winners have included Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad and Emily St John Mandel’s Station Eleven. Last year,Scottish writer Martin MacInnes wonfor In Ascension, a novel that moves from the depths of the ocean to outer space.Butler was joined on the judging panel by Dolly Garland and Gene Rowe from the British ScienceFictionAssociation, Nic Clarke and John Coxon from the Science Fiction Foundation and Glyn Morgan from the Sci-Fi London film festival.Explore more on these topicsBooksArthur C ClarkeArthur C Clarke awardAwards and prizesScience fiction booksFictionnewsShareReuse this content"

Oh god, I loved him so much’In this deeply moving and cathartic film, the presenter confronts his father’s death by going on a holy pilgrimage … and ends up releasing his soul in the sacred river. BeautifulChitra RamaswamyWed 25 Jun 2025 17.00 EDTShareThree years ago Amol Rajan’s father died unexpectedly of pneumonia. Ever since, as the BBC journalist and broadcaster puts it at the start of Amol Rajan Goes to the Ganges, “I’ve been in a bit of a funk.” I get it. As a fellow second-generation kid of Indian immigrants (and journalist from southwest London to boot) I, too, have been in a funk since my mother died (two years before Rajan’s father, at the same age, 76, as him). In Rajan’s case, his grief plunges him into a search for belonging and an attempt to reconnect with his Hindu roots. Where might such a quest take him? To the largest gathering of humanity on earth. TheKumbh Mela, where over 45 days at the start of this year half a billion Hindus gathered on the sacred banks of the Ganges. The question Rajan poses, and it’s a pertinent one for many, is whether “an atheist like me can benefit from a holy pilgrimage”.This is the deeply personal premise of what turns into an intimate, moving, entertaining yet oddly depoliticised documentary considering both the day job(s) of its presenter and the fact that the Kumbh Mela is the world’s biggest Hindu festival, funded by a prime minister whose success is built on his identity as a Hindu nationalist strongman. Only once is Narendra Modi mentioned, halfway through, and it’s in the context of his government investing £600m in the biggest Kumbh Mela to date: a mega-event owing to a specific celestial alignment that occurs once in 144 years. We know, watching Rajan’s film in the aftermath, thatat least 30 people were killedand many more injured in terrifying crowd crushes. As much as he is spiritually shaken, even altered, by the experience, he’s also traumatised by what he sees. “The people in front of me were just stepping on women,” Rajan says after he and his fixer are forced to turn back due to reports of a stampede 800 metres ahead. “Lots of very poor, very old, very fragile, possibly quite sick women … they were like human debris on the floor. Kids as well.”View image in fullscreenRajan and his festival fixer, Sumit Tyagi, at the Kumbh Mela.Photograph: BBC/Wildstar FilmsBefore he flies to Delhi, Rajan returns to his childhood. Born in Kolkata, he was three years old when his family moved to southwest London in 1986. On the three-year anniversary of his dad’s death, he goes home to Tooting with his mum. “This was my field of dreams,” he says wistfully as they drive past the pitch where he played cricket as a boy. “You were very chubby … pleasantly plump,” his mum recalls with a giggle. The loving, mischief-laden sparring between mother and son make for the most touching moments. Like when Rajan’s mother watches him flip a dosa and quips: “You are already getting spiritually enhanced!” Or when he jokily asks, “Do you want me to come back a mystical yogi?” and his mum gets serious and says, “No. I want you to be calmer, to take life in your stride.”What emerges, above all, is how grief-stricken Rajan is by his father’s death. “I’ve avoided thinking about him because I found it too painful,” he admits, sitting on a bench with his mum overlooking the Thames where they scattered his ashes (the exact same stretch where we scattered my mother’s ashes). Weeping over a framed portrait of his father, the rawness of the loss overwhelms him. “I really miss that smile,” Rajan says. “I miss his love. Oh god, I loved him so much.”View image in fullscreenHigh as a kite … Rajan is blown away by all the men who look like his father.Photograph: BBC/Wildstar FilmsIn India, the documentary ups its pace as Rajan heads for the city of Prayagraj, joining the millions of Hindu pilgrims seeking moksha (liberation from the cycle of birth and death and the end of suffering). He spends the night in an ashram withsadhuswho, hilariously, stay up on their phones watching YouTube and WhatsApping videos to one another. He’s astonished by the magnitude of the megacity temporarily built on 15 square miles of flood plain to house the Kumbh Mela – the 30 pontoon bridges, 250 miles of road and 150,000 toilets. He’s just as blown away by all the men who look like his father.The pilgrimage to the Sangam – the sacred confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati river – takes three days. Along the way Rajan, a congenial, very English guide, becomes more and more introspective. He puts on orange robes, talks to pilgrims in the smattering of Hindi he’s barely spoken since childhood, and begins to feel a “tremendous affinity and fellow feeling with others”. It’s moving and subtly handled. By the end Rajan has failed to make it to the Sangam because of the dangerous crowd surges. Instead he performs an ancient funeral rite for his father, finds a safe spot to enter the Ganges, releases his dad’s soul and plunges underwater. Has the atheist been healed by the largest gathering of people ever recorded in history? Kind of. “There’s a power in doing something that a lot of people have done for a very long time,” is how he carefully puts it, high as a kite. What Amol Rajan Goes to the Ganges expresses most powerfully of all, certainly to this fellow bereaved Hindu, are the irresolvable particularities, and commonalities, of second-generation grief.Amol Rajan Goes to the Ganges aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsKumbh MelaTV reviewTelevisionIndiaHinduismNarendra ModiReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Rajan gradually realised that his mother, a practising Hindu, “seemed to have an emotional toolkit that I lacked”. Has this lack of faith made it harder to come to terms with bereavement? With this question in mind, he travels to India to take part in the Hindu festival Kumbh Mela. Initially, he’s slightly overwhelmed by the intensity of the pilgrimage, not to mention emotionally triggered by seeing so many older Indian men who remind him of his dad. And he’s soon faced with more tragedy, as a crush causes 30 deaths. In the wake of this new sadness, can he find closure?Phil HarrisonSide Hustlers8pm, U&WA hyperactive transatlantic twist on Dragons’ Den.

Here are some of the most popular picks from the Gruffalo author’s gigantic oeuvre.Monkey PuzzleMonkey Puzzle is my three-year-old daughter’s favourite book. She’s bilingual, and – for this book specifically – she always wants me to read it in Arabic. So it’s “La, la, la!” instead of “No, no, no!”, otherwise she doesn’t like it (and she lets me know about it). Her Arabic is much better because of this book, at least when it comes to animal-related vocabulary. We went to a zoo the other day, and she referred to the elephant’s trunk in perfect (Sudanese) Arabic – a proud parenting moment for me.Affa, GlasgowView image in fullscreenWilliam and his son.Photograph: Courtesy of WilliamMy son is multisensory-impaired, he has nystagmus and unilateral hearing loss, and has always loved stories as somewhere that he can completely immerse himself. Julia Donaldson’s have always appealed and, though it’s difficult to know how much of the detail in the illustrations he can see, he loves to point out the characters or items of interest.Monkey Puzzle is often revisited, and if there’s a part that I misread then it will be corrected. He particularly loves naming all of the animals after I have read the “No, no, no!” part and we will often repeat these to each other in the day and laugh. I know that this is something that will always bring a smile to his face.William, East SussexThe GruffaloFifteen years later I can recite The Gruffalo word for word. My son insisted on me reading it to him at bedtime every night for the best part of a year! If I ever go on Mastermind it would be my specialist subject!UncleKarlMMy daughters are now 14, 17, and 20. Julia and Axel [Scheffler]’s books are as indelibly imprinted in my memory as the Ladybird books I read as a nipper in the 70s. When the animated version of The Gruffalo was broadcast for the first time I sat us all down excitedly to watch (they were still of an age where they would mostly listen to anything I had to say) – within seconds I was in bits. All those years of reading it to them, but it was like someone was reading it to me. Very embarrassing.stripsidebobView image in fullscreenIllustration: flab/AlamyMy children used to give me belly laughs all the time. One of my favourites was when my son was four and I was reading The Gruffalo to him and his older cousin who was visiting. I got to the bit just before the real Gruffalo appears and he stopped me and said earnestly to his cousin: “There’s a Gruffalo along in a minute.” Like most things that cause a complete collapse this probably doesn’t sound funny to other people but I was laughing so much I couldn’t speak for five minutes.WithoutPurposeThe Paper DollsI think The Paper Dolls is an amazing book; definitely my No 1. It touches on so many themes: imagination, loss, memories, cruelty, play and the way traditions are passed down through generations. Such a talented combination of author and illustrator to cover all of that in a relatively low number of words and a few pages. Most importantly, it’s still simple and entertaining enough for little ones to understand and enjoy. Both my kids are too old for it now, but I’ve kept a copy, and hope to be able to read it to grandkids one day.ProfyleNeimskip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

From a very young age she loved the illustrations of the brightly coloured dragons and all of Zog’s mishaps. We think Princess Pearl is a feminist icon for challenging traditional stereotypes about what girls can do and she has inspired our daughter to want to be a doctor and look after people (and dragons) when she grows up.Amy Peck, ChelmsfordExplore more on these topicsBooksChildren's books: 7 and underJulia DonaldsonPicture booksFamilyParents and parentingChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His new book is a bricolage of memoir, criticism and interviews with film-makers that explores the personal and political dimensions of this coupling. It opens with the author in Venice, preparing to give a lecture on cinema; writing in the third person, Gilbey describes himself as the “Gustav von Aschenbach of easyJet”, a reference to the ageing, lustful composer from Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice(played by a moustachioed Dirk Bogarde in Luchino Visconti’s 1971 film adaptation). Gilbey identifies with Aschenbach only because he remembers how his own once-hidden sexuality devitalised him: the closet “render[ed] him elderly before he had so much as touched puberty”. He employs the third person off and on throughout the book. Thinking of yourself as a fictional character, he says, is an “occupational hazard” for any film enthusiast. It can also be a survival technique for anyone queer, creating a distance between yourself and a hostile world.It Used to Be Witchesranges from the early 1980s – when “queerness in film started to become a commercial possibility” – to the present day. Its chapters centre on box office hits such as Call Me By Your Name,beloved independent films such as Chantal Ackerman’s Je Tu Il Elle, and less well-known releases. Thanks to Gilbey’s journalistic skills, his interviews with film-makers (François Ozon, Andrew Haigh and Peter Strickland among them) are engaging even if you are unfamiliar with the material. These conversations include illuminating observations on the art form (Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s remark that “film is a parallel life that keeps intersecting with real life”, for example) but Gilbey keeps the dialogue tethered to the book’s central questions: what is the history and future of queer cinema? How should queerness be represented on film? What, exactly, does “queerness” signify today? The voices he has assembled provide diverse answers, testimony that is valuable precisely because it is so often in disagreement.This is particularly true of the book’s strongest chapter, during which film-maker Jessica Dunn Rovinelli presents a compelling case for an anti-aspirational queer cinema, one in which queer and trans characters are free to be “vile subjects”. “If we can only exist as the best versions of ourselves,” she says, “we will die”. Portraying queerness exclusively in a positive light, Rovinelli argues, has the effect of designating only some queer and trans persons “deserving of participation” while others are left out. Gilbey segues into a discussion of the 2023 psychological thriller Femme (in which a drag artist is subjected to a brutally violent homophobic attack). After a screening at the Berlinale, transgender director Harvey Rabbit lambasted the film’s directors during a Q&A; a moment that may have affected their ability to secure distribution. Rabbit’s agenda (“More trans joy, more queer joy”) ran counter to Femme’s portrayal of queer violence. Weighing up these competing politics of representation, Gilbey notes that “a well-meaning liberal aversion to the dramatisation of trauma” can coincide with “a rightwing tendency to police or nullify challenging queer material”.He perceptively diagnoses the cinephile’s particular obsession (“sitting in the dark, staring secretly at strangers’ bodies on-screen”) and understands the chronic, vaguely paranoiac compulsion to keep watching, to collect and catalogue, as if some divine logic will become clear once you’ve seen everything there is to be seen. It Used to Be Witchesoccasionally overindulges in this stockpiling impulse, with some sections resembling a compendium of film titles and log lines – catnip for Letterboxd users, potentially onerous for the cinematic novice. This cataloguing mode fits with Gilbey’s commitment to blending different styles and forms across the book, a melange which confuses rather than facilitates his inquiry. As if to preempt such criticism, he expresses uncertainty in the book itself, a metatextual manoeuvre inspired by films which usemise en abyme(stories within stories) to acknowledge and thereby subvert their own artifice. He hopes his formal approach will push the book into “destabilised territory” – a natural place for “any queer work, an implicit acknowledgment that identities are not stable or fixed”.It’s a nice idea, but the persistent self-referentiality (“What he intends to do in this book …”, “I explain where she fits into my book …”) is distracting. Gilbey’s concluding revelation seems hard-won (“my research into queer cinema has begun to teach me how to be queer myself […] the options are infinite: I can choose any of them, or none, or I can invent my own”) but he follows it up with “I need to channel that sensation into the book somehow”. This device places the author in opposition to the reader, keeping us at a cold distance. Emotional sincerity in writing is always, to some extent, illusory – the form demands artifice – but it is possible, and often worthwhile, to commit to the illusion sincerely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Fries is a star on her home turf who deserves to be better known internationally than she is, although her role in TV’s Babylon Berlin brought her a global audience. (Before this, I had seen her only in theRobert Harris adaptation Munich: The Edge of War, in a not entirely dissimilar role.)Fries plays anti-Nazi resistance activist Hilde Coppi, a dental assistant in Berlin who falls in love with Hans Coppi, a communist who is hiding a Soviet parachutist; she listens to radio broadcasts from Radio Moscow, sends messages back via a hidden morse-code transmitter, and prints and distributes anti-Nazi leaflets and posters. She is finally arrested while pregnant, has to give birth in the prison hospital and then has to surrender the baby, Hans Jr (with a plea that her own mother looks after him), before she is led away to execution.Hilde’s story, told here by interspersing scenes of her grim prison life and the first summer of her love affair with Hans, is comparable to that oficonic anti-Hitler activist Sophie Scholl, but this is a more adult, passionate drama. Johannes Hegemann plays Hans; Lisa Wagner plays the hard-faced prison warder Fraulein Kühn, who softens towards her wretched prisoner as the dark day approaches; Alexander Scheer plays the diffident, sensitive prison-visiting pastor, who does his best to soothe her but is inscrutably present when the final sentence is pronounced and appears ineffectual and even blandly complicit. As Hilde’s condition deteriorates in prison, Fries’s portrayal is devastating.From Hilde, With Love is in UK and Irish cinemas from 27 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsSecond world warGermanyEuropeNazismreviewsShareReuse this content"

Amy Heckerling’s high school romcoming-of-age masterpiece, inspired by Austen’s Emma, is now on re-release for its 30th anniversary and more than ever it feels like a complete joy, a deliciously movie-literate (and literate-literate) classic, with references to Stanley Kubrick, Oscar Wilde and William Burroughs to go with the Austen parallel.Clueless is something to compare with Bringing Up Baby and The Philadelphia Story – and Alicia Silverstone’s final, tearful scene matches, and even outclasses, Julia Roberts’ speech in Notting Hill about being just a girl standing in front of a boy. Like Withnail and I, it’s a film which is composed entirely of quotable funny lines and for each rewatch fans could lip-sync along with the entire film. Maybe some of the material wouldn’t fly now – Cher’s body-image jokes (“I feel like such a heifer!”) are … of their time … but what contemporary movie has this level of sustained wit and fun?Silverstone gives a lovely performance as the spoilt, yet innocent and sweet-natured not-quite-16-year-old Cher (like her friend Dionne, played by Stacey Dash, she is named after a star of the past who does infomercials). She is the daughter of a widowed, wealthy lawyer in Beverly Hills, played by the formidable Dan Hedaya, who had terrified audiences in the Coen brothers’ debut Blood Simple. Cher’s conceit is gently mocked, and yet we’re always laughing with, not at her. Silverstone is amazingly innocent and charming and her sublimely weightless screen presence has a kind of serenity and maturity that belongs to an instinctive comedy performer.Super-popular Cher, having already played matchmaker to her two teachers Mr Hall (Wallace Shawn) and Miss Geist (Twink Caplan), decides in her high-handed and meddling way to take a new student under her wing: maladroit suburban kid Tai (Brittany Murphy). But the endlessly considerate Cher, always thinking of others in her narcissistic way, finds it poignantly difficult to find a soulmate herself, having conceived a tendresse for the beautifully dressed Christian (Justin Walker) who seems to be more interested in hanging out with other guys. The awful truth is that Cher may have feelings for her goofy, annoyingly progressive stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd).Watched again 30 years on, it’s impossible not to marvel at the fact that eerily youthfulPaul Ruddreally doesn’t look much different now (really, it should be Rudd, not Sarah Snook, doing a stage version of The Picture of Dorian Gray). There is also, sadly, a tone of melancholy in savouring Murphy’s terrific performance; she died in 2009 of drug-related issues aged just 32 and like Silverstone, she was a natural comedy player and, also like Silverstone perhaps, she never got a role as good as the one in Clueless. There is great stuff also from Breckin Meyer as stoner skater-boy Travis, with whom Tai is really in love, Donald Faison as Dionne’s boyfriend Murray, Jeremy Sisto as the caddish Elton, and also Walker as the sleek gay exquisite Christian. Never was a title more misleading. This is sophisticated pleasure.Clueless is in UK cinemas from 27 June, and is streaming on digital platforms in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsCluelessPaul RuddBrittany MurphyJane AustenComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s endearingly daft and unexpectedly charming for a film about small-town drug dealers full of knob jokes – and contains no actual violence from criminals who are more crap than nasty. There are some sparky performances from the young cast, and it manages to pull off natural, easygoing laughs without the cringe that often seeps into British comedies.Ethaniel Davy is brilliant as Jayce, who has just been released from 10 months in a young offenders’ institution – wrongly convicted for crashing a stolen car. Now that he’s out, he wants answers. What everyone except Jayce knows is that it was his best mate Lee (Ramy Ben Fredj, also terrific) behind the wheel of the car. Lee is the heir to a battery-chicken farming empire with links to organised crime. His dad, Lee Sr, has just remarried and sent him to live in a caravan at the edge of the family estate. Lee Jr is thick and spoilt, an adult man with a toddler brain, but like everything in the film, rather sweet underneath it all.Meanwhile Jayce and his old schoolmate Paula (Amelie Davies) get roped into a drug deal, joining forces with retired busybody Kev (Graham Fellows). Kev has somehow (plot is not this film’s strong point) ended up with a shed in his allotment full of high-quality weed. The unlikely friendship between the two kids and Kev gives the film some of its funniest lines. In Kev’s front room, Paula is mesmerised by his carriage clock, a retirement present. “Is it ironic?” she asks, genuinely curious. “No, it’s brass.” And the final moment of comedy, a scene involving a joke about Kev’s 67-year-old bladder is priceless. This is a very likable film.Chicken Town is in UK cinemas from 27 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsCrime filmsEnglandComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Gloomy lighting, claustrophobic sound design and heavy mood can stylishly cover up a lack of clear ideas with faux gravity. And yet for choreographer Botis Seva, who started out dancing hip-hop in east London and now tours to acclaim across Europe, that darkness has become his cosmos and his material.The eerie echoes, whispers and intense frequencies of Torben Sylvest’s electronic soundscore are paired with Tom Visser’s always atmospheric lighting. On the dim, hazy stage Visser finds different timbres of shadow and sudden switches of tone, and never enough wattage to clearly illuminate faces or costumes. Amid all this, Seva’s dance is like the workings of the subconscious.View image in fullscreenDifferent timbres of shadow … Victoria Shulungu and Jordan Douglas in Until We Sleep at Sadler’s Wells East.Photograph: Tom VisserA cast of six are clustered around a central figure, Victoria Shulungu, a powerful dancer who has been performing with Seva since the early days. Like some sort of sage, she’s as arresting in her stillness as her urgent movement. It feels as if this might be the artist himself, someone asked to lead, looked to for vision, but also seeking his own answers and salvation, in a cycle of struggle, hope, confusion, revelation and reckoning.From quiet, sparse scenes, we keep circling back to amazing bursts of movement, like statements of resilience. The whole group dances tight little steps with wiry energy, a pure synthesis of body and beat. The dancers scuttle like critters, spring into the air, or are buffeted as if on high winds (hip-hop languages are deeply embedded in the movement, but also a nod to Hofesh Shechter, Seva’s one-time mentor).The stage is framed by a minimalist set of tall poles that turn out to be LED lights, flickering like stars or flames, creating a wall or a cage. At one point they look like the teeth of a whale, with the dancers’ bodies repeatedly spat out between them. Until We Sleep doesn’t give out a lot to its audience; it is a deliberately opaque but immersive hour. There’s a confidence in being so sure of the work’s own world, and sticking to it; this feels like a deep dive in the mind of an artist coming into his own.AtSadler’s Wells East, London, until 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsDanceSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Alongside the rock and pop stars, Glastonbury will feature talks on violence against women and girls, collective action, the Israel-Gaza conflict, racial equality and climate, featuring figures including the MP Zarah Sultana, the broadcaster Gary Lineker, the writer Reni Eddo-Lodge, the former Green MP Caroline Lucas and the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham.The spotlight is set to be firmly fixed on the Irish rap trio Kneecap, who have been subject to ongoing scrutiny over their position on the conflict in Gaza. One of the members, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, has beencharged under terror lawsfor allegedly displaying a flag in support of the banned terrorist organisation Hezbollah at a gig in London in November last year.Last week, the 27-year-old, who performs under the stage name Mo Chara, was cheered by hundreds of supporters as he arrived with his bandmates, Naoise Ó Cairealláin and JJ Ó Dochartaigh, at Westminster magistrates court in “Free Mo Chara” T-shirts.

We were mesmerised. Forty years later, I am playingDeath Stranding 2, Hideo Kojima’s sprawling apocalyptic adventure, and there are times I feel as if I’m back in that classroom. Most of the game takes place in a ruined Australia, the cities gone, the landscape as stark, beautiful and foreboding as it was in Roeg’s film.I’ve been playing for 45 hours and have barely made an impact on the story. Instead, I have wandered the wilderness, delivering packages to the game’s isolated communities. The game is set after a catastrophic event has decimated humanity and scarred the landscape with supernatural explosions. Now you pass through vast ochre deserts and on toward the coast, watching the sun set behind glowing mountains, the tide rolling in on empty bays. Usually in open-world games, the landscape is permanent and unchanging, apart from day/night cycles and seasonal rotations. But the Australia of Death Stranding 2 is mysterious and amorphous. Earthquakes bring rocks tumbling down hillsides, vast dust storms blow up and avalanches bury you in snow. As you go, you are able to build roads, electricity generators and even jump-ramps for cars. These can be found and used by other players, so each time you visit a place you may find new ways to traverse. Nothing is ever really still.Kojima named George Miller ashis idoland the influence of the Mad Max movies and their crazed, desolate energy is everywhere in this game: its interplay of technology and isolation; its feudal tribes and scarce resources, its weird sense of adrenaline. He has also seen Walkabout, and that film’s mythic energy is here, too, though perhaps lacking the strong undertone of colonial guilt. There is a rocky outcrop in a remote corner of the game map that reminds me a little of Peter Weir’sPicnic at Hanging Rock, with its labyrinthine crevices, the reddish glow, the unnerving silence.View image in fullscreenSun-stricken hallucinatory strangeness … Picnic at Hanging Rock.I’ve spent hours driving along highways in this game, picking up parcels and taking them to strange, inaccessible places – why? How have I been seduced into sitting in front of my screen until 2am ensuring an animal shelter gets its delivery of fluffy pyjamas? The answer is, in creating a version of Australia that is timeless yet subject to moments of extreme change, Kojima has played the same trick Weir did: this world is beguiling and threatening – and that’s what makes it seductive.Years ago, Weirsaid thisabout Picnic at Hanging Rock: “What I attempted was to develop the oppressive atmosphere of something which has no solution: to bring out a tension and claustrophobia in the locations and the relationships. We worked very hard at creating an hallucinatory mesmeric rhythm, so that you lost awareness of facts, you stopped adding things up, and got into this enclosed atmosphere. I did everything in my power to hypnotise the audience away from the possibility of solution.”That, in short, is my experience of Death Stranding 2. It is a game of hallucinatory mesmeric rhythms; you drive and drive, then hours later you’re back in the same place – except now there is a road, or a sign left by another player who passed in the night. What Grand Theft Auto has always tried to do with American cities, Kojima has succeeded at with the Australian outback: to interpret and distill the feeling of a place from an outsider perspective. That’s why, when I do actually make progress in the game and open up a new area for exploration, I get the same feeling I had when I first saw Walkabout on that rainy afternoon in Manchester as a teenager – it feels as if I am seeing an impossible alien landscape, rife with beauty, possibility and danger. I think it will be months before I escape.What to playView image in fullscreenMetaphorical comedy … Quantum Witch.Photograph: Nikki JayA few months ago,I interviewedthe creator ofQuantum Witch, a wildly idiosyncratic pixel art adventure about a shepherdess who loses her flock and then gets tossed into a metaphysical battle between duelling gods.

And beyond the full English breakfasts and pub crawls, there’s an authentic Spanish side to itLeah PattemWed 25 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 25 Jun 2025 10.29 EDTShareLast year, Benidorm welcomed close to 3 million visitors. Despite its reputation as a British holiday mecca – nearly 900,000 UK travellers visited the city in 2024 – it was actually Spanish nationals who made up the largest share, with more than one million domestic visitors flocking to the Costa Blanca resort, according toBenidorm city council. I have a feeling that these visitors did not come for the stereotype of full English breakfasts and pub crawls, but for something often overlooked by international tourists: the authentic, everyday rhythm of Spanish coastal life.Map for BenidormIn a country where tourism makes up about15% of GDPbut has also spurred ahousing shortage and countermovements, Benidorm offers a contrast to cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where tourism pressures are acute. The city’s mid-20th-century reinvention as a purpose-built resort might once have been controversial, but today it looks surprisingly sustainable in the context of a national housing emergency.Benidorm was designed and built to handle industrial numbers of visitors – including me. My first visit was in the early 1990s, aged eight, on a classic package holiday with my family. I vividly remember staying up late to play billiards with a rotating cast of kids, and language barriers didn’t matter. Their mothers – and what felt like every other señora in our 20-storey hotel – took turns pinching my cheeks.The city’s reinvention as a purpose-built resort now looks sustainable in the context of a national housing emergencyThe coastal city has long accommodated large numbers of domestic and international travellers without displacing residents at the same rate as elsewhere. Unlike the “live like a local” model that has backfired in Spain’s big cities – such that more and more apartments once meant for residents are now exclusively for tourist use, especially in Madrid, where I’ve lived for 12 years – Benidorm has absorbed demand with ease while still offering an authentic Spanish experience. I’m here to explore exactly that.Before the sun has fully risen, I walk to Poniente beach, the quieter, more local stretch just west of the old town. It is already full of life. A dozen elderly señores are taking a refreshing, pre-breakfast dip and a group of señoras are easing into the day with a free session of group yoga. As the weather heats up, the Spanish crowd moves away from the main beach to the nearby Cala Almadraba or, further along, to Cala del Tío Ximo. In these two secluded coves beyond the headland, pine trees frame crystal-clear shallows. Even in peak season, these smaller spots remain largely undiscovered by foreign visitors.View image in fullscreenCala Almadraba.Photograph: AlamyBy the time the sun is at its highest, many Spaniards are already retreating to long lunches of local cuisine. AtLa Fava, I find a serene space where chef Fran Burgos serves elegant dishes rooted in Alicante’s coastal traditions – such as grilled aubergine with honeycomb, parmesan soup and seasonal fish – in a tranquil, whitewashed interior. For a classic Iberian diner,Casa Toniboasts Andalusian tiles and legs ofjamónhanging above the bar. For paella, a must in the Valencia region, refined seafood restaurantDucadohas an array of rice dishes.There’s room too for cross-cultural comforts. Ray’s 1, a longstanding British chippy run by a mother and daughter team (both called Teresa), earned a new Spanish fanbase when I wrote about it for Spain’s leading national newspaper,El País. Since then, Teresa senior tells me, they’ve had a regular flow of Spanish customers. Nearby, on my way to theajuntament(town hall), I spot a queue outsideBar El Puente, a chicken rotisserie run by the same family since 1968 and attracting a mostly Spanish clientele.View image in fullscreenLocal social documentary photographer María Moldes captures the city’s idiosyncrasies through saturated, surreal portraits of Spanish sunbathers.Photograph: María MoldesAnyone who has visited Benidorm will be familiar with Calle Santo Domingo, a pedestrianised alley in the old town. Here, a global clientele are drawn to the bustling Basquepintxobars, especially in the evening. But farther inland lies a no-frills and more authentically Spanish tapas destination, just off Avenida Ruzafa. I squeeze intoTaperia La Mina, where a bottle of house wine and six tapas costs €11.Restaurant AitonaandEl Rincón de La Croquetaoffer an equally simple experience. For a slightly quieter but still lively meal,La Mejillonerais known for its large plates of juicy orange mussels, and is worth the wait for a table.But beyond sun, sea and food, Benidorm is a real Spanish city with real stories. For example, Marina Sanchis openedCasa Cremà, a pottery workshop for locals and visitors alike, having returned to her home town after being forced out of Madrid by soaring rents, and has turned her creative retreat into a thriving community space. She tells me Benidorm has given her something she’d lost in the capital: space, time, and a connection to community.Spanish culture, local gastronomy and a deeper sense of place – this is the side of Benidorm that is enjoyed by more than 1 million domestic visitors each yearMany more Spanish artists have been inspired by the coastal metropolis, and their work has featured in the free and often overlookedMuseo Boca del Calvariin the old town.María Moldes, who exhibited there a few years ago, is a local social documentary photographer whose photos of Benidorm echo the works of the lateCarlos Pérez Siquier. Both photographers capture Spain’s idiosyncrasies through saturated, surreal portraits of Spanish sunbathers. Despite being taken decades apart, their images are almost indistinguishable.View image in fullscreenLa Fava restaurantEven online, Benidorm has become something of a Spanish cult favourite.Erik Harley, a satirical influencer from Barcelona, tells me that Benidorm is his favourite place in the universe and he will soon be launching new tours of the city’s most iconic skyscrapers. And then there’s Mulero Ok, as he’s known here, a smartly dressed pensioner whose niche is playing Spanish pop music on his speaker andfilming passersby dancingalongside his decorated, slow-gliding mobility scooter.Among Spanish youth, the city’s cultural relevance is also on the rise.Benidorm Festis Spain’s official competition to choose its Eurovision entry. Unlike the UK’s often half-hearted approach to the contest, Spain makes a big deal of the selection process and I regularly hear Melody’sEsa Diva, which was chosen as Spain’s entry this year, playing on the radio and in bars. Still only in its third year, the festival has become a defining highlight of the city’s cultural calendar, earning Benidorm a new identity as the country’s unofficial capital of pop.Beyond the bustle of Benidorm, the nearby area is home to several charming villages that make for a perfect day trip, such as the colourful coastal town of La Vila Joiosa, a short tram ride away. Inland, the ancient hilltop village of El Castell de Guadalest is home to no fewer thaneight eclectic museumsand boasts stunning views of the Guadalest reservoir – one of Benidorm’s main sources of fresh water.Benidorm wears its tourist-resort reputation with pride, but it offers far more than the stereotypes suggest. As a Brit abroad occasionally longing for home, I’m not going to deny that the British stereotype of Benidorm has its appeal for me. But I’m also here for what has become even more familiar to me: Spanish culture, local gastronomy and a deeper sense of place – the side of Benidorm that is enjoyed by more than 1 million domestic visitors each year.In a country grappling with overtourism, Benidorm’s purpose-built design shouldn’t be dismissed as inauthentic. It’s a uniquely Spanish solution to a modern global challenge – and a city with space for everyone.Explore more on these topicsSpain holidaysBeach holidaysEurope holidaysCity breaksShort breaksCultural tripsFood and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The lush green tops are turned into a punchy chermoula that is stirred into the sauce and used as a garnish.One-pan Moroccan-spiced carrots and chickpeas with carrot top chermoulaOne image has stayed with me ever since a journey through a small Moroccan village near Taghazout, just west of Marrakech, all of 12 years ago. Bright orange carrots lay in vast heaps on contrasting blue tarpaulin spread across the ground. I was especially struck by how the vast majority of each pile was green with the feathery foliage that was still attached to the roots we love. The carrot is so often robbed of its crowning glory before it reaches the supermarket shelf, but when you find a bunch with those vibrant tops intact, you’re getting two ingredients for the price of one. Those super-nutritious greens can be stirred into stews, tossed with other leaves, or blended into bright green sauces such as apestotoday’s punchy chermoula, a piquant North African herb sauce that adds brightness and depth to this warming stew.Serves4-6For the spiced carrots1 bunch carrots(about 600g), with foliage attached650g new potatoes, halved2 red or white onions, peeled and cut into thin wedges4–5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilJuice and finely grated zest of ½ organic unwaxed lemon6 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed5 tsp ras el hanout, or your own blend featuring cinnamon, turmeric, cumin, coriander, paprika and/or ginger2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes2 x 400g tins chickpeas, including their liquid (or 1 x 550g jar)50g toasted chopped almonds, or walnuts or hazelnutsCooked couscous, or barley or quinoa, to serveYoghurt, to serveFor the chermoula2 tsp cumin seeds2 tsp coriander seeds1 tsp sweet paprika1 tsp sea salt2 garlic cloves, peeled1 red chilli, diced, or 1–2 tsp cayenne pepper60g carrot tops(stalks and leaves)Juice and finely grated zestof ½ organic unwaxed lemon, or 1 tbsp chopped preserved lemon100ml extra-virgin olive oilHeat the oven to 190C (fan). Separate the carrot tops from the roots. Wash both thoroughly and set the tops aside for the chermoula. Put the carrots (about 450g), whole or halved if thick, 650g new potatoes and two red or white onions (cut into wedges) on a large tin. Drizzle with olive oil, cover with parchment and roast. After 35 minutes, remove the parchment and cook for another 15–25 minutes, until charred and tender. Mix in the lemon zest and juice (or the chopped preserved lemon), six lightly crushed garlic cloves and five teaspoons of ras el hanout (or your own blend) and roast for 10 more minutes. Stir in any leftover carrot tops (roughly chopped), the chopped tomatoes and the undrained chickpeas and roast for a final 15 minutes, until hot and bubbling.Meanwhile, make the chermoula: toast the cumin and coriander seeds in a dry pan, then grind to a powder. Add the paprika, sea salt, garlic and diced red chilli, pound to a rough paste, then smash in 60g chopped carrot tops. Mix in the lemon juice and zest and extra-virgin olive oil, then season to taste.Dot spoonfuls of chermoula on the carrots in the tray, scatter over the crushed nuts and a few extra sprigs of carrot tops, and serve with couscous and yoghurt on the side.Explore more on these topicsStewWaste notFoodFood wasteVegetablesNorth African food and drinkMain coursefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The simple truth is that all youreallyneed to create flavourful food at home is a capsule of flavourful pantry ingredients. This, for me, includes everyday staples such as toasted sesame oil, dark maple syrup and peanut butter, and bold taste-boosters such as tamarind, pecorino romano and gochujang. Another ingredient I turn to repeatedly is mango chutney, a beloved staple at the Punjabi table of my childhood upbringing in Leicester. Today, I use it in infinite different ways to enliven whatever I happen to be cooking, leaning into its characteristics as a sticky and vinegary, bustlingly tropical, flamboyantly spiced, sweet and mellow flavour hero. These recipes show you just a few ways that mango chutney, or indeed any ingredient in a thoughtfully stocked pantry, can be used when you liberate yourself to play with ingredients with creative joy.Mango chicken schnitzel with lime-leaf smashed peas (pictured top)Schnitzel and mushy peas both have a nostalgic 1970s Fanny Cradock-meets-Wimpy-diner charm that I’m always drawn to – they’re also crying out for the addition of pineapple rings, piped green mashed potato and silver jugs of parsley sauce on the side. My flavour-elevated take on these culinary relics uses mango chutney to add tropical pizzaz to the chicken, and lime leaves to bring south-east Asian fragrance to the peas.Prep10 minMarinate30 min+Cook20 minServes2For the schnitzels5 tbsp mango chutney, plus extra to serve3 fat garlic cloves, peeled1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce2 tbsp apple cider vinegarFine sea salt andblack pepper2 large boneless and skinless chicken breasts(2 x 250g)Cornflour, for dredging1 large egg, beaten60gpanko breadcrumbs1 tbsp nigella seeds2 tbsp sesame seedsSunflower or vegetable oil, for fryingLemon wedges, to serveFor the peas400g frozen peas12–14 fresh makrut lime leavesAbout 30 fresh mint leavesJuice and finely grated zest of 1 small lemon20g butterA splash of olive oil, for frying2spring onions, trimmed and finely choppedPut the chutney, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and a teaspoon each of salt and ground black pepper in a small blender and whizz to a fine paste.Put one chicken breast between two sheets of baking paper, then gently flatten it with a rolling pin into a 3-4mm-thin steak – don’t bash hard, though, or the meat will tear. Repeat with the other breast. Put the flattened breasts in a large bowl, smother in the mango chutney paste, and leave to marinate for at least 30 minutes.Meanwhile, cook the peas in a pan of boiling salted water for three minutes, then drain and set aside. In a small blender, whizz the lime leaves, mint, lemon juice and a teaspoon of zest to a very fine paste.Melt the butter and a splash of oil in a pan over a medium heat, then add the green paste and fry, stirring, for two minutes. Add the spring onions, cook for a minute, then add the peas and a teaspoon of salt, and cook for a minute more. Mash the pea mix with a potato masher until rough and chunky (or blend to a puree), and keep warm while you cook the chicken.Put the cornflour in one large bowl, the egg in another and the breadcrumbs, nigella seeds and sesame seeds in a third bowl. Dredge one schnitzel in the cornflour, flipping it to coat all over, leave for 30 seconds, then dredge again so it’s completely covered. Shake off any excess cornflour, dip into the egg, and then into the breadcrumb mix so it’s coated liberally. Repeat with the second schnitzel.Put 2cm oil in a deep-sided frying pan on a medium heat (if you have a probe, you want it to reach 165C). Fry the schnitzels one at a time for six or seven minutes, turning occasionally, until crunchy and golden brown on the outside and cooked through.Serve with the smashed peas, lemon wedges and extra mango chutney on the side.Balinese mango pork crispy rollsView image in fullscreenGurdeep Loyal’s Balinese mango and pork crispy rolls.After a week of yoga, juicing and chanting at a Balinese jungle retreat in Ubud a few years back, I made the executive decision to undo all of that “wellness” by booking intothe Slow in Canggu. It is without doubt one of the most chic, stylish and cosmopolitan places I’ve ever stayed, with beautiful boho interiors, a tropical cocktail list of dreams and a Balinese-leaning, culture-crossing menu that read like poetry. These spiced pork crispy rolls are inspired by my stay there, with the mango chutney, lemongrass, fish sauce, peanuts and lime creating flavour acrobatics on the palate. Forget the yoga: cooking these is my kind of meditation.Prep15 minCook45 minMakes10 large or 20 mini rolls8makrut lime leaves, stalks removed20g lemongrass, roughly chopped10gknob of fresh ginger, roughly chopped6 garlic cloves, peeled1 tbsp fish sauce20g roasted peanuts1 tsp ground cinnamon½ tsp freshly grated nutmeg1 tsp chilli flakes3 tbsp vegetable oil, plus extra for brushing1 large red onion, peeled and finely diced500gpork mince(at least 5% fat)100g mango chutneyJuice and finely grated zest of 2 limesFine sea salt10 sheets filo pastryNigella seeds, to finishIn a blender, whizz the lime leaves, lemongrass, ginger, garlic, fish sauce, peanuts, cinnamon, nutmeg, chilli flakes and a splash of water to a very fine paste.Put the oil in a large pan on a medium heat, then fry the onion for five to six minutes, until softened. Add the pork and fry, stirring, for 10–12 minutes, until most of the moisture has evaporated and the meat is starting to brown.

Brush the tops liberally with oil, then sprinkle over the nigella seeds.Bake for 14–16 minutes, until crisp on the outside and piping hot in the middle, then serve with drinks or as a starter, perhaps with dips or chilli sauce.These recipes are edited extracts from Flavour Heroes: 15 Modern Pantry Ingredients to Amplify Your Cooking, by Gurdeep Loyal, published last week by Quadrille at £27.
