But does the stereotype match the reality?Gaby HinsliffSat 6 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 6 Dec 2025 12.09 ESTShareJess never dreamed that she was going to get sick, nor did she consider what it would mean for her love life if she did. When she first started dating her boyfriend, they were both in their late 20s, living busy, active lives. “Sport was something we did a lot of and we did it together: we worked hard, played hard, we went for bike rides and went running and played golf together.”But around a year into their relationship, all that stopped abruptly when Jess was diagnosed with long Covid, the poorly understood syndrome that in some people follows a Covid infection. For her, it meant “a general shutdown of my body: lungs, heart, stomach, really bad brain fog”. She went from being a sporty, independent 29-year-old with a successful career to sleeping all day and relying on her boyfriend for everything.“I couldn’t leave the house, I couldn’t see my friends, so he became my emotional and physical support. I needed him to do everything around the house and bring me things when I couldn’t get out of bed, and he was also my social contact because I wasn’t seeing anyone else. It was an instant dynamic shift,” she says.Three years on, Jess has recovered enough to return to work part-time, though she still struggles with chronic fatigue and spends much of her free time resting. What knocked her for six, however, is that, having nursed her through the worst of it, her boyfriend broke up with her just when she seemed to be getting better. Six weeks on from the split, Jess is still struggling to process what happened and why.“One of my friends did say to me: ‘This is quite savage, but if I was one of his friends I’d be telling him to think twice before proposing to you, because if this lasts for ever then your relationship will be different for ever, and how will your health affect kids and the future? If you struggle to work, how will that affect the responsibility he might have to shoulder?’ It was tough but it’s true,” she says ruefully. “In the end there were a number of reasons for our breakup, but I think it’s hard to not trace almost all of them back to my illness.”Everyone’s telling me my husband is the same person, but really I’m living with a corpseThough her friends reassure her that she will find someone else, Jess struggles to imagine how she would describe herself now on a dating app: suffering from a condition with no agreed cure and no settled prognosis, she simply can’t be sure what her future looks like. “Previously I’d say, ‘I love cycling, being outdoors’, but I haven’t been able to do these things for a while. Is it false advertising if I say those are my hobbies? My hobbies currently involve napping on the sofa.”Tellingly, she knows other long Covid sufferers in similar situations. “You’re going round in circles and thinking: what if I hadn’t been ill? Would we actually have broken up sooner and realised we weren’t compatible? Or would we have lasted for ever?” But in the end, she says, it’s impossible to take illness out of the equation: it changes both of you.Couples vow at the altar to stick together in sickness and in health, often at an age when the prospect of having to live up to that promise feels remote. Yet the reality can be considerably less romantic. Though some couples – married or unmarried – are brought closer by adversity and others muddle through well enough, buried in cancer support forums, anonymous Reddit groups and Mumsnet threads are entirely different stories: tales of rage and guilt, of getting dumped by text in the middle of chemotherapy, or cheated on at your lowest point, interspersed with tentative questions from spouses who were secretly planning to leave before their partners got ill and now feel morally obliged to stay. And what’s striking is how often someone will respond that it’s not only a common story but a gendered one, frequently citing the statistic that women are six times more likely than men to be abandoned when they get sick. But is it really that simple? The stereotype of heartless husbands and wronged wives obscures a much more complicated web of emotions running beneath the surface of relationships, including those that survive a diagnosis.The idea that men are more likely to run away from caring responsibilities can betraced back to a 2009 US studyof 515 people with cancer or multiple sclerosis. It was led by two oncologists who had noticed how often their female patients’ relationships seemed to crumble. Sure enough, their suspicions were confirmed by the finding that 20.8% of the female survivors ended up divorced or separated, while only 2.9% of the men did, though couples who had been married longer seemed more resilient. The authors speculated that women commit earlier than men to relationships, meaning they were quicker to form an unbreakable bond.View image in fullscreenSince then, a 2025study of 25,000 European couplesaged 50-64 from the University of Florence found a higher risk of breakup if the woman reported poor health, but no significantly increased risk if the man did. This is in line with “the idea that men struggle more than women to adapt to a caregiving role”, according to lead author Giammarco Alderotti, but also with the fact that women are more likely to be financially dependent on their husbands.Given thata systematic reviewof more than a quarter of a million cancer patients’ records in 2022 concluded that they were (with the striking exception of cervical cancer patients) if anything slightly less likely to get divorced than average, perhaps all that can be said with certainty is that more research is needed. Nonetheless, the idea that men leave when women get sick has become firmly ingrained in the culture, with studies that reinforce it going viral in ways that studies contradicting it don’t. It evidently sounds true to many that women are more loyal to ailing partners, if only because nursing is still stereotyped as “women’s work”. The 2009 study is still being echoed everywhere from the popular Diary of a CEO podcast – whose host Steven Bartlettdiscussed it in an episodethis summer – to TikTok videos full of dire warnings about desertion. “As a divorce lawyer I can tell you that when sickness comes a lot of men don’t stick around,” says the Texas divorce lawyer Lena Nguyenin a postwith more than 42,000 likes. “They loved who you were, not who you become when life gets hard.” Too many men, she argues, are used to being taken care of, not the other way round.But when the Guardian asked readers for their experiences of care within a relationship, both men and women responded with tales of selfless devotion in some cases, and of deep-seated anxiety or resentment in others.Wendy’s husband, John, was in his mid-40s when he suffered a brain injury in a road accident. Though his broken bones mended, he came home from the hospital a different person, she says: more like an impostor pretending to be her husband.At first, she put that down to the stress of recovering from surgery. But, slowly, it became clear that his head injuries had caused personality changes, and that the person she fell in love with was gone. “It’s so hard to explain to people. You tell them one thing and they’ll say: ‘Oh, that sounds like my husband.’” But the whole point, she says, is that it doesn’t sound like hers. “I think: ‘Well, you might have married an arsehole but I didn’t.’”A decade and a half on, John exists almost entirely in the moment: he can follow a familiar routine but can’t plan ahead or problem-solve. “It’s like his get-up-and-go has literally been removed from his brain. You spill something, and you would automatically wipe it up; he would have done too, before, but he doesn’t now. If it’s my birthday, he doesn’t think even slightly to acknowledge it.” Domestically, he leaves a trail of chaos in his wake – “It’s like living with an enthusiastic eight-year-old” – and loses his temper easily. “If he’s pulling at a drawer and something gets stuck he’s, like, ‘Fucking hell, fucking hell’, he’s so frustrated.” A highly educated professional man, he couldn’t cope at work and had to retire. Wendy, a psychologist now in her late 50s, pays all the bills.I was ashamed of getting dumped and having cancer – like, what’s wrong with me?Their sex life ended – she found sleeping with someone who both was and wasn’t her husband disturbing – and they rarely go out together, since he finds noisy or stimulating environments overwhelming. For Wendy, it’s like living with a doppelganger trying to gaslight her into thinking he’s really her husband. “Everyone’s telling me I’m living with the same person, and really I’m living with a corpse in the room. I have gone from being in a happy marriage to being a widow who is also a carer.” He showed no obvious sympathy, she says, when she lost her father. “He never says the word ‘we’. He has no thoughts about the future or us together. He never says, ‘Why don’t we paint the bathroom?’ or ‘Why don’t we go on holiday?’ or ’Do you fancy doing this?’”Wendy has considered leaving him, and friends have asked outright why she doesn’t. But she feels too guilty: they don’t have children, so there is nobody else to look after him, and if they separated they would both be broke.Wendy doesn’t cry during our interview: she has learned, she says, to keep up a front. But she can’t look at photos of her husband from before the accident, or listen to music they used to enjoy, without breaking down. Though she doesn’t envy friends with happy marriages – “I don’t want their relationships, I want mine” – secretly she envies widows, whose loss is at least easy for others to see.Ben tells a similar story. His bright, busy wife had a stroke in her mid-40s that left her paralysed down one side, with some cognitive impairment: she can’t leave the house unaided, or make lunch for herself. He has become effectively a single parent to their three children, now in their teens and 20s, and employs care professionals so he can work part-time. Only in the last few months has he started to face the fact that she is unlikely to get better. “When you are reasonably successful in your career and you’ve got a lovely family, in your head you kind of step forward and imagine what it’s going to look like [in the future], and nowhere is there something like this,” he says. “We would have been thinking now that in a few years the kids would have flown the nest, we could start enjoying a bit more freedom – dreams like that have been shattered.”He does, he admits, feel down and even angry at times. “Where once you would share life’s chores, now it’s all me, and that gets a bit much. I do feel quite niggly at the kids sometimes, which is not me at all.” He has had counselling, but relies mostly on a stiff upper lip: “If I do think, ‘Woe is me’, then I think, ‘Oh shut up, Ben. Think about her.’”Ben stays with his wife for now “because I have to”, though he finds that painful to say. “There’s the kids, but there’s also almost a sense of duty, I suppose. If I was to say, ‘Oh, sod this’, and go, then I am not sure what her life would look like. She couldn’t look after herself.“But I am married to a different person, and I couldn’t contemplate putting her in a home. So I’m stuck.” He doesn’t feel he can talk about any of this with their friends. “The honest answer is I don’t know what it will be like without the kids, when they go. They’re probably a lot of the glue at the moment, and when that’s gone … I genuinely don’t know.”Wendy and Ben aren’t alone in their feelings, nor in keeping them a secret. “What the research tells us about partners is they’re often silent in their grief, their anxiety, because they don’t want to appear disloyal,” says Dany Bell, a strategic adviser in cancer care at MacmillanCancerSupport, which recently launched a campaign highlighting how long-term illness affects sex and relationships. About half the calls to the charity’s helpline are about emotional issues, she says, rather than treatment or the illness itself.View image in fullscreenAs a breast cancer surgeon, Liz O’Riordan had plenty of opportunity to observe how couples dealt with bad news. But it wasn’t until she was diagnosed with the disease herself, a decade ago, aged only 40, that she understood the full impact it has on a relationship.“I think it would be about a fifth or a sixth of my patients where the marriages ended,” she says. “Was it a marriage that wasn’t great before, and this is the final straw … or was it cancer? It’s really hard to say. But I think, especially for the younger women, who have just got married, it’s a really big thing – [partners having] affairs seem to be more common.”A cancer diagnosis can, she points out, bring with it multiple pressure points: if the patient has to give up work it often means financial stress, while younger couples can struggle with the impact of treatment on fertility. What is also hard to talk about is the impact on a couple’s intimate relationship.After her surgery, O’Riordan didn’t want her husband, Dermot – who is also a surgeon – to see her naked. “I would get changed in the dark. I would look at the scars and I would say: ‘Don’t touch me, because I don’t find myself attractive,’” she remembers. “And he said: ‘Look, don’t be silly, I’m not going anywhere. I love you.’ But you do feel it’s your fault that things have suddenly changed.” At her lowest point, she told him he should divorce her and “go and marry a woman with two breasts and a libido, because I felt guilty about what I’d done to the marriage”.Luckily, he ignored her advice. They’re still happily married, and he is a silently supportive presence next to her as we talk on the phone. But when O’Riordan started talking publicly about those feelings, she was swamped with messages from other cancer survivors saying they had experienced something similar. A common theme was the impact of drugs given to prevent a recurrence of the cancer, which trigger early menopause with all its potential side-effects. “The vaginal dryness, the loss of libido – it is huge,” says O’Riordan. She also heard tales of husbands sleeping in spare beds because they were frightened of hurting their partners, or even of “catching” cancer. “I think we need to prepare women and their partners because this is going to have a massive impact on their relationship. At a time when you need them most, you either want to push them away or they distance themselves.”For couples navigating cancer, she says, the key is communication. “It’s talking and asking: what do you need? How can I help you? And having those conversations around the dinner table, not in the bedroom.”Bell, at Macmillan, agrees that couples need to be unafraid of having difficult conversations. An awkward question for many, she says, is whether a partner should take on intimate tasks like washing or helping their spouse to the loo, and what effect that might have on their relationship. “I always say to my husband: ‘If I can’t do my own personal hygiene I don’t want you to do it.’ For me, there’s something there about maintaining your dignity, even though we’ve been together a long time. But it’s a personal choice – many people work through it.”Cancer can cast a surprisingly long shadow, well after the immediate crisis is over. “People get anxious – there’s always that thought in the back of their mind about the cancer coming back. And some treatments do have long-term side-effects,” Bell says. “There’s a high percentage of people who don’t get back into the same work, or work at all, after they’ve had cancer.”Surviving a near-death experience, meanwhile, may inspire some to make dramatic changes to the lives they almost lost – including, in some cases, ending a relationship. One smallIsraeli study of breast cancer patientswho had subsequently filed for divorce found that many saw the illness as a wake-up call alerting them to what was wrong with their marriages. Given a second chance at life, they wanted to live it differently. The study concluded that, for some, being sick had emboldened them to put themselves first, while others described a newfound confidence, concluding that as they had coped with almost dying, they could certainly cope with being single.The breakup gave me an opportunity to be, like, ‘Right, I don’t have to consider anyone else’s feelings now: what do I need? What do I want?’Antonia was only 24 when she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, after a three-year struggle to pin down the cause of symptoms – including repeated episodes of anaphylactic shock – that had caused her to drop out of university and move back in with her parents. Back then, she was in a serious relationship with her childhood sweetheart, but around the time she started radiotherapy, her partner broke it off.“It felt like the world was against me,” she says over Zoom from her home in Jersey, where she grew up. “Throughout my cancer journey I’ve tried not to go down the route of ‘Why me?’ because it’s a really negative route, and that was the only time I even looked in that direction.” Sitting in a radiotherapy room by herself, being told she couldn’t hug anyone because she was radioactive, was lonely enough already. But, above all, what she felt was shame. “A lot of people are ashamed about getting dumped in general, but getting dumped and having cancer – you’re, like, what’s wrong with me?”It was only when she plucked up the courage to talk about it on TikTok, where she was already documenting her treatment, that she realised how common her experience was among cancer survivors. “So many people were saying: ‘Oh my God, me too. I’ve never told anyone about this because I was embarrassed.’ And that’s how I felt. I’d dropped out of uni, I couldn’t work, all my friends are getting engaged, buying flats, having babies, and you just stick out like a sore thumb – it almost felt like another failure.”Yet even at the time, she was anxious that her ex shouldn’t get the blame for walking away, a feeling that has only grown. Two years on, in remission from cancer and living happily with her new boyfriend, Antonia is working as a journalist and is an ambassador for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Last year, she made aValentine’s Day videofor Macmillan Cancer Support in which she reflected on why she now sees that breakup as for the best: at least it meant she could focus wholly on herself, and getting well.“I know people who have stayed together throughout the cancer journey, and when they get to the stage where they’re cancer-free, they split up because the person’s so resentful,” Antonia says. “The truth is that the kindest thing someone can do for you is to be honest, saying: ‘I can’t give you what you need – I care enough to let you know that.’ When battling cancer, my focus was: I need to live. Anything else is trivial to me.”Among the young cancer survivors of both sexes she knows, Antonia thinks it’s the women who are more likely to have been dumped after a diagnosis. “The men just can’t handle it – they see their friends going out and they’re, like: ‘I want to do that.’ That being said, I think girls return to dating quicker than men who have had cancer. Sex is a massive thing – your hormones have changed, you might not feel the same as before – and a lot of men struggle with that because it’s more of a performance anxiety thing.”View image in fullscreenDating again, however, wasn’t easy for her. To keep the life-threatening reactions that complicated her case at bay, Antonia will need monthly treatment for the rest of her life. She can’t work full-time, and has been left with serious allergies. “I can’t wear certain makeup, I can’t dye my hair, I can still only eat certain foods. I thought: how can I go on a date and explain I can’t drink alcohol?” Strong emotions can also trigger a physical reaction. “It’s hard in a romantic situation – some people can play it cool but I can’t; I literally break out in hives.” And she won’t know exactly how treatment has affected her fertility until she tries for a baby.She met her current boyfriend through mutual friends, which meant he already knew about her cancer before they started going out. Her advice to anyone dating after serious illness is to be upfront about what that involves, on the grounds that to the right person it won’t matter. “When I did meet my current partner, I was, like: ‘I’m allergic to alcohol, I can’t do this, I can’t do that.’ If I didn’t, I might have started a relationship under false pretences and slowly but surely realised it was only working because I was being inauthentic.”Yet ironically, she says, it was only going through a life-changing illness that gave her the courage to be so open about it. “I used to be such a people pleaser. I never stuck up for myself. I never cried when I got a diagnosis because I was comforting everyone around me, and I think about that a lot,” she says. “I think that breakup gave me an opportunity to be, like: ‘Right, I don’t have to consider anyone else’s feelings now: what do I need? What do I want?’, rather than sort of keeping everyone at bay.”It’s perfectly normal, Antonia stresses, to rage at being dumped: to feel heartbroken, hurt, to wonder why this had to happen to you. But, two years later, she’s at peace with it.“There’s nothing wrong with me. That’s a big thing that I had to come to terms with – we just weren’t right for each other. But a lot of things would be less heavy if we talked about it, and it was more normal to just go: ‘Oh, I got dumped.’” Especially, perhaps, if you’ve already survived far worseSome names have been changedMacmillan Cancer Supporthelpline: 0808 808 0000.

We unlucky few. In years to come when we are all still recovering from post-traumatic stress disorder, we will be able to say we were there. That we have seen things that cannot be unseen. The 8,000 of us who, through a mixture of curiosity and comedy, chose towatch Liz Trusscommit a drive-by on herself. Though only a very few will have made it to the end.Some won’t have even made it to the start. The show started an hour late because Liz forgot to put her watch back in October. Still, this was an award-winningYouTubeTV show. Though not the awards anyone would want to collect.In January we were treated to the bizarre sight ofLiz Trusslive-tweeting the presidential inauguration from her hotel room in Washington. It had dawned on her too late that you actually needed an invitation to the Capitol and she wasn’t on anyone’s guest list. In hindsight, we can see this as a trial run.The Liz Truss Show review – hapless ravings from a cupboardRead moreFor her new Liz Truss Show, she appeared to have turned her utility room into a makeshift studio. No expense incurred. Though she did have someone to do the filming this time. Albeit a 12-year-old intern doped up on ketamine. I’ve seen better editing on my dad’s home movies from the 60s.We opened with a montage of Lizzy’s greatest hits. There she was beinggreeted by the queen at Balmoral. Huge mistake. She doesn’t seem to realise that the entire country holds her responsible for the queen’s death. The last photo we saw of the queen was of Truss being introduced to her on the Tuesday. Two days later she was dead. Case proved. It’s not hard to imagine the queen thinking: “You know what? It’s just not worth it any more. My first prime minister was Winston Churchill. Now it’s come to this …”Then Liz stared straight to camera and launched into a deranged diatribe. If it wasn’t obvious before, it is now clear her care in the community experiment has failed. She is a danger to herself. It’s almost painful to watch someone so lacking in any self-awareness. Her therapist is doing her no favours by letting her out into the wild.The message that Liz has taken from her 49 days in Downing Street is that the only reason she failed was because she wasn’t given long enough. She believes that deep down we all want more of her. Hell, she can’t even get a gig as a D-list wannabe on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!. Remembered less fondly than Matt Hancock.“Britain is going to hell in a handcart,” said Liz, sitting behind a makeshift bookcase containing the only copy ofTen Years to Save the Westthat hasn’t been pulped. The whole country was poorer than Mississippi. Yes, and who contributed most to that? Irony is not her strong point.Islamists were everywhere. The governing elite hated us and civil servants were all trans activists. But she was going to lead the counter revolution against the DEEP STATE. Five minutes in, I was already exhausted. You can’t buy this level of nonsense. Thankfully I didn’t have to. She made Elon Musk sound like the voice of reason on X.Next we came to Radon – “She’s a gas, but she’s inert” – Liz’s first special guest. Step forward Matt Goodwin, hot from the sewers of far-right conspiracy theories. Matt immediately went on to his favourite obsession. Foreigners. There were far too many of them. We were being betrayed by a self-loathing elite. Perhaps Matt would like to include himself in that. No one has ever knowingly see him smile.“I went into politics because I was a patriot,” said Liz. “I didn’t want open borders.” YES, YOU DID. During the EU referendum you were one of the politicianscampaigning loudest for remain. And you were a cabinet minister under Boris Johnson. Poor Lizzy. Her memory shot to pieces. By now, even Matt was looking queasy. Beginning to wonder if he had made a serious mistake by coming on a show hosted by a lunatic. And he had met many lunatics in his time.But Lizzy was on a roll. Or a slur. The longer she spoke the more her words rolled into one another. Must have been the benzodiazepines starting to kick in. ‘KeirStarrmeristhemostunpopularprimeministereverrrrr.’ No, Liz that was you.She sneered at the word compassionate. The Bank of England was full of Trotskyists. As were the police. It’s Britain, Matt, but not as you know it. The last word went to Matt. There were way too many foreigners. True Brits needed to have more babies. And we knew what he meant by True Brits. Not often the Great Replacement Theory gets an outing.Jumpy cut to the next guest. Peter McCormack, podcaster and bitcoin enthusiast whom I had never heard of. He was wearing a T-shirt with “Freedom” on the front. Maybe that was a cry for help. He too seemed to have no idea what he was doing there. Other than to say everything is a bit shit over and over again while Lizzy talked over him. Communists were too clever for their own good, she told us, before concluding that gen Z were going to rescue the country. Go for it. You have nothing to lose but your oat milk skinny lattes.That just left Alexandra Phillips, a rightwing talking head primarily remembered for having her GB News show cancelled in 2022. Since then she’s been on the same circuit as Goodwin. If anything, Alex hated Muslims even more than Matt. They came from a barbaric culture. Bournemouth was now a no-go area. A woman couldn’t walk down the sea front without the threat of being raped. It was the Muslims who were the real racists. Not the white Britons that hated them. Every single immigrant was a potential sex offender or terrorist. Liz nodded along eagerly. She couldn’t agree more. Though chiding her for being too woke.A final jump back to the bookcase where Lizzy was giving her closing speech to camera. The country was in terminal decline. But there was hope. And that hope was her. SuperLiz to the rescue. Until next week, she said. If there is a next week. Episode two is in the balance. Fingers crossed. Right now everyone who made it to the end is in a survivor’s therapy group. In years to come we will see her with her carer at the Cenotaph and say to ourselves: “Wasn’t she the woman who had her own chatshow that nobody watched?”Explore more on these topicsLiz TrussThe politics sketchYouTubeTelevisionRacecommentShareReuse this content"

There was a bit more to it than that, but from Prague to Panama City, his scrunched contours were instantly recognisable, expressed in an exuberant parade of buildings that cranked and slumped as if hit by a wrecking ball, or crashed and whirled like dervishes, defying laws of gravity and structural logic. Though Gehry, who has died aged 96, came of age in the era of modernism, it was as if he were physically incapable of drawing a straight line.In his prime, Gehry’s architecture was a rebuff to modernist imperators such as Mies van der Rohe and his po-faced injunction, “less is more”. The American postmodern theorist and architectRobert Venturiturned it on its head, quipping “less is a bore”. It summed up the maximalist Gehry perfectly.As the millennium loomed, he changed the game with his 1997 design for an outpost of the Guggenheim modern art empire in the unfashionable northern Spanish city of Bilbao. Grappling with post-industrial decline, its unlikely recovery was catalysed by a building of exhilarating complexity sheathed in an epidermis of 33,000 wafer-thin sheets of titanium that shimmered like rippling fish scales. With gallery spaces as expressive as the works they were designed to house, this was no neutral backdrop for art.View image in fullscreenExhilarating: Athletic Bilbao fans in front of Gehry’s Guggenheim Museum wait to celebrate when their team appears on the Nervión estuary in Bilbao, Spain.Photograph: Álvaro Barrientos/APSet on a prominent waterfront site on the River Nervión, the Guggenheim became an instant icon, propelling Gehry, then in his late 60s, into the “starchitect” firmament, an epithet he affected to despise. And as its backers had hoped, it also transformed Bilbao’s wider civic fortunes, attracting 1.3 million visitors in its first year and begetting the “Bilbao effect”, which became shorthand for uplift through cultural tourism predicated on “iconic” architecture.Bilbao was followed by the 2003 Walt Disney concert hall in Gehry’s adopted home town ofLos Angeles, conceived as a clutch of stainless steel-clad volumes resembling billowing sails or giant metal shavings. He had urged his client to use stone, but they wanted a Bilbao. The timber-lined auditorium was warm and intimate, akin to being inside a musical instrument. Even the organ bore Gehry’s imprimatur, its scrum of pipes like a box of exploding french fries. For Gehry, whose family had relocated to Los Angeles from his birthplace of Toronto when he was 17, it represented the culmination of a long and formative relationship with the city.View image in fullscreenNo Mickey Mouse affair: early morning sunshine illuminates the Walt Disney concert hall in Los Angeles.Photograph: Nick Ut/APThe dynamic forms of his buildings were achieved through an ingenious yet laborious modus operandi involving the creation, in the first instance, of handbuilt models. These were then digitised using computer software capable of modelling complex curves, originally designed for use in the aerospace industry. Sculpture, in effect, became architecture, always striving for effect. Anything was possible.As computers liberated form-making, architecture became increasingly – and often preposterously – uninhibited. Throughout the 90s and 00s, architects and their patrons strove to outdo each other, with Gehry leading the charge, through projects such as the Dancing House in Prague, nicknamed “Fred and Ginger”, where a pair of disparate towers conjoin in a twirling, balletic embrace, and the Jay Pritzker pavilion in Chicago’s Millennium Park, an outdoor amphitheatre framed by a halo of torqued stainless steel ribbons.View image in fullscreenCutting a rug: the Dancing House in Prague, designed by the Croatian-Czech architect Vlado Milunić in collaboration with Frank Gehry.Photograph: NurPhoto/GettyBut as time wore on, in the effort to emulate the success of Bilbao, Gehry became fixated with chasing ill-conceived museum projects around the world. Extending its purview to the Middle East, in 2006 the Guggenheim commissioned him to produce an Abu Dhabi satellite, which has been dogged by delays and is slated to open only next year, two decades after its conception. “It was suggested that the huge budgets had raced past a clear idea of what the building would mean culturally or even what kind of artwork it would hold,” wrote Christopher Hawthorne in the Los Angeles Times.Seattle’s over-egged Experience Music Project (since 2016 known as the Museum of Pop Culture) proved a wincing disappointment, while the 2014 Fondation Louis Vuitton inParis, designed to accommodate the collection of French business magnate and art collector Bernard Arnault, is a bloated car crash, with some appallingly shoddy workmanship. By then, Gehry was also designing luggage, yachts and cognac bottles, a side hustle that began more prosaically with furniture made from layers of corrugated cardboard.View image in fullscreenHandbag house: Gehry’s Fondation Louis Vuitton building in Paris received mixed reviews.Photograph: Ian Langsdon/EPASuch late-career hubris was a long way from the project that first made his name, his own house in Santa Monica, California, a two-storey pink stucco dwelling which he bought in 1977 and then proceeded to eviscerate and augment by collaging in bits of corrugated metal and chain-link fencing. “I was trying to use the dumb, normal materials of the neighbourhood,” he said at the time. Imbued with an edgy, gritty populism, his early work drew parallels with the art practice of Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns.LA provided the scope and momentum for experimentation as Gehry gradually found his rhythm in a frontier town of sprawl and ad-hocism. Revelling in exaggerated geometries and juxtapositions, a 1980 house for film-maker Jane Spiller featured a plywood interior encased in a carapace of corrugated metal. Where the timber sporadically broke through the external walls “the house felt like the architectural equivalent of a couple quarrelling in the kitchen”, wrote the American architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff.Though Gehry built extensively inEurope, especially in Germany, with housing towers in Düsseldorf slouching like dissipated drunks, and a design museum for the Vitra furniture campus, which marked his transition from industrial bricolage to more poised, sculptural spectacle, the UK proved more resistant to his charms.View image in fullscreenSurprisingly simple: Gehry’s first UK project, a Maggie’s Centre in Dundee, for people undergoing cancer treatment.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianIn 2003 he designed a Maggie’s Centre for the Ninewells hospital in Dundee, part of a network of drop-in centres for those affected by cancer. Surprisingly sober and simple, it’s modelled on a traditional Scottish “but and ben” dwelling, with a white cottage topped by a folded metal roof, like a piece of origami.From Bilbao to Las Vegas: Frank Gehry’s incredible architecture – in picturesRead moreLatterly, he was involved in terraforming the environs around Battersea power station, designing silos of luxury housing that for all their cleverness feel distinctly formulaic. He was also invited to devise a Serpentine pavilion, London’s annual architecturalfête d’été,reconceptualising it as a whirlwind in a lumber yard.In a career that spanned 60 years, Gehry became a quintessential grand old man of architecture, apt, on occasion, to yell at clouds, as the world changed around him. At a 2014 press conference inSpain, on the occasion of him being garlanded with yet another award, when accused of designing “spectacle architecture”, he silently flipped his audience the finger. He later apologised. He also declared that: “In the world we live in 98% of what is built and designed today is pure crap. There’s no sense of design, no respect for humanity, just damn buildings.”Explore more on these topicsFrank GehryArchitectureSpainMuseumsEuropeLos AngelesParisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Back in 2008, whenNicola Coughlanwas at drama school, a guy in her class swaggered over and, with all the brimming confidence of young men in the noughties, asked her, “Do the Irish think the English are really cool?” Coughlan, born in Galway, mimes processing the question. “Well,” she said, “it’s quite complicated. Like, there’s a lot ofhistorythere, between the two countries. Like, there’s a lot going on.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Today, people are more knowledgable about the history of the English in Ireland. Coughlan is happy about that. She’s also happy about the explosion of Irish storytelling in popular culture –Normal People,Trespasses,Small Things Like These, not to mention the series that made her name,Derry Girls. And she’s proud of young Irish actors – Paul Mescal, Barry Keoghan and Lola Petticrew, to name a few.She listens to bands such as Fontaines DC, CMAT and Kneecap. “It’s such a small country and the amount of creativity that comes out of Ireland is really extraordinary.”But now there’s a different kind of English guy, the one who swaggers over “to explain Irish history to you through the music. I’m like, ‘No, no. I know all of that.’ Like, ‘I know why [Kneecap] is wearing a balaclava, yes. I know why all of it.’” And then there’s the person who congratulates her for having an elected leftwing female president in the form ofCatherine Connolly. “I’m like, ‘Our third. Our third female president. And by the way, Michael D Higgins, her predecessor, is incredibly leftwing. And a poet.’”Depending on your viewing tastes, Coughlan is either most recognisable as Clare Devlin from Derry Girls, the sublime comedy about Catholic teens set in the Troubles in 1990s Northern Ireland, or Penelope Featherington from Bridgerton, the Jane Austen-meets-Gossip Girl Netflix juggernaut in which she plays a Regency debutante with a secret. She’s become equally well known for her frankness – refusing, even under considerable pressure, to stop talking aboutGazaorabortionortrans rights. She’s also not going to apologise for not meeting societal expectations of what a starlet should look like.Video clip of actor Nicola Coughlan wearing a brown coat and furry hat, blowing in the windHat:Awon Golding. Coat:Nour Hammour. Video: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The GuardianThis steel is arresting in person from such a fairy-cake package. She looks like a Norman Rockwell illustration of a child from the 40s or 50s, or an Eileen Soper book cover, blond with the rounded forehead of a china doll, fondant pink cheeks that blotch at times with emotion. And she’s tiny, 5ft at a push, swamped in an oversized beige jersey. (She tells me that back when she’d collect her niece and nephew from primary school, other kids would shout, “Why are you so short if you’re an adult? Why do you look like that?”)This morning, we’re deep in the concrete block that is London’s National Theatre, discussing her latest project, The Playboy of the Western World. It’s a play set in a pub in 1900s County Mayo and she’s immersed in conversations with the other actors about “the contradictions of being Irish and the perceptions of Irish people and what it means to be Irish”, she says. “Also to be part of a country that was colonised for so long, and had ideas imposed on it, but we’re all sitting around speaking English in the British National Theatre.” She’s interested to see how audiences respond, and a little apprehensive. “I read some reviews from when it was staged at the Old Vic in 2011 and they were like, ‘No one could understand a word!’ You don’t see anyone going to [Shakespeare’s] Globe and writing, ‘I couldn’t understand anything.’”View image in fullscreenCoughlan with her Derry Girls co-stars.Photograph: Peter Marley/Channel 4On stage she’ll be reunited with Siobhán McSweeney – Sister Michael in Derry Girls – and directed by Caitríona McLaughlin of Dublin’s Abbey theatre. The all-Irish cast accounts for the outbreaks of Gaeilge in the corridors, which Coughlan loves. “I saw a report about how manyyoung people are learning Irishnow. It’s terrible to admit, but as a teenager, myself and my friends were like, ‘Well, I can’t use this language anywhere else, so why would I learn it?’ Then as you get older, you realise it’s your native language, and you feel ashamed that you can’t speak it.”She’s relieved to be doing something small and intimate after Bridgerton (the show is the reason a group of diehard fans are outside the stage door every day) – her first play since 2018. Bridgerton was already one of Netflix’s hugest shows, but an astounding 45.05 million viewers watched the first episodes of season three, the season in which Coughlan’s character transforms from bashful and bookish into a ravishing goddess, which climaxed with hernear six-minute nude sex scene(a record even for this bonkbuster).Imagine you’re at the pub, having a lovely time. And a few days later, you see pictures of that. The violation is immenseHow she dealt with journalists’ questions about doing a nude scene – given her voluptuousness – was instructive. She’s done press tours with hundreds of interviews and, sure enough, each time, there it was nestled in among the anodyne and the technical. She tried batting it away, rejecting the label “plus size”, politely asking people to stop contacting her directly to offer their opinion on her curves. One night, doing a Q&A on stage in Dublin, she was asked about her “bravery”. “You know it is hard,” she said, hand resting gently on her corseted waist. “Because I think women with my body type – women with perfect breasts – we do not see ourselves on screen enough.” She paused to soak up the laughter from the audience. “I am very proud to be a member of the perfect breasts community. I hope you enjoy seeing them.”The riposte captured both her come-off-it realness and the ludicrousness of what, until recently, has been considered acceptable to ask women in a PR back and forth. No wonder theclipwent viral.“It was a joke I’d definitely made to friends,” she says now. “But I’d never said it in public. You know what [journalists] want to get out of you and you think, I’m not going to give you that. I’m just going be stupid in response.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian. Coat:Nour Hammour. Shoes:Giaborghini. Glasses:Jimmy FairlyAlthough Bridgerton was huge amounts of fun and she’s proud of her work and adores all the cast and crew, it brought a landslide of attention, some of which, well, let’s just saythere’s a specific type ofparasocial fandom. “With Derry Girls, people really enjoy the show, and say, ‘I love that.’ With Bridgerton, it’s a different beast.” Fans identified strongly with her character. They devoured theories about Coughlan and her co-star love interest Luke Newton, convinced they were a real-life couple concealing their marriage. They looked for clues in what she wore, what she posted, where she appeared, believing that, like Taylor Swift, Coughlan was telegraphing messages specifically to them – “which I’m definitely not. I definitely just put a jumper on and the colour doesn’t mean anything.”When Newton posted photographs of a summer holiday with his actual girlfriend, those fans felt cheated, called it a PR stunt, a hoax. They wrote wild posts and cancelled their Netflix subscriptions. “The maddest thing they thought was that I’d had a secret baby and was hiding it,” Coughlan says. “I would like to go on the record and say, ‘I don’t have a secret baby.’” Then she sugars her tone, “But it’s real in the show! They’re married for ever in the show! They have a baby in the show!”There was also acute public scrutiny of Coughlan’s love life, partly because her boyfriend, the actor Jake Dunn, is 25 and she is 38. It was bad enough after paparazzi shots appeared of her with Dunn in the early days of their relationship (“Imagine if you had an evening at the pub and then you walked around, talking, having a lovely time. And a few days later, you see pictures of that. The violation is immense”). But a widespread assumption that she had courted this publicity meant she was suddenly fair game for anyone with a cameraphone. She was photographed as she went about her day – shops, parks, restaurants, streets – the pictures uploaded online. “People go, ‘Oh, there’s so-and-so from TV.’ They forget you’re a person.”View image in fullscreenWith Luke Newton in Bridgerton …Photograph: Liam Daniel/NetflixView image in fullscreen… and with real-life boyfriend Jake Dunn.Photograph: Eamonn M McCormack/Getty ImagesSoon her world began to contract. Fans were trying to find out where she lived. They posted photos of her and Dunn in real time and she realised that they were being tailed. “That level of attention is hugely intense. And I don’t know how well that suits me. The intensity gave me horrific anxiety,” she says. “I was like, ‘I really want to go away.’And also, because I’m somewhat politically outspoken, I didn’t know that people didn’t mean me harm. Work is one world and my private life is another. When one started collapsing into the other, I thought, oh my God, what have I done?”Her face goes pink and she apologises because she’s trying not to cry but the tears are spilling over. And then she’s apologising both because it genuinely stresses her out to think what might have happened if people had found out where she lived, but also because, look at her, she’s being ridiculous, crying in the first interview she’s done in a year.Then she’s laughing and crying at the same time and telling me not to worry because I’m scrabbling around in my Pret bag looking for a napkin.She cries all the time, she says, rallying. She cried last night, in fact, watching Married at First Sight because there was a couple so in love, but he lived in Brighton and she in Liverpool. She cried watching Oasis recently because they played Wonderwall and she hadn’t realised until she heard it live that “it’s a fucking masterpiece”.She touches the corner of her eye and picks up her point. A year later, she’s still reflecting on the intensity of theBridgertonexperience. It’s made her think twice about her career trajectory. Only the other day, watching Wicked, she thought of Jonathan Bailey: “You are a movie star, like, you are literally huge, but I don’t know that I could do that.” And in the summer when she didn’t get a part she’d auditioned for in a big movie (they cast a man instead), she felt OK. “It sounds really saccharine, but I do really just want to work with nice people who want to make great things. Those are my guiding principles now. Because I am really sensitive and I can’t work in bad environments. I’m not built for it at all.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian. Coat:Fendi. Tights:Heist. Shoes:LouboutinWhen Derry Girls first came out, Couglan’s plan was “to be myself in the public eye”, and if anyone misunderstood, “I’d explain what I meant and it would all be fine.” She learned quickly enough that the actual way to deal with trolls was “to block and move on”. These days she’s retreated from social media and is mainly on the New York Times games app, trying to do the crossword in under 10 minutes. She uses her Instagram platform mostly to raise awareness and money for charity. Back in April she helpedNot A Phase, the charity supporting trans people, to stay open. “I don’t have a Twitter account on which to say ‘I don’t think blah blah blah’, so I was like, well, maybe I should help raise money. And I did.”So far, she’s also raised more than £1.5m for relief for people in Palestine through organisations such as the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, ActionAid UK and Medical Aid for Palestine. She knew early on in the conflict that she had to do something, “Not in a holier than thou way. I was just, like, no, I don’t think I can stay quiet about [watching civilians being killed]. But no one was talking about it early on. People were very afraid to.”Some of those she worked with – “people with my best interests at heart” – told her, “You could really damage your career doing this.” Who, I ask? “I feel bad saying who specifically. But that’s the truth, I could. And I had to go, OK, I have to accept that. They said, ‘You mightn’t be able to do this, this and this [job].’ And I thought, well, then I don’t want to be able to do that, that and that. I can’t throw away my moral conscience. True activism, it should cost you something.”She started wearing a ceasefire pin to public appearances. “People [on social media] really tried to be bullies about it and go, ‘Shut up and stop talking.’ And I was, like, well, no.” She estimates that she lost a quarter of a million followers on Instagram, which in crude terms is money, because commercial deals are often calculated on engagement numbers. “So it costs me something.

With Jewish friends. It’s untrue to conflate [support of Palestine] with antisemitism. All of these systems of oppression and hatred go hand in hand – antisemitism, Islamophobia – they’re abhorrent and I reject them all. But it’s a way of silencing people, to throw antisemitism as an accusation.” She told those friends, “‘There’s no world in which I would not stand up as vocally for antisemitism.’ And those are the more difficult conversations to have – the actual, real ones with people in your life. But you have to approach those with understanding, too. It must feel really intense. It must feel horrific.”It’s very easy to type something on social media and put your phone away. It’s harder to show upShe says she went on one of the London marches – she can’t remember when exactly – but it was positioned as a “pro-Hamas” march by the government and some media, and resulted in “a very difficult conversation” with one particular friend. “I was, like, ‘I was there, literally. And it wasn’t [pro-Hamas].’ I can’t speak for every single person at a march, obviously, but there was no space for that in the atmosphere I saw.” She defends her decision to get out there. “It’s very easy to type something on social media and put your phone away. It’s harder to show up. All that is very important.”Coughlan was born just outside the city of Galway. Her father, Martin, was in the Irish Army and worked for much of his career for the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation on peacekeeping missions. Among the places he and her mother lived in the 70s and 80s were Jerusalem, Lebanon and Syria. Coughlan says her parents did not “impose dogma on us”. But they did often talk about that time happily, about how much they loved their work. What Coughlan took from those conversations was “both my parents trying to help in practical ways”.Although her father died five days before she was offered the part in Derry Girls, “I hope that he knew I was on the right path.” He came over to see her do a reading ofJess and Joe Foreverat the Old Vic. “He was almost like a theatre luvvie for that one night. He was in the bar at the Old Vic, and he was full of it. He was really excited.”She jokes that as a child she parked herself in front of the TV, “never going outdoors” (one reason, she adds, for her glass-like complexion – no sun damage). It was while sitting on the floor watching Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz that she first realised she wanted to act. From the age of nine she had a professional career “doing little bits”. And even back then acting felt completely right. “It was like that true love feeling. When you’re like, ‘Everything makes sense.’”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian. Coat:MoschinoWhat was harder was convincing her parents that this could be a career. Her father had grown up on a farm and joined the army at 17. “So having a child that’s like, ‘I’m going to be a thespian full-time! That’s how I’ll pay my bills!’ he was like, ‘Jesus, oh my God, what?’”The way she tells it, she was a handful at school. She remembers getting into a fight with the parish priest. She hated mass. “A cruel and unusual punishment for an ADHD child. You’re sat there listing to, ‘Remember you are dust and to dust you shall return’ and, like, having a fucking existential crisis every time. When I realised I never had to go back to mass, I was like, ‘Brilliant!’ The most uncomfortable seats you’ve ever sat on.”Not suitable for trains: how Bridgerton’s longest ever sex scene set commuters’ pulses racingRead moreIncidentally, she was telling someone the other day why she hates Irish country and western music. “Which I’m sorry to anyone who’s a fan, but I literally have, like, a Pavlovian horror response to it, because it’s what my dad used to play in the car on the way to mass on Sunday. So I hear it. I’m like” – she makes a noise like huuuurrr from the pit of her stomach – “It’s straight back to getting out of bed early on a Sunday, getting into the car, listening to country and western music and then having an existential crisis.”She followed her siblings to the University of Galway, studying English and classics because she liked the “salacious” aspect, “all the bacchanalia” in Roman and Greek history. “Less so the dates of wars.” Afterwards, she went to the Oxford School of Drama for a foundation course, then on to Royal Birmingham Conservatoire’s School of Acting for a master’s. She wrote her thesis on improv in the work of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach.There followed a painful and very lean near decade while she waited for her acting career to take off. She did a series of jobs – as a waitress at Bill’s in Ealing (“Didn’t love that”) and at Snog in Westfield, Shepherd’s Bush (“My worst job. People go to Westfield just to be terrible to other people”).One of her favourite jobs was at Lush. “I used to do all the bath bombs and stuff for little kids. I love kids.” But even that had its low points. “One day a little girl said, ‘When I’m older, I want to work here.’ Without a beat, her mum said, ‘No, no, darling, when you’re older, you’ll have a better job than this.’ I wanted to say, ‘I have two degrees. I have no shame in what job I’m doing. Why do you think I’m less than you because I can only get this job?’” Twice she had to return home when she ran out of money. Once she was fired from a promo job with Coors Light because, she says, one of the reps freaked out at how young she looked.She still gets ID’d – although it’s been a few months now, so she wonders aloud if she’s crossed the threshold for what it looks like to be 18. Earlier this year she was at a film festival discussing how she was first cast as 15-year-old Clare in Derry Girls when she was 30, andBarry Keoghanpiped up from the audience, “What? How old is she now? Why does she look like that?”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian. Styling: Aimée Croysdill, assisted by Julia-Rose Stanbrook. Hair: Halley Brisker.

Shoes:LouboutinCoughlan has an immediacy of emotion that is both startling and entertaining. She says her brain goes off “in 50 different directions” and she can bring seemingly quite disparate subjects together without any fear of contradiction. She remembers now how she had no patience once she’d grasped a concept at school. But as she got older, her high-speed approach became more difficult. For instance, she could only ever revise last minute. To learn her lines for her drama exams she locked herself in her wardrobe. “Literally. I remember sitting in the wardrobe going, ‘Why can’t you just do this normally?” (She still learns lines in the makeup chair shortly before going on set.)But then there was the hyperfocus and the slight bewilderment that not everyone was as interested in certain topics as her. Left to her own devices she’ll spending hours browsing gadgets on the internet – “I have two air purifiers, two robot vacuums, two air quality monitors” – or watching really dressed-up girls making sandwiches on TikTok while at the same time forgetting to eat. “That was a big thing living alone, that I would get no sense of how time would be passing.”She talks animatedly about her two forthcoming projects – the latest of Dominic Savage’sI Amseries and The Magic Faraway Tree alongside Claire Foy and Andrew Garfield – and I ask, was it better, in the end, to have found fame older? “For me, yes. I had to live in the real world and learn how to pay my council tax, etc. It made me aware and appreciative of what I have. I also know what’s real and what’s important.”This will be the first Christmas in her life that Coughlan hasn’t gone home to Galway – “because of the play,” she explains. But her ties to the city are strong. Her two best friends from school still live there and her family, of course. Her mum worries – “Oh my God, she’s an Irish mother, she’s programmed to worry!” – but calls all the time. “She’ll be like, ‘Tell them to give you a day off. You tell them.’ And I’m like, ‘It doesn’t work like that, unfortunately.’”The Playboy of the Western World is at theNational Theatre in Londonuntil 28 February 2026 and will be broadcast in cinemas viaNT Livefrom 28 May 2026.Explore more on these topicsNicola CoughlanBridgertonDerry GirlsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It described being caught in the system as like being “at the whim of a faceless machine”.The review, by the disability rights expert Liz Sayce, concluded that senior DWP leaders had for a decade failed to grip or fix problems with the benefit, despite repeated warnings by whistleblowers, auditors and MPs.Couling’s post said one of the main causes of overpayments was as a result of the DWP’s “rather byzantine” guidance on the averaging of carer’s earnings. But he suggests these overpayments ultimately occurred because individual carers failed to report fluctuations in their earnings that breached benefit rules.“Incidentally what has been missed in all the [media] coverage is that this error (and hands up we made it and we will put it right) affects only a relatively small number of cases and wasn’t the cause of the original complaint. Because at the heart of the overpayment issues in CA [carer’s allowance] is a failure to report changes of circumstances,” Couling wrote.This is at odds with the government’s own position, which accepts the DWP itself was the main cause of overpayments because of its confusing guidance and unclear reporting processes.Kirsty McHugh, the chief executive ofCarersTrust, said: “This seems to be a really serious error of judgment. There has been an independent review which came up with some very clear findings. The DWP must now stand by this report and get on with returning money to carers.”View image in fullscreenThe Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, said he was ‘disgusted’ by Neil Couling’s blogpost.Photograph: House of Commons/UK Parliament/PAThe Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, said: “I’m disgusted by this blogpost as it shows some senior DWP people have learned nothing about the scale of the misery their policies and procedures inflicted. It’s high time the DWP showed some respect to carers and some awareness of their own gross errors.”Emily Holzhausen, the director of policy at Carers UK, said: “To say that the heart of the matter is claimants’ fault for not reporting changes in circumstances is missing the point entirely. The root cause of this is a confusing, complex and difficult to navigate system, which has caused numerous errors.”The government-commissioned Sayce review was ordered after anaward-winning Guardian investigationrevealed howunpaid carers had been unfairly hitwith draconian penalties of as much as £20,000 after unwittingly running up overpayments of carer’s allowance benefit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It estimates about 200,000 cases will be reviewed, with 26,000 likely to have debts cancelled or reduced.Last week, Sir Peter Schofield apologised to MPs for what ministers have called a “mess” inherited from the previous government: “I am sorry for all of those who are affected by this, but I am going to sort it out,” Schofield said.Six years ago, Schofieldrefused three times to apologise to MPsover carer’s allowance failures. Although he then promised to fix the overpayment problem, 180,000 carers ran up debts of £300m on his watch between 2019 and 2025, roughly one in five of all claimants, of whom 854 were convicted of fraud.A DWP spokesperson said: “We have been clear, and remain of the view, that we accept the vast majority of recommendations put forward in the Sayce review, including that confusing rules on averaging earnings left carers facing unexpected debts.“That’s why we are tackling this issue and have already put in place extra staff to prevent carers building up large debts, updated internal guidance, and ensure letters to unpaid carers clearly explain what changes need reporting.“And we will continue putting things right and rebuilding trust by reassessing affected cases, and potentially reducing, cancelling or refunding debts for tens of thousands of carers.”Explore more on these topicsCarersBenefitsSocial careCivil servicenewsShareReuse this content"

In a social media post three years ago, he appears to have said: “Dr Shaga Bing-Bong…. Time she F’d off back to Nigeria. She’d feel more at home there.”And in a post this year attacking David Lammy, the justice secretary, he allegedly wrote: “No foreign national or first generation migrant should be allowed to sit in parliament.”Cooper, who has not responded to the allegations, was Reform’s parliamentary candidate for Tamworth in a byelection in 2023 and again in last year’s general election.Myska was allegedly targeted by Cooper earlier this year, just weeks before he became leader of Staffordshire county council.A post to Myska from Cooper’s X account in April, read: “You are neither ethnically, culturally or historically English. Your diaspora isn’t NW European. All you have is a piece of paper entitling you to British citizenship.”Sarah Edwards, the Labour MP for Tamworth, said the social media posts displayed “deeply disturbing white supremacist views”.View image in fullscreenSangita Myska: ‘Reform UK is a private company and it’s the chief executive that will set the culture and that person is Nigel Farage.’Photograph: Ashley Coombes/Shutterstock for Edinburgh TV FestivalMyska said she held Farage and the widerReform UKleadership responsible for the “culture” that enabled their politicians and members to amplify racist rhetoric online.“Without a shadow of a doubt, Nigel Farage’s track record is emboldening party members and now elected councillors and potentially those that might become MPs to express views that were once considered completely unacceptable in mainstream political discourse,” she said.“Reform UK is a private company and it’s the chief executive that will set the culture and that person is Nigel Farage.”Farage is under mounting pressure after 28 of his school contemporaries told the Guardian they had witnesseddeeply offensive racist or antisemitic behaviour by him at Dulwich college, a public school in south-east London.Former Dulwich pupil says Farage told him: ‘That’s the way back to Africa’Read moreThe Reform UK leader said this week he had never been racist or antisemitic with “malice”.Myska, who left LBC earlier this year, continued: “In any normal political environment the leader of the party who have these accusations levelled at them would have at the very least stood aside and an investigation launched.“But Nigel Farage has managed to shift what we consider normal in the UK political environment and it is dangerous. It’s dangerous because it’s setting a precedent.”She said the position of people of colour in public life in Britain was “becoming harder by the day”, in part due to an “unbelievably toxic environment in which anything goes” that became normalised during the Brexit campaign in 2016.“It feels like a feat for many of us to remain in the realms of public discourse on social media because of the racist abuse levelled at us on a daily basis,” she said. “The reason we have dug our heels in is because we are British. Britain is our home, it’s where we made our lives and we have no intention of going anywhere.”Myska said the online hate had deepened in recent years as immigration – and particularly the issue of small boats – had dominated the political agenda.There were legitimate concerns about those topics, she said, but added that they were being used as cover by people to attack anyone who was not white British.She said: “This guy [Cooper] thinks he’s entitled to attack me in this way, to attack the mayor of London – the financial capital of Europe, to attack Dr Shola in this way and the antecedent to this can be traced right back to Brexit.“Nigel Farage and Reform UK’s previous incarnation, Ukip, created a particular atmosphere around people of colour in Britain and despite Brexiting that hasn’t dissipated.”Reform UK has yet to publicly condemn the posts, but said: “Following an investigation into the failure to declare social media accounts during the candidate vetting process, Cllr Ian Cooper has had his membership of Reform UK revoked.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

I’m very, very disappointed. I have done so much for this club down the years and especially last season. Now I’m sitting on the bench and I don’t know why.Tanaka equaliser caps thrilling comeback as Leeds deny LiverpoolRead more“It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame.” He refused to specify who that person was.Salah has been leading scorer in the Premier League four times and was both the Professional Footballers’ Association’s and the Football Writers’ Association’s player of the year last season as he helpedLiverpoolto his and their second Premier League triumph. But he suggested next week’s home league game against Brighton could be his last for the club. He will join up with the Egypt squad for the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco after that and he gave a strong hint that he could leave Liverpool in the January transfer window.“I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager and all of a sudden, we don’t have any relationship,” Salah said afterLiverpool’s 3-3 draw at Elland Roadon Saturday. “I don’t know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn’t want me in the club.“This club, I always support it. My kids will always support it. I love the club so much I will always do. I called my mum yesterday – you guys [journalists] didn’t know if I would start or not, but I knew. Yesterday I said [to my mum]: ‘Come to the Brighton game. I don’t know if I am going to play or not but I am going to enjoy it.’ In my head, I’m going to enjoy that game because I don’t know what is going to happen now. I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go the Africa Cup. I don’t know what is going to happen when I am there.”View image in fullscreenA dejected Arne Slot leaves the pitch at Elland Road after Leeds secured a draw in added time.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesAsked directly if he thought that the Brighton fixture at Anfield next Saturday would be his last for Liverpool, he replied: “In football you never know. I don’t accept this situation. I have done so much for this club.”Salah has scored only four Premier League goals this season, one of those a penalty, and has been widely criticised for his lack of defensive work as Liverpool have endured a stuttering start to their title defence. But he is clearly hurt that he is taking the blame for their poor form and feels the club have let him down after he agreed a two-year contract extension in the spring.“I got a lot of promises and so far I am on the bench for three games so I can’t say they have kept the promise,” he said. “It is not acceptable for me. I don’t know why this is happening to me. I don’t get it. I think if this was somewhere else, every club would protect its player. How I see it now is like: ‘You throw Mo under the bus because he is the problem in the team now.’ But I don’t think I am the problem. I have done so much for this club.“The respect, I want to get. I don’t have to go every day fighting for my position because I earned it. I am not bigger than anyone but I earned my position. It’s football. It is what it is. I am top goalscorer, best player, winning the league in such a style, but I am the one who has to defend himself in front of the media and fans.“After what I have done for the club it really hurts. You can imagine, really. After going from home to the club and you don’t know if you are starting. I know the club too well, I have been here many years. Tomorrow [the Sky pundit Jamie] Carragher is going to go for me again and again and that’s fine.”Salah did not feature in the win at West Ham last Sunday but came off the bench at half-time in the draw against Sunderland on Wednesday. However, he did not make an appearance at Elland Road, a situation he clearly finds extremely frustrating. “I have been at this club, scoring more than anyone in this generation, since I came to the Premier League. If I was somewhere else, everybody would go to the media and defend the players. I am the only one in this situation. Can I give an example?“It’s silly but I am sorry. I remember a while ago, Harry Kane was not scoring for 10 games, and everyone in the media was like: ‘Oh, Harry will score for sure.’ When it comes to Mo everyone is like: ‘He needs to be on the bench.’”There has been consistent interest from the Saudi Pro League for several months, but Salah would not be drawn on whether that was his likely destination. “I don’t want to answer this question,” he said, “because the club is going to take me to a different direction.”Did he regret signing the new contract? “Imagine how bad I feel that I have to answer it, honestly,” he said. “That hurts, even the question hurts. This club, signing for this club, I will never regret it. I thought I’m going to renew here and end my career here, but this is not according to the plan, so I’m not regretting signing for the club for sure.“Somehow it will end but the thing in my head is like: ‘Why it should end this way?’ Because I am too fit, just five months ago I was just winning every individual award so why should it go this direction?”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolMohamed SalahLeeds UnitedArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

The group has repeatedly rejected the proposition.Hamas said on Saturday that it was ready to hand over its weapons in the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian authority on the condition that the Israeli army’s occupation ends.“Our weapons are linked to the existence of the occupation and the aggression,” Hamas’s chief negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said in a statement.“If the occupation ends, these weapons will be placed under the authority of the state,” he added.Under theplan endorsed by the UNin November, Israel is to withdraw from its positions, Gaza is to be administered by a transitional governing body known as the “Board of Peace”, and an international stabilisation force is to be deployed.“We need to deploy this force as soon as possible on the ground because one party, which is Israel, is every day violating the ceasefire,” Egypt’s foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, said at the Doha Forum.The Egyptian foreign ministry said Abdelatty and Sheikh Mohammed met on Saturday, with both stressing “the importance of continuing efforts to implement” the peace agreement.Arab and Muslim nations, however, have been hesitant to participate in the new force, which could end up fighting Palestinian militants.Trump would theoretically chair the “Board of Peace”, while the identities of the other members have yet to be announced.Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, told the forum that talks on the stabilisation force were continuing, with critical questions remaining as to its command structure and which countries would contribute.Fidan said its first goal “should be to separate Palestinians from the Israelis”.Abdelatty seconded the idea, calling for the force to be deployed along “the yellow line in order to verify and to monitor” the truce.There have been many deadly incidents of Israeli forces firing on Palestinians in the vicinity of the yellow line since the ceasefire went into effect.Turkey, also a guarantor of the truce, has indicated it wants to take part in the stabilisation force, but its efforts are viewed unfavourably in Israel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said custard and apple crumble was flung at the case, which contained the imperial state crown.Scotland Yard said: “Four protesters have been arrested following criminal damage at the Tower of London. Police were called at 09.48hrs on Saturday 6 December to the Tower of London following reports of criminal damage to a display case, containing the state crown.“It was reported that four protesters threw suspected food on to the case before two left the scene. Officers worked closely with City of London police and security officers and four people have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. They have been taken into custody.”The Tower of London, one of the capital’s most popular tourist attractions, was partially closed to the public while the police investigation continued. It reopened later on Saturday afternoon. “The crown jewels have not been damaged,” Historic Royal Palaces said.Take Back Power said it carried out the stunt to demand the UK government establishes a permanent citizens’ assembly – a “House of the People” – with the power to “tax extreme wealth and fix Britain”.Footage shared by the group showed one demonstrator removing the large foil tray of crumble from a bag and slamming it against the glass protecting the crown. Another repeatedly poured a tub of bright yellow custard on the front of the case.The demonstrators then opened their coats to show their T-shirt slogans reading “Take Back Power”, before one shouted “democracy has crumbled” and another shouted: “Britain is broken. We’ve come here to the jewels of the nation to take back power.”The group released a statement, in which it named one of the activists as 19-year-old Zahra Ali, a student from London. She said: “Our country is crumbling before our eyes. We have homeless people dying on the very streets that King Charles passed on his way to the coronation, whilst there are more empty homes than unhoused people in this country. It’s time the ultra-rich pay their fair share.”Surprised tourists could be seen reacting to the stunt, while a Tower of London worker approached, saying: “Excuse me, excuse me”, as she radioed for help.Initial reports suggested the whole of the site had been shut. The Metropolitan police later said only the Jewel House had closed, before Historic Royal Palaces issued a further update saying it had reopened.Explore more on these topicsLondonCrimeMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

As a consequence, Tuchel may rethink the date when he takes his squad over to the US for a pre-tournament camp in Fort Lauderdale.The Champions League final will be played in Budapest on 30 May and, originally, Tuchel was considering whether to travel to the US before that – with any Champions League final players to follow afterwards. Now, he may delay the departure for everyone until after the showpiece club game.The Football Association is set to narrow down its search for a tournament training base. Given the identity of the group match venues, with Boston and New Jersey on the east coast, it appears that the original preference for Kansas City may have to be shelved. Tuchel said after Friday’s draw: “We had some preferred options and I think they’re out of the window now but let’s see.”Harry Kane has given his reaction to the draw. “There are some tough games,” the England captain told Cleats Club. “It just makes me excited. And as the season goes on, the excitement will grow and grow. We will try and win it. That’s always the aim for England – to try and be champions. We have to have the mindset that we can beat anyone and it’s no different at the World Cup.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026EnglandScotlandWorld CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

A press conference last week – held at a crucial time for a Pentagon embroiled in scandal – was instead attended by more than a dozen rightwing activists, with the government being held to account by a close ally ofDonald Trump, an employee at Turning Point USA and someone from a pillow salesman’s nascent media company.Almost all credentialed reporters from traditional media companies surrendered their Pentagon press passes in October, rather than sign a 21-page Pentagon document that set restrictions on journalistic activities.New York Times sues Pentagon over Trump team’s limits on press reportingRead moreThose constraints include requiring news organizations to pledge they will not obtain unauthorized material – in effect limiting journalists to reporting on officially provided information – and agreeing to limits on journalists entering certain parts of the Pentagon.Following that walkout, the Pentagon issued passes and access to dozens of rightwing media figures and organizations who agreed to the strict rules, including Laura Loomer, a Trump confidante who has described herself as a “proud Islamophobe”; LindellTV, an online streaming channel founded by Mike Lindell, a conspiracy theorist and CEO of MyPillow; and Matt Gaetz, a disgraced former congressman turned host at One America News Network.The lack of serious media figures scrutinizing the Pentagon – last year Loomerfilmed herself eating dog foodfor an advert, while LindellTVappears to existprimarily to push Lindell’sdisproven claimsof election fraud – comes at a time when there is a particular need for journalists to provide proper scrutiny of a Pentagon beset by controversy.On Thursday, anindependent reportpublished by the Pentagon’s office of inspector general found that the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, “created a risk to operational security that could have resulted in failed US mission objectives and potential harm to US pilots” when he used the chat app Signal to discuss details of an operation in Yemen. A journalist from the Atlantic was included in the Signal group chat where Hegseth shared the information – the debacle led to calls for Hegseth’s resignation. Separately, the Pentagoncontinues to face questionsover the double strike conducted on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean.The new press corps seems ill-positioned to ask those questions, or to hold the government to account. Loomer and Gaetz are hyper-partisan rightwing commentators and avid supporters of the Trump administration; LindellTV and other organizations which signed the agreement, like Turning Point USA, the Daily Signal, the Gateway Pundit and the Post Millennial, are self-professed conservative outlets.“It’s incredibly problematic. We’re talking about severely limited access to the already secretive military-industrial complex,” said Carole-Anne Morris, a journalism professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.“I have a hard time assigning any credibility whatsoever to any media outlet or journalist who would agree to the terms of the Pentagon’s new press policy. Essentially, these folks will only be able to parrot information they’re spoon-fed by some media liaison in the Pentagon. They can’t seek out information on their own. Doesn’t sound like journalism to me. Here’s what it actually is: a group of alt-right outlets who are vying to be mouthpieces and apologists for this administration.”The New York Timessuedthe Pentagon and Hegseth on Thursday, alleging that the ban “seeks to restrict journalists’ ability to do what journalists have always done – ask questions of government employees and gather information to report stories that take the public beyond official pronouncements”, and experts have warned that the government is violating the first amendment right to free speech.“Everything about the press and the way it works requires independence from the government, so anything that restricts what you can say, what you can do, anything that’s about how you do your job is just unacceptable,” said Gregg Leslie, executive ​director​ of the First Amendment Clinic,​ at Arizona State University’s ​Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law.“It’s just a fundamental violation of the first amendment. I mean, you can make the argument that nobody has the right to get into the Pentagon, and the same is true of the White House, but once they start making decisions that discriminate against you based on how you’re going to cover something or what your viewpoint is, that’s going to become completely unacceptable.”As criticism continued this week, the Pentagon issued its own, school newspaper-stylereporton Wednesday, chirpily hailing a “whirlwind of activity” for its staff, who it said had completed three days of “onboarding” for the new press corps. That new makeup consists of more than 70 independent journalists, bloggers and “social media influencers”, the report said.“This ‘new media’ operates differently than traditional media, and Pentagon leadership believes it is better equipped to inform a broader swath of the American public about what goes on inside the department,” Kingsley Wilson, the Pentagon’s press secretary, said in the release.Of the new, almost exclusively rightwing press corps, Wilson said: “We want to make sure that we’re reaching as many Americans as possible.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsPete HegsethDonald TrumpUS press and publishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They were just young boys, aged nine and 10 and, after all, a ceasefire had been declared inGaza.Their mother, Hala Abu Assi, was making tea in the family’s tent in Khan Younis when she heard an explosion, a missile fired by an Israeli drone. She ran to the scene – but it was too late.Since the US-brokered ceasefire was announced on 10 October, Israeli forces have killed more than 360 Palestinians in Gaza; according to a UN official, at least 70 are children – like Jumaa and Fadi.View image in fullscreenA mourner holds up a phone picturing Jumaa and Fadi Abu Assi at the boys’ funeral on 29 November.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThey were killed, their mother said, at “a time when bloodshed was supposed to stop”.“After the ceasefire was announced, I felt a bit of safety and believed that nothing would harm my children any more,” Abu Assi said. “But fate had another plan.”She is focused now on keeping her two surviving daughters alive. “I still hear explosions and gunfire,” she said. “I do not feel that the war has ended.”The toll from Israeli attacks in Gaza has fallen significantly compared with the preceding two years of war, when on average 90 Palestinians were killed each day, but significant numbers of civilians are still losing their lives.On average, Israeli weapons now kill seven people a day. That rate of violent death would be considered an active conflict in many other contexts, raising questions about how accurately “ceasefire” describes the new status quo.View image in fullscreenTents burn in Khan Younis on 3 December in an Israeli strike that killed five people, including two children, in violation of the ceasefire.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“It’s something that if you want to you can call a ceasefire, which is very convenient for the Americans and for everyone who wants this off their television screens and off their streets and off their annoying parliamentary and political schedules,” said Daniel Levy, a former Israeli negotiator and the president of the US/Middle East Project.“It is very convenient for Israel. The pressure is off and they have smashed the whole place up, and can still kill as they please.”Amnesty International has allegedthat Israel is still committing genocide in Gaza and that the use of the term ceasefire “risks creating a dangerous illusion that life in Gaza is returning to normal”.Chart on Gaza deathsThe Israeli military has made clear it is still operating a shoot-to-kill policy around its positions. It acknowledged the drone strike on Jumaa and Fadi Abu Assi, describing the two young boys collecting wood to feed and warm their family as “suspects” who threatened Israeli soldiers.‘Yellow line’ hardensLike many of those killed under the ceasefire, the young brothers were targeted for approaching the “yellow line” to which the army has withdrawn under the truce. It now bifurcates Gaza, giving Israel the lion’s share. In the original ceasefire map Israel would continue to occupy 53% of the Gaza Strip, but the Israeli army unilaterally expanded that to 58% when it laid down markers to delineate its territory.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian woman and her children trudge through the rubble on 21 November after being displaced again by the Israeli army’s expansion of its ‘yellow line’.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThis division is Gaza’s new reality, with the US military preparing for anindefinite partitioninto what it calls a “green zone” under Israeli and international military control, where reconstruction would start, and a “red zone” to be left in ruins.According to a geographical analysis by Forensic Architecture, the great bulk of Gaza’s fertile farmland is in Israeli hands, while the population is mostly confined to the barren coastal sand dunes, the “red zone”.The ceasefire proposals put forward by Donald Trump, enshrined in large part in aUN security council resolutionlast month, imagined further steps after the first-phase hostage and prisoner exchange and the pullback to the “yellow line”.Israeli forces are supposed to continue to withdraw, to be replaced by an international stabilisation force (ISF) overseen by a “peace board” chaired by Trump, with other world leaders of his choosing, with a technocratic Palestinian committee to conduct day-to-day governance.However, these phases, even more difficult to agree than the initial halt to fighting, were left purposefully vague and remain just as hazy two months on.Israel has been adamant there can be no progress from the first phase until all the bodies of hostages killed during the war are returned and Hamas is disarmed.Hamas has found and returned all but one of the bodies and has said it is prepared to discuss handover of offensive weapons, such as rocket launchers and rockets, but not to Israel or any Israeli-backed entity.The UN resolution in November suggested the ISF could lead the disarmament, but none of the countries supposed to be contributing troops, such as Indonesia, Azerbaijan or Pakistan, are willing to send soldiers to take weapons from Hamas against its will.A EU-sponsored training programme for Palestinian police involving recruits from Gaza and the West Bank, which was under way in Egypt and Jordan before the ceasefire, is due to be expanded. But without a governing authority for Gazait is uncertain who would direct such a force, and Israel has made clear it will not countenance anything with a Palestinian national character.Against this backdrop of uncertainty and delay, there are growing signs that the “yellow line” is hardening into something more permanent, a partition of Gaza.The army has been building concrete outposts along the “yellow line”, creating new free-fire areas around them. On the Israeli-occupied side of the line, the army has continued to flatten Palestinian neighbourhoods wrecked by the war, despite the Trump plan’s commitment to reconstruction.What will rise in their place, if anything, is unclear. Israel has indicated it will allow construction only in the “green zone” it occupies, and plans developed by the US government and military envisage scattered fenced camps, rather than rebuilding Palestinian communities.Referred to as “alternative safe communities” (ASCs), they would be little more than refugee camps, with Palestinians living in prefabricated units or repurposed shipping containers, with shared community toilets and showers.Residents would be vetted to exclude any Palestinian who had been paid by Hamas even in a civilian role, or who had a relative, including cousins, aunts and uncles, who had been on any Hamas payroll.It is not clear if those who moved to the Israeli-controlled areas would be allowed to cross back to the western zone of Gaza.Several humanitarian organisations and European countries have refused to take part in planning for ASCs, on the grounds the project could break international law. They fear the ASCs could be used as a tool of coercive displacement, and exploit civilian needs to pursue military goals.The US is also ignoring basic issues such as land ownership, said Amjad Iraqi, the senior analyst for Israel and Palestine at theInternational Crisis Group. “American officials coming in with this sort of blank slate approach, that you just can sort of reconstruct things from scratch as if nothing existed before, no houses or no communities or no land registrations in the areas. It breaks every international law in the book,” Iraqi said.Even if the US does push ahead with a pilot ASC planned for Rafah, the project will do almost nothing to ease the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza.Mountains of rubble dotted with unexploded bombs must be cleared before construction can start and even the most optimistic timeline allows for six months’ work before the first Palestinians move in, sources briefed on the plans said.When completed it would house only 25,000 people, barely 1% of Gaza’s population.Locked in dire conditionsMeanwhile, the ceasefire deal as it stands leaves Gaza’s remaining 2.2 million Palestinians hemmed into just 42% of their former territory, and locked into dire conditions.View image in fullscreenAn encampment of displaced Palestinians in northern Gaza City on 30 November.Photograph: APAImages/ShutterstockPalestinians are by no means safe from Israeli strikes, many of which have been in “relocation areas” set aside for them, according to the Forensic Architecture analyst group.Nine in 10 Palestinians in Gaza are without homes, which have been reduced to ruins. The latest satellite data suggests 81% of dwellings have been destroyed or severely damaged by Israeli bombardment. Most live in tents, vulnerable to the coming winter.Two heavy downpours in Novemberflooded Gaza’s tented camps, washing away hundreds ,if not thousands, of shelters. In the most recent deluge, on 25 November, tents in Deir al-Balah collapsed under the pressure of water pouring in from all directions. Some people tried digging channels to divert the water away, while most stayed huddled in their tents. Much of the flood water came from overflowing sewage pits nearby.View image in fullscreenA woman attempts to clear filthy sludge out of her family’s tent after heavy rain.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“We are very concerned about water-borne diseases given the dire hygiene situation and lack of sufficient sanitation. We are concerned that diseases like cholera could appear if the situation doesn’t improve as soon as possible,” said Jonathan Crickx, spokesperson for the UN child protection agency, Unicef, inPalestine. “There’s been a significant spike in acute watery diarrhoea over the past four weeks affecting children above five.”Food supplies in Gaza have increased since the declaration of the ceasefire. Aid deliveries have gone up from an average of 91 trucks a day in the month before the 10 October truce, to 133 a day in the following month.A reduction in looting also makes it easier for aid groups to reach the most vulnerable people. Before the ceasefire, most aid was stolen by gangs or desperate Palestinians before reaching its destination.Chart on aid truck deliveriesAt the same time, non-UN shipments, including commercial supplies and deliveries from Arab countries, have increased at a faster rate. According to World Food Programme figures, commercial shipments have nearly quadrupled from 37 trucks a day in September to 144 trucks daily in the first week of November.The influx of commercial goods has reduced prices in markets from the astronomical levels of the war. Flour in the Deir al-Balah market costs four shekels (93p) a kg, a kg of sugar is five shekels (£1.16), a single egg four shekels, and a chicken 35 shekels (£8.11). A tent costs between 1,000 and 2,000 shekels (£231 to £462).But even these prices are beyond the vast majority of Palestinians, who have exhausted their savings after two years without work and now rely on aid.Chart on commercial truck flowHowever, the total inflow of goods remains below the prewar average of 600 trucks a day, while the needs of the population have increased exponentially, as the war has robbed almost all Palestinians of shelter, their livelihoods, schools and hospitals.“We’re not seeing major increases in the scope of stuff that is coming in,” said Sam Rose, the acting director for Gaza for Unrwa, the UN relief agency serving Palestinians in the region.Unrwa is by far the biggest aid agency in Gaza, but has been banned by Israel, which claims some of its 13,000 employees in the territory took part in the October 2023 attack on Israel that ignited the war.View image in fullscreenThe price of food has dropped since its peak, but items at the Deir al-Balah market are still out of reach of most Palestinians.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesWorld risks being complicitEuropean and Arab states justified their support for the Trump proposals at the UN resolution that codified them as a way to keep the US engaged in peace efforts and to give his proposed steps some form of legitimacy – and at least a nod towards some future Palestinian state.They have rationalised their involvement in the Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC) along similar lines, pointing to modest improvements in aid deliveries in the hope of containing the threat of famine.The CMCC, established in a warehouse in Kiryat Gat, southern Israel, is staffed by the Israeli and US militaries along with liaison officers from other countries backing the ceasefire. There is no Palestinian representation.Observers warn European and Arab states as well as aid agencies that without significant advances in the peace process, the CMCC risks being complicit with the Israeli military in a status quo that keeps Palestinians in inhuman conditions, and in schemes such as the ASC plan, in contravention of humanitarian law.“An army that has just committed a genocide has 30, 40 other militaries now collaborating with it in its back yard,” Daniel Levy said.Rose said: “There’s not as much international outrage and pressure directed towards Israel these days, but the fact is that people are living in miserable conditions and continue to be killed in spite of the ceasefire.“Palestinians are being confronted with these multiple possible futures over which they have zero control. So that element of helplessness, psychological torture and cruelty they’ve endured for the past two years – that persists.”Faiq al-Sakani has nowhere to take his family of nine other than the wrecked shell of their home in Gaza City’s Tuffah district, about 500 metres from the “yellow line”. For the 37-year-old, no day is without anxiety that his children could die.“The situation is extremely tense. Every day, we hear the sounds of tanks moving, firing shells, and shooting in all directions,” he said on Thursday. “Just yesterday, a group of my relatives was directly targeted in the area; three of them were killed, and several others were critically injured.”“It feels as if the war is still ongoing and there has been no ceasefire,” Sakhani added. “It is unbearable; there is no sign of normal life at all.”"

The Canadian-American architect, whodiedin his Los Angeles home at 96, designed a career around defying what was predictable and pulling in materials that were uncommon and, as such, relatively inexpensive.Gehry collaborated with artists to turn giant binoculars into an entryway of a commercial campus, and paid homage to a writer’s past as a lifeguard by creating a livable lifeguard tower. And while dreaming this up, he transformed American architecture along the way.Below, take a look at how his work wrapped around and shaped the neighborhoods and urban centers ofCalifornia.Walt Disney Concert HallView image in fullscreenThe Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles.Photograph: Buyenlarge/Getty ImagesWith its stainless steel waves rolling on a corner of Downtown Los Angeles, the Walt Disney Concert Hall has become an integral part of this urban center. Lillian Disney gifted the hall to the city and to pay tribute to her late husband’s commitment to the arts. Gehry built the music hallfrom the inside out, designing it around how music was to be heard within its walls with a team of acousticians.While the hall’s exterior has free-forming waves and Gehry’s touch of unconventional geometry, the interior is surprisingly symmetrical – an intentional contrast. “The reason I made Disney Hall symmetrical was because I knew that I was a very suspect architect for a building like that by the general public,” Gehry told the Getty. “Everybody is going to think I’m going to do a Thing. So I decided to give them a comfort zone.”Gehry houseView image in fullscreenThe Gehry residence in Santa Monica.Photograph: BDP/AlamyGehry pruned this Dutch colonial bungalow in Santa Monica down to its original wooden bones and, in 1978, built around it intricate layers of glass, exposed plywood, corrugated metal, and chain-link fencing. The home is considered one of his earliest works of deconstructivist architecture, with large tilting windows that allow the outside world to peer into the home’s internal, seemingly unfinished structure. Gehry continued to add to this residence until 1992.Binoculars BuildingView image in fullscreenThe Binoculars Building in Venice.Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/Getty ImagesFirst commissioned as a commercial office building in Venice for advertising agency Chiat/Day, this bold design has become one of Gehry’s most recognizable works inLos Angeles, thanks to its towering entryway that looks exactly like what it is: a giant pair of binoculars. This 44-foot feature was actually designed and created by his collaborators, artists Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen. Gehry designed the 79,000 sq ft campus to have a tree-like metal canopy facade on the south of the binoculars, with a bright-white ship-like exterior to the north. Google has occupied the building since 2011, though it is currently on sale for the first time in 30 years for an undisclosed price.Norton residenceView image in fullscreenThe Norton Residence in Venice.Photograph: Saulius T Kondrotas/AlamyWhen artists hire artists to design a home, places like the Norton residence pop into existence on Venice Beach’s famed Ocean Front Walk. Inspired by photos of his Santa Monica home, Lynn and William Norton, an artist and writer respectively, hired Gehry to bring this eclectic deconstructivist beachfront home to life in the 1980s. Gehry’s design plays with contrasting sizes of stucco and concrete boxes, heights and shapes, making chaos seem like a cohesive, colorful whole. At the forefront of the property is Gehry’s version of a lifeguard tower in the shape of a one-room studio standing on a single pillar, an apparent nod to William Norton’s former life as a lifeguard.Loyola Marymount University Law SchoolView image in fullscreenThe columns of Merrifield Hall on the Loyola Law School campus, and the facade of the South Instructional Building.Photograph: Roger Ressmeyer/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesGehry was chosen to redesign the law school for Loyola Marymount University in 1979 because, unlike other architects who presented plans for a big building, Gehry proposed a collection of smaller buildings designed around a plaza. Robert Benson, a member of the committee who selected Gehry’s design,saidthe committee “squabbled” with the architect over his strange but signature choice of materials and angles, including sheet metal-wrapped Roman columns, chainlink fences or the peculiar angling of a building. Gehry won most of the squabbles, as Benson recalls it, and the result is a village-like complex of contemporary buildings, bold shapes, bright yellows and at least one oversized chainlink structure.Explore more on these topicsFrank GehryLos AngelesCaliforniaArchitectureWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Malaysia, Denmark and Norway are to follow suit and the European Union last week passed a resolution to adopt similar restrictions. As the world watches on, millions of Australian adolescents and their parents are wondering just what will actually change come 10 December.Concerns around the negative impact social media use can have on the wellbeing of young people have been around since the quaint days of Myspace – long before those to be affected by the ban were even born.Heard of Coverstar, Lemon8 or Yope? Teenagers rush to apps not covered by social media banRead moreSupporters of the social media “delay” policy believe that restricting under-16s access will reduce mental health risks, exposure to harmful content and the social malaise associated with being chronically online. Those opposed worry that the legislation is ill-conceived, will push children into murkier corners of the web, impinge on their human rights, exacerbate some mental health conditions or simply prove futile.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsAs the world waits to see just how this grand experiment will play out, the Guardian spoke to teenagers about their feelings as the ban approaches. All five are on the youth advisory board of the Australian Theatre for Young People, which will next month host a production of The Censor, which canvasses issues of teen social media use, literacy and adult censorship of their lives.From indifference to frustration or simply being confounded by the choices being made by the adults in the room, the perennial teen question remains: “What’s the big deal?”‘It feels deeply unfair the government is punishing an entire age group ’View image in fullscreenSarai Ades says ‘removing social media removes a major avenue for self-discovery and belonging’.Photograph: Joel Pratley/The GuardianSarai Ades, 14I’ve been using Snapchat, Facebook Messenger as well as Instagram and TikTok since I got a phone in 2023.I find the “delay” very frustrating because it targets young people instead of addressing the issues at the root of online harms; things like algorithmic amplification of bigotry, the spread of misinformation and the lack of accountability for the companies and creators who profit from harmful or discriminatory content.Teens are not the primary drivers of harmful content. Much of it comes from high-influence adult creators, political commentators and extremist groups, and it feels deeply unfair that the government is punishing an entire age group by removing access rather than regulating platforms.I think media literacy is very important, especially for our generation. We need to be taught the right methods to deal with the online world in ways that don’t become harmful – and that includes the bigotry that is often disguised as “opinions” on social media. Eliminating [access] without doing anything about building our media literacy is the equivalent of the government banning books until we are 16 and expecting us to magically start reading critically.Right now, media literacy doesn’t figure highly in our syllabus, but it should. It’s taught in a very boring way and it isn’t up to date; we might learn about cyberbullying but not echo chambers, for example. And with the rise of AI, there is a whole new world to understand that could harm us, but we aren’t taught anything about that. I think the government could definitely be focusing its efforts there and on specific aspects of social media, rather than just establishing a whole ban.2:08eSafety commissioner questioned on Roblox and social media ban after Guardian investigation – videoHaving less exposure to this kind of harmful content might be good for our mental health in some ways, but I think the negatives outweigh the positives.I grew up on another continent and social media is a primary way that I feel connected with these childhood friends. Australia promotes itself as a multicultural, globally connected country, but this ban will cut teens off from their cultural communities and international friendships. And for multicultural teens that loss is significant, especially living in an Anglo-dominant country like Australia.Social media ban: Instagram and Facebook begin shutting down under-16 accounts in Australia as ban loomsRead moreMy generation uses social media as a tool for identity formation; we explore other cultures, our creative expression, neurodivergence, gender identity, political beliefs. Removing social media removes a major avenue for self-discovery and belonging.My daily screen time average on socials is about two hours, shared between Pinterest, Instagram and TikTok equally. Developing a healthy relationship with your screen time has become quite trendy. Me and most of my friends already use apps that help us manage our time online, we all use “do not disturb” and only check our phones when we have time.Whatever time I do gain will be used to invest in my goals, but the irony is that I probably wouldn’t have half those goals without social media. The ban doesn’t just take away an app, it takes away inspiration and opportunities. For kids like myself in the performing arts, taking away our ability to share our skills online also limits our exposure and could put us behind on the world stage.Even if they aren’t trying to develop a presence though, the ban will drive teens to less savoury corners of the internet – shady apps, private browsers or unsafe websites, instead of regulated platforms. Cutting off access to socials won’t eliminate the need for online connection, it will just drive it underground.‘I don’t think I’ll be affected that much’View image in fullscreenPia Monte says she has had ‘a really positive experience on the social media I use, so I don’t see why it should be banned for everyone’.Photograph: Joel Pratley/The GuardianPia Monte, 13I only have accounts on WhatsApp and Pinterest so I won’t be directly affected by the social media ban, but I still don’t like it. I know people whose main support networks are on social media, so if that’s being taken away they will be left with nothing. I’ve had a really positive experience on the social media I use, so I don’t see why it should be banned for everyone.I don’t keep my phone in my room overnight, I just check it quickly in the morning for notifications, but I don’t really use it before school. I use it mostly to take a break from study, my daily screentime average this week was 49 minutes.I mostly use social media to look at cooking videos on YouTube or Pinterest; I can still use YouTube for that without an account and Pinterest isn’t being banned. Neither is WhatsApp and that’s what I use mostly to keep up with friends – I don’t know that many people my age who spend lots of time on the apps that are being banned anyway – so I don’t think I’ll be affected that much. I might get accounts for things like Instagram when I’m older, but there’s no rush.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

She says ‘it won’t affect me that much because I mostly use messages and WhatsApp to chat with friends’.Photograph: Joel Pratley/The GuardianGrace Guo, 14I’m quite indifferent to the ban, it won’t affect me that much because I mostly use messages and WhatsApp to chat with friends. I do post on YouTube sometimes, but I won’t care if I can’t. Sometimes the comments aren’t very nice so I won’t miss those. And anyway, you can still access the content without an account. When I’m using YouTube to research new skills or school work, sometimes irrelevant or inappropriate things come up, but that doesn’t change if you have an account or not.I’ve only been using Instagram since the start of this year, it’s just another way to communicate with friends and I don’t think two years is a long time to wait to use it again. It’s not a big deal to me, I’ll just use other messaging apps more.I only looked at my phone to check the time this morning. I first checked it for messages after school on my way home on the train. My screen time average is about an hour or two a day; most of that is chatting with friends across all the apps. I feel like our generation is quite dependent on it and I have friends who use their phones lots more than me.Overall, for kids my age, I think things will be pretty much the same – they will get around it if they want, use the banned apps without accounts or just wait. Maybe for younger kids the ban will delay some harmful experiences. But also it might be a lot to deal with at 16 if you haven’t been exposed before.‘Adults are viewing social media as something that hijacks our whole life’View image in fullscreen‘At the moment I only use YouTube and Discord’: Ewan Buchanan-Constable.Photograph: Joel Pratley/The GuardianEwan Buchanan-Constable, 15I’m a bit disappointed with the ban because I was introduced to a lot of my current creative interests through YouTube. At the moment I only use YouTube and Discord. I have a couple of videos up, but it’s not a regular thing. I use Discord to talk to friends and to engage with communities, mostly about movies and video games. Most of my friends use the apps that are being banned but I don’t feel excluded because the content that’s on there doesn’t really interest me.Coalition complaints about under-16s social media ban grow despite waving laws through parliamentRead moreI use my phone as an alarm but I don’t start using it in bed. Once I’ve eaten and showered I might put something on YouTube in the background while I get ready, but it’s not my main focus. My daily average is about two hours a day. On the weekends though, my screen time goes up to more like five hours because I often have podcasts, music or videos playing on YouTube while I study or do chores.Adults are viewing social media as something that hijacks our whole life, but really it’s just something we use in downtime and it doesn’t stop us from reaching out to each other and arranging to leave the house and hang out or anything like that. I also read, write and draw a lot. I play Dungeons and Dragons and video games.The way I look at it is that the goals the government has about mental health and limiting the harm of inappropriate content could be achieved through regulation and education rather than a ban.Making that education start earlier would be important, being able to navigate online spaces safely is something kids need to know about much younger now. And I think it might be dangerous to forget that and just let them loose at 16. They’re going to encounter lots of weird stuff online before then anyway, so they should be taught about it earlier.I’m not sure if I will ever start using social media, unless it’s for my career. I want to be an actor so for me it would be a professional tool rather than a source of entertainment.‘No one is going to miss scrolling’View image in fullscreenEmma Williams says the government ‘could spend their money better on educating rather than restricting’.Photograph: Joel Pratley/The GuardianEmma Williamson, 15I turn 16 in February, so it will just be the holidays without Instagram for me really. I opened my account a couple of years ago and then I changed schools so it has been a good way to stay in touch with those people I don’t see every day any more.I think everyone will miss the socialising part. But it’s also a relief to not have to do that on a platform designed to lure you in and waste your time, no one is going to miss scrolling. I get bored of watching reels quickly anyway, and AI slop is the worst, it takes so long to keep blocking that content and more keeps coming. I only want to see real content about my interests, like old audition videos of actors.My daily average for Instagram is about half an hour. I use an app called Fitlock that gives me access to certain apps I choose based on how many steps I do. It’s easy to turn off, but I try to stick to what I’ve earned. And funnily enough, most of what I’ve learned about how and why to keep social media use down has been from the apps themselves. There’s lots of content from people a bit older than me encouraging people to get off their phones and go and live their lives in the real world.My friends and I have group chats on Instagram but also on WhatsApp, so we will just spend more time there. Saying that, I find that Instagram content can be a fun conversation starter, so maybe we won’t chat as much without that to share.At school they teach about cyberbullying and harmful content but never about how to use the apps in healthy ways. I think the government could spend their money better on educating rather than restricting. Right now though what they teach us is really boring, they’d need to work on that.The Censor will play at ATYP’s Rebel theatre as part of Sydney festival, 22 to 25 January 2026Explore more on these topicsSocial media banChildrenSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

They started selling pillowy, coconut-dusted lamingtons, vanilla slices, chunky steak pies and crusty loaves of bread alongside crispy banh mi and rice paper rolls, creating a traditional country-style Australian bakery with a Vietnamese twist.View image in fullscreenLawrence Du (centre) helped grow the popularity of the bakery operated by his parents, Cindy Vuong and Shaun Du.Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The GuardianLawrence, 28, who runs his own social media marketing company, had grown up with the bakery and wanted to share stories of his parents’ “hard work, all the love and care that they pour into their business”, he tells Guardian Australia.Shaun and Cindy had a limited understanding of what their son wanted to do. But after costs rose with inflation and competition in the area increased, they finally relented.“I knew that the videos were going to do well, but I didn’t expect them to do this well,” Lawrence says.Lawrence leaned into his parents’ unpolished charm: Cindy is sweet and friendly and struggles to remember her lines, a neat dramatic foil to Shaun’s sardonic sense of humour. The videos are a wholesome and funny behind-the-scenes look at the couple, the workings of the bakery and the food they sell.Their firstTikTokvideo appeared last year. It was an instant success.It was viewed more than 100,000 times on that platform and another 50,000 times on Instagram, and the audience only seemed to expand. And the business grew.Cindy was recognised while out shopping. People started making long journeys just to taste their goods – including one man who drove from Adelaide.The bakery’s young staff – mostly high school and university students – also got involved, hosting and appearing in videos.“Out of all the businesses I’ve filmed for, they’re the staff that are always the most friendly and most enthusiastic about being in social media,” Lawrence says. “They honestly are, they’re such good sports.”3:17The Australian bakery that went viral on TikTok for defending its staff from trolls – videoLike in every social media fairytale, a darker side soon began to emerge.“We started getting racist comments, really inappropriate things said about my parents, and also some of the workers,” Lawrence says.The negativity seemed to snowball.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailSome of the workers were subjected to sexual harassment, and strangers found their personal accounts.

But she says Shaun and Lawrence were “super supportive”.“They asked us straight away, like, ‘did you want us to take any videos down?’ And even any weird comments, they were already being deleted or hidden,” she says.“They asked us all individually as well, and made sure we were all comfortable.”View image in fullscreenThe bakery gained a strong following for the videos, which often show how their food is prepared.Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The GuardianLast month, they posted a video directly addressing the issue.

It’s been harder for them to come to work. We just want to make sure that our staff feel safe and comfortable filming and go to work and go home from work.”It was this video that went viral.It had 12.1m views on TikTok at the time of writing.

Months later, their feelings came pouring outFind more stories fromthe moment I knew seriesDarcy GreenSat 6 Dec 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 6 Dec 2025 17.23 ESTShareIn 2018 I moved from Sydney to Oxford to complete my masters. My mum was born in London, and I was raised on my gran’s stories about England, so moving to Oxford felt oddly like going home.I was excited to get my degree, visit as many beautiful libraries as possible and play all the sports I could cram into my calendar. Falling in love wasn’t on my wishlist, but then I met Miranda.View image in fullscreen‘She was terrifying.’ Darcy and Miranda in Oxford in 2019We first met at an AFL Grand Final screening. A 2.30pm ball-drop in Melbourne meant an early start in the UK. I navigated my way to the common room through picture-perfect cobbled alleyways in the pre-dawn darkness. Miranda was energetically welcoming everyone through the door, distributing cups of coffee and bagels loaded with smashed avocado to bleary-eyed Aussies.I remember thinking she had an amazing smile. She’s the kind of person who practically vibrates with energy when she’s enthusiastic about something. I wish I could say that Miranda was immediately struck by my charms but, as Collingwood was playing, her mind was on more important things.Over the next couple of weeks, I found out more about Miranda. She was completing her masters in classical archaeology. She was a rower, the president of the Oxford University Australia and New Zealand Society, and in one of Oxford’s best chapel choirs. She seemed to know everyone.She was terrifying.I had a strategy, which was to try to attract her attention without going to the nerve-racking extreme of actually speaking to her. Just before Michaelmas term ended, I hosted a raucous pot-luck dinner in the common area of my graduate accommodation. Spirits were high, there was mulled wine on the stove and I forgot my nerves long enough to put Miranda in charge of the music playlist. In time-honoured Australian style, our initial conversation was mainly roasting one another about our tastes in Christmas music.View image in fullscreenMiranda and Darcy in Melbourne in 2022.Photograph: Benny ValentineShe told me later that whatreallygot her attention was when I (intentionally) set the Christmas pudding on fire. Buoyed up by my success with the pudding – and a nip of cooking brandy – I finally plucked up the courage to ask her out.Two months later, we were walking down Turl Street on a blustery winter day, holding hands, our clasped fingers warm in the pocket of my favourite teal coat. One moment I was explaining why I find Jane Austen’s works profoundly romantic, and the next I’d used our own relationship as an example of finding the person you wanted to be with for ever. I had never found it easy to talk about my feelings, but with Miranda the words came out before I had time to second-guess myself.The moment I knew: they decorated a carrot cake to celebrate with meRead moreI only had a moment to be nervous before she looked at me and smiled. I knew she felt the same way.We got married in September 2022 after weathering long distance, a global pandemic, unexpected cohabitation in a tiny apartment and an interstate move organised in under three days. We’re settled in Melbourne now, with two smug and spoilt indoor rabbits. There have been many wonderful moments in our years together, but I still think back on that accidental, unexpected confession on a wintery day.Darcy Green is the author ofAfter the Siren(Penguin; $22.99)Tell us the moment you knewShare your experienceShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.According to an informal survey of my nearest and occasionally dearest, many younger Britons believe that they don’t like mince pies. It’s a claim that I always counter annoyingly with: “No, you just haven’t had a good one”, before forcing a homemade version, all crumbly, buttery pastry and plump currants, in their faces. To be fair to them, though, mince pies are baked so firmly into our festive tradition that some retailers seem to take sales for granted, and concentrate on price and shelf life rather than quality. (Which isn’t to say I won’t force down a fair few over the festive season.)The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That, at least, is the only excuse for the pappy pastry and unpleasantly sour gloopy filling that has marred so many Christmases past for me, but I come into this taste test determined to see the positives, mostly because I don’t want my fellow taster, the deliciously upbeatprofessional baker Benjamina Ebuehi, to think I’m a grinch.We agree, as we survey the field, that we’re looking for crisp, golden pastry and a genuinely fruity filling, and that we’ll try to give any innovations a fair hearing. I think I’m more fixated on booze than Benjamina, and she’s fussier about the aesthetics, as befits a stylist, but we feel like quite a balanced pairing as we take deep breaths and dive in.Felicity CloakeThe best supermarket mince piesBest overall/best bargain:Mr Kipling Signature all butter mince piesView image in fullscreen97p for two at Asda (49p each)BenjaminaEbuehiMuch wider and more shallow than you’d expect, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. After all, any deeper and it might be too much. The pastry looks well baked, with one of the most appealing colours of all the test group. Overall, it’s quite enjoyable, with perhaps just a bit too much apple for me.★★★★☆Felicity CloakeAttractive, with a nice colour, even on the base. The pastry’s not bad, either: crisp, if not very flavourful. The filling has a pleasant citrussy note (marmalade?) without any unpleasant acidity and a gently boozy note. I like the chunky texture and the chewy peel. Good ratio of pastry to filling, too.★★★★☆And the rest …Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference all butter mince piesView image in fullscreen£3.50 for six at Sainsbury’s (58p each)BEVery pretty to look at, but they’d be even better with a darker top. There is a pronounced buttery flavour, but I can’t help but think it tastes a bit artificial. The texture of the filling isn’t my favourite, either – it’s a bit pasty. ★★★☆☆FCQuite pale on top, and the pastry has some crunch around the edges, but there’s an artificial butter flavour that’s almost ghee-like. Only half-filled with a lot of jam and not much in the way of plump whole fruit, but the flavour isn’t too bad: quite boozy and peppery with an orangey backnote. ★★★☆☆Morrisons the Best Signature Collection mince piesView image in fullscreen£2 for two at Morrisons (£1 each)BEThese are so deep! Maybe too deep. And quite full on. I’m not a fan of a sugar dusting on top, a feature of lots of the other pies, too. Tastes as if it could be mixed with cornflour, perhaps. The pastry has a good colour on the bottom, and I like the thickness. The filling is a bit on the gloopy side, which lets it down a little. This would work really well as a dessert, served warm with custard, rather than straight out of the packet.★★★☆☆FCArrestingly, troublingly large – this could go either way, couldn’t it? Nice colour, quite homemade-looking, with very thick pastry, which, with a big Bertha like this, I suppose you’d have to have for reasons of structural integrity. The pastry’s a bit salty, which is good; and buttery, but in an oddly artificial-tasting way. The filling is very jellied – more jelly than fruit – with an emphatically clove-y, almost mentholated top note. Not bad, but you could feed a family of four on one of these. Surely there’s no way anyone could eat a whole one?★★★☆☆M&S Collection all butter mince piesView image in fullscreen£4 for six at Ocado (67p each)BEThese are very pretty to look at, and I love the colour on them, but they’re the smallest of the lot. You get some brandy flavour coming through nicely, too, and they’re well filled, but I’d like just a bit more of those spices coming through. ★★★☆☆FCVery pallid, but a nice bake on the bottom. The pastry has a crisp outer, but it’s very sweet with a slightly bicarby fizziness. Half-filled in the centre, though the filling gets points for having discernible solid fruit and not being too wet; I like the spice, too, but it’s very acidic and sweet. Not the worst. ★★☆☆☆Tesco Finest all butter mince piesView image in fullscreen£3 for six at Tesco (50p each)BEThe pastry stands out for being very thin on the base, but tastes really floury and underbaked. These are a bit forgettable. I’d eat one if offered, but wouldn’t buy them. ★★☆☆☆FCI like the little snowy top, but the base pastry is a bit soggy and it’s very soft, albeit with a decent buttery flavour. The mincemeat has a good texture, with lots of whole fruit and some mixed peel, and the flavour isn’t bad, but it is so citrussy that it’s a bit like the end of an orange Calippo. I can see the spice, but the flavour is quite subtle. Inoffensive. ★★★☆☆skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The filling is very jammy and acidic, albeit with a few whole chunks of fruit – I can see spice, but can’t really taste it, and the citric acid is troubling the back of my throat. Could do with a sweet sherry to wash it down. ★★☆☆☆Asda Exceptional luxury mince piesView image in fullscreen£1.42 for six at Asda (24p each)BEThe least attractive of them all. Normally, when the filling bubbles up through the sides, it adds some rustic charm, but this is the opposite. It looks the most underbaked, too. The citrus in the filling comes through strongly, and the chunkiness of the raisins and dried fruit is appreciated. ★☆☆☆☆FCSomeone got hit with the ugly stick: these look like something someone’s toddler brought home from nursery, and are overflowing with brown gloop. Nice, chunky fruit with discernible pieces of peel, which I like, but that Valencian orange oil is doing some hard work – it tastes like an orange fruit pastille – and I don’t get much spice. ★★★☆☆Co-op Irresistible all butter mince piesView image in fullscreen£3.25 for six at Co-op (54p each)BEThere’s an odd, dusty texture to the pastry, and it’s drying my mouth out quite a bit. The filling isn’t as citric acid-heavy as some of the others, but it leans a bit too sweet for me. ★★☆☆☆FCVery pallid pastry that tastes overwhelmingly floury, like eating raw offcuts when you’re too lazy to chuck them in the bin. Nice big pieces of fruit, and a boozy top note (brandy, rather than rum, sadly), which slightly counteracts the acidity of the fruit. ★★★☆☆Aldi Specially Selected mince piesView image in fullscreen£1.49 for six at Aldi (25p each), in store onlyBEThese are chunky! And so weighty, I’m a bit worried. The pastry is very thick, which I often don’t mind, but here it’s so sandy and floury that it tastes very underbaked. I do like the crunch from the demerara sugar on top, though. One point for that. The filling isn’t spiced very much and is heavy on the citric acid. ★☆☆☆☆FCQuite chunky and rustic-looking, with a nice, solid, biscuity base, but the pastry itself has a strange raw flavour and raw flour texture. The mincemeat is overwhelmingly sharp and very gloopy – I think I can taste alcohol, but not much else – while the texture is just grape skins and biscuit. Like a malevolent festive Jammie Dodger. ★☆☆☆☆Lidl Deluxe all butter mince piesView image in fullscreen£1.49 for six (25p each), in store onlyBEThese look like your classic supermarket mince pies, and the base has a nice golden colour. But there’s an overwhelmingly artificial taste to it all. The filling is more of a thick paste than chunky and fruity. Not good at all. ☆☆☆☆☆FCNice colour, and I like the slightly rococo pastry top – like a Jammie Dodger (but, visually at least, not a malevolent one). Again, the base has colour, but the pastry is disappointingly soft given that colour, with a floury texture and a slightly stale, cardboardy flavour. The filling has a good chunky consistency, but a citrussy tang that borders on the aggressive, which goes right the way through the fruit. Decent peppery spicing – is it allspice? ★★☆☆☆Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkThe FilterFoodChristmasSnacksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For those who remember theManchesternightclub Sankeys in its heyday 30 years ago, the venue was a clubbing mecca.“Sweat was dripping off the walls,” said Lee Spence, a promoter and resident DJ at the club from 2002 to 2012, who remembers once double booking Chase & Status and Carl Cox on the same night. “It was an atmosphere like nothing else I’d really seen.”It closed in 2017 but now, against atide of closing venues, Sankeys is back. And like when it first opened more than three decades ago, there will be no phones on the dancefloor.David Vincent, one of the nightclub’s founders, who is behind its resurrection, said venues needed to return to a more “intimate” experience in the club rather than the selfie frenzies that saturate social media.“The phones are the problem,” he said. “People are more bothered about having a phone and filming the DJ rather than dancing.”The aim in particular is to tackle incessant filming on the dancefloor. “We’re probably going to put a sticker on their camera so they can’t film. People need to stop taking pictures and start dancing to the beat,” Vincent said.View image in fullscreenSankeys first opened in 1994, in the basement of the Beehive Mill, a former soap factory that was sold to property developers in 2017.Photograph: fotofacade.com/AlamySankeys will reopen in late January in a 500-capacity venue in Manchester city centre. By reputation alone, it should enjoy a busy start despite clubbers perhaps still nursing their festive hangovers.But the challenge for the venue is stark:nearly 800late-night venues in the UK have closed during the past five years, according to the most recent data from the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA). It reported a 26.4% drop in late-night venues since March 2020.Michael Kill, the NTIA chief executive, said the reopening of Sankeys was “more than just a venue returning”. “It signals [Manchester’s] commitment to nurturing spaces that are central to the cultural heartbeat of nightlife,” he said, adding that it showed there was still “strong demand for shared, immersive experiences that only physical spaces can provide”.The no-phones policy follows similar moves by other venues across Britain including Amber’s in Manchester and FOLD in east London. Kill said he had seen more and more clubs banning cameras from the dancefloor in an effort to “reflect the essence of the live experience”.He said: “By encouraging guests to be present and fully engage with music and community, these policies aim to recapture some of the spontaneity and social connection that can be diluted in a digital-first world.”Spence said it would be impossible to replicate “the exact version that we had before” but he embraced the opportunity of a new place for hedonists of tomorrow. “The world’s changed. It’s a different venue but I do think that something new could be created.”View image in fullscreenSankeys debuted artists such as Daft Punk and the club’s founder hopes the reopening will create new future stars.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianSankeys first opened in 1994 as Sankeys Soap in the basement of the Beehive Mill, a former soap factory in the industrial area of Ancoats. It is widely considered to have been the successor to the Haçienda club. In 2010, DJ Mag rated it the best club in the world, and it debuted artists such as Daft Punk, the Chemical Brothers and David Guetta. The venue was sold to property developers.With the reopening, Vincent hopes that spotlighting new DJs will draw in a new, younger crowd. One of the consequences of the UK’s declining nightclub industry is the absence of platforms for undiscovered and up-and-coming artists.“What we will be doing is booking a lot of young fresh talent,” he said. “Back in the day, when the Chemical Brothers or Daft Punk played, they became stars. Hopefully we’ll be doing that again with some new future stars.”Davina Vernizeau, a regular raver at Sankeys when she was a university student in the early 00s, said: “It wasn’t just about the music for me. It felt like finding a set of like-minded people where we all belonged, we were all united and met there in the same place every week.”Explore more on these topicsClubbingClub cultureDance musicManchesterNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Andrew Flintoff consoling Brett Lee; Shane Warne’s balcony dance; the sprinkler; Ian Botham celebrating a miracle win at Headingley, Ben Stokes doing the same; and all the way back to the Oval pitch invasion in 1926.Maybe this year’s has been taken, with England’s campaign in danger of being summed up by the footage of Jofra Archer arriving here on Saturday clutching a pillow. The day Archer imagined and the one Australia subjected England toturned out to be very different.Sun setting on England’s Ashes dream as Australia close on second Test triumphRead moreWith the home side six down overnight, the notoriously chilled bowler presumably thought he would help his side swiftly steamroller the lower order and spend the rest of the day being laid back, while his teammates assembled a match-winning lead.Four hours after the start he was still fielding – working in the covers, if you like, rather than lying under them – while Australia’s tail made the pitch look like a featherbed and this was becoming less day-nighter than daytime nightmare.Archer does not help himself sometimes, but the main issue with the image was not what it said about the 30-year-old pace bowler. It was that it would inevitably be interpreted as emblematic of the attitude of a touring side that is already perceived to have taken a laid-back approach to their pre-series preparations and to the extended period between the humiliatinglypremature conclusion of the first Testand the start of this one.Their fielding on Friday’s second day here, whenfive catches went down, was a bit sleepy. All of this means they are not seen as being particularly keen on hard work, certainly not in the way they are keen on their own company or golf.They insist that they have an established and proven method for tuning up for away series – Perth was the first time they had lost the opening Test of one since Brendon McCullum’s appointment as coach in 2022 – and that they have trained long and hard in all conditions and for all eventualities. Bringing your own bedding to work rather undermines this message.View image in fullscreenJofra Archer appeals unsuccessfully for the wicket of Scott Boland.Photograph: Robert Cianflone/Getty ImagesThree months ago McCullum described this challenge, one of the most difficult in British sport and the focus of furious planning for years, as the“biggest series of all of our lives”. Now their players are pondering how best to sleep through it.What followed made it look as if Australia had perceived Archer’s definition of essential kit for a day of Ashes cricket as something of a slight and decided that they – and certainly he – were not going to take it lying down. Archer does not need to invite questions about his work ethic – there have been enough of those over the years, most of them entirely without merit. Having done so, what followed was just a little awkward.For a start, the day began with Stokes deciding to give him a rest. England were toiling with a ball that was 73 overs old, leaving them seven to get through before they could get their hands on a fresh one, which the captain intended to deliver to a fully refreshed Archer.

With Mitchell Starc and Scott Boland surviving 165 of their finest deliveries while adding a hugely damaging and frustrating 75 for the ninth wicket, a partnership of slow savagery. There were good deliveries, edges that fell short, others that flashed just past the stumps, balls that just cleared them, but it was pure toil. No bowler managed to make the ball sing, though one imagines it might have groaned a few times.This Australia side was supposed to be fallible, feeble even, ageing and injury-ravaged. But in key moments, as Starc and Boland demonstrated, they simply refuse to yield. England will not want to be remembered as relative featherweights, but the time for them to stand up is slipping away. Like the fowl whose down potentially packed that pillow, they’re looking increasingly plucked.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Jofra ArcherAustralia cricket teamEngland cricket teamCricketAustralia sportThe AshesanalysisShareReuse this content"

It seems almost incredible now that this was a club that won the league with a series of cold-eyed 2-0 victories. They led 2-0 here, and were 3-2 up four minutes into injury time, yet still couldn’t manage a win.Mohamed Salah says ‘I’ve been thrown under the bus’ and signals Liverpool exitRead moreAnd a difficult night was not finished there. Soon after the final whistle, Mohamed Salahaccused the club of throwing him “under the bus”after he was left out of the starting lineup for the third game running, saying he has been made a scapegoat for the poor start to the season and casting severe doubt on his future at the club.Liverpool have now won just two of their last 10 league games and that they remain within a point of Champions League qualification is the result in part of the string of unlikely late winners with which they began the season, and in part of the crowded middle of the table; two points separate fifth from twelfth.They won their last away game by that familiar 2-0 scoreline, but nobody can be sure whether a win at West Ham means the victors have played well or have just been playing West Ham. This was a mishmash of haplessness and excellence. Their three goals all stemmed from fine finishes and one from clever buildup play, but the image of the game – once again – was Virgil van Dijk standing, hands on hips, steam rising literally and metaphorically as he glared in disbelief at the bizarrely diffident defending around him.Arne Slot insisted he is starting to see signs of progress. His side had seemed in control, only for a needless sliding challenge from Ibrahima Konaté to concede a penalty that offered Leeds a way back into the game.“Unfortunately for him,” Slot said of Konaté, “he does a lot of things well but he has been a bit too much on the crime scene. He has been involved in goals we have conceded. If you are a centre-back that happens in football. Today it was a tackle that came from effort, he tried to block the cross, the ball went out and then there was contact. The question is of whether VAR should intervene …” The replay actually seemed to show Konaté catching Willy Gnonto just before the ball went out of play.“It is not for the first time I see us doing many things well without combining the result with the performance,” Slot continued. “I can take a lot of positives. But it’s not even a dangerous chance that leads to the penalty. And then in nine minutes of extra time we conceded a set piece.”Sometimes the opening minutes of a half can give a false impression.As Leeds had three shots in the opening five minutes, it seemed they might be about to carry on the form that enabled them to rattle Manchester City in the second half oftheir defeat at the Etihad Stadiuma week ago beforebeating Chelsea on Wednesday. Here was the next stage of football’s 1980s revival: a front two. Here was another example of modern centre-backs struggling to deal with old-fashioned ideas such as both of them having to mark without the contingency of one of them covering.But it did not work out like that. Other than Curtis Jones whipping a shot against the bar, very little happened for the rest of the first half, which felt like an achievement from a Liverpool point of view.The opening to the second half proved just as illusory, as Liverpool swept into a 2-0 lead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That meant a first league start in almost a month for Hugo Ekitiké and he responded with two goals. Leeds played their part in both. Ekitiké’s first was the result of a sloppy square ball from Joe Rodon while his second, which came while the video assistant referee was checking whether his heel had been clipped in the box, came after Conor Bradley had nipped in front of Gabriel Gudmundsson to keep the ball in play.Last season, that might have been that, but for Liverpool at the moment nothing can ever be straightforward. Konaté slid to block Gnonto when he might have shepherded him to the goalline, and caught his knee. Dominic Calvert-Lewin converted the penalty for his third goal in his last three starts. Gnonto had been part of a triple substitution eight minutes earlier.Two minutes later, with Elland Road raucously energised, another sub, Brenden Aaronson, after combining with Gnonto, slipped a neat ball inside for Anton Stach, who slammed in the equaliser.Quick GuideKey statsShow• Ao Tanaka’s equaliser for Leeds was the third result-altering goal Liverpool have conceded in the 90th minute or later of a Premier League game this season (also winners for Crystal Palace and Chelsea),their joint mostin a single campaign in the competition, along with 2010-11.• Only Nottingham Forest (11) have conceded more goals from set pieces in the Premier League this season (excluding penalties) than Liverpool (10).

Lucas Perri made a stunning save from a Van Dijk header before, with 10 minutes remaining, Alexis Mac Allister stepped over Cody Gakpo’s through ball to release Dominik Szoboszlai, who finished calmly.It looked as if, for the second time in a week, Leeds had pulled back a two-goal deficit only to lose. But there was one last twist to come, as a left-wing corner fell for yet another substitute, Ao Tanaka. He had scored against Chelsea and he scored again: 3-3. Elland Road writhed in ecstasy and Leeds rose to 16th, three points above the relegation zone, having emerged from a week in which they played three of last season’s top four with four points and a lot of credit.Did it mean anything?

And then mayhem unfolded inside the Arsenal 18-yard box and, subsequently, in the Villa Park stands, the 128-year foundations put to the test as Emiliano Buendía, enveloped by the rubble of splayed defenders and with virtually the last kick of the game, exhibited unthinkable composure to curl a first-time shot into the corner and seemingly blow thePremier Leaguetitle race wide open.Not for the first time,Aston Villahad been the architects of Arsenal’s downfall, though few envisioned a climax quite like this. David Raya blocked Youri Tielemans’s side-foot effort from inside the six-yard box and then Buendía saw his initial effort halted by a combination of Martín Zubimendi and Jurriën Timber before seizing on the loose ball. Buendía slipped as he shifted possession to Boubacar Kamara and Arsenal smelled danger, Ben White and Timber flinging themselves towards the ball.Tottenham v Brentford, Manchester City v Sunderland, and more: football – liveRead moreA mini-ruck ensued before an off-balance Kamara raked the ball clean from the wreckage and towards Buendía, now back on his feet, to do the rest, his goal inflicting a first defeat onArsenalsince August.Four Arsenal players, plus Raya, were either on all-fours or on the ground as Buendía charged towards the dugouts in celebration. Emiliano Martínez joined the throbbing Villa huddle on halfway, where the match-winner was mobbed by Pau Torres and Ollie Watkins, among those to surge on to the pitch wearing substitute jackets after being withdrawn in the game. Buendía beat his chest, Ian Maatsen jumped on to Ezri Konsa for a piggyback. For Villa, wild abandon, this a ninth win in 10 league matches and a 13th in 15 across all competitions. For Arsenal, despair, Zubimendi dragging his shirt over his face as he and his teammates trudged towards halfway.View image in fullscreenEmi Buendía scores the winning goal with the last kick of the game.Photograph: Paul Currie/ShutterstockMikel Arteta had acknowledged the hazards that awaited his side here. Villa inflicted irrecoverable damage on his side in January, Unai Emery’s team rallying from two goals downto earn a point at the Emirates Stadium, a result that left Arsenal lagging behind Liverpool and with too much ground to make up in the title race.Two seasons ago, Villa did the double over Arsenal,two late goals earning an away victoryin the final weeks of the season that paved the way for Manchester City to pip Arteta’s side to the crown. It was, of course, Emery whom Arteta succeeded six years ago, tasked with the ultimate aim of reclaiming a title that has eluded them since 2003-04.Surely Villa, who failed to win any of their first six matches this season, are now in that race? They sit third in the table following Manchester City’s 3-0 defeat of Sunderland later on Saturday. Judging by the way this place went berserk after Buendía hauled himself off the canvas to locate the top corner suggests so. “They are when you look where they are,” Arteta said. “They have beaten some big teams at home. They are where they are and we are there too.” Villa overcame City here at the end of October and since then their only hiccup was defeat at Anfield against Liverpool.View image in fullscreenAston Villa’s Matty Cash fires home the opening goal of the game against Arsenal.Photograph: Dave Shopland/APVilla seized a first-half lead through an increasingly reliable source: Matty Cash. Eight minutes after Declan Rice played firefighter, racing across the box to block Cash’s vicious goal-bound shot, the Villa right-back throttled another effort through the legs of Raya. Timber, who partnered Piero Hincapié at centre-back, inadvertently flicked Pau Torres’s cross towards Cash. Eberechi Eze winced as Cash whizzed past him to add to his tally of important goals this season. Eze registered just 13 first-half touches and was replaced at the interval. Every outfield Villa player followed Cash to the corner flag, where he performed his golf-swing celebration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trossard made an immediate impact, whistling a 50th-minute volley narrowly wide of Martínez’s left post after arriving unmarked to meet Martin Ødegaard’s chipped cross. A couple of minutes later, Trossard sparked bedlam in the away end. Rice overpowered Amadou Onana on halfway and Ødegaard freed an overlapping Bukayo Saka. Saka’s ball across the box brushed Martínez’s right glove and Trossard was on hand to feast on the leftovers, lashing home inside the six-yard box.Arsenal were in the ascendancy after levelling but Villa stirred after Martínez got fingertips to a dipping Ødegaard effort. The substitute Donyell Malen, also formerly of Arsenal, flashed a shot wide. But the finale was boxed off for Buendía to score with almost the last kick.“We are disappointed about how we lost the game,” Arteta said. “First of all, congratulations to Villa because they are a very good side and they are very good at what they do. I thought we were going to win the game. We had two chances to score [again]. The result could have been different but the reality is that it is not.

I’m going to defend. If I need to attack, I’ll attack because what can happen? You’re either second or third or you win. That would be fantastic.”Norris still holds the advantage at Yas Marina. Leading the championship, he is 12 points in front of Verstappen and 16 clear of Piastri. Norris will claim his debut F1 title and become the 11th British driver to do so if he finishes in front of both his rivals or claims third place or better. Verstappen would need to win and hope Norris finishes outside the podium places while Piastri would need to win and have the Briton finish sixth or lower.Still, the pressure weighs heavy on Norris. Any contact, damage or errors from the three leaders could change the complexion of the title race in the blink of an eye. Verstappen has repeatedly stated he has nothing to lose, having not even expected to be in the title fight given how far off the pace his car was for more than half the season. So as they hurtle through those opening corners, Norris may be forgiven for staying well out of trouble. He was betraying no signs of nerves, however.View image in fullscreenLando Norris (left) with pole sitter Red Bull driver Max Verstappen. The McLaren driver still holds the advantage as they enter the final race.Photograph: David Davies/PA“I’m not too bothered to be the hunter or the hunted,” he said. “Normally, to be hunted is fine because you’re the one with the advantage in the first place. That’s good. And, of course, I would sign for that now. I’m still going to go into tomorrow and plan for how we can win the race, whether it’s on pace or strategy or whatever it may be.”Norris knows his destiny in his own hands and will leave nothing to chance. But with Verstappen out front, staying out of trouble – even if the Dutchman disappears into the middle distance – will be enough.McLarenhave confirmed they will employ team orders if required to ensure one of their drivers seals the title.The session under the lights was as fascinating as any of the 23 that preceded it this season and it was quickly clear Verstappen had found his touch at the perfect moment. He opened the first runs in Q3, leading the times with two huge opening sectors and with a mighty lap and a tow from his teammate Yuki Tsunoda, he was quickest in 1min 22.295sec.Norris followed on scrubbed tyres but was four-tenths back, with Piastri three-tenths back from the Dutchman.The final runs as the track reached its grippiest were tense. The McLarens had new rubber, while once more Tsunoda gave Verstappen a tow. Piastri was the first of the McLarens and had a good first two sectors as did Norris as they looked to the third to make up the time. However, Verstappen too was improving, and he went even quicker at 1:22.207. Norris claimed second two-tenths down and Piastri third three-hundredths back from his teammate.Bringing the final qualifying session of the season to close with pole emphasised how extraordinary Verstappen’s resurgence in the final third has been. He has five wins in the last eight races and with his eighth pole, one more than any other driver, has been the most successful over the single lap.By contrast,Lewis Hamiltoncrashed out in third practice after an element of the car broke, causing him to lose the rear and spin off nose-first into the barriers at turn nine. “Something buckled at the front and snapped the rear,” he told the team.Ferrari did repair the car for qualifying but the British driver could manage only 16th place, out in Q1 again after he made a small error in the final sector. “Every time, mate, I’m so sorry,” he said to his race engineer.Another afternoon of toil now awaits him to see out what has been his worst season in F1. He is in sixth place in the championship and has yet to take a podium across the season for the first time in his career. “I don’t have the words to describe the feeling inside,” he said. “[There is an] unbearable amount of anger and rage and, yeah, there’s not really much I can say about it.”Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Formula OneLando NorrisOscar PiastriMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

Not since 2012 has a Cup of Nations been held in the venue and at the time originally planned: 2013 was switched from Libya to South Africa because of the civil war; 2015 was moved to Equatorial Guinea when Morocco withdrew from hosting over Ebola fears; 2017 was moved to Gabon because of the turmoil in Libya; 2019 was moved from Cameroon to Egypt because of construction delays; 2021 was played in Cameroon, but not until 2022 because of Covid; and 2023 was initially scheduled for Côte d’Ivoire in June/July only to be shunted back to January/February when somebody at CAF belatedly looked at the weather charts and accepted trying to play a tournament in the west African rainy season was nonsensical.However absurd the idea of playing tournaments regularly in the European summer – is the plan really never to play the tournament in west Africa again? – that remains official policy. The 2025 Cup of Nations was initially set for Morocco in June and July. But then Gianni Infantino invented his extended Club World Cup andAfrica was forced to push back its tournament to start on 21 December.For somebody who said before the last World Cupthat he feels African, Infantino has an odd way of showing it. Fifa’s president still plays the old anti-colonial tune so beloved of João Havelange to rally his support base in Africa, but has seemed just as unconcerned by the lack of a slot for the continent’s tournament as he was by thedeaths of thousands of migrant workers in Qatar.View image in fullscreenThe Côte d’Ivoire president, Alassane Ouattara, lifts the Africa Cup of Nations trophy in 2024.Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty ImagesHis proposed $100m 20-team African super league, a dubious plan given how it would have trampled over traditional rivalries and pre-existing competitions, ended up as a one-off, eight-team tournament in 2023 (it has never officially been abandoned, but there are no references to it on the Caf website).Fifa usually insists clubs release players 14 days before a tournament, but for this Cup of Nations that has been reduced to six, with clubs encouraged to find individual solutions if that doesn’t suit them. The disdain for Africa is palpable.Patrice Motsepe, the South African president of Caf and a key Infantino ally, did attend Friday’s World Cup draw despite DonaldTrump’s attempts to excludeSouth Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, from next year’s G20 summit.Trump, who played a major part at the draw, boycotted a G20 leaders’ summit in Johannesburg in November, claiming South Africa’swhite minority population are persecuted.With the June/July slot closed to Africa, it was suggested the tournament should return to the opening it had occupied in January/February. But that posed its own problems. Between 1996 and 2012, the Cup of Nations was held in the January/February of even numbered years. Why every two years? Because when the Cup of Nations began in 1957, Africa was 13 years from having a guaranteed place at the World Cup and it was the only way to ensure regular competitive football.View image in fullscreenThe Caf president, Patrice Motsepe (left), is a key ally of his Fifa counterpart, Gianni Infantino.Photograph: Issouf Sanogo/AFP/Getty ImagesWith only five sides qualifying for the World Cup until the latest expansion, the Cup of Nations was still the best way of generating revenue for the other 50 Caf members. If Europe objects to that, when so many Africans play for European clubs, it needs to find some other way to fund the continent’s football.There was a sense that in World Cup years it was overshadowed by the global tournament. In addition, Fifa regulations oblige clubs to release players for only one international tournament per year. In a World Cup year, European clubs would be within their rights to refuse to let players go to the Cup of Nations, with the seep of the expanded Champions League into January increasing their reluctance to release them.The compromise is this December/January competition, which can be classed as a 2025 tournament to prevent clubs refusing to release players, while also falling in the winter break of most European leagues. Which is why, with only onePremier Leaguefixture, you can fill your Boxing Day watching Zambia v Comoros, Egypt v South Africa, Morocco v Mali and Angola v Zimbabwe.Africa Cup of Nations has been clobbered by Fifa’s unwanted Club World Cup | Jonathan WilsonRead morePremier League clubs will be affected, although Arsenal and Chelsea will not have any representatives at the Cup of Nations. Sunderland could be without as many as seven players, the most significant the indefatigable Democratic Republic of the Congo midfielder Noah Sadiki and the Mozambique left-back Reinildo, particularly as his back-up, Arthur Masuaku, will be with the DRC. Dennis Cirkin’s return to training has come at just the right time.The loss of Mohamed Salahlooks less significant for Liverpool than in previous years, while his Egypt teammate Omar Marmoush has started two league games for Manchester City this season. Manchester United’s attacking thrust will be affected as Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo join up with Côte d’Ivoire and Cameroon respectively, West Ham will have to give up both wingbacks in the DRC’s Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Senegal’s El Hadji Malick Diouf .The creativity of Diouf’s compatriots Iliman Ndiaye and Ismaïla Sarr will be missed by Everton and Crystal Palace, and the Nigerian Alex Iwobi’s calm passing by Fulham. The failure of Ghana and the Gambia to qualify, though, means Mohammed Kudus, Antoine Semenyo and Yankuba Minteh will all still be available for Tottenham, Bournemouth and Brighton respectively.But this isn’t a story about the Premier League. It’s a story about African football and how, for all Infantino’s rhetoric, it has been shunted to the margins, about how, as greed expands the fixture list, it has had to scrabble to find a nook into which it can almost apologetically squeeze in its flagship tournament.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Inside footballAfrica Cup of NationsPremier LeagueFifaFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The blockbuster antitrust trial, explainedThe basketball legend says Nascar gives teams too little power with too much risk. His lawsuit could force historic changes to how one of America’s biggest sports is runBryan Armen GrahamSat 6 Dec 2025 08.15 ESTLast modified on Sat 6 Dec 2025 08.21 ESTShareMichael Jordantook the stand on Fridayin his landmark antitrust fight against Nascar, a case that could reshape how one of America’s biggest sports is run. Jordan’s team, 23XI Racing, and Front Row Motorsports say Nascar holds so much control over everything, from the tracks to the money to the rulebook, that teams have no real bargaining power. Nascar denies that and says the lawsuit threatens to blow up a system that has held the sport together for decades.The case has already pulled blunt internal messages into public view and laid bare long-running frustrations between teams andNascarleadership. Denny Hamlin, Jordan’s co-owner, has said the trial will finally “hear the truth” about how the series “really operates”.So what is this case actually about? Here’s the simplified version …What’s going on?Michael Jordan – yes,thatMichael Jordan– co-owns 23XI Racing with three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin. Together they’ve built one of Nascar’s strongest young teams. But Jordan says the business model underpinning America’s top motorsport is fundamentally imbalanced.Jordan says Nascar isn’t playing fair with a system that determines who gets guaranteed entry into races, how much money they make and even the tracks where the races are held – a system so central to team survival that it can make or break an entire organization.That system revolves around something called a charter. And that’s where the fight begins.What exactly is a charter?A charter is like a golden ticket that guarantees your team can race each week. Only a limited number exist. Teams bought them years ago for a few million dollars and their value skyrocketed into to the tens of millions because they essentially secure your place in the sport. The most recent sale went for about $45m (£33.7m).But here’s the catch: the chartersexpireand can be renewed only on Nascar’s terms. It’s like if you bought an ice-cream truck permit in 2016 for $5, and in 2025 the city tells you: “Oh, by the way, your permit expires now. Renew it on our terms or else.”Jordan does not love that.Fifteen teams were offered new multi-year charter agreements in 2024, after more than two years of tense negotiations. Thirteen eventually signed. Jordan’s 23XI Racing and Bob Jenkins’ Front Row Motorsports did not, arguing the terms fell far short of what teams needed for financial stability and long-term growth.Both teams competed in 2024 as “open” entries – permitted under Nascar rules but without guaranteed purse payouts – which they say cost them millions.What is Jordan’s beef?Jordan’s basic complaint is that teams are being asked to spend huge sums of money without getting anything solid in return. He says he’s personally invested $40m (£29.9m) into 23XI Racing, but Nascar still controls whether his team has a guaranteed spot on the grid from year to year.In Jordan’s view, that means he doesn’t really own his place in the sport. Nascar does.It’s like buying a house and then having the landlord show up to say: “Actually, this is still mine. You’ll need to re-apply every few years if you want to keep living here.”Teams want charters to function the way franchise rights do in the NBA or NFL: permanent, transferable and worth whatever the open market will pay. Right now, they say Nascar can change the rules whenever it wants, which makes their investment feel shaky and unsafe.What is Nascar’s defense?Nascar, founded 76 years ago by the France family, insists it has violated no antitrust laws and says its charter negotiations reflected standard commercial practice.The series argues the 2025 agreement actually increased payouts to teams and that the ability for cars to compete as open entries shows the system is not anti-competitive. Nascar also points to extensive support from other team owners, including declarations from Rick Hendrick and Roger Penske, who do not want the charter model dismantled.Pretrial filings also revealed Nascar earned more than $100m in 2024, a figure the suing teams argue underscores the imbalance in bargaining power.View image in fullscreenMichael Jordan looks on during last year’s Nascar Cup Series FireKeepers Casino 400 at Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn, Michigan.Photograph: Logan Riely/Getty ImagesWhy was the discovery process so explosive?Because the lawsuit opened the door for lawyers to seize emails, texts and internal messages from both sides, many of which were never meant to be public.Among the disclosures:Nascar executives called Hall of Fame owner Richard Childress a “dinosaur”, an “idiot”, and a “stupid redneck”, with one saying he should be “taken out back and flogged”Another executive claimed Nascar fans “can’t read”Leaders discussed trying to “kill” Tony Stewart’s SRX short-track series because Cup drivers were participatingA 23XI president joked that Nascar chairman Jim France “had to die” before teams would get better charter termsHamlin said he disliked the France familyOne Jordan adviser wrote that Hamlin was not a good businessmanJordan himself joked he loses more money in a casino than he pays one of his driversThe revelations have deepened mistrust between Nascar and several high-profile figures in the garage.Who is appearing in court?Jordan received permission to attend the entire trial – a rarity for a party in a civil case – and is expected to be the most visible presence for the plaintiffs. On Friday, he took the stand and described a lifelong love of racing and a desire for a fairer partnership with Nascar. He insisted he doesn’t want to destroy the sport, but said the lawsuit is “for every person in Nascar … that isn’t being treated fairly”.Hamlin has testified that teams are being squeezed by rising costs and a charter system that leaves “only one side going out of business”. He acknowledged 23XI has turned profits but said that’s only possible because Jordan can attract sponsors, arguing the model isn’t sustainable for most teams.Front Row Motorsports owner Bob Jenkins detailed more than $60m in cumulative losses and sharp cost increases under the Next Gen car, while Nascar president Steve O’Donnell defended the series’ record, noting nine-figure profits but also losses on high-profile events in Chicago, Los Angeles and Mexico City that he framed as investments in growth.Joe Gibbs Racing co-owner Heather Gibbs told the jury she felt forced to sign the 2025–31 charter deal under a last-minute deadline, saying it was like having “a gun to your head” when hundreds of jobs and her late husband’s legacy were on the line.How big are the potential consequences?Massive. If Jordan and Front Row win, the jury will decide monetary damages. US district judge Kenneth Bell can adjust the amount, including tripling it under antitrust law. More dramatically, if a monopoly is found, the court could order structural remedies.Those could include:forcing the France family to sell Nascar or the tracks it ownsmandating permanent chartersrestructuring or even dismantling the current charter systemrewriting elements of Nascar’s governanceIf Nascar prevails, 23XI and Front Row may struggle to continue operating beyond 2026. The six unassigned charters held aside for the next agreement would likely be sold, with private equity firms among prospective buyers.What happens next?The trial is expected to run for another week in the Western District of North Carolina. A settlement remains possible at any time, including after a jury verdict, and either side could appeal.Whatever the outcome, the case has cracked open long-simmering resentments inside the sport and raised existential questions about its future. Jordan’s presence alone underscores how high the stakes have become and how far the fight over Nascar’s economic model now extends.Explore more on these topicsMichael JordanNascarMotor sportexplainersShareReuse this content"

It seemed like a long shot to me, I wasn’t in anyone’s club, but my supporters were insistent. I agreed to let my name go into the mix.It was a surprise then when the chair of the selection committee called a few weeks later and said with an apologetic tone: “Sorry Julianne, it’s just not your turn.”I felt as though I’d stepped back into the school yard. Once again it wasn’t my turn to bat, bowl, kick, be the captain or whatever. No reason was needed, skill and knowledge didn’t come into it, there was no trial or audition, a decision had been made.Even then I could see the pattern, it was always less likely to be a girl’s turn.Nancy Pelosi, the first female speaker of the US Congress used the phraseIt’s not your turnlike a motivational mantra in countless speeches. She’s a few decades older than me, and much more ambitious, so no doubt heard it more often than I did. Her response was to keep pushing, to argue that decisions should be made on merit, not favours, gender or age.Reading the reports ofLynelle Briggs’ mates for jobs report that the government released last weekafter a long period of consideration, this memory ofnot-your-turnismcame rushing back.The experience seemed odd at the time. The chosen candidate, whose “turn” it was, was highly respected, well qualified and had gravitas. By some measures he probably also counted as a mate, or possibly even as someone who was owed a favour.What surprised me was the apparent lack of close scrutiny of what the organisation itself actually needed, the lack of deep critical curiosity about the complexity of the issues it was grappling with and how they might be tackled.Scathing ‘jobs for mates’ review finds appointments to government boards routinely abusedRead moreAt some level the conscientious, non-partisan folk making the recommendation worked from a sense of secondhand familiarity with the organisation, buttressed by adherence to basic process.Process and transparency are important, but they are not sufficient.I have since chaired a number of boards and know that there is a human dynamic at play that is not simply defined by ensuring all the boxes in the skills matrix have been ticked. These matrixes ensure there is expertise in law, finance, governance, marketing, ethics, communications, technology and (imagine this) the industry sector itself.The most effective boards are more than the sum of their parts – they have a human dynamic that determines success, shaped by respect, expertise, trust and wisdom. These attributes transcend the skill set and are harder to capture using routine processes.I have sat on boards that have been at war with themselves, and on boards where a generosity of spirit has been transformative. The worst have been those stacked with political appointees, who regarded the organisation as a proxy battleground for other struggles. Yet some of the best board members have been former premiers and ministers who had long left their party allegiance behind.The tension between meritocracy and favours is always present. Mates can also be people who merit appointments. Prior associations, professional relationships and shared work histories can help flesh out selections.We are encouraged to think that it can be automated, that LinkedIn, with its AI-aided tick boxes, can somehow capture the full complexity of a career. But it’s that feeling you get when you look someone in the eye and have a direct conversation about a difficult subject that matters most.When I started working in journalism in the late 1970s there was a mantra beloved by the older men in newsrooms. If you had been to university, worked in journalism and spent some time in Canberra you probably knew everyone or could get to everyone who mattered, they said.It was arrogant and silly but, with a population half what it is now, at a time when about 5% of people were graduates and the old hierarchies of class, ethnicity and gender held strong, it also had a flicker of truth.Australia today is not only bigger but more diverse, smarter, more competitive and bound much more rigidly by process. Process designed to ensure access and transparency is important but not enough.At a time when Australia’s segregated school system works to keep people in their lane, when membership of political parties has plummeted, when the shared spaces of an old mass media, clubs, churches and community organisations have shrunk, it’s arguably harder than ever to ensure that people from different worlds interact so that the talent pool becomes deeper and broader. This is why Briggs’ recommendations matter.If there is a pervasive, not surprising and very human expectation thatturnismprevails then the new meritocracy may look rather like the old world of mates, leaving many talented people wondering what they must do to crack the system.Julianne Schultz is deputy chair of the Sydney writers’ festival boardExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionCorporate governanceBusinesscommentShareReuse this content"

But it’s clear we must think about how our society is impacting human developmentGabor Maté is the author of The Myth of Normal: Trauma, Illness and Healing in a Toxic CultureSat 6 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 6 Dec 2025 06.13 ESTShareDoes the rise in diagnoses of ADHD mean that normal feelings are being “over-pathologised”? The UK’s health secretary, Wes Streeting, seems to suspect so. He is said to be so concerned about a sharp rise in the number of people claiming sickness benefits thathe has ordered a clinical reviewof the diagnosis of mental health conditions, and autism and ADHD.I was diagnosed with ADHD (ADD, as it was then most often called) decades ago, in my early 50s. As I wrote in my book on the subject, Scattered Minds, it “seemed to explain many of my behaviour patterns, thought processes, childish emotional reactions, my workaholism and other addictive tendencies, the sudden eruptions of bad temper and complete irrationality, the conflicts in my marriage and my Jekyll and Hyde ways of relating to my children … It also explained my propensity to bump into doorways, hit my head on shelves, drop objects, and brush close to people before I notice they are there.”There was good reason Scattered Minds was my firstcompletedbook, several others having been abandoned midstream. I could never be organised and persevering enough to finish such a big project until – well into midlife – I came to terms with the puzzlingly erratic functioning of my mind.In retrospect, though, my “seemedto explain” was a telling Freudian slip, for in fact the diagnosis elucidates nothing. A useful description, it fails as an explanation. Consider: “So and so has ADD.” How do we know? “Well, they tend be inattentive, their mind leaps all over the place, they may be hyperactive, and they display poor impulse control.” Why do they exhibit such features? “Because they have ADD.” How do we know they have ADD? “Because they show these patterns.” Oh, how come they manifest these troublesome traits? “Because they have ADD.” And so we go, round and round the spinney, like Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet stalking Woozles and only doubling their own tracks in the snow.Consensus islackingabout almost every aspect of ADHD. While it has become the object of an intellectual free-for-all as to its nature, neurobiology, origins – and, in some circles, even its validity – the diagnosis is burgeoning internationally. Among children in China, for instance, it has beencalled“an increasing public health concern”. In Germany, rates increased almostfourfoldin a little over a decade. In the UK,prescriptions for ADHD medicationshave risen18% each yearsince the pandemic. Similar trends areseenin North America.Whatever the accuracy of such statistics, it is evident that throughout the globalised world more and more children are struggling with attention challenges, emotional instability, learning disabilities and behaviour regulation, to say nothing of the panoply of other diagnoses such as spectrum disorders, anxiety, “oppositionality”, depression or the catch-all phrase, “neurodivergence”.What to make of all this? Among the possibilities are an unwarranted hyperinflation of diagnoses coupled on the other hand with better recognition; or some attributes of contemporary culture that are exerting a noxious influence on many children’s healthy development. I believe both must be factored in – most crucially and most urgently the latter.Many see ADHD as a biological dysfunction of the brain largely rooted in genetics. It is sometimes said to be the “most heritable” mental illness, which in my view is likecalling quartz the most chewable crystal. Despite some earlier reports, since debunked, no gene or group of genes has ever beenidentifiedthat, by themselves, determine inattention or hyperactivity or deficient impulse control.At most they provide a predisposition, but that’s far from a predetermination, for genes are turned on and off by the environment. “Genes affect how sensitive one is to the environment, and environment affects how relevant one’s genetic differences may be,” wrote the renowned geneticist RC Lewontin. “When an environment changes, all bets are off.” Whatever the genetic contribution, we must still ask ourselves what features of modern life may sabotage optimal human development.The key lies in the inextricable and multifaceted unity of social and personal experience, psyche and neurobiology. The brain, neuroscience tells us, is a social organ, its circuitry and biochemistry modulated by how the environment, particularly the emotional milieu, acts on the genetic material. “The interaction of genes and experiences literally shapes the circuitry of the developing brain, and is critically influenced by the mutual responsiveness of adult-child relationships, particularly in the early childhood years.” So reported a major reviewpaperfrom Harvard University’s Center on the Developing Child. As this seminal article pointed out, that interaction begins already prenatally, in the womb.After an ADHD and autism diagnosis, I now find the world more confusing. How do I make sense of this? | Leading questionsRead moreAnd there’s the rub. What is happening to that indispensable parent-child responsiveness under the present-day neoliberal dominion? Given a setting of increasing inequality and economic insecurity; growing isolation; the breakdown of social supports such as the traditional community and extended family; the fraying of the social safety net; proliferating social hostility; and the addictive siren call of digital media – given all this, stress on families and young parents is increasingly intolerable.Stressed parents, despite all the love and devotion they feel and wish to extend to their offspring, are at a disadvantage. Research has demonstrated that when stressed, parents are less patient, more punishing and harsher with their young children. Stress impairs their capacity to be calm, responsive and attuned. As areviewby leading researchers pointed out: “In more stressful environments for parents, children not only experience less protection from environmental stressors but also are more likely to have stress-inducing relationships with caregivers.”When parents are stressed, children are stressed, affecting their brain development and their functioning. And when stressed, children are more likely to “tune out” as a coping mechanism. Intensifying risk to young brains is the documented psychologic and neurotoxic impact of digital media.Where, then, is the solution? Surely it must be rooted in a societal commitment to support pregnant and parturient women; to aid young families; not to blame parents or to stigmatise troubled children, as is too often the case; to treat young humans with full understanding and empathy in all institutions of childcare, from preschool through adolescence; to provide special help to all young ones who, through no fault of their own or of their parents, are discomfited by the traits of ADHD and related conditions. And, not least, in an understanding by health professionals that compassionately helping parents deal with their own emotional stresses and unresolved traumas is essential in securing a nurturing environment for a developing child.Will all that incur financial costs, as some conservativecommentatorsseem to dread? Yes, a pittance compared with the real economic burdens and human suffering imposed by current social conditions that have created an unstable and even hostile context for the raising of the human young.Gabor Maté is an international public speaker and retired physician.

Native Americans with tribal identification cards, US citizens, people doing crucial work from construction to nursing, military veterans, college students, people sleeping in their own beds, small children: all kinds of residents of this country are under attack.“ICE raids are cruel, inhumane, and do nothing to serve public safety,”declaresZohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect. Masked thugs smashing car windows and dragging parents away from their babies, terrorizing whole swathes of the population, and interfering with the ability of schools and businesses to function does the opposite. The rounds of targeted hatred by Trump and his minions – for people from Haiti during the 2024 campaign, for people from Venezuela this spring and summer, and most recently for people from Somalia – rely on defamatory lies and insults, because the facts about these groups don’t support the hate.This terrorizing and demonizing pretends to be in service of recreating a white America that never existed. The US when white supremacists like Trump were young was whiter, but this was never a white country. In 1776, the 13 colonies that became the United States included a significant percentage of Black and Indigenous people (some southern states were a third or more Black). When the US annexed Texas in 1844 and then in 1848 took Mexico’s whole northern half, a Spanish-speaking population was already settled across parts of what’s now the south-west and California. The first African Muslim in what is now the United Statescamein a Spanish expedition almost a century before the Mayflower brought its fanatical Puritans to the shores of Massachusetts in 1620.The persecution of huge numbers of brown people and even the mass deportations will not create the white country of far-right fantasy. Los Angeles, for example is an almost 50% Latino city, and despite the ICE and border patrol outrages, arrests, imprisonments and deportations, it remains so. The city’s very name is Spanish, a reminder of who was here first. All the hatred, all the persecution, seems like the panic of racists pretending they can stop the future of this country no longer being majority white through sheer cruelty.It’s coupled with an attack on reproductive rights that is sometimes openly intended to make white women have more babies (the US has a below-replacement rate birthrate, which is less impactful than in many other countries facing the same decline, because a young, hard-working immigrant workforce keeps things going). Of course, rather than offering the support that might make parenthood less grueling, they are attempting to realize their goals by punitive means. And it’s not working. Margaret Talbot of the New Yorkerwritesthat JD Vance’s reproductive politics – and insults to childless women – amount to pronatalism, which “typically combines concerns about falling birth rates with anti-immigration and anti-feminist ideas”.Likewise, CNNreports: “Reproductive rights groups and other advocacy organizations say these efforts to buttress the birth rate don’t make up for broader administration priorities aimed at cutting federal programs such as Medicaid, its related Children’s Health Insurance Program, and other initiatives that support women and children. The pro-family focus, they say, isn’t just about boosting procreation. Instead, they say, it’s being weaponized to push a conservative agenda that threatens women’s health, reproductive rights, and labor force participation.”The anti-immigration and pronatalist policies add up to fantasies of redirecting the demographic future of this country. Both amount to, in the end, dim-witted bullying by haters inadvertently demonstrating that their claims to superiority have to be based on race and gender, because otherwise they’re incoherent idiots.A lot of the Trump administration’s justifications don’t line up with realities and results. The attacks in the southern Caribbean target small boats not confirmed to be carrying drugs and not capable of reaching the US. Venezuela is not involved in any meaningful way in trafficking fentanyl and much less involved in cocaine trafficking than other South American countries.“We reject the disastrous ‘climate change’ and ‘Net Zero’ ideologies,” says anew White House document. Trump and company are sentimentally committed to fossil fuel, especially coal, and are forcing various US locales to waste money on this outdated and toxic fuel while sabotaging cheaper, cleaner renewable energy. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, is sabotaging public health while promoting anti-scientific schemes to control Americans’ diet.The premise of the attacks on immigrants is that people of color who were not born in the US are intruders and threats, but from Los Angeles to Charlotte, North Carolina, and Chicago to Portland to New York, it’s the Trump administration’s violent foot soldiers with ICE and the border patrol that locals perceive as unwelcome threats and violent invaders. There is no more dramatic sign of the rejection of Trumpism than the thousands upon thousands organizing, showing up, risking bodily safety, arrest and felony charges to defend their neighbors. City after city has risen up to defend its own. All of Trump’s insults cannot change that.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

In fact, it is as small as 3% of the size of an ever-diminishing strip of land, where the rest ofGazaCity is being forcibly displaced, bombed and starved. But our rejection doesn’t end at Gaza’s “borders”.It follows us everywhere.Since I left Gaza in November 2023, my life has been defined by visa rejections and endless hours waiting in airport lines. I watch people behind the counters staring at my Palestinian passport with confusion, often having to “call for help” just to process it.I’ve learned to explain the details automatically: “My name is Plestia, Rana is my mother’s name. Yes, on Palestinian passports, we include our mother’s name.” One rejection after the other; I am stuck in Gaza, I am stuck outside. Where are Palestinians supposed to go? We are pushed out of our own land, then met with locked doors everywhere else. Why should survival mean being permanently exiled from home? Why can someone with the “right” passport walk freely into my country, while I need a mountain of papers to prove I am real, genuine and worthy just to enter theirs?I still remember one airport officer flipping through my passport as if it were written in an alien language. He looked at me, then at the pages, then back at me, as though trying to connect an impossible puzzle.Plestia Alaqad: ‘We were talking, applying for jobs. The next day, we woke up to a different reality’Read moreThis is the reality of being Palestinian. The world has turned our identity into a security risk. Yet this makes me think– what if it was still me, but I have another powerful passport? I would’ve been treated differently. If I have a western passport, I will suddenly stop being a threat even if I’m still the same person. My point here is the double standards.Sometimes I feel like the only version of Palestinians the world is willing to recognise is the one under the rubble. People mourn us when we die, but fear us when we live. They repost our tragedies, but hesitate to open their borders. It is heartbreaking to realise that our humanity becomes visible only when we are suffering, not when we are simply trying to move, to work and to simply exist.This all feels like first-world problems; talking about airport lines and visa rejections when a genocide is happening in Gaza. We’re told there is a ceasefire, but in reality the genocide has only taken different shapes and forms. How can it be called a ceasefire when people are still displaced in tents? How is it a ceasefire when a land as small as 365 km² is shrieked so tightly that Gazans are not even allowed to exist freely within it?I keep thinking about winter in Gaza. It used to be one of my favourite seasons, turning on the fireplace whenever there was electricity, eating corn, watching movies on the couch with hot tea in my hands. Now winter in Gaza means something entirely different. It means thousands of displaced families soaked by the rain, children shivering without shoes, and people drowning in tents that were never meant to be homes.And while Gaza is being pushed into smaller and smaller corners of what is left of home, the rest of the world moves on as if this fragmentation is normal. People debate politics, borders and aid, but they forget that every decision determines whether a family sleeps dry or soaked, warm or freezing, alive or gone. The distance between safety and danger for a Gazan is not measured in miles, but in minutes, in the sound of a drone, in the direction of the wind, in whether the sky decides to rain tonight.Sometimes I feel like the world is more afraid of me as a refugee than it is afraid of the genocide and wars that create refugees in the first place. In my homeland, I’m trapped by borders and bombs. Outside Gaza, I’m trapped by identity. So I find myself asking, with Darwish: where should the birds fly after the last sky?Plestia Alaqad is an award-winning journalist and authorExplore more on these topicsPalestineOpinionGazaMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

Back then, Ukip’s support was running atnearly 25%in the English local elections, and less than 1% in Scotland.On Saturday, Farage will venture back across the border to host a sold-out Reform UK campaign event in Falkirk, a town which hasrecently seenangry demonstrations outside a hotel hosting asylum seekers.While anti-racism protesters will no doubt turn out in force again, support for Farage’s new party has risen dramatically. Polls suggest the SNP will still win the most seats in May’s Scottish parliamentary election, butReform UK, benefiting from the country’s hybrid PR system, could come second.This turnaround is a hammer-blow to the self-image of a country that has sold itself as uniquely welcoming to migrants, but now finds sections of its population are as susceptible to anti-immigration rabble-rousing as anywhere else.Back in 2013, when Farage was forced to escape in a police riot van, the pro-independence campaign was in full flow. Central to its vision was the idea that Scottish nationalism was a civic affair, of which anyone who committed to the country could consider themselves a part.Not only would Scotland embrace its incomers, it would protect them from UK hostility. The “Glasgow Girls” whosuccessfully campaignedagainst the deportation of their Kosovan classmate in 2005, and the locals who surrounded a Home Office enforcement van todemand the releaseof two Indian men in the multicultural Glasgow suburb of Pollokshields in 2021, became totems of the country’s moral superiority.The Falkirk protests are a photo negative ofthis fightback. In Pollokshields East, locals chanted: “These are our neighbours, let them go”; in Falkirk, they have been shouting “Send them home” and talking about “ancestral homelands” – the definition of blood-and-soil nationalism. The town, mostly white, heavily working class, has also seensaltires put upon lamp posts as part of theRaise the Colourscampaign. Unlike in England, where St George’s crosses have long been co-opted as an expression of xenophobia, the saltire was not previously associated with anti-immigration sentiment.Other places have been affected, too. In Inverness, where asylum seekers may soon be housed in a former barracks,primary school teachers were harassedover plans to stage a Christmas play touching on the plight of Syrian refugees. Placards were brandished outside a Glasgow primary that holds English lessons for the asylum-seeker mothers of a handful of pupils.It is difficult to discern how much of what is happening is driven by local communities and how much by hard-right infiltrators. That there has been a degree of orchestration is clear from the repetition of Reform UK tropes: the spurious claim that asylum seekers are “illegal”, or that Muslim men pose a disproportionate threat to women and children.But to exploit resentment, there has to be resentment to exploit. Some bad things have happened, some unfortunate decisions have been made. Earlier this year, one of the men – and it is only men – at the Falkirk hotel wasconvicted of raping a teenage girl. Last week, another appeared in court charged with sexual assault. All ethnicities have their predators, but dropping foreign males en masse into a community with little history of diversity was bound to cause a disquiet easily traded on by bad-faith actors.As the first minister John Swinney has pointed out, that decision was down to previous UK Tory governments. Ditto the backlog in asylum cases, which Labour is now trying to address by processing them in batches. Labour’s efforts are having a knock-on effect because, once asylum seekers have leave to remain, the responsibility for housing them transfers to Scotland’s local authorities, 13 of which havedeclared housing emergencies.The SNP is less keen to take responsibility for the cuts in its affordable housing budget that fuelled this accommodation crisis, or for legislation which abolished the concept of “priority need”, obliging Scottish councils to house everyone who is unintentionally homeless.Scotlandalso, in effect, unilaterally scrapped the “local connection” test, which means those who are homeless can seek help in any local authority area. This has encouraged single male asylum seekers in England to head north. Such policies are progressive, but if you make changes that are designed to increase demand, you have to resource them properly – or something is going to blow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is no reflection on the asylum seekers themselves. But Farage knows how to turn such tensions to his advantage. In advance of his visit, he seized on a report suggesting almost a third of Glasgow schoolchildren speak English as an additional language asevidence of the “cultural smashing”of the city.Such stunts leave Swinney in a tight spot. On the one hand, he wants to present himself as the anti-Farage candidate, a positioning that chimes with his party’s core supporters. On the other, every time he or Keir Starmer brands Farage “racist” or “toxic”, they amplify his message to voters who know exactly what Farage is and admire him for it.The SNP has also tried to counter Reform UK’s narrative, explaining again and again that asylum seekers are not “illegal”, that the small boats are the only route into the UK, that multilingualism is an asset not a curse, that economic migrants are net contributors, and that Scotland, with its ageing population, relies on foreign workers.Yet as Farage prepared for an event he has chosen to stage in Scotland’s most volatile town, at a venue so well-publicised it’s a lightning rod for trouble, news broke that Reform UK had received arecord £9m donationfrom a cryptocurrency investor.

So is the history of US support for himDana FrankObama, Trump, and Biden stood by their man in Tegucigalpa for the eight vicious, destructive years he was in powerSat 6 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 6 Dec 2025 17.20 ESTShareSince President Trump first announced the pardon of former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández last Friday, the media has been wading through the long list of criminal acts that led to Hernández’s 2024 conviction for drug trafficking, money laundering and arms dealing. Trump’s outrageous pardon is being contrasted with his unlawful, aggressive attacks on boats allegedly trafficking drugs for the government of Venezuela. Missing from the narrative, though, are the other illegal acts committed by Hernández that weren’t about drug trafficking, and thus didn’t fall under the justice department’s anti-drug mandate when it charged and convicted him in the southern district of New York. Many are the crimes of Juan Orlando Hernández, and ruinous.And long is the history of US support for him in full knowledge of those crimes. Presidents Obama, Trump and Biden all stood by their man inHondurasfor the eight vicious, destructive years he was in power. They ignored his drug connections, supported the military and police that kept him in power through state terror, and countenanced his illegal re-elections. Hernández was only able to rise to power, and stay there, because of the United States government.When Hernández was a member of congress he was part of a committee thatapprovedthe 2009 military coup that deposed the democratically elected president Manuel Zelaya. As president of congress in 2012, he led the “technical coup”in which four out of five members of the constitutional branch of the supreme court were illegally and replaced with his loyalists. Hernández won the presidency in adubious2013 election. Two years later it was revealed that he and his partystoleas much as $300m from the national health service to pay for their campaigns, bankrupting it. Under his watch, the criminal justice system crumbled; gangs, violence, extortion and murderproliferated.In 2017, Hernándezranfor re-election even though theconstitutionstrictly forbade it. When the majority of the results had been counted in that election and his opponent was clearly ahead, Hernández’s officials shut down the computers, thenannounceda week later that he hadwon by 1.7%.In response, outraged Hondurans peacefully protested and Hernández’s security forces used live bullets for the first time in decades,killingat least 20 protesters and bystanders.All those years Hernández was also in bed with drug traffickers. As the brave prosecutors of the southern district of New York (SDNY) have shown, he accepted huge sums from drug traffickers, including a million dollars from the famous Mexican cartel leader Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. Memorably, Hernándezpromisedto “shove the drugs right up the gringos’ noses”.But when Hernández overthrew the supreme court in 2012, the US government looked the other way. When widespreadviolence eruptedin the run-up to the 2013 election that Hernández falsely claimed to have won, and a recount was barred, Obama’s secretary of state, John Kerry,blessed the outcomeand praised the Honduran government “for ensuring that the electoral process was generally transparent, peaceful, and reflected the will of the Honduran people”. When Hernández ran for re-election in 2016 in complete violation of the Honduran constitution, the US embassy in Tegucigalpa announced: “The United States does not oppose President Hernández or others from presenting themselves for re-election according to Honduran democratic practices.”And when Hernández went on to steal the 2017 election, the state department, under Trump, congratulated him on his victory.In 2015, hundreds of thousands of people erupted in peaceful anti-corruptiondemonstrationsdemanding “FUERA JOH!” (Hernández Out!). Days after the biggest single march in the capital, the US ambassador, James Nealon, stood next to Hernández in a matchingguayaberashirt at the embassy’s big Fourth of July party and announced very deliberately: “Relations between the United States and Honduras are perhaps the best in history.” Soon after, Biden, then the vice-president, launched the “Central American Alliance for Prosperity”, rushing $250m to aid the Honduran government.During all these years the US also poured tens of millions of dollars into thesupportof the Honduran military and police,sharedintelligence with its military, and worked closely with figures now documented to have beencollaboratingwith drug traffickers. Former general Julián Pacheco Tinoco, minister of security under Hernández, for example, wasnamedexplicitly during Hernández’s trial. It’s implausible to think the US wasn’t well aware of Hernández’s narco connections all these years, given its vast intelligence apparatus including the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration.Yet in 2017, Gen John Kelly, former head of the United States Southern Command and about to become Trump’s chief of staff,referred toHernández as a “good friend” and a “great guy”. Adm Craig Faller, head of the United States Southern Command, after presenting a medal in December 2020 to the chief of Hernández’s armed forces in December 2020announced:“Honduras is a trusted partner in regional efforts to combat illicit traffickers.” Beginning in 2015, 80Members of Congressand a dozensenatorsdemanded that the US suspend all security aid to Honduras, but Obama, Trump and Biden kept the money flowing nonetheless.Thanks to Trump’s shocking pardon, Hernández’s drug crimes are now more well known than ever. But the rest of his repressive, thieving, dictatorial history, backed by the United States year after year, has evaporated from the story. Who will be held accountable up north for supporting him all those years, in yet another chapter of repressive US intervention in Latin America? Or will Hernández’s full criminal history – and US support for him – be swiftly forgotten?Dana Frank is research professor and professor emerita of history at the University of California, Santa Cruz and author of The Long Honduran Night: Resistance, Terror, and the United States in the Aftermath of the CoupExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionHondurasAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

President Vladimir Putin has waged a full-scale war against Ukraine for nearly four years and this week threatened thatRussia was “ready right now” for warwith Europe if need be. President Donald Trump has demonstrated that the US is ready to sell out Ukraine for the sake of a dirty deal with Putin’s Russia. His new US National Security Strategy prescribes “cultivating resistanceto Europe’s current trajectory within European nations”. How much more clarity do you need?Now it’s up to us Europeans to enable Ukraine to survive armed assault from Moscow and diplomatic betrayal from Washington. In doing so, we also defend ourselves. For a year now, people have been telling me that Trump will eventually get tough on Russia. It’s been the geopolitical version of Waiting for Godot. Then his personal real-estate emissaries come up witha 28-point “peace plan”that is a Russian-American imperial and commercial deal at the expense of both Ukraine and Europe.European leaders jump into their familiar Trump-management mode, whittling away the most outrageous points by track-changes diplomacy to produce a version that – predictably enough – Russia in turn finds unacceptable. Although this 28-point plan only lasted a few days, it should long be studied as a historical document. It reveals just how far Trump’s US is prepared to go in reverting to a politics of empires and spheres of influence, over the heads of all Europeans. The old Polish rallying cryNic o nas bez nas!(nothing about us without us!) must now go up from the whole ofEurope.Two questions follow. First, can Europe, together with like-minded countries such as Canada, sufficiently strengthenUkraineand weaken Russia for the former eventually to prevail? Second, will it?View image in fullscreenA Ukrainian serviceman walks near apartment buildings damaged by a Russian military strike in the frontline town of Kostiantynivka.Photograph: Ukrainian Armed Forces/ReutersThe answer to the first is that it will be very difficult, but we still can. If, at theirsummit on 18 December, EU leaders agree a way to use the frozen Russian assets held in Belgium, the gaping hole in Ukraine’s budget can be filled for at least the next two years. Europe’s combined economy is 10 times the size of Russia’s. European defence production is being ramped up. The list of military essentials that only the US can supply is getting shorter and Trump’s profit-seeking logic means most can still be bought. Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and Canada recently agreed to purchase another $1bn of US weapons for Ukraine. If Trump were again to cut the supply of US intelligence, trying to blackmail Ukraine into accepting a capitulation peace, that would be a major blow, but Ukrainian and European intelligence can already plug some of the gaps.Ukraine itself has vital homework to do. The departure of president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s right-hand man Andriy Yermak, ina major corruption scandal, creates an opportunity for Ukraine to make a bold domestic reset, perhaps in the form of a genuine government of national unity. The yellow-and-blue line of soldiers at the front is getting desperately thin. Since February 2022, prosecutors have opened almost 300,000 cases relating to absence without leave or desertion, and one does meet a lot of Ukrainian men of military age outside the country.But Russia has growing problems of its own. Graveyards are reportedly being enlarged to accommodate at least 250,000 war dead and, with perhaps a further 750,000 wounded, recruitment becomes difficult even for a dictatorship that has a much larger population than Ukraine. The economy has held up remarkably so far, thanks to a “war economy” boost and flourishing ties with China and India (witnessthis week’s Delhi love-inbetween Putin and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi). But inflation is soaring, interest rates are above 16% and, crucially, the price of oil is declining. Long-range Ukrainian attacks have damaged more than a third of Russia’s oil refineries. Some 80% of Russia’s seaborne oil exports go through the Danish straits in “shadow fleet” ships that generally don’t meet international safety and environmental standards. Europe could slow this revenue flow by stopping and rigorously inspecting those ships.If Europe can generate sufficient military and economic support for Ukraine, and economic pressure onRussia, then at some point in 2026 or 2027 the incentive structure for Putin would change. His generals would tell him “we’re not getting anywhere” and his central bank would tell him “the economy is cracking”. A ceasefire along the existing frontline then becomes more likely. It’s hard to envisage any formal peace treaty that both Putin and Zelenskyy could agree to sign, but a longer-term truce is a realistic possibility.View image in fullscreenSoldiers salute Ruslan Zhygunov, a Ukrainian serviceman, during his funeral ceremony in Hostomel, Ukraine, 22 November 2025.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APEurope would then face a further challenge. Who has won this war will be decided not in that moment, when the guns fall silent, but over the five to 10 years that follow. If in 2030, as well as occupying and russifying Ukrainian territory larger than the size of Portugal and Slovenia combined, Moscow can privately boast that the rest of Ukraine is insecure, dysfunctional, demoralised, depopulated and subject to strong Russian influence, then Russia will have won. If in 2030 most of Ukraine is sovereign, secure, a “steel porcupine” capable of deterring any future Russian attack; if it has a dynamic economy, attracting foreign investment, offering good jobs to veterans and persuading young Ukrainians to come home from abroad; if it further has a halfway decent democracy, a strong civil society and is seriously on track to become a member of the EU; then Ukraine will have won. But that will require a sustained and substantial effort from Europe, as well as from the Ukrainians themselves.Yes, Europe can do it. But will it? I can offer you a long list of reasons why it may not. The still pervasive myth of Russian invincibility. Learned helplessness after 80 years of depending on the US for our security. The procedural slowness of the EU. Acute competition for public money in often heavily indebted European states with ageing populations that have unrealistic expectations of what those states can provide. The kind of politics that brings Germany’s governing coalition to the brink of collapse over a proposed modest trimming of a state pension scheme that already devours a quarter of the federal budget. The national egoisms that have seen Belgium’s prime minister hold out against the seizure of the Russian frozen assets and France squabble with Germany over a supposedly joint project for a next-generation fighter jet. Need I go on?Yet against this pessimism of the intellect I place the optimism of the will. For that is the one thing that can turn “Europe can” into “Europe will”. Willpower. Strategic determination. Fighting spirit. The courage to put the long-term collective interest before short-term party-political opportunity. We know that individual nations have done extraordinary things against the odds in moments of existential danger: Britain in 1940, Ukraine in 2022. But will our diverse, complicated, self-doubting continent rise to this major but still significantly less extreme challenge? Europe can if it wills it.Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionRussiaUS foreign policyEuropean UnionVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

The initial draft plan, which was reportedly developed by Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the Kremlin adviser Kirill Dmitriev, would have forced draconian measures on Ukraine that would have givenRussiaunprecedented control over the country’s military and political sovereignty, conditions that were seen as a surrender by Kyiv.The peace plan was significantlyamendedby Ukraine last month, removing some of Russia’s maximalist demands. Though for now, the conflict continues. On Friday night, Russia launched a drone and missile attack on Ukraine’s power and transport infrastructure.The Ukrainian military said Russia hadlaunched 653 dronesand 51 missiles on Ukraine overnight. Ukrainian forces downed 585 drones and 30 missiles, the military said.Zelensky has said Ukraine’s energy infrastructure was the main target for hundreds of Russian drones and about 50 missiles, with Ukrainian officials accusing Moscow of seeking to “weaponise” the cold by denying civilians access to heat and power.Meanwhile, US and Ukrainian officials will conduct a third day of talks in Florida as Trump’s administration pushes Kyiv to accept an American-backed peace plan.The Russian president,Vladimir Putin, has already rejected some parts of the plan, with Ukraine’s territorial integrity and measures to deter future Russian attacks proving big sticking points for Moscow.Starmer has repeatedly stressed that Ukraine must determine its own future, and said the coalition of the willing’s peacekeeping force would play a “vital role” in guaranteeing the country’s security.The Ukraine peace deal has stumbled yet again over an inevitable obstacle: PutinRead moreIn its new national security strategy, published overnight on Saturday, the White House said it was committed to Ukraine’s survival as a “viable state”. But the strategy also prioritised improving relations with Moscow, stating that ending the war is a core US interest to “re-establish strategic stability with Russia”.​On Saturday evening, Zelenskyy said he had held a “very substantive and constructive” call with the US envoys Witkoff andJared Kushner.“Ukraine is committed to continuing to work honestly with the American side to bring about real peace,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram. “We agreed on the next steps and the format of the talks with America.”Zelenskyy, who was in Kyiv, joined the call with the senior Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov, and Andriy Gnatov, the chief of staff of Kyiv’s armed forces, both of whom were in Miami for the talks with the US side.The two Americans – Witkoff and Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law – had been in talks with Umerov and Gnatov since Thursday.Zelenskyy said the call with Witkoff and Kushner “focused on many aspects and quickly discussed key issues that could guarantee an end to the bloodshed and remove the threat of a third Russian invasion, as well as the threat of Russia failing to fulfil its promises, as has happened many times in the past”.He said he was waiting a “detailed report” from Umerov and Gnatov.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeKeir StarmerVolodymyr ZelenskyyEmmanuel MacronFriedrich MerzRussianewsShareReuse this content"

But under data protection laws, patients can – and in some cases have – demanded their embryos’ raw genetic data and sent it abroad for analysis in an effort to have smarter, healthier children.Dr Cristina Hickman, a senior embryologist and founder of Avenues fertility clinic in London, said rapid advances in embryo screening techniques and the recent launch of several US companies offering so-called polygenic screening had left clinics facing “legal and ethical confusion”.“This opens a whole can of worms,” said Hickman, who raised the issue in a letter last month to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).One US company, Herasight, which charges couples $50,000 (£37,000) to assess an unlimited number of embryos, confirmed that it had already worked with couples undergoing IVF at clinics in the UK. There is no suggestion Herasight is in breach of any regulations.Avenues currently has two patients who – without the clinic’s involvement – intend to use Herasight’s service. One, a 29-year-old woman, said she and her husband hoped to reduce the risk of diseases, such as diabetes, and to pick embryos with high predicted IQ.“People are willing to spend loads of money and heartache to give their kids slightly better lives after they’re born,” said the patient, who wished to remain anonymous. “This seems the best bang for your buck; it’s less per year than private school.”Herasight claims to deliver an average gain of six IQ points for a couple with five embryos and provides sex, predicted height and risk scores for conditions including heart disease, common cancers, Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia. The patient, who has banked 16 embryos, said: “I’m hoping to have six where I’m like: ‘Wow, that’s an excellent profile.’”In the UK, tests performed on embryos are legally restricted to a list of serious health conditions, such as Huntington’s, sickle cell disease or cystic fibrosis. Clinics cannot perform polygenic screening for the purpose of embryo selection. The HFEA also says a clinician should not be guided by a patient on which embryo to use based on that patient’s knowledge of its scores.Peter Thompson, the chief executive of the HFEA, said polygenic testing was unlawful for use in the UK. “Licensed clinics in the UK are responsible for selecting embryos based on what is permitted in the HFE Act and therefore should not offer such testing and subsequent treatment,” he said.“However, there is nothing to stop a UK-based couple seeking such testing, and indeed treatment, overseas, but a UK licensed clinic should not then make decisions on what embryo to put back using that information.”Some have questioned whether the HFEA’s position is enforceable. Hickman said the clinic would not generally block a couple’s request that a particular embryo is transferred, provided there was no conflict with medical safety.“If a patient wants to have embryo number one transferred and the clinic says no, we want embryo number three, I cannot think that, if this were to go to a judge, they would say no, you have to transfer embryo number three,” she said.“I would rather have [polygenic testing] allowed here and have the HFEA control how to do it ethically.”Herasight has built its algorithms using large genetic databases, including UK Biobank, and has published thescientific basis for its predictions. However, using polygenic scores in the context of embryo selection remains contentious and the European Society of Genetics has condemned the technique as“unproven and unethical”.There are also broader ethical concerns, including the potential for a stratified society where wealthier people pay to select the embryos they prefer and the prospect of normalising a belief that some individuals are genetically superior.Prof Angus Clarke, a clinical geneticist at Cardiff University, said: “These companies are dealing in murky science in an emotionally fraught context.” He said some parents may find it hard to resist the promise of selecting the “best child possible rather than any old child”.“Let’s hope they’re not disappointed,” he added. “It might be difficult to live up to those expectations, if you’re that child.”In a statement, Herasight said: “We can confirm that Herasight has been working with parents from across the globe, including families who have undergone IVF treatment in the UK, by transforming routine PGT-A data that parents have legally obtained and provided to us. This data can be accessed by clients under applicable data protection laws in the UK, Europe and the rest of the world.”Herasight said it did not work with, or provide data to, IVF clinics or influence them in the selection of embryos.Explore more on these topicsIVFFertility problemsHealthGeneticsBiologynewsShareReuse this content"

Beckstrom died of her injuries the day after she was shot while Wolfe was hospitalized in critical condition.On Friday, West Virginia’s governor, Patrick Morrisey – who deployed the state’s national guard to Washington DC – said in a post on his website that Wolfe had been recovering, if slowly, from being shot in the head.Pressure grows on ‘reckless’ Hegseth as twin scandals engulf Pentagon chiefRead more“His parents report that his head wound is slowly healing and that he’s beginning to ‘look more like himself’,” the governor’sstatementsaid of Wolfe. “Overall, the family expects that Andy will be in acute care for another 2-3 weeks but have been optimistic about his progress.”Wolfe joined the West Virginia national guard in 2019 and has earned multiple commendations since. He was deployed toWashington DCin August after the Trump administration announced what it billed as a “crime emergency” there, though the city had just reported a 30-year low in violent crime.The suspect in the deadly double shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was formallychargedon Tuesday for a number of crimes, including first-degree murder. Lakanwal is from Afghanistan and had entered the US in 2021 after the US military’s withdrawal from the country as the Taliban took power there again.Lakanwal worked with the CIA, within an Afghan counter-terrorism group called the “Zero Unit”. The unit was involved in secretive and dangerous missions to capture or assassinate suspected terrorists. Afghan strike forces, like so-called Zero Units, have beenaccused of human rights abuses.In the days after the shooting attributed to Lakanwal, the Trump administration announced a number of restrictive immigration policies. The White House at first announced it would be halting all asylum decisions and processes for Afghan nationals, blaming the preceding Biden administration for allowing Lakanwal into the country.Lakanwal was granted asylum in April, during Donald Trump’s second presidency.Then the administration announced it would be pausing immigration applications for people from 19 separate countries, including Afghanistan. The 19 countries were included in a Trumpproclamationthis June.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The building was defaced with stickers such as “I love the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]”, according to images captured by security cameras.The embassyhad its flag-raising ceremonyon 22 September after Britain’s recognition of the Palestinian state. The building had before then served as the Palestinian mission to the UK. Despite the change of status, which has given it a higher profile, there has been no change in security arrangements and there are fears for the safety of staff.View image in fullscreenZomlot said: ‘To those responsible, we clearly say your actions will not deter us. We will continue to advance Palestine-UK relations.’Photograph: PalMissionUK/XAnother demonstration was planned for Friday with a Facebook post stating: “A hardcore group of Zionists have decided it’s time for direct action to challenge the haters and give them a taste of their own medicine. Bring your union jack and Israeli flags and your megaphones.”Zomlot said: “To those responsible, we clearly say your actions will not deter us. We will continue to advance Palestine-UK relations and defend the rights and lives of the Palestinian people.“We have formally requested the British authorities to provide immediate and comprehensive protection for the embassy and our personnel from such attacks. We call on them to investigate this incident fully and hold those responsible accountable for this incident and other incidents.”In 2023, when it was still the Palestinian mission, staff reported four attacks in a matter of weeks, including vandalism. They also said there had been death threats. The officials said the failure to provide diplomatic protection had been “inexplicable and unacceptable”.According to pictures posted by the embassy, further stickers left by the group last Saturday included “Anti-Zionism is racism” and one with the star of David superimposed over the union jack with the slogan: “We are not Jews trembling at the knees.”View image in fullscreenThe building was defaced with stickers such as ‘I love the IDF’, the embassy said, and produced images captured by security cameras last Saturday.Photograph: PalMissionUK/XUnder article 22 ofthe Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, a host state is “under a special duty to take all appropriate steps to protect the premises of the mission against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of the mission or impairment of its dignity”.The embassy described last Saturday’s incident as “a flagrant breach of diplomatic laws and customs and the rules of international law”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many have no police presence but some, such as the Israeli embassy, have enhanced protection from specialist officers.

Its “very common”, he said, adding that the number of sightings had increased in recent years.View image in fullscreenCapt Marko Petkovic said Russia was modernising its ships and would increase its capabilities in the Baltic.Photograph: SuppliedThe Baltic Sea region is facing an increasing range of threats, includingsuspected hybrid attacksfrom drones,alleged sabotage of underwater infrastructureand a steady flow of ageing oil tankers in the form ofshadow fleet shipscarrying crude oil from Russia.Last month, the British defence secretary said that a Russian spy ship hadentered British watersand shone lasers at military pilots, warning that the UK faced a “new era of threat” from hostile countries.Sweden recentlyhosted a major Nato anti-submarine warfare exercise, Playbook Merlin 25, featuring nine countries, includingSweden, Germany, France and the US, in which hundreds of personnel practised their submarine-hunting skills in the unique conditions of the Baltic to prepare for possible underwater attack.The hilly underwater landscape of the Baltic near Sweden makes it difficult to detect submarines because they can hide.Petkovic saidRussiawas increasing its capabilities and was producing one Kilo-class submarine a year in St Petersburg and the Kaliningrad enclave, positioned between Poland and Lithuania. He said it was undergoing a “deliberate and constant modernisation programme” of its ships.“Once a ceasefire or armistice is eventually in place in Ukraine, you can only assess, and we do assess that Russia will reinforce its capabilities in this region,” said Petkovic. “So with that said, the [Swedish] navy needs to continuously grow and focus on the overall picture.”Putin trying to negotiate an end to Ukraine war as he cannot win it on battlefield, says EU’s Kallas – Europe liveRead moreHe said Russia’s shadow fleet of civilian-flagged oil tankers was also a concern and did not rule out the potential for such ships to be used to launch drones.“The shadow fleet in itself is not a military problem, but the shadow fleet could affect our nations from a military perspective,” Petkovic said.The varying challenges of underwater conditions – including shorter visibility than above water, salinity and temperature – mean that underwater infrastructure was especially vulnerable in the Baltics, he said. This was especially the case for Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia and Lithuania, he said, which were “fully dependent on the sea lines for communication, for our sustainment of our societies”.However, he believes that increased Nato vigilance is having an impact. He said that sinceOperation Baltic Sentrywas established in January, “we haven’t seen any cable incidents in this region at all”.He added: “First of all it shows that the alliance works, cohesion. And we are closing ranks against one particular threat. The Baltic Sentry has proven that point. Regardless of whether any of the incidents have been state-sponsored or if it’s been bad seamanship, or anything in between, it has raised awareness amongst the merchant fleet that they should be a bit more cautious when travelling our regional waters.”Explore more on these topicsSwedenRussiaUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It has mounted a criminal investigation and sent formal notices to those with an interest in the land requiring that the waste be removed and threatening legal action if they fail to do so.The illegal dump at Bolton House Road is partly on a field where children used to play sports, and it is causing an environmental hazard, with rat infestations, air pollution and a stench.One parent who did not want to be named said: “My kids have to go to school every day with that stench and air pollution and they cannot play outside on the field any more. But there is no urgency to clean this up.”The cleanup cost has been estimated at £4.5m, including the requirement to pay landfill tax on the rubbish.Another resident said she felt they had been left to suffer in silence, particularly after politicians and the media focused on a mountain of rubbish recently discovered inKidlington, Oxfordshire.“Thousands of tonnes of illegally dumped waste have been left to rot here,” she said. “This is a lot of household waste, so you can imagine the issues it is causing; smells, flies, rats. We have had an infestation in our attic and walls, as have some of our neighbours. This is a serious environmental and public health failure.”In July the dump caught fire and the blaze raged for nine days, forcing the school to close and residents to shut all windows and doors to avoid the toxic fumes.Simons, the Labour MP for Makerfield, said he alerted the EA in January when rubbish first started being dumped at a rate of 20 truckloads a day but it did not intervene.“The impact of this blatant criminality continues to be very severe on the community in Bickershaw,” he said. “From lost days of school when the pile caught fire to closed windows on blisteringly hot days, they shouldn’t have to put up with this.”Organised crime groups are drawn to waste crime because of the millions they can make from a criminal enterprise that costs the taxpayer £1bn a year.The gangs make millions by exploiting the landfill tax, which is £126 a tonne. Criminals can make £2,500 for each articulated lorryload of waste they dump by pocketing the landfill tax and diverting the waste to an illegal dump.Russell said making the agency pay the tax showed a complete lack of joined-up government, which was letting criminals get away with their offences while ordinary people suffered.“We have got a broken system and stuff is swept under the carpet and there is no accountability,” he said. He wants full transparency from the agency on the scale of organised criminals illegally dumping thousands of tonnes of waste.“We cannot effectively fight that which we do not know. More than numbers, we require location, sizes, types of waste and what action is being taken to clear up these tremendous, huge waste piles,” Russell said.An EA spokesperson said a criminal investigation was ongoing in Wigan and it was treating the dumping as a critical incident.“[We are] using all the powers and the enforcement tools available to us to bring the perpetrators to justice and make them pay for this offence,” they said. “Our skilled officers are on site frequently and at the forefront or our minds is the impact this illegal waste is having on the local community.”Wigan council said it was part of a multiagency partnership including the EA and Greater Manchester police to prevent any further criminal activity on site and to minimise the risks and the impact on neighbouring residents.The council said: “We understand the impact this site is having on the local community and want the site cleared as a matter of urgency. Unfortunately, the legal and financial landscape for clearing illegal waste sites is complex.”Explore more on these topicsWasteEnvironment AgencyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Driving, I can only snatch glimpses of flickering light. I pull into a lay-by near home. Now I can make out five or six broad-winged birds, flying in a loose flock. They are black and white and their motion reflects the low sun, flashing light and contrasting dark, like a disturbance in the force field.Lapwings, or “peewits” as they are known for their call, are birds of my childhood. Every spring, they nested in the same field and, in winter, flocks gathered. I loved their crest and the way their petrol-sheened plumage changed with the light, from dark green to bronze or purple.We saw them most intimately at night, on our pyjama-clad safaris, as they fed on invertebrates by moonlight when there was less risk of predation. I longed to witness the subterfuge for which they are known, feigning a broken wing, flapping and stumbling to draw a predator away from vulnerable eggs or chicks. No wonder Chaucer described them as “ful of trecherye”.Going further back, to 60 or so years ago, my dad recalls huge flocks of lapwings that would follow the plough as gulls now do. As a child, he’d sit on the back of the tractor – no cab in those days – and take shots at them with an air rifle. Despite theProtection of Lapwings Act of 1928, they were still commonly eaten. The eggs were prized as a delicacy, although usually no more than two were taken from a clutch of four.Habitat loss has had the greatest impact on the lapwing’s decline, but Dad and I look back with disbelief at how their abundance was taken for granted. Aside from an occasional nomadic group, we have not had lapwing on the farm for over a decade.Now the sky and ground are owned by corvids. Rooks swirl above the woodland and jackdaws hop over the pastures in pairs, spreading horse droppings to find beetles and grubs. If temperatures drop on the continent, lapwings are encouraged to cross the North Sea, often arriving just ahead of a cold snap, harbingers of bad weather. I still miss our breeding population, but to see them back here at all lifts the heart.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsBirdsCountry diaryAnimalsFarmingWildlifeRural affairsWinterHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, a source close to the prime minister said, “he isn’t going to bang the cabinet table and say it’s customs union or bust. If that happens, it has to come from Keir himself.”That would once have seemed very likely: Starmer was long an advocate of a customs union with the EU. Way back in early 2018, the then shadow Brexit secretary cameclose to quittingthe shadow cabinet over attempts to kick his rejoin plans into the long grass.After two more years of bitter Brexit wars, the new Labour leaderwhipped his MPsto back Boris Johnson’s deal, arguing that while it was a dud, it was better than leaving Europe with no deal at all.With that, and his subsequent “red lines” – ruling out a return to the customs union or the single market – Starmer neutralised Brexit after a deeply divisive period for theLabourparty and the country.But in recent weeks, the issue that dare not speak its name has once again gained traction. Why? Because the government is desperately in search of growth.Where political argument by ardent pro-Europeans failed, cold economic reality has prompted informal discussions across government about rejoining the customs union. Ministers and advisers have been quoting House of Commons analysis that found it could increase GDP by 2.2%.Before the budget, Minouche Shafik, the prime minister’s economic adviser, suggested that returning to the customs union could be one of the most effective ways of generating growth.While the idea was rejected at the time, several sources have told the Guardian that further informal discussions inside No 10 on the issue have taken place since.“The people raising the question in No 10 are right to do so. It’s the only idea around that would radically raise growth at the next election,” said one cabinet source.Another added: “It’s a very live question. The customs union is one of the big levers that we could pull. But it would be a big decision to do it before the next election.”The prime minister himself set hares running this week by apparently going out of his way to say he wanted to go beyond thereset dealstruck with Brussels in May.“We must confront the reality that the botched Brexit deal significantly hurt our economy,” hewrote in the Guardian. “One element of our economic renewal will be continuing to move towards a closer trading relationship with the EU.”In a speech on Monday morning he warmed to this theme, arguing that people would “have to be grown up” about an even closer relationship, and to accept that it would require “trade-offs”.Later than night, he again talked up the benefits of frictionless trade with the UK’s closest neighbour, telling the lady mayor’s annual banquet: “Wild promises were made to the British people and not fulfilled. We are still dealing with the consequences.”“In his heart I think Keir would like to go further,” one of the prime minister’s close allies said. “Having been absent from his speeches for a long time, a closer relationship with the EU is now mentioned in every speech.”Supporters of rejoining the customs union have warned that talking about the economic damage caused byBrexitis not the same as having a solution. “At the moment they’re struggling to get all the things they promised in the reset deal – which were baby steps anyway – over the line.”Negotiations to join the EU’s flagship £131bn defence fundcollapsed last weekafter France demanded that the UK contribute £5.7bn to EU budgets to allow British defence firms to bid for contracts. Talks on food exports and on energy markets also appear to be stuck.Despite that, the public mood is shifting, with polling suggesting people are now far less rigid about the red lines. “The public has moved on from Brexit but the Westminster bubble hasn’t,” one senior government figure said.The drumbeat towards closer ties is reflected in the cabinet, where pro-European ministers including David Lammy, Peter Kyle, Liz Kendall, Bridget Phillipson and Wes Streeting are believed to be among those who would like to see the government go further.While the issue has not been raised in cabinet meetings and there is no formal strategy being drawn up, in private conversations across Westminster, Labour ministers are debating the economic benefits and the timing of any move.Lammy, the justice secretary, broke cover – albeit inadvertently –on the News Agents podcastthis week when he repeatedly dodged a question on whether the UK should rejoin the customs union.“That’s not currently where we are,” he eventually responded, before adding: “But you can see countries like Turkey with a customs union seemingly benefiting and seeing growth in their economy and again, that’s self-evident.”The EU-supporting Tory commentariat has also begun urging Starmer to think about reversing Brexit. Daniel Finkelstein, a close adviser of David Cameron,argued this weekit was the logical step for Labour at the next election.“This is a policy that voters you actually can win over might really want. Your own party would feel enthusiasm for it and be relieved they are finally saying what they actually think and proposing policies that fit together,” he wrote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We know this is the single best way of getting it. We could do it now and hopefully start to see the benefits this side of an election,” one told the Guardian.“We could then challenge Nigel Farage at the next election to either continue with our economic recovery, or to halt it in its tracks and take us backwards.”While supportive ministers acknowledge that Labour would have to be very careful about breaking another manifesto promise, after the furore over tax rises, they think the public is ready to hear the arguments.“If we’re planning to get in the car and drive in reverse back to 2016 then we’ll lose the argument. We need to be future-facing. Explain all the economic benefits,” one minister said.For now, Starmer seems determined to stick to his red lines, telling the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, at PMQs on Wednesday that he remained committed to the fundamental architecture of the Brexit deal.Downing Street sources acknowledge that Starmer is pursuing an “iterative” process with the EU and that at the next annual reset summit, expected in the spring, there will be fresh issues on the table.They admit this could include “trade-offs” and that the prime minister would be “much more frank” about the damage Brexit had caused the economy, but emphasised that any proposals would “stop short” of the customs union.There is some frustration inside the government at the prime minister’s reticence. “Keir keeps hinting at it, dipping his toe in the water, then getting scared and rowing back from it,” a cabinet minister said.“Why are we talking about red lines again? The public has moved on from that. The mood has shifted. A customs union is the obvious thing to do. I’d go further, but it’s a starting point.”Yet it is not just the prime minister who is cautious. One close ally suggests the enthusiasm of ministers and advisers urging Starmer to go further and faster might be down to their long-held belief in the EU, rather than because it answers the growth problem.“I would strongly contest whether rejoining the customs union would either be quick or straightforward,” one cabinet source said.They point out the government would have to give up its independent trade policy and therefore abandon recently negotiated trade deals with the US and India. The UK would no longer have the power to set its own tariffs, as they would go back to being decided by the EU.Others observe that the politics of the EU has hardened towards the UK, demonstrated by the length of time taken to agree their existing negotiating mandate.One senior aide noted the turbulent domestic politics of France and Germany, suggesting they could be a block. “Any UK government that tried to rejoin could find the EU instantly turning round and saying we don’t want you.”But while any moves to go back into a customs union this side of the election look remote, those close to the negotiations are clear where it goes next. “The reality is this: for this parliament we are where we are,” one said. “As for the next one, that’s what this debate is really about.”Explore more on these topicsBrexitKeir StarmerLabourEuropean UnionEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Three months later he received the letter he was threatened with legal action if he did not start his refund payments.“Over the last 11 years, I’ve made decisions, expenditures and plans based on the figures I was given and the mistake will cause me considerable hardship,” said Ritchie, who was prescribed medication for depression and anxiety after having received the letter in March. “I shall have to go back to work for years to pay this off.”Ritchie is one of hundreds of civil servants who have been ordered to return overpayments caused by administrative errors. Some were told to repaysix-figure sums.“Errors and overpayments have been a feature of outsourced pension administration,” said Fran Heathcote, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union. “Civil service pension administration should be done by civil servants under direct ministerial control. When things go wrong, people suffer.”MyCSP, which was appointed to manage civil service pensions on behalf of the Cabinet Office, admitted in 2019 that it was trying toclaw back £2.7m of overpaymentsfrom more than 2,000 pensioners.The errors had come to light during a big review ordered by the Cabinet Office. However, the review failed to spot the overpayments to Ritchie. Instead, they rose from about £200 a year to £4,000.His income has been reduced by 13% a month and MyCSP told him it would deduct a further 15% a month to recover the debt if he did not agree to a payment plan.Pension providers have a legal duty to recover overpayments even when scheme members accept them in good faith. However, the debt may be reduced if pensioners can provide evidence that they have spent the money and would suffer significant hardship by making repayments.Ritchie said his pension valuation encouraged him to take early retirement when his position at the Ministry of Defence came up for redundancy in 2014. He has since worked part-time as a mental healthcare assistant and had planned to retire fully in 2027.“I might have chosen to continue my career within the ministry or opt for the redundancy deal available under the voluntary early release scheme if I’d known my income would be lower,” he said.The Cabinet Office said it sympathised with Ritchie but had a duty to recover public money paid out in error. “We apply stringent guidelines on the recovery of overpayments, and work to ensure any money is recovered with flexibility and the least burden possible,” said a spokesperson.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The report from the public accounts committee also highlighted concerns about the transfer of the £239m management contract from MyCSP to Capita and suggested the service should instead be managed in house.Capita took over the scheme this week. The Guardian has reported ondelays with the Teachers’ Pensionsscheme that it runs.The company said: “We bring over 50 years of pensions expertise, modern technology including AI, a focus on innovation, and a commitment to social value, and are working in partnership with the Cabinet Office to build a more intuitive service that meets the needs of members.”Ritchie said he was awaiting an explanation of how the mistake arose and had no way of knowing whether the revised figures were correct.“Government rules say a member should be placed in the position they would have been in had an overpayment error not occurred,” he said. “Unless they are able to give me back the last 11 years and enable me to review and change my financial decisions, they’ve left me in a nightmare with no way out.”This article was amended on 6 December 2025. A previous version said MyCSP told Ritchie it would deduct a further 15% a month from his payments if he agreed to a payment plan. It should have said they would deduct a further 15% if he did not agree.Explore more on these topicsPensionsCivil servicenewsShareReuse this content"

But it’s better than no women’s conference.”The group welcomed the party’s “decision earlier this year to follow the Equality Act in all its internal positive action processes for women, and its decision last week to do the same with the women’s conference”.It added: “Opening up the rest of the 2026 women’s conference, such as the reception and exhibition to everyone – regardless of sex, will need to be evaluated after the event by the party and participants.”The party cancelled this year’s event, which was due to take place before the party’s annual conference in Liverpool in September, as it awaited full guidance from the equalities watchdog on the supreme court decision.The Equality and Human Rights Commission’sinterim advicesuggested voluntary organisations should apply the biological women-only rule.A Labour party spokesperson said: “National women’s conference will be held in 2026 after a comprehensive legal review.

The toxic wild mushrooms are often mistaken for edible ones because of their appearance and taste.“Death cap mushrooms contain potentially deadly toxins that can lead to liver failure,” Erica Pan, director of the California department of public health, said in a statement. “Because the death cap can easily be mistaken for edible safe mushrooms, we advise the public not to forage for wild mushrooms at all during this high-risk season.”One adult has died and several patients have required intensive care, including at least one who might need a liver transplant.Wet weather fuels the growth of death cap mushrooms, and officials warn against any wild mushroom foraging to avoid confusion. Residents in central California’s Monterey county became ill after eating mushrooms found in a local park, according to county health officials. Another cluster of cases were in the San Francisco Bay Area, but state health officials warned that the risk is everywhere.There were more than 4,500 cases of exposure to unidentified mushrooms logged at the US’sPoisonCenters in 2023, according to their National Poison Data System annual report. Roughly half were in young children, whom experts warn may pick and eat a mushroom while playing outside.California’s poison control system sees hundreds of cases of wild mushroom poisonings each year. The death cap mushroom and the destroying angel mushroom look and taste similar to edible mushrooms, so experts warn that a mushroom’s color is not a reliable way of detecting its toxicity. And whether it is eaten raw or cooked does not matter.People can have stomach cramping, nausea, diarrhea or vomiting within 24 hours after ingesting a toxic mushroom. Though gastrointestinal symptoms may improve, health officials warn that patients can still develop serious complications, including liver damage, that surface later.People looking for guidance on diagnosing or treating mushroom poisoning can contact the poison control hotline at (800) 222-1222.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaPoisonWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The twelfth victim succumbed to injuries on Saturday afternoon.The victims included a 12-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl.South African police have been grappling with violence linked to illegal bars, known as shebeens, which often sell home-brewed drinks.With high levels of gun ownership in the country, shootings linked to organised crime are common and police say they are often fuelled by alcohol.“These illegal shebeens are really giving us a problem as the police,” Mathe told the 24-hour eNCA news broadcaster. “Because a lot of murders are being reported at these illegal establishments.”Forensic and ballistic experts and investigators were at the scene. “So we are on a manhunt. For now, we are looking for three suspects,” Mathe said.Between April and September,more than 60 people were killed each dayin South Africa, according to police data.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSouth AfricaAfricaGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The official did not give specific examples of coverage and did not take questions, according to AFP.An OSNS statement posted online shortly after the meeting accused some foreign media of having “disregarded facts, spread false information, distorted and smeared the government’s disaster relief and aftermath work”.Hong Kong has been on edge since the fire on 26 November in an apartmentcomplex, which left at least 159 people dead. The blaze at the eight-tower Wang Fuk Court in northern Hong Kong is the city’s worst disaster in 75 years, and the world’s most fatal residential building fire since 1980.Hong Kong warns ‘external forces’ working to exploit apartment fire, as death toll rises to 159Read moreHome to nearly 5,000 people, the sprawling block of apartments was under extensive renovations that have since beenfound to contain substandard, flammable materials, leading to public outcry.The online OSNS statement urged journalists to “not cross the legal red line”.“The office will not tolerate the actions of all anti-China and trouble-making elements inHong Kong,” adding: “Don’t say we didn’t warn you.”Semi-autonomous Hong Kong was returned from the UK toChinain 1997 and operates under a “one-country, two-systems” framework. It has long prided itself on liberties not available on the mainland, such as a free press and the ability to demonstrate. However, those freedoms have been eroded since the wide-ranging national security law was passed in 2020, which gave Beijing sweeping powers to curtail dissent.The OSNSwarned earlier this weekagainst what it claimed were “external forces” threatening to exploit the fire, as well as “anti-China media organisations”.Saturday’s statement accused some in the media of having “attacked and interfered with” the legislative election, which will be held on Sunday.

Nothing, nothing, nothing.”DoJ moves to eliminate sexual abuse protections for LGBTQ+ people in prisonsRead moreBiden, who as president signed theRespect for Marriage Act, which requires states to recognize same-sex marriages from other states, said Republicans had “weaponized people’s basic identity and turned it into a political football”.“They’re trying to turn it into something scary, something sinister,” Biden said. “But folks, it’s not really about anything that’s all that complicated. At its core, it’s about giving every American an opportunity to be treated with the basic decency, dignity and respect they all deserve.”Biden’s support for same-sex marriage came relatively late in life. In the 1990s, while in the Senate, Bidenvotedin favor of the Defense of Marriage Act. But in 2012, as vice-president, he famouslyexpressed support for same-sex unionsbefore Barack Obama, then the president, had done so.“I got myself in a bit of trouble – good trouble,” Biden said on Friday.In his speech, Biden said: “There are young people sitting alone as I speak, scrolling through social media, wondering whether they will ever truly be accepted for who they are.“You are heard, and you belong,” he added.The speech marked a rare public appearance for Biden, who wasdiagnosedwith prostate cancer in May.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zhu himself graduated from high school in 2018.Papers he hasput outin the past two years cover subjects like using AI tolocate nomadic pastoralistsin sub-Saharan Africa, toevaluate skin lesions, and totranslateIndonesian dialects. On his LinkedIn, he touts publishing “100+ top conference papers in the past year”, which have been “cited by OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Stanford, MIT, Oxford and more”.Zhu’s papers are a “disaster”, said Hany Farid, a professor of computer science at Berkeley, in an interview. “I’m fairly convinced that the whole thing, top to bottom, is just vibe coding,” he said, referring to the practice of using AI to create software.Farid called attention to Zhu’s prolific publications in a recent LinkedInpost, which provoked discussion of other, similar cases among AI researchers, who said their newly popular discipline faces a deluge of low-quality research papers, fueled by academic pressures and, in some cases, AI tools.In response to a query from the Guardian, Zhu said that he had supervised the 131 papers, which were “team endeavors” run by his company, Algoverse. The company charges $3,325 to high-school students and undergraduates for a selective 12-week online mentoring experience – which involves help submitting work to conferences.“At a minimum, I help review methodology and experimental design in proposals, and I read and comment on full paper drafts before submission,” he said, adding that projects on subjects such as linguistics, healthcare or education involved “principal investigators or mentors with relevant expertise”.The teams used “standard productivity tools such as reference managers, spellcheck, and sometimes language models for copy-editing or improving clarity”, he said in response to a query about whether the papers were written with AI.Bot watchers in turmoilThe review standards for AI research differ from most other scientific fields. Most work in AI and machine learning does not go undergo the stringent peer-review processes of fields such as chemistry and biology – instead, papers are often presented less formally at major conferences such asNeurIPS, one of the world’s top machine learning and AI gatherings, where Zhu is slated to present.Zhu’s case points at a larger issue in AI research, said Farid. Conferences including NeurIPS are being overwhelmed with increasingnumbersof submissions: NeurIPS fielded 21,575 papers this year, up from under 10,000 in 2020. Another top AI conference, the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), reported a 70% increase in its yearly submissions for 2026’s conference, nearly 20,000 papers, up from just over11,000for the 2025 conference.“Reviewers are complaining about the poor quality of the papers, even suspecting that some are AI-generated. Why has this academic feast lost its flavor?” asked the Chinese tech blog 36Kr in aNovember postabout ICLR, noting that the average score reviewers had awarded papers had declined year-over-year.Meanwhile, students and academics are facing mounting pressure to rack up publications and keep up with their peers. It is uncommon to produce a double-digit number – much less triple – of high quality academic computer science papers in a year, academics said. Farid says that at times, his students have “vibe coded” papers to up their publication counts.“So many young people want to get into AI. There’s a frenzy right now,” said Farid.NeurIPS reviews papers submitted to it, but its process is far quicker and less thorough than standard scientific peer review, said Jeffrey Walling, an associate professor at Virginia Tech. This year, the conference hasusedlarge numbers of PhD students to vet papers, which a NeurIPS area chair said compromised the process.“The reality is that often times conference referees must review dozens of papers in a short period of time, and there is usually little to no revision,” said Walling.Walling agreed with Farid that too many papers are being published right now, saying he’d encountered other authors with over 100 publications in a year. “Academics are rewarded for publication volume more than quality … Everyone loves the myth of super productivity,” he said.On Zhu’s Algoverse’s FAQ page, answers discusses how the company’s program can help applicants’ future college or career prospects, saying: “The skills, accomplishments, and publications you achieve here are highly regarded in academic circles and can indeed strengthen your college application or résumé. This is especially true if your research is admitted to a top conference – a prestigious feat even for professional researchers.”Farid says that he now counsels students to not go into AI research, because of the “frenzy” in the field and the large volume of low-quality work being put out by people hoping to better their career prospects.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can’t keep up, you can’t publish, you can’t do good work, you can’t be thoughtful,” he said.Slop floodMuch excellent work has still come out of this process. Famously, Google’s paper on transformers,Attention Is All You Need– the theoretical basis for the advances in AI that led to ChatGPT – was presented at NeurIPS in 2017.NeurIPS organisers agree the conference is under pressure. In a comment to the Guardian, a spokesperson said that the growth of AI as a field had brought “a significant increase in paper submissions and heightened value placed on peer-reviewed acceptance at NeurIPS”, putting “considerable strain on our review system”.Zhu’s submissions were largely to workshops within NeurIPS, which have a different selection process than the main conference and are often where early-career work gets presented, said NeurIPS organisers. Farid said he did not find this a substantive explanation for one person to put his name on more than 100 papers.“I don’t find this a compelling argument for putting your name on 100 papers that you could not have possibly meaningfully contributed to,” said Farid.The problem is bigger than a flood of papers at NeurIPS. ICLRusedAI to review a large volume submissions – resulting in apparently hallucinated citations and feedback that was “very verbose with lots of bullet points”, according to a recent article in Nature.The feeling of decline is so widespread that finding a solution to the crisis has become the subject of papers itself. AMay 2025 position paper– an academic, evidence-based version of a newspaper op-ed – authored by three South Korean computer scientists that proposed a solution to the “unprecedented challenges with the surge of paper submissions, accompanied by growing concerns over review quality and reviewer responsibility”, won an award for outstanding work at the 2025 International Conference on Machine Learning.Meanwhile, says Farid, major tech companies and small AI safety organisations now dump their work on arXiv, a site once reserved for little-viewed preprints of math and physics papers, flooding the internet with work that is presented as science – but is not subject to review standards.The cost of this, says Farid, is that it is almost impossible to know what’s actually going on in AI – for journalists, the public, and even experts in the field: “You have no chance, no chance as an average reader to try to understand what is going on in the scientific literature. Your signal-to-noise ratio is basically one. I can barely go to these conferences and figure out what the hell is going on.”“What I tell students is that, if what you’re trying to optimize publishing papers, you know, it’s actually honestly not that hard to do. Just do really crappy low-quality work and bomb conferences with it. But if you want to do really thoughtful, careful work, you’re at a disadvantage because you’re effectively unilaterally disarmed,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)AcademicsComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Netflix inks deal for troubled Hollywood giantCallum Jonesin New YorkDavid Zaslav, CEO of Warner Bros Discovery, promised ‘everyone’ would win by combining the storied Hollywood studios with his reality TV giant. Instead, many lostSat 6 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 6 Dec 2025 08.01 ESTShareIt’s less than five years since David Zaslav, CEO ofWarner BrosDiscovery, negotiated what looked like the deal of his career. Now as Netflix plans a landscape-changing takeover of Warner Bros, he’s in the middle of an even bigger one.Zaslav, or Zaz, is a hard-charging, well-connected executive who cut his teeth inside NBC, and ascended into New York’s media elite as he transformed Discovery Inc from a nature- and science-focused cable broadcaster into a reality TV giant.But he elevated himself to moguldom in 2021, crafting a mega merger between Discovery, home to hit shows including 90 Day Fiancé​ and Naked and Afraid, with WarnerMedia, home to HBO, the premier cable channel; the CNN news network; and Warner Bros, the legendary movie studio behind hit movies from Harry Potter and The Dark Knight to Casablanca and The Exorcist.‘This merger must be blocked’: Netflix-Warner Bros deal faces fierce backlashRead moreSuch esteemed pillars of media are “better and more valuable together”, Zazclaimedas the plan for Warner Bros Discovery was unveiled. “It is super exciting to combine such historic brands, world-class journalism and iconic franchises under one roof and unlock so much value and opportunity.””We believe everyone wins,” he declared – promising great returns for Hollywood producers and stars; investors on Wall Street, and beyond; and fans and viewers around the world.It is now December 2025, 55 months after the tie-up was announced, and 44 months after it was sealed, and few feel as if they have won.Operators in Hollywood, promised “more resources and compelling pathways to larger audiences”, have endured cost cuts and a continued struggle to revitalize returns at the box office.Shareholders in Warner Bros Discovery, promised a “globally scaled growth company committed to a strong balance sheet”, have watched as its stock suffered steep market declines and its executives struggled to strengthen its balance sheet.And fans and viewers, promised “more diverse choices”, grappled with a streaming platform thatcouldn’t even decide on a name. While Barbie surged out of a distinctly mixed bag of Warner Bros cinematic releases since the merger, it had been in the worksfor yearsbefore Discovery came knocking.It’s hard to believe everyone has won, or that so much value and opportunity has been unlocked, although one man has done relatively well. As president and CEO of Warner Bros Discovery, Zaslav maintained his status as one of thebest-paid bossesin corporate America. Last year alone, his total pay package was worth $51.9m.Warner Bros, founded more than a century ago, has been subjected to more than its fair share of Wall Street deal making. Over the years, matchmakers have paired the revered giant with Time Inc, the magazine publisher;AOL, the early dotcom colossus; andAT&T, the telecom giant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It meant that taxpayers did not lose out when banks paid out compensation for controversies such as thepayment protection insurance (PPI) scandal.Bobby Dean, a Liberal Democrat MP on the Treasury committee, is now urging the government to intervene to ensure the rule applies to payouts for car loan mis-selling.“It’s not right that that the taxpayer is set to lose out on billions due to a loophole in compensation rules,” Dean said.“The UK banned banks from deducting payouts from tax bills for good reason and it seems that those caught up in the motor finance scandal are going to dodge their responsibilities by operating through spin-off companies.“I hope the government will intervene and ensure that the spirit of the compensation payout rules are maintained.”OBR documents released alongsidethe autumn budgetshowed that corporation tax takings would be offset by a £2bn loss linked to the Financial Conduct Authority’s proposed motor finance compensation scheme over 2025-26 and 2026-27.The scheme,which is out for consultation, is meant to compensate borrowers who were overcharged as a result of unfair commission arrangements between lenders and car dealers.When asked for clarification, the OBR told the Guardian the forecasts were made on the basis that the compensation payouts by non-bank entities – in both banking and non-banking groups – were “expected to be deductible for corporation tax purposes”.Dean said he is planning to write to ministers to raise the matter this week, days before the FCA’s consultation on the compensation scheme is due to close on Friday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The court largely sided with lenders in the end, and Reeves did not step in.The Financing and Leasing Association (FLA) lobby group, which represents car lenders, has been pushing for the FCA’s compensation scheme terms to be narrowed, claiming the scheme’s terms are “so broad that they will compensate customers who suffered no loss – effectively ignoring the requirement for proportionality on the part of the regulator”.Commenting on the loophole, the FLA’s director of motor finance, Adrian Dally, said: “Focus the scheme on loss, therefore it’ll cost less than proposed. That will have less of an impact on profits and lenders will pay more corporation tax as a result.”The Treasury did not directly comment on the tax relief. A spokesperson said: “It is vital that consumers have access to motor finance to enable them to spread the cost of a vehicle in a way that is manageable and affordable.“We want to see this issue resolved in an efficient and orderly way that provides certainty for consumers and firms.”Explore more on these topicsMotor financeMotoringConsumer rightsConsumer affairsFinancial Conduct AuthorityBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

Co-writers Chris Bush and Roni Neale have given Cinders a modern festive twist, complete with a magical microwave and a memorable costume change inside a fridge. As you’d expect from Bush, the script is witty and heartfelt, but it’s also overly complicated, caught somewhere between truthful play and slapdash pantomime.The Rose is committed to giving young actors a real shot on the main stage and the cast is largely made up of members of the Rose YouthTheatrecompany, as well as six professional actors. The young performers are, on the whole, very good. A trio of cheese-obsessed mice rap, chatter and charm us all, and Jack Fernie is scene-stoppingly good as a deliciously camp and amazingly convincing cat, Mr Bingles.View image in fullscreen‘Laden with feeling and purpose’ … Cinderella.Photograph: Photo by Mark DouetThe very best adaptations slip on as easily as Cinders’ golden slipper but, despite nifty direction from Owen Horsley and a lovely flamboyant set from Ryan Dawson Laight, this production feels like an awkward fit. Doubts and questions keep arising. Why on earth would stroppy teenage Ella even want to go to a ball, let alone marry a prince? Why are her baby sisters reimagined as fully grown women? What is all this talk of the Prince’s baffling affliction, which means he can’t recognise faces, and are we really supposed to believe sparky young Ella would want to live inside a fantasy world for good?It’s only when Ella gets back to her real life that Matt Winkworth’s songs – really just skits until this point – start to pack a punch, suddenly laden with feeling and purpose. Kara Lily Hayworth imbues The Witching Hour with frustration, sorrow and longing, as she sings about falling in love with her “impossible” stepdaughter. Maddy Hunter, as Ella, brings to life, quite movingly, just how hard it is to make a blended family work in I Remember. There’s a beautiful play hiding in here – a knockout story about the love between a stepmum and her stepdaughter – that appears in tantalising bursts but gets lost amid the noise and bustle.AtRose theatre, Kingston, until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsChristmas showsPanto seasonTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Ken Burns does that withonewar.”‘We have to be able to ask difficult questions’: who really took the iconic Napalm Girl photo?Read moreThe film pulls back the curtain on the mystical media shop. Curry and his crew spent a year rummaging through the archives, listening in on production meetings, shadowing famous bylines – none more venerated in the industry than editor David Remnick, the magazine’s abiding leader. Curry had hoped to make a meal out of staffers pushing to meet the February 2025 publishing date, the magazine’s centennial anniversary issue, but the scenes he found didn’t quite approximate anything from the boiler room-centered dramas of film fiction or even The September Issue doc on Anna Wintour’s clannish Vogue operation. “I wanted to see people running around each other and saying, ‘We’ve got to get this thing done before the deadline!’” Curry says. “But they don’t do that.”Supreme self-assuredness is how the New Yorker has managed to remain an essential subscription in a contracting media landscape where paper journalism has been reduced to a niche product. While rivals chased trends in hopes that eyeballs would follow, and faded into irrelevance, the New Yorker doubled down on curiosity and honed its refined palate, collaging wry cartoons, original art and cultural observations around authoritative profiles and investigations. And readers show their loyalty every time they lose themselves in an issue on the subway, troop around town in New Yorker-branded totes or point with some embarrassment to the stack of issues they haven’t gotten all the way through yet.“My mini stack is around here somewhere,” says Curry, who grew up in New Jersey reading his parents’ magazine subscription. “I started looking at the cartoons because I was a little intimidated by all those words. Then I started reading the shorter stuff, then the longer stuff – then I got my own subscription and have had one nonstop since.”Curry’s film is as much of a tasting menu as the magazine itself – one that has Academy Award-winner Julianne Moore playing narrator. Jesse Eisenberg and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie enthuse over their rarefied status as New Yorker contributors. Sarah Jessica Parker and Molly Ringwald nerd out about Roz Chast as the celebrated cartoonist makes parakeet fodder out of her old New Yorker issues. It follows Françoise Mouly, art editor, as she wrestles with what to do for the centennial issue cover in between reporting adventures with New Yorker staffers – in a Syrian prison with Jon Lee Anderson, war correspondent, alongside Rachel Syme, profile writer, for her interview with Carol Burnett, at home with Ronan Farrow, investigative reporter, as he reels in a big scoop on Trump administration surveillance tactics.The big challenge for Curry was turning the tables on these expert reporters and interviewers. “There’s this trick that documentary film-makers learn quickly where you ask a question, the person finishes it but you don’t jump in with your next question because the person will try to fill the awkward silence that frequently follows – and they’ll add some additional piece of color that’s even better than the thing they said in their original answer,” he says. “Well, I asked David a question. He answers it. I sit quietly. He looks at me. I look at him. Finally, he says: ‘Marshall, I know this trick, too.’”Where the film really shines is in retracing an institutional history that dates back to the New Yorker’s rowdy early days as a Mad magazine-style funny paper hatched by a high school dropout from Colorado.But where Mad committed to the comedy bits, the New Yorker seized on the world shaking events it observed through the years and took them as opportunities for its journalism to grow up. John Hershey’s seminal piece on Hiroshima, his 30,000-word response to the US government banning photographs of the civilian impacts of their nuclear bombing of Japan, made war coverage a priority for the magazine. James Baldwin’s 1962 essay A Letter from the Region of My Mind, which arrived in the throes of the civil rights movement, opened the magazine to non-white perspectives at a time when the mainstream media wasn’t platforming Black voices – much less Baldwin, just an aspiring novelist at the time.“It’s interesting that you use the phrase ‘grow up,’” Curry says. “That’s kind of what we get to watch the magazine do, start out as this silly 10-year-old with its silly cartoons, and the one day an atom bomb gets dropped. When the film premiered at Telluride film festival, a woman stopped me on the street and said ‘I feel like I was watching the biography of an old friend.’”View image in fullscreenDavid Remnick and Nicholas BlechmanPhotograph: Courtesy of NetflixTruman Capote’s In Cold Blood, which effectively launched true crime as a genre, became a reason to build the industry’s most rigorous fact-checking department after Capote was found to have taken fictional liberties with the piece. Curry’s film makes sure to fulfill the required fan service and tarry over the New Yorker’s world-class pedantry: the quirky typographical style, its habit of accenting élite, coöperate and other common words – the gleeful reader letters that stream in when the magazine’svauntedfact-checking department gets caught out. (Readers love smacking fact-checkers around with that word, apparently.)And yet: for as much as the New Yorker has grown up through the years, to the point of distinguishing itself as a dynamic multimedia brand now, concerns about its future remain ever-present. Remnick, who turned 67 in October, has defined the magazine’s direction for the past two decades; readers and insiders worry the magazine could become a museum piece after he steps down. Curry’s film only nods at the magazine union’s protracted collective bargaining fight with Condé Nast; last month, the magazine conglomerate fired one New Yorker employee who was also a prominent union member after announcing the near shuttering of Teen Vogue. Before that, a veteran New Yorker fact-checker walked off his job amidwhat he said were tensionsover the magazine’s coverage of the Israel-Gaza conflict.Curry says he didn’t see any signs of strife while embedded with the magazine. “My sense was there was a lot of diversity of thought, and people disagreed,” he says. “I heard writers arguing about whether Trump was in fact a racist and open debates about a lot of other things. I was kind of surprised, honestly.”In the days leading up to the film’s debut this week, the New Yorker posted a link to a story on photographer Ann Hermes and her work documenting the decline of local newspapers across the US. It’s the sort of post that might scan as self-promotionandself-awareness to a discerning New Yorker reader. Can the magazine endure for another 100 years? Can it even survivethiseconomy? “They still have 1.25 million subscribers and I’m sure they’d like that number to go up,” Curry says. “But they’re not trying to be McDonald’s and sell billions and billions of hamburgers to everybody in the world,” Curry says. “They’re making handmade, exquisitely crafted sushi for two seatings a night at their small restaurant for people who love and care about perfectly made sushi.”The New Yorker at 100 is now available on NetflixThis article was amended on 6 December 2025. The New Yorker fired one employee who was also a prominent union member, not four as an earlier version stated.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsThe New YorkerNewspapers & magazinesMagazinesNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a thoughtful take on his songs and ChristianityRhik SamadderSat 6 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTShareDevouring the newNick Cavedocumentary on Sky, I am reminded how critics go wild for arty musicians who constantly change direction and dabble in everything. This is its own kind of myth. I know plenty of artists who keep moving – one week they’re sewing fish scales on to jackets, the next they’re painting mirrors or putting seahorses in samovars. The problem is, no one cares. If poet and ceramicist Nick Cave didn’t also write classic songs, he’d just be a local weirdo. I definitely wouldn’t buy a hardcover transcription of conversations he’d had with a mate about God. I’m glad I did, though.The documentary, Nick Cave’s Veiled World (Saturday 6 December, 9pm, Sky Arts), is timed to promote the TV adaptation of his filthy novelThe Death of Bunny Munro. It’s a glorious opportunity to revisit his early, intense masterpieces: electric chair confessionals, murderous duets with pop princesses, profane love songs. They’re still in my head, days later. It’s also a reminder that, in a joyfully perverse career, the assertion of his Christian faith has been his most divisive move. Audiences love biblical imagery in rock songs, provided the singer doesn’t actually believe.Retrospectives generally feature a gallery of talking heads who resemble the Platonic form of comfortable middle age, as if they got wealthy from careers in procurement. Cave’s friends are still the weirdest people at the party. There’s Bella Freud, Wim Wenders, Warren Ellis, who looks like Mandy Patinkin playing an Indian sadhu in a Paul Smith suit. The most rock star guest is arguably the ex-Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who speaks about the difference between joy and happiness with piercing insight.View image in fullscreenRafael Mathe as Bunny Junior and Matt Smith as Bunny Munro in the TV adaptation of Cave’s novel, The Death of Bunny Munro.Photograph: Sky Uk/Clerkenwell Films/PAOther contributors can’t offer the same value. Some, such as Flea and Florence Welch, read their favourite lyrics aloud. I am left wondering why they’re all sitting in empty rooms, with objects and furniture in the background covered by sheets. They seem to be surrounded by patient ghosts. This could be an eloquent metaphor, but it also looks as if everyone got the painters in on the same week.‘Matt Smith is so hot it’s problematic’: inside the TV version of Nick Cave’s disturbing, sex-filled novelRead moreThere are strains of Martin Scorsese’s Bob Dylan film, with archival collages of pilgrims, riot police, herds of bison. Veiled World is split into sections with titles such as The Outlaw, The Divine Child and The Prophet, leaning into the archetypal imagery Cave favours. He himself is absent, save for vocal clips, and there’s not too much biography. I found myself craving more footage of the drug-addicted, firebrand Cave, who saw the audience as a hostile force to be conquered. We learn that some of his cooler nicknames include “Evil Jesus of Melbourne” and “King of Berlin”, but not why.The programme is more interested in the Cave of today: a man of deep compassion, racked by faith and consoled by doubt, who no longer believes in art as the highest power. At school, the punk rebel dreamed of being a guru, reveals his photographer and friend Polly Borland. Cave has grown into his vision, at a cost no one would pay. The death of his teenage son Arthur was a seismic tragedy. The programme tracks its aftermath, including the spectral album Ghosteen, a new dimension of sorrow and communality to his live performances, and his emergence as a self-elected spiritual teacher.Like many, I’m a devotee of Cave’s advice newsletter, the Red Hand Files, in which the title “agony uncle” has never been better earned. Many of the readers’ letters decry his religiosity, his refusal to be partisan on political issues. His replies are profoundly beautiful and frequently hilarious. I can’t read them in public, as I don’t like having metaphysical epiphanies on the bus or crying next to strangers. He would say both are essential. It’s a shame this part of his portfolio career doesn’t feature in the documentary.Veiled World is high-minded but struggles with a contradiction. Documentaries are reportage, an attempt to make sense and fix meaning. Grief and God are ineffable subjects that resist being pinned. Details and events are easier to render than interiority. We can’t experience calm or purpose vicariously, but an anecdote about the worst thing you ever did at a party? That’s worth telling.Cave’s recent work has been about dispelling a myth, namely that the devil has the best tunes. Perhaps the real perversity is in me, and anyone else who misses the scent of sulphur.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherNick CavefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Other elder statesmen publishing this year included Salman Rushdie withThe Eleventh Hour(Cape), a playful quintet of mortality-soaked short stories and his first fiction since the 2022 assault that blinded him in his right eye; while Ian McEwan was also considering endings and legacy inWhat We Can Know(Cape), in which a 22nd-century literature scholar looks back, from the other side of apocalypse, on a close-knit group of (mostly) fictional literary lions from our own era. In a time of climate terror, the novel is both a fascinating wrangle with the limits of what humans are able to care about – from bare survival, to passion and poetry, to the enormity of environmental disaster – and a poignant love letter to the vanishing past.But perhaps the most eagerly awaited return this year was another global figure: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, whose first novel in more than a decade,Dream Count(4th Estate), follows the lives of four interconnected women between Nigeria and the US. Taking in love, motherhood and female solidarity as well as privilege, inequality and sexual violence, it’s a rich and beautifully composed compendium of women’s experience.Two of the year’s biggest novels – in all senses – were even longer in the writing. Kiran Desai took 20 years over her Booker-shortlisted epicThe Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny(Hamish Hamilton), following two globe-trotting Indians whose meddling families try to bring them together, and then keep them apart. It’s a vast canvas worked with precision; full of gorgeous nature writing and rueful human comedy, exploring where to find one’s centre in a globalised world, and how to write a novel that incorporates eastern and western traditions.View image in fullscreenAlso two decades in the making, Sarah Hall’sHelm(Faber) – the story of a Cumbrian wind, from the formation of Earth up to the present – is a colossal achievement, and one I was surprised not to see on the Booker list. The cast of characters includes not only the mercurial wind itself, but neolithic shamans, medieval zealots, Victorian meteorologists and modern-day scientists, building to a tour de force of narrative and an urgent intervention on the climate crisis.The winner of the Booker,Fleshby David Szalay (Cape), was a bold but excellent choice: bleak in mood, uncompromising in form and completely riveting, it puts the primacy of the body front and centre as it traces the rise and fall of a man whose inner life remains opaque. Meanwhile, Madeleine Thien’s richly philosophicalThe Book of Records(Granta) illuminates the lives of great thinkers of the past through the story of a girl and her father stranded in a strangely shifting migrant hotel. This is a beautifully written interrogation of migration and memory.View image in fullscreenFor a big, immersive American saga, deeply pleasurable yet tinged with melancholy, you could do no better thanDream Stateby Eric Puchner (Sceptre). It begins against a glorious Montana backdrop with an apparent golden couple poised to wed, then unspools over half a century through complications, children and existential crises, with the depredations of the climate crisis and our relationship with the natural world coming increasingly to the fore.Another American novelist, Susan Choi, mapped a family saga on to the geopolitical upheavals of the 20th century in the impressiveFlashlight(Cape). Her story of a Korean émigré and his American wife and daughter ranges from postwar Japan and North Korea to the US suburbs. With a tragic mystery at its heart, it is a masterclass in situating the prickly particularity of the individual against the tides of history.Gurnaik Johal followed up excellent short stories withSaraswati(Serpent’s Tail), a sweepingly ambitious tale of family history and contemporary politics in a changing India, while Tash Aw began a layered and intimate quartet about family inheritance: inThe South(4th Estate), two boys come of age in a modernising Malaysia. Family is also the arena for a sharp and unusual study of female ambition,The Tiger’s Shareby Keshava Guha (John Murray). Two friends in patriarchal Delhi contend with their entitled brothers as environmental collapse threatens all ways of life, both traditional and modern, in a sideways take on the state-of-the-nation novel. Meanwhile, in her Booker-shortlistedAudition(Fern), Katie Kitamura uses family and theatre as the stage for a slippery investigation into performance and identity: how we construct our selves in relation to the people around us. Composed of two separate and contradictory narratives, it’s a puzzle box of a book that demands immediate rereading.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Another British novel not to miss is Benjamin Wood’sSeascraper(Viking), in which a young man stuck in a mid-century coastal town, where he scrapes the beach for shrimp like his grandfather before him, is offered a glimpse of freedom and modernity. Deeply atmospheric and as uncanny as the sea mist that rolls in without warning, it’s a depth charge that resonates long after reading.I found comic relief in a trio of wickedly funny novels.The Pretenderby Jo Harkin (Bloomsbury) is the filthy, clever, immersive picaresque about a pretender to Henry VII’s throne that you didn’t know you needed, while Emma Jane Unsworth’sSlags(Borough), in which two middle-aged sisters take an ill-advised caravan holiday through the Scottish Highlands, is essential reading for anyone with a sibling bond. Rebecca Wait excels at tragicomedy, andHavoc(Riverrun), set in a crumbling girls’ boarding school at the peak of cold war paranoia, is St Trinian’s on steroids.View image in fullscreenIn Maria Reva’sEndling(Virago), the comic tone turns suddenly much darker as a Ukrainian caper taking in endangered snail species and the marriage industry is disrupted, in both the writing and the reading, by Russia’s full-scale invasion. Reva handles the formal demands of melding autofiction, road trip and blistering reportage with poignancy and flair. The comedy is also pitch-black in Oisín Fagan’sEden’s Shore(John Murray), a freewheeling satire on revolution, colonial greed and human folly, as an 18th-century Irishman finds himself stranded in Latin America: Fagan is shaping up to be one of the most dazzling and daring stylists around.The biggest debut of the year was Florence Knapp’sThe Names(Phoenix), which carried off its Sliding Doors-style high concept – a mother gives her newborn son three different names, and three very different lives unfurl for Gordon, Julian and Bear – to become a tender portrait of possibility, hope and family love in tough times. Shortlisted for the Women’s prize, Nussaibah Younis’s debutFundamentally(W&N) was another hit: a fearless critique of international aid which finds big laughs in the story of a fed-up British academic trying to rehabilitate a teenager lured into becoming an Islamic State bride.Wendy Erskine’sThe Benefactors(Sceptre), a choral novel about class and power in Belfast which follows the fallout among different families when three boys assault a teenage girl, more than fulfilled the promise of her short stories. While Charlie Porter’s debutNova Scotia House(Particular Books), in which a bereaved middle-aged man honours the life and legacy of his much older partner, and the passing of a generation of gay men, is told with originality and courage.There were a host of great debuts about youth, including Seán Hewitt’s tender tale of gay first love,Open, Heaven(Cape); Colwill Brown’s blistering account of girlhood in deprived 00s Doncaster,We Pretty Pieces of Flesh(Vintage); and Harriet Armstrong’s spiky, ultra-contemporary portrait of awkward university life,To Rest Our Minds and Bodies(Les Fugitives).View image in fullscreenStandout short-story collections includedRejectionby Tony Tulathimutte (4th Estate), a series of utterly unforgiving excoriations of modern life lived in, and warped by, the digital realm. We meet fetishists, “incels” and social media addicts of all kinds in brutally funny, linguistically inventive stories that are even more compulsive than doomscrolling. But the collection of the year was undoubtedlyEvery One Still Herefrom the young Northern Irish writer Liadan Ní Chuinn (Granta). From the generational trauma of the Troubles to profound questions of memory and identity and the quirks of contemporary society, these stories are fiercely political and confronting, but also hum with the mysteries of life. They mark the arrival of a phenomenal new talent.To browse all fiction books included in the Guardian’s best books of 2025, visitguardianbookshop.com.

Despite fears about social media eroding attention spans, the pupils were engrossed for two and a half hours and many stayed for Q&A sessions afterwards.“They were the most remarkable atmospheres we’ve ever experienced,” Graham said. “Julie [Hesmondhalgh, one of the actors] said it was one of the highlights of her performing career. You always hear that theatre doesn’t fit the TikTok generation, but we could tell these young people were completely connected to the themes of what it’s like to grow up as a teenager, to struggle, survive and evolve.”View image in fullscreenJulie Hesmondhalgh said playing the role of the grieving mother was one of the highlights of her career.Photograph: Marc BrennerNow Graham is working on an adaptation of the play for younger audiences, which will be taken into schools around the UK. The new version, produced out ofNottingham Playhousein 2027, is being funded by profits and royalties from the West End run.“We want to tell the story directly in the young people’s own environments,” Graham said. “It’s about making the play more compact for a younger generation who will be seeing this between classes.”Punch tells the true story ofJacob Dunne, a Nottingham teenager whose single punch on a night out killed a stranger. Adapted from Dunne’s memoir,Right From Wrong, it follows the aftermath of that moment, including his time in prison and the extraordinaryprocess of restorative justicewith the victim’s parents.View image in fullscreenJacob Dunne with Joan Scourfield, the mother of James Hodgkinson, who was killed by Dunne in Nottingham in 2011.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The ObserverThe play has enjoyed a remarkable trajectory: opening at Nottingham Playhouse in May 2024, transferring to the Young Vic, and opening on Broadway and in theWest Endsimultaneously. Its 10-week run at London’s Apollo theatre attracted 54,000 people, with school groups accounting for more than 10% (5,700) of the audiences.Graham said the story resonated powerfully with younger audiences. “There’s something about seeing a young man born into difficult circumstances and surrounded by unhealthy forces – gangs, in Jacob’s case – or, today, social media and peer pressure. The fact he turned his life around was incredibly inspiring.”He said Dunne’s experience also spoke to wider anxieties around masculinity. “There are unique challenges to being a young man in the 21st century that I didn’t have growing up.”View image in fullscreenJames Graham said the fact Dunne turned his life around had inspired younger audiences.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianWhat struck Graham most was the story’s hopeful trajectory. “Jacob managed to turn his life around. He got educated, got a PhD, became a father. It was the incredible generosity of the parents of the man he killed reaching out to him that saved his life. And by responding to them, Jacob helped release them from their grief. It’s one of the most moving stories I’ve ever had the privilege to tell.”Graham used some of his profits to bring pupils from his former comprehensive school in Ashfield to the West End run. “I want the new version to reach schools with less access to the arts,” he said. “Drama helps generate empathy, and the fact it’s beenstripped awayso systemically is really worrying – especially at a cultural moment when we need infinitely more of that.”The producer Kate Pakenham said the profits and royalties from the West End run had gone into a catalyst fund for the schools version and they would be looking for additional partnership funding.“Teachers have told us Punch could be valuable across the curriculum, and with the practical and financial challenges many schools face, we wanted to take the play to them,” she said.View image in fullscreenThe cast of Punch at the Young Vic.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe play’s success comes amid warnings of asharp decline in productions of new worksince the pandemic. Last month the British Theatre Consortium reported a 30% drop compared with 2019, although demand has risen in parallel, with new work accounting for 41.9% of theatre attendances in 2023, up from 29.9% in 2019.“There’s always going to be an appetite for new work but it’s not easy,” Graham said. “We have a storytelling crisis in our nation. We’re struggling to imagine the next chapter of our national life.“I’m not surprised if what we consistently do on our screens or on our stages is fall back on to nostalgic old stories, rather than have the capacity to imagine stories for the next generation.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreJames GrahamNottingham PlayhouseWest EndJulie HesmondhalghYoung peopleSchoolsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I saw Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead when it came to London in 1967 with the wonderful Graham Crowden as the Player King. It was a big sensation. The Real Thing was a great play and Arcadia was extraordinary.Rock’n’Roll was at the Royal Court in London, directed by Trevor Nunn, and starredRufus Sewellas Jan, a Czech student who returns to Prague in 1968. I played Max, a Marxist academic. It was a fascinating experience, because there were two plays there: the play about Sappho, the Ancient Greek poet, and the play about the Soviet takeover in Czechoslovakia.It was a statement about what Tom believed. In it, he talked about the Plastic People of the Universe, the real-life psychedelic Czech band who werebanned by the communist governmenteven though they did not see themselves as political. I’d heard it before, when I went to Russia in the 1980s to work with students of the Moscow Art Theatre School. There was a young actor called Ravil Isyanov, sadly no longer with us, who people thought was a KGB boy. He wasn’t: the problem was he loved the Beatles. All his compadres were suspicious of this Beatles thing and I just thought, no, the guy’s got a good sense of music.View image in fullscreenBrian Cox and Rufus Sewell in Rock ’n’ Roll, 2006.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhat distinguished Tom as a writer were his clear and purposeful ideas. He knew what his purpose was in everything he wrote and there was no way you could deviate from that. Max was based on Eric Hobsbawm, the great intellectual Marxist, but ideas were more important to Tom than character. I said to him: “Why am I sitting here listening to a lecture on Syd Barrett if I’m based on Eric Hobsbawm? Why am I here?” He said: “Because you are.”It was as simple as that and you couldn’t go any further. He was great at getting you into a corner where you couldn’t argue any more. Yet there was never any harshness in him. He was always charming.We had this amazing first night. In the audience wereVáclav Havel, the former president of Czechoslovakia; Timothy Garton Ash, the historian; and Dave Gilmour of Pink Floyd. I remember looking through the curtain and seeing Mick Jagger being spoon-fed by his girlfriend. Audiences loved it and it did well critically. Then New York audiences loved it too. Tom really understood what the audience’s need was without giving in. He was very clever that way.View image in fullscreenCox and Sinead Cusack (Eleanor) in Rock ’n’ Roll.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDespite being born in the former Czechoslovakia, he was quintessentially English and so proper, almost upper-class in his manner. Nicole Ansari, my wife, was also in the show, playing Lenka, the Czech student. One day, we were parking near the Royal Court when, a couple of cars down, we saw Tom. He had been sitting in his car for a while and we were a bit worried about him: “Do we say anything?”We went up and knocked on the door and said: “Tom, are you OK?” He said: “Yes, I’m fine. Why?” We said: “We wondered, because you’ve been sitting here for a while.”He said: “Well, I’m waiting for the meter to go to 12pm because I got here a bit early and then I shall deposit my coin and we can move on.”I said: “Why?” He said: “My dear boy, it’s all a question of elegance.”He was a man who believed in elegance. It was about picking your moment. He was an astonishing man.Explore more on these topicsTheatreTom StoppardBrian CoxRoyal Court theatreTrevor NunnMick JaggerVáclav HavelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I love the top view angle; I’d been inspired by another image that was split that way and it suited the colours to balance them like this, too.”Mansour says he didn’t have the luxury of a camera back in 2019. “But I wasn’t disheartened. I think it’s important to remember it depends most of all on your vision, and striving to capture that. I hope people see this like a snapshot of a movie; a small moment in time.”Since Mansour took the image, many of the houses around the canal have been demolished and the area has been renovated. “The fishermen no longer gather there as they used to,” he says. “Most of them have moved closer to the sea instead.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Stuck in the wilds of Donegal for two weeks as part of teacher training, I listened to Broadway musicals while the rest of the lads watched the Gaelic fixtures and got drunk. I stumbled upon the recent production of Merrily We Roll Alongwith Jonathan Groff and Daniel Radcliffe and like most of the internet, I became obsessed.Afterwards, I went down a Groff rabbit hole tracking down interviews and cast recordings. I was drawn to how bubbly he was, how smiley he was. Groff had a joyous energy that was infectious. His voice was like melted chocolate. I both loved – and envied – his calmness and his openness to the world.I could never say the same about myself. Ever since I was small, I’ve had a stammer. It ruled my life for a long time. I couldn’t make phone calls or ask for things in shops. I couldn’t stand up for myself or even say my name properly. Young children would laugh at me and well-meaning adults would pat me on the shoulder and finish my sentences. Going through life, I never really felt that people knew me. I had a sense of humour, but people never saw it. I had opinions but I could never articulate them, even though the words were bubbling in my head.I’d often come home from a day of teaching and be relieved that I could finally feel in control of myself and not, as I jokingly called myself ‘Porky Pig having a stroke.’ Teaching with a stammer was humiliating. My mouth was sore at the end of every day and I felt defeated because the kids could never understand me.There, watching Jonathan Groff at 3am, I felt something shift. Maybe, just maybe, I could have his strengthAfter failing teacher training, my therapist suggested to me that I register for something called the McGuire Programme to learn a new way of speaking. Apparently, it changed lives. I was sceptical: hadn’t we discussed that my stammer was emotional, a by-product of my anxiety from childhood trauma? What was a breathing technique going to do? Nevertheless, I signed up for the next course in Reading.The night before my flight was hellish. I couldn’t sleep. I had horrible stomach and back pains, and I was running to the loo to vomit every half hour. My body was clearly resisting. I was taken by fear and was considering ringing up the director the next day to tell him I couldn’t do it. Luckily, at that moment, I flicked open YouTube and immediately gravitated to an unwatched interview with Jonathan Groff.He was being asked about what inspired him to come out of the closet, why he didn’t do it sooner. Groff explained that he was worried about the impact on his career, but that falling in love andbeing lovedgave him the strength to come out. There, at 3am, I felt something shift. There was a warm feeling inside. Maybe, just maybe, I could have that strength too …The McGuire programme was tough. Running from 8am until 10pm for four days, it saw us spend hours doing breathing exercises and saying our name. It was gruelling – but it worked. On the final day of the programme, we were tasked with talking to 100 strangers and disclosing our stammer. As someone with anxiety, this was nerve-racking. But what surprised me was that strangers were open. Strangers were kind. Strangers were understanding. For the first time in my life, I could be myself. I was making jokes, introducing myself, being assertive, being sarcastic, all the things I never thought I could be. Like Groff, being accepted and loved made me feel free.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I felt slightly queasy with joy, thinking about the possibilities now that I had control of my speech. I thought of when I first heard Groff in Merrily.Looking up at the moon, his character Franklin Shepard, sings, “It’s our time, breathe it in. Worlds to change and worlds to win.”Indeed, I feel that it is now, my time. Although I still have work to do on my stammer, I’m lighter within myself and doing things I never thought I could.

But if you are someone who feels theyshouldwear heels, rather than actually likes to, then good news – that way of thinking is very much over.View image in fullscreenPolka dot tights, £19.99,CalzedoniaVelvet pumps(above)£105 at EsskaAfter decades of being indoctrinated into believing heels were somehow superior, representing everything from power to femininity and sex – as immortalised in TV shows such as Sex and the City – fashion has done an about-turn and realised that flats are just as alluring – but with fewer blisters.Balancing on one leg in the street while attempting to switch from trainers into heels is now considered a bit like eating a sandwich on the go – deeply unchic.This rational way of thinking started on the catwalks. All the big designer debuts this season, including Jonathan Anderson at Dior and Pierpaolo Piccioli at Balenciaga, championed flats – from sparkly slingbacks to velvet flip-flops. Even the Cannes film festival got the memo. Ten years afterejecting women for wearing flat shoes, this year the Croisette was peppered with flats, including The Substance’s Margaret Qualley in a pair of two-toneChanel ballet pumps.Downsizing is easier than you may think. If you previously opted for a stiletto, shifting to a pointy slingback such as River Island’s embellished leopard print flatswon’t be too much of a jump scare. For strappy sandal wearers, may we interest you in a mesh slip-on from Loeffler Randall or Dear Frances? And for those who still worry about flats looking frumpy, get excited about embellishment and texture – there’s nothing dowdy about Bimba Y Lola’s sequined ballerinas or Flabelus’s tinsel-adorned versions.View image in fullscreenGreen top, £32.99,H&M.Trousers, £99,Never Fully Dressed.

Here’s a guide to getting it right, every timeSarah PhillipsSat 6 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 6 Dec 2025 00.02 ESTShareThe festive shopping season is upon us and there is usually someone who is hard to buy for on the list. How can you avoid the stress of last-minute panic buying? Personal shoppers share their tips on how to treat your loved ones to something that they will cherish.Be ultra organised“A spreadsheet makes life so much easier,” says Clare Barry, a personal shopper and director ofVictoria James Concierge, based in Sunningdale, Berkshire. “I set a budget, and I’ll think about what they like, what they’ve been doing this year, work out different options and start putting ideas against their name.” Barry says she has been working on her clients’ present lists since the summer. There are usually some last-minute pleas for help: “It is generally men,” Barry says.Jennifer Nicholls from Watford works as a personal shopper as part of herAn Hour Earnedconcierge business. She starts gathering her clients’ lists in October. “I spend a lot of time Googling things, and have lots and lots of deliveries. The postman hates me. At the moment, my flat is festooned with hundreds of gifts.”Use last year’s gift guides for inspirationBecause she starts so early, Nicholls turns to the previous year’s gift guides for ideas of products and companies. This helps to create a portfolio of businesses that make unusual things, she says, and has the added benefit that items don’t sell out instantly, unlike suggestions on the current year’s guides.Give gifts a quality check“Always go for the best quality you can at the price that works for you,” says Nicholls. “I would avoid a brand name over something that feels better quality. It needs to feel solid and well built.” “Something that’s nicely made that you can tell is quality is always appreciated,” adds Barry.Check the returns policy before you buyNicholls does most of her shopping online: “You can find more interesting, unique, quirky items much easier. I find that going to physical shops tends to be a bit samey.” But the quality of things you buy on the internet can sometimes disappoint: “Colours don’t translate properly; if the feel and quality isn’t quite right, I’ll return it,” says Nicholls. “I’m always careful to check the returns policy before I buy and the returns window so I don’t miss that.”Use the opportunity to support local businesses and shopsBuying locally can be more economical and helps small businesses rather than giving Jeff Bezos even more cash. “We have a responsibility to support local businesses and people who are out there building and making beautiful things,” says Nicholls.View image in fullscreenA small box of posh chocolates can be a good option.Photograph: Yaraslava Melchanka/Getty ImagesIf you don’t know what to buy,give foodThere are some usual culprits who are difficult to buy for, like, “the neighbour down the road, the boss, the aunt you haven’t seen in a decade, but you still feel like you have to send something”, says Nicholls. “Food is always good, such as a hamper or some really nice chocolates … even if they personally don’t like it, a family member will.” Which is better, a small box of posh chocolates or a massive box of cheap ones? The former, says Barry – while you might buy a huge bar of Dairy Milk for a movie night, you might not get yourself a bougie box of truffles.Or givean experience“If somebody is a busy parent or working every hour, then experience gifts are really fun,” says Nicholls. For example, buying a nail voucher for a friend who has just had a baby, “and looking after the baby so she can go out and get her nails done. It is about buying somebody time more than anything. Most people will be very grateful for that.” Always print out an experience voucher rather than just forwarding an email, says Barry. Or even better, put it in a gift box with an item related to the experience, such as a toy car if it is a race car driving day, or an Eiffel Tower figure if it is Eurostar tickets to Paris.Have something personalised“The people most difficult to buy for are almost always those who have everything,” saysAoidín Sammon, a personal shopper in London. “For them I would always have something personalised.” Her go-to would be getting a passport cover or luggage tag monogrammed.“Focus on their lifestyle, what they like to do, what they talk about, what they spend time on,” says Barry. “If they play golf a lot, and they’ve got everything for it, you could get something personalised for them, like a glove with their initials on. That makes such a huge difference: you’ve gone out of your way to do something different that they will always keep.” The same goes for a personalised notebook, says Barry, which she believes even in this day and age will still be coveted and used: “People like to take them to meetings”, she says, to show them off.View image in fullscreenConsider a gift that’s personalised.Photograph: Posed by model; Jacob Wackerhausen/Getty ImagesGet someone an upgradeSomething that works particularly well for men, who Nicholls says are often tricky, is to “buy them something they already have, but either an upgraded version or in a different colour. So if they wear lots of checked shirts buy them a checked shirt. You know they’re going to like it.” Nicholls also says fancy kitchen equipment can be a safe bet, as people often just buy basic stuff. “Gifting somebody a Le Creuset casserole dish that will last 30 years, or a really nice knife that’s going to be something they reach for regularly, is really useful. My mum gave me a cheese grater in my 20s and I’m still using it 20 years later.”Consider a practical giftNeedless to say Nicholls is a fan of practical presents: “I’m very much of the opinion that something that you can use is going to make a good gift, and also, every time you use it, you’re going to think of the person who gave it to you.” One of her favourite gifts ever was a pink toolkit from her grandfather, which she still uses regularly: “I think of him every time I pick it up.” Barry, though, is not a fan of practical gifts: “A gift should be something that you would love but you wouldn’t buy yourself. It’s a treat.” When a client suggests a new steam iron for their wife, “I say: ‘absolutely not!’ I think it’s grounds for divorce.”Be inventive with yourSecretSanta“I would go down the jokey route,” says Nicholls. “Leave yourself plenty of time and search for ‘fun Secret Santa gifts’. The best one I ever found was an office voodoo kit.”Barry says she has heard of people doing a challenge for their Secret Santa, where they can only spend £10 in a charity shop: “It’s great because you can come up with all sorts, but the charities benefit as well.”Don’t spoil children“Children generally get far too much atChristmas,” says Barry. “We’ve had clients where the children didn’t even finish opening the gifts that they got on Christmas Day – they were still wrapped six months later.” She says “less is more” and advises on setting a firm budget and number of presents. “It means that they will appreciate what they’ve been given, and they will actually spend time looking at what they’ve got.”“Most parents are not going to thank you for another plastic thing with lots of bits,” says Nicholls. She recommends experiences for kids: “Take them to the zoo, a museum, their first theatre trip. They are probably going to appreciate that more than a piece of plastic that they’ll play with for a day and then discard, and it gives their parents a break for an afternoon as well.” She also loves giving book tokens “because most parents want to encourage their children to read, and kids love being able to pick their own book”.View image in fullscreenIf you have time, add ribbons when wrapping your presents.Photograph: fotostorm/Getty Images/iStockphotoInclude a gift receipt in certain circumstancesShops sometimes offer a gift receipt; should you include it? “I think if you’re giving clothing, yes, because it’s easy to not get the style or the size right,” says Nicholls. “If you’re giving other things, I say no … You’re inviting them to not like it if you give them the receipt.” “For the most part there is no need,” says Sammon. “If lots of thought has gone into a gift, the receiver would not wish to return or exchange it.”Regift with cautionIt can be awkward if you receive a gift you will not use and cannot return it. Is it acceptable to pass it on to someone else? “Regifting is very much OK in my mind,” says Sammon. “If you receive a candle or perfume that isn’t your scent, I see nothing wrong with regifting it to someone you feel will enjoy it more. There is so much waste at this time of year, we need to help reduce this.”“I wouldn’t,” says Nicholls. “I find it uncomfortable but other people feel differently. I suppose there is something to be said for the gift going to a home of somebody who will appreciate it.”Wrap with a ribbon“The wrapping is the first impression of the gift, so it deserves just as much consideration as what is inside,” says Sammon. “A gift won’t be quite as special if not wrapped with care.”“I don’t believe in spending a fortune on wrapping paper,” says Barry. “Yes, it looks lovely when it is wrapped, but it is going to last three seconds as somebody then rips it off. But I do think if you’ve got the time to put ribbons on, that really does elevate the way your gifts look and are presented.” To make it look really magical, her top tip is brown paper, velvet ribbon and a sprig of holly.You can’t go wrong with the classicsWhen lacking in inspiration, turn to old favourites like socks, whisky and scarves. “A failsafe gift for a friend or family member is a really beautiful hand soap or hand cream,” says Sammon, but something more luxurious than normal. “You always need more soap!”“It depends on who you’re giving them to,” says Nicholls. “If it is a close relative, like your mum, they might be a bit boring. You can come up with a spin on it to make it more interesting,” such as a subscription where you receive something like books for a few months. “If you’re buying it for your boss or somebody you’re not that close to, I think timeless is absolutely a great way to go: hampers, candles, you can’t go wrong with cashmere–pretty much everybody is going to be happy with some cashmere bed socks.”If you are on your way somewhere and have only got a petrol station to dash into, reach forthis“Alcohol, definitely,” says Barry. What if they don’t drink? “Then I don’t think we’d be friends,” she laughs. But if there was no booze: “I would get a gift bag and create a little kit. Say they love hot chocolate, I would buy hot chocolate and marshmallows.”“A couple of bunches of flowers,” says Nicholls. “Take them out of the paper and re-tie them. Or I’d go for the nicest box of chocolates, if it was a Marks & Spencer. If it was the local Shell, I’d buy them the nicest antifreeze that was available and turn it into a joke. At the end of the day, it really is the thought that counts. It’s not about the stuff, it’s the thought behind it.”Explore more on these topicsChristmasThe expertsShoppingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pieced together from scrap material and made with the single sewing machine available in the prison, it was the product of a communal craft circle.“It’s something very, very precious to me,” she said. So precious, in fact, that she has worked on a new collaboration between London’s Imperial War Museum (IWM) and the fabric department of Liberty, creating three new prints that explore experience as a prisoner.Zaghari-Ratcliffe arrived at the launch of the project on Wednesday, wearing a dress she had made only the week before. It was cut from fabric called Passage of Time, a green pattern showcasing nature and the repetition of life when incarcerated, and featuring white doves in flight, Tehran’s rooftops, the moon in different phases and the monotony of the seasons passing, all of which Zaghari-Ratcliffe glimpsed through cracks in her prison cell.View image in fullscreenThe Liberty fabric Passage of Time, Creativity in Conflict & Confinement, in creative partnership with the Imperial War Museum.Photograph: Liberty“We used to say, when I was in prison, that they can take away the world you live in, but they can’t take away what’s happening in your mind, your imagination and your creativity. Holding on to that was how we survived.”It makes me so proud,” she says of the project. It is this idea, creativity as a form of resistance, that sits at the heart of the collaboration. Titled Creativity in Conflict and Confinement, it launches this week at the Imperial War Museum London, and explores the role of craft during war, conflict and incarceration through a series of designs created by Liberty’s in-house studio, each developed with Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who serves as the project’s ambassador.During her imprisonment, Zaghari-Ratcliffe sewed clothes for her young daughter using the only sewing machine in the prison. Liberty fabrics were familiar to her long before the collaboration – she had accumulated them over the years and managed to have some sent to her.She shared some of the materialpieces with her fellow inmates, while learning various craft skills, such as woodwork and knitting, through a prison rehabilitation programme led by a professional seamstress. “As women, making things and creating things was very important to me,” she said. “You might not have absolute freedom in your movement, but no one can control your imagination.”View image in fullscreen©Liberty Obscured Landscape, Creativity in Conflict & Confinement by Liberty in creative partnership with IWM (1)Photograph: LibertyThe project draws on pieces from the IWM’s collections, which uncover the ways people have turned to craftwork as a means of retaining dignity and surviving.In one IWM display, for example, there is a wooden figure made in 1919 by a disabled ex-soldier at the Lord Roberts Memorial Workshops, where men wounded in the first world war were trained in craft as a way back into work and purpose.Prof Sir Simon Wessely, an IWM associate, says that the link between craft and resilience is longstanding: “In the face of trauma and confinement, creativity helps restore agency, identity and hope. It has always been a way to process pain and reclaim resilience.”Against this backdrop, Liberty designers worked with Zaghari-Ratcliffe to create the three new fabrics – as well as Passage of Time there is also Obscured Landscape and Stitch and Community – each reflecting different themes that shaped her confinement. Obscured Landscape layers geometric patterns from the Liberty archive over sketches by the British war artist Anthony Gross. Stitch and Community, the most personal of the set, overlays Liberty florals on various private papers from army generals and prisoners in the IWM collection, and evokes the solidarity Zaghari-Ratcliffe felt with her fellow prisoners.View image in fullscreenNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in conversation with staff at the Imperial War Museum earlier this year.Photograph: LibertyFor Liberty, whose store operated during the second world war, the project is also a return to its own history of creativity under pressure.View image in fullscreen©Liberty Stitch and Community, Creativity in Conflict & Confinement by Liberty in creative partnership with IWM (3)Photograph: LibertyThe new designs have been enlarged and displayed on vast hanging banners across the museum’s entrance and atrium, where they will remain until February 2026. They also appear in a new retail range available in-store and online, as scarves, ties, pillowcases and other accessories, with each fabric available in four colourways. Meanwhile, 225 metres of the fabric will be donated to the charity Fine Cell Work, which supports people in prison through paid craftwork opportunities, helping them to gain dignity to aid their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.“These fabrics cover so many elements related to incarceration – the passage of time, hope, resilience – but more than anything else, solidarity,” said Zaghari-Ratcliffe. “You’re collectively enduring this pain and you got through it together.”Creativity in Conflict and Confinement is a free exhibition, now at theImperial War Museum, London, until February.Explore more on these topicsFashionCraftNazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeImperial War MuseumsIranExhibitionsMuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Which, much like spotting Mars in the night sky or visiting the pyramids of Egypt, makes me feel hugely insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but simultaneously awe-inspired by the power of a simple biscuit to provide joy and underpin celebrations across centuries. This particular recipe belongs to my friend Friede’s grandma, Hadmuth, and is worth continuing, I think, for at least another 500 years.Friede’s grandma’s zimtsterneYou’ll need an electric whisk and a star cookie cutter that’s about 6cm in diameter (other shapes could be used). In this recipe, you ice the biscuitsbeforebaking rather than after. Don’t bin the leftover egg yolks; use them inanother recipe.Prep5 minChill2 hr+Cook1 hr 20 minMakes40For the biscuits2 large egg whites150g icing sugar, sieved1½ tsp ground cinnamon325g ground almondsFor the icing1 large egg white100g icing sugar, plus extra for cuttingPut the egg whites for the biscuits in a large bowl and whisk until stiff. Gently whisk in the sugar spoon by spoon, until the mixture takes on the look of a glossy meringue, then add the cinnamon and whisk again. Remove the beaters, rinse them and keep to one side.Fold the almonds into the egg white bowl until they’re evenly mixed through, then, using clean hands, roughly knead the dough until it comes together into a smooth ball; it should be firm but slightly sticky. Wrap in a large sheet of greaseproof paper and refrigerate for two hours (or longer).Meanwhile, make the icing. In a second large bowl, whisk the remaining egg white until stiff, then gently work in the icing sugar, whisking until smooth and well combined. Refrigerate until needed.Once the dough has chilled, lay a 40cm- to 50cm-wide sheet of greaseproof paper on a worktop. Unwrap the dough, put it on the sheet of paper on the worktop, then lay the unwrapped paper on top, to sandwich it. Roll out into a roughly 30cm x 30cm square that’s ¾cm-thick, then peel off the top sheet of paper.Line two large oven trays with baking paper. Use a star-shaped cutter to cut out the cookies and arrange them on the trays about 1cm apart; dip the cutter in icing sugar every so often, to keep the dough from sticking. Re-roll all the dough offcuts and cut out into more stars, until all the dough is used up.Heat the oven to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2. To put the icing on the cookies, with a small spoon, gently place a bit on top of each cookie and rub with the back of the spoon so it’s evenly spread out – not too much, or it’ll run; too little and it will turn translucent. When all the biscuits are iced, bake for 18 minutes, or until the icing is turning from white to pale gold and the biscuits are soft-firm to the touch.Leave the biscuits in their trays to cool completely, then transfer to a suitable container; I like to put 10-12 in a small box and wrap it up with a ribbon. They’ll keep for at least two weeks.Explore more on these topicsFoodMeera Sodha recipesBakingBiscuitsGerman food and drinkChristmasChristmas food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

As usual, the competition is fierce on the high street, with some supermarkets selling the most popular tree – the Nordmann fir – for under £15.B&Q says it is experiencing growing demand for bigger realChristmastrees, “with more customers looking for statement centrepieces in their homes”, while “mini trees” are becoming more popular for decorating multiple rooms, desks and for gifting.What you end up paying will depend on where you live and the local competition.“The price of trees always varies regionally and between individual retailers,” says Russell Parkins, the chair of the British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA), who runs a tree farm in Hertfordshire.View image in fullscreenMany Britons are keen to start decorating a Christmas tree.Photograph: fotoshoot/Alamy“An average 6ft British Christmas tree takes about 10 years to grow, and so the price of a tree today reflects a decade of production costs,” he adds. “As with all sectors, business costs have risen considerably in recent years but ultimately, prices depend on individual growers and how they manage their margins.”The Nordmann fir is most common choice for real tree fans these days, mainly because its soft, dark needles are slower to drop than those of the Norway spruce, the traditional tree from Victorian times.At Parkins’ Dane End Christmas Tree Farm, for example, prices start at £39 for a 4ft Nordmann and £26 for the same-sized Norway spruce.Opting for a British-grown Christmas tree is a way to support local farmers and reduce your “tree miles” – ensuring a fresher product with a lower carbon footprint. The BCTGA has anonline directoryto find your nearest grower.“A real tree brings a wonderful, traditional atmosphere to the festive period, complete with the fresh scent of pine,” says Mark Sage, the lead outdoor buyer at B&Q. However, with most trees cut at about the same time, he advises heading to the shops “sooner rather than later”.He says: “For minimal mess, choose the Nordmann fir, which has excellent needle retention. For those seeking a fragrant option, choose the Fraser fir, which has a fantastic citrus-cedar scent.”View image in fullscreenNordmann firs are the most popular variety of Christmas tree in the UK as they shed their leaves more slowly than other types.Photograph: Jacqueline  Anders/Getty ImagesB&Q is selling real trees in selected stores as well as online, although for orders under £75 there is a £6 delivery charge. Its range of Nordmann firs starts at £20 (4ft), rising to £60 (7.5ft). If you want to spend more (and have a high ceiling), you can order a 10ft Fraser fir costing £250.For those who plan to pick out their own tree, Sage’s top tip is the “bend test”. He says: “The needles should be bright green, flexible and stay firmly attached to the branch when gently touched.” Experts also say a heavier tree generally means it is well hydrated and freshly cut.Christmas trees are sold as cut trees or in pots.“Our cut Christmas trees are 99% Nordmann fir because of their superior performance and longevity,” says Andy Little, the Christmas tree buyer at British Garden Centres, where prices start at £30 for a small tree in its 73 stores.“We offer Fraser firs in select garden centres, typically only in the taller sizes, as that’s when they look their best, and these often work out about £5 cheaper than the Nordmann firs of the same size.”If you have a garden, consider buying a container-grown one that can be planted outside afterwards.“For our pot-grown tree range of Nordmann firs, they work out at about £15 more expensive than the cut tree of the same quality and height,” Little says. “In our garden centres you can pick up a 5ft premium-grade cut tree for £44.99, whereas the 5ft premium pot-grown tree is £59.99.”View image in fullscreenChristmas trees are sold as cut trees or in pots.Photograph: mladn61/Getty Images/iStockphotoIf you are on a tight budget, the big supermarkets are running cut-price promotions.Tesco is selling “half-price” Christmas trees that it says are comparable with garden centre onescosting £50-£60. They start at £15 for small pot-grown Nordmann and £20 for the cut version (5-6ft). Asda also has trees at £15.As usual, Aldi and Lidl have gone one step further, charging £14 for a medium Nordmann (5-6ft) and £20 for a large (6-7ft).It is also worth checking if there is a tree sale at your local Ikea. A £20 voucher is up for grabs when you buy a £29 Christmas tree, but this deal is only available at ahandful of outlets: Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Gateshead, Leeds and Bristol. Customers receive £20 off a minimum spend of £40 on their next in-store visit (valid from 5 January to 13 February).Before setting off, Little advises you take a moment to measure the area where the tree will stand. They appear smaller outdoors in the shop’s plant area, and you need to allow for a stand and an angel or star on top. “You don’t want to trim branches at home and lose that lovely natural shape.”With the right care, a real Christmas tree should still look healthy come New Year’s Eve. The advice is to cut the bottom before putting it in water (this removes the sap “plug”), allowing the tree to absorb water efficiently.“To ensure a tree lasts all festive season, it is crucial to ensure enough water is provided; however, not too much,” warns Sage, who says useful kit includes the £44 Krinner stand with its built-in water well.Options and prices correct at the time of writingExplore more on these topicsChristmasConsumer affairsShoppingRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So someone earning £600 from craft sales and £500 from posting content online would need to register as their total exceeds £1,000. This is the figure earned before factoring in expenses – it is not the same as profit.However, just because you register for self-assessment, this does not necessarily mean you will actually owe any tax. Your personal allowance means you can earn £12,570 a year before you must pay any tax.Also, when you come to do your tax return, you may be able to deduct some costs (“allowable expenses”) from your income, which can lower your tax bill, provided these costs relate entirely to your side hustle. These might include things such as “office costs” (for example, stationery or phone calls) or website costs. The HMRC websitehas more informationon allowable expenses.While HMRC’s current publicity focuses on Christmas side hustles, the rules apply all year round and cover a wide range of ways that people make money outside their main job.The main categories of side hustle are selling things, providing a service and creating content. Examples of selling include regularly buying items from car boot sales or charity shops, etc with the aim of selling them for more than you paid; upcycling secondhand furniture as a hobby with the intention of selling it; and buying vintage clothing in bulk that you then resell individually via online platforms or apps to make a profit.Service side hustles can include dog walking or pet-sitting, gardening, babysitting or childminding, tutoring, taxi driving or ride-sharing, delivering food or parcels, hiring out equipment and renting out a parking space or garage.The rules also apply to many of the UK’s online content creators and influencers, with growing numbers of people now earning extra cash from making videos, social media posts and podcasts.Crucially, when someone is working out their income from creating online content, they must include the value of any gifts or services they received from promoting products online. That is because these count as income. Let’s say that several brands paid you £700 last year to post product review videos online, and they sent you these items, worth £300, which you got to keep for free. You also made £200 from ads that appeared on your videos. This means that overall, you had a total income of £1,200 from your content creation side hustle.However you earn your cash, it is vital to keep proper records of the money you make from a side hustle. “It’s your responsibility to keep full and accurate records of all sales, income and business expenses – even if you use a tax agent or accountant. You’ll need this information to complete your tax returns properly,” HMRC says. So that means things such as invoices, receipts and bank statements.Explore more on these topicsTaxIncome taxHMRCConsumer affairsChristmasSelf-assessment taxRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

They are wearing thick padded clothing and hats with ear covers. One is scanning the valley with binoculars, the other is checking their drone. “We’ve got a speaker on it to play various calls. Thermal imaging helps. The dogs do the rest.” The younger of the two men, Elvjin, pours out tots of strong coffee for everyone. “The main job at this time of year is to keep the herd up here where we can see them,” he says. “When they start calving, the danger from bears, wolverines and eagles increases. We need to see them.”If I had a mental picture of reindeer herding before arriving here in the mountains of western Sweden, it certainly did not involve drones and thermal imaging. But that is the aim of this trip: to see an authentic and little-known European way of life, which for centuries suffered repression and abuse, only to be swiftly cannibalised into tourist-trap Santa experiences – all sleigh bells and traditional embroidery.View image in fullscreenElvijn’s father, Peter, who has brought me up here on his snowmobile, laughs: “We do have our traditions, but reindeer herding is a tough business. We use any modern tools we can.” And it really is a business: reindeer meat is highly prized all over Scandinavia.Peter was brought up in the 1960s by grandparents who had lived in tipis and could remember times when the use of the Sami language was punished. In the 19th century, Christian missionaries would march into Sami summer camps, break the shamanic drums and build churches on the sites. That kind of history leaves deep scars; there’s a thoughtful caution that still kicks in when some aspects of Sami culture come up.Fortunately, Peter and his wife Helena have devised this bold attempt to build a tour that gives visitors an authentic picture of modern Sami life. Together with the income from a small shop selling beautifully made handicrafts, they can subsidise Elvijn to guard the reindeer herd full-time, something he loves doing. “Most Sami have reindeer, but they can’t afford to spend the time looking after them.”My grandfather would take a reindeer on the train to Stockholm. He came to this area in 1930 and they lived here in tipis for a long timeThe vast group of 800 animals below us is actually a cooperatively owned herd belonging to the entire community of Grövelsjön, a village in the province of Dalarna, close to the Norwegian border. Each animal has an ear mark that identifies its rightful owner. When it comes to herd size, Peter’s expression becomes rueful. “Officially, the government allows us 2,700 reindeer, but actual numbers are hard to know. We slaughter around 700 every year, but lose more than 10% to predators.”Wildlife concerns are just another factor that make reindeer herding contentious. “Would you like to see all bears eradicated?” I ask.Peter shakes his head. “I think with modern technology we can just remove the bears that prey on reindeer.” As far as wolves go, however, he is implacable. “Wolves and reindeer cannot live in the same place.” Poor old wolves.View image in fullscreenPeter and his reindeer herd.Photograph: Kevin RushbyThen, along the horizon, appears a long line of reindeer. The sun emerges bringing some warmth, and one of the dogs jumps into the driver’s seat of the snowmobile. It’s a precious moment, and Peter responds. He rolls on to a patch of moss and, lying there, grinning at the sky, begins a strange yodelling chant. This repetitive improvised incantation is ajoik, a traditional Sami song.We leave Elvijn and head across the hilltops to reach a simple wooden cabin from which Peter scans the surrounding countryside with binoculars, eventually spotting reindeer heading our way. He struggles, however, to explain their position to me. “It’s so much easier in Sami,” he laughs. “Our language is made for this environment. For example, we have several words for different types of snow-free areas that are covered in moss.”Now I see the herd, picking its way down a slope. “At this time of year, the reindeer get the urge to walk west,” Peter tells me. “It’s an instinct to turn their noses into the wind, better to smell predators.” The herdsmen’s job becomes a fight against that instinct, which includes putting out sacks of food, as we do.View image in fullscreenThe handmade knife and coffee cup of Peter, the writer’s guideOnce the herd is fed, we take the snowmobiles down into a wooded valley, the path leading to a clearing where there are a few old wooden cabins. “It was once a farm run by a woman whose husband had deserted her,” says Helena. “Despite that, no divorce was allowed, even when she appealed to the king. Those were tough times for women.”Inside the beautiful handmade cabin is a magnificent old cooking range, which we light. As the sun sets, the cold comes down. Helena brews coffee that is served unsweetened and black. Despite the ready adoption of modern conveniences, the knives and wooden cups are exquisite handmade items, clearly much valued. Peter drops scraps of cheese and reindeer biltong in his coffee. “That’s how we do it.” Cheese marinaded in coffee tastes pretty good. What did they drink before coffee? Helena rushes outside and returns with some lichen that she brews up as tea. After tasting it, I can understand why they adopted coffee.Peter drops scraps of cheese and reindeer biltong in his coffee. Cheese marinaded in coffee tastes pretty goodA long rolling discussion ensues, punctuated by eating and drinking. I’m fascinated by the fact that Peter was born in a tipi, but now uses drones. He recalls many old practices that have died out. “My grandfather would take a reindeer on the train to Stockholm,” he says. “He came to this area in 1930 after the government reversed a policy of eradicating reindeer herding. The whole family came on skis, driving the herd, and they lived here in tipis for a long time.”In 1955, Peter’s father was spotted as a talented skier. Having never even seen a large town, he found himself taking part in two Winter Olympics, visiting Italy and the USA. Such experiences, however, never distracted from the main business of life: reindeer. As I listen, I sense how the family’s year is still governed by the unchanging requirements of the herd. “We even have a pet reindeer,” says Helena, explaining how Loovis, an orphaned calf, became a household fixture.Peter and Helena go off to sleep in another cabin and I have the place to myself, watching the fire burn low and thinking about the bears they told me about, hibernating in a snow cave not half a mile away.View image in fullscreenThe writer outside a Sami herder’s tipiThe next day, we go to meet Peter’s brother Thomas, who looks after Loovis and a small herd of semi-domesticated animals that are used to encourage the main herd to be less wary of humans. Loovis is certainly not afraid. She trots over, and the others soon follow. We walk with them through the forest, then dig a snow bench and light a fire, drinking coffee while the reindeer forage for lichen. It is a profoundly simple, yet intensely enjoyable, experience.My final night is in a tipi, alone in the forest, wrapped in two down sleeping bags with a log burner humming away next to me. I leave the canvas door slightly open to watch the stars, but soon fall deeply asleep. At some point in the small hours I wake, replenish the log burner and for a minute sit outside under the miracle of the stars, feeling privileged to have had this glimpse into modern and ancient Sami life.The trip was provided byVisit Dalarna.Rail transport to Mora was provided byInterrail(a seven days in one month pass is £339 adults/£255 for 12-27s); then by bus to Grövelsjön.

The dog is still staring at my wife an hour later.“I think she’s the instructor’s favourite,” my wife says. “Obviously, they’re not allowed to say.”“Did you learn anything else?” I say.My wife produces a dog treat and commands the dog to lie down. The dog obeys.“Stay!” my wife shouts. She then parades around the room with the dog treat held above her head. The dog stays put; only its eyes follow my wife.“Weird,” I say.Bedtime is less sorted. The dog retreats to its own bed on command, without complaint, seven or eight times a night. But whenever I wake up I find it sleeping across my chest, restricting my breathing. As far as the dog is concerned, it’s obeying my orders to the letter. From my perspective, the dog is never not in my bed.My wife blows the whistle, a signal for the dog to come; instead she retreats to the other side of the roomAnyway, the point of dog school is to modify the dog’s behaviour in public, where its outgoing nature can sometimes lead to breaches of protocol. To that end, my wife has been supplied with a high-pitched dog whistle to improve the dog’s recall. If nothing else, we can add it to the long list of noises the dog is afraid of.My wife blows the whistle; the dog ducks its head and retreats to the other side of the room.“Two short toots,” she says. “Everyone has to have their own signal so you don’t get mixed up.”“She’s supposed to come, and it makes her run away,” I say.“She’ll get used to it,” she says.“I’m sorry, but I can’t use a whistle in public,” I say.“Why not?” she says.“Because of how it will make me seem,” I say. “Anyway, I can already whistle.”Some days later we are on a long, flat beach at low tide. It’s one of those still, sunny days when the beach is nicer in winter than it often is in the summer. Everyone present is either a dog owner or a dog.The dog runs up and down the beach, kicking up sand. If she gets too far ahead or behind, my wife calls and the dog comes running.“She’s much better these days,” she says.“I guess this sort of thing is the test,” I say.I throw the dog’s ball, repeatedly.

The gen-Z French-American heart-throb and original “internet boyfriend” is receiving the best reviews of his career forJosh Safdie’s frenetic ping-pong flickMarty Supreme, while also making waves for his idiosyncratic approach to celebrity in an age somewhat lacking in star power. He has even got Gwyneth Paltrow’s seal of approval. Here are seven reasons why“Chalamania”is back.1. He seems a cert for an OscarView image in fullscreenChalamet in Marty Supreme.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyView image in fullscreenWith director Josh Safdie.Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for FLCTwice Oscar-nominated and not yet 30,Chalamet lost outtoAdrien Brody for best actorat this year’s awards, but is already the favourite to win in 2026 for Marty Supreme. Early reviews say the film presents Chalamet at“his most infectiously charismatic”, playing a table tennis player with a little paddle and big dreams, while the internet has already been thrilled with his character’s tiny goatee and tank top. Director Josh Safdierecently told Voguethat the actor shared similarities with his character – “a man possessed and blinded by his ambition”. The star has certainly been energetically promoting the picture, as“the best thing I’ve been in”. The press rollout has been a performance in and of itself, Chalamet making appearances with an entourage wearing orange ping-pong balls over their heads.And, in an 18-minute-long video skitpurporting to show a marketing meeting with the studio A24, he poked fun at his public image as an intensely ambitious method actor, throwing out increasingly ludicrous ideas for promotional reasons. You wonder if the Academy will be forced to introduce a new category: best marketing campaign.2. He has defined the ‘garment of 2025’View image in fullscreenThe future is orange … at a ‘special screening’ of A24’s Marty Supreme in LA.Photograph: Eric Charbonneau/A24/Getty ImagesEven Marty Supreme’s merchandise is making headlines. A clothing line produced with the streetwear brand Nahmias immediately sold out at a pop-up event in New York last week, with items already fetching thousands of dollars on resale sites. Chalamet reportedly spent six months working on the designs. Had you been wondering what, at this late stage of 2025, might constitute the year’s “defining garment”, GQ hassuggestedthat it’s the zip-up jacket bearing the film’s title, as pictured on a host of Chalamet’s famous friends such as the rappers Frank Ocean and Kid Cudi, and NFL quarterback Tom Brady. Even Chalamet’s mother has struggled to cop the covetable limited-edition layer. Earlier this week, Chalametposted on Instagramher texted request to “please send me a Marty Supreme jacket” and to send it “so it’s timely and I can wear it to the premiere”.3. ‘Chalamania’ is back in a big wayThough theinternet now claimsPaul Mescal, Josh O’Connor and many other handsome young stars as its “boyfriends”, Chalamet remains its fiercest love. Indeed the “Chalamania” first documented in 2018 is now back with the hype around Marty Supreme inspiring a new wave of online tributes. A fan turned the marketing-meeting skit into an interactive website, enabling users to“Zoom with Timothée”and picture their own strained response to Chalamet’s suggestion to paint the Statue of Liberty orange or his repeated interjections of “Schwap!” for emphasis. Meanwhile, his best-known fan is getting her own press. A 59-year-old US healthcare worker who posts on X as@ClubChalamethas gained a cult following for her impassioned and lengthy commentary on the actor, and was this weekprofiled bythe Wall Street Journal. Simone Cromer defended her parasocial activity to the paper, saying she was “just a fan”: “I’m not a stalker. I’m not weird … I can’t change the fact that I was born in 1966.”4. He is still in pursuit of greatness …Chalamet is an alleged“nepo baby”. His older sister Pauline is also an actor (best known for The Sex Lives of College Girls); their mother (Nicole Flender) and maternal grandmotherboth used to dance on Broadway, while theiruncle (Rodman Flender), directed Leprechaun 2. Whether this constitutes actual nepotism continues to be contested, years on from the viral“nepo baby” debate of 2022– but it is increasingly incontrovertible that Chalamet has never had to jump through the same hoops as other aspiring young actors. According to a recent profile inVogue, he did not even have to audition for his breakout role in 2017’s Call Me By Your Name. Having declared himself “in pursuit of greatness”at the Screen Actors Guild Awards early this year, he has also set some parameters. Asked by Vogue if he would ever consider TV, he responded “with a simple, self-assured ‘no’”. Chalamet went on to clarify that he was otherwise engaged, being “so fucking locked in” with film and “literally actively falling in love with this newfound creative structure, this discipline that I’ve only accrued through experience”.5. … but he may also have a secret side hustleView image in fullscreenUnder rap … is EsDeeKid actually Chalamet?After his Oscar-nominated turn as Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown (for which Chalamet enlisted the support of a team of dialect, guitar, harmonica, vocal and movement coaches), Chalamet is rumoured to be exploring his own musical stylings. This week he has beenwidely speculated to be the entitybehind EsDeeKid, a rapper apparently from Liverpool, who recently landed a song in the top 10. Chalamet is known for having experimented with rapping as a teenager under the moniker “Lil Timmy Tim”, while EsDeeKid performances have coincided with screenings of Marty Supreme. At the very least,they appear to own the same scarf.6.

Leaked photos of them kissing briefly set the internet alight last year, and were takenby someas indicative of how Paltrow was enticed to return to acting.She has claimedto have not known anything about Chalamet before they met on set, buttold the Hollywood Reporterthis week that she understood the broader interest: “Of course a fortysomething woman is going to be excited about a sex scene with Timothée Chalamet.” Paltrow’s own phone was “blowing up” with texts from friends about the paparazzi pictures, she added. “They’re all sending me these pictures, like, ‘Yesss, G.P.!’ Everyone wasthrilled.” Her 19-year-old son, however, was “kind of mortified”.7.

But, she added: “I didn’t know [it was] Kylie Jenner.” Chalamet has been keeping up with that particular Kardashian (who has two children, aged seven and three, with rapper Travis Scott) since early 2023. He declined to comment on his relationship to Vogue: “I don’t say that with any fear, I just don’t have anything to say.” He did, however, admit that fatherhood “could be on the radar”. According to Vogue, Chalamet believes “procreation is the reason we’re here” and considers the thought of forgoing parenthood so as to have more time for other activities “bleak”.

But for gen Z, those common workplace moments are a huge source of anxiety.According to a study released this week, early mornings, working with older colleagues and making small talk are just some of the things employees born between 1997 and 2012 dread.The study, commissioned byTrinity College London, surveyed more than 1,500 people aged between 16 and 29 across the UK. It found that 38% of young people dread having to make small talk in the workplace. Almost 60% said they would struggle to work with older colleagues while 30% feared picking up the phone.Here, experts share their tips on how to overcome gen Z’s biggest anxieties.Telephobia“There’s a massive skill to learning to make calls,” says Liz Baxter, a careers adviser at Nottingham College who runs coaching sessions on phone confidence. She says demand for the college’s “telephobia” course is high.While previous generations grew up having no option but to pick up the phone, Baxter says texting, online booking platforms and AI customer service have made making a phone call one of the biggest generational divides.Baxter explains confidence comes with practice. She suggests calling friends and family first “to practise the ebb and flow of a two-way conversation in real time”.Baxter stresses the importance of sitting up straight, speaking slowly and smiling as “the caller will hear it in your voice”.Sophie Rains, a customer support and experience manager who manages a call centre, says that before dialling you should jot down “what the purpose of your call is and any relevant information. That way if you get nervous or confused you can refer back to your notes.”If someone is rude or angry, Rains says: “I usually let them vent and eventually they run out of steam and are often a bit calmer.”Rains says to remember not to take anything personally. “You don’t know what is going on in the caller’s life, or you might have caught them at a bad time.”Colleagues and office chit-chatRather than fearing encounters with new people, Marie O’Riordan, an executive coach, suggests viewing it as an adventure, with many people making lifelong friends through work.The former editor-in-chief of Marie Claire and Elle UK, who now specialises in helping women transition into leadership roles, says small talk can often lead to other opportunities.She suggests starting with workplace topics such as how long someone has been with the company, rather than subjects such as someone’s home life, which could be considered too personal.“Gen Z often underestimate how flattering it is to be asked questions,” O’Riordan says. “It shows a generosity and you can learn so much from other people.”Early birdsIf you need to set an early alarm, Dr Radha Modgil, the author of Know Your Own Power: Inspiration, Motivation and Practical Tools for Life, suggests treating yourself as if you were a child going back to school after the summer holidays. In the weeks leading up to a new job, start by bringing your bedtime and getting-up time forward.For an efficient morning routine, take your start time and work backwards. “Look at travel timetables. Get your work clothes ready the night before. Lay out your breakfast,” Modgil says. “These are things that all sound very simple but they help prepare you and can reduce anxiety.”According to the report, 28% of gen Z favoured flexible working hours and no emails after 6pm, while 32% wanted mental health days as standard. A desire to work from home was expressed by 68% of the respondents. Modgil says a lot of trepidation stems from gen Z feeling like the workplace will be detrimental to their wellbeing.Modgil suggests treating each month like a marathon and coming up with a plan. “It helps to pace yourself so that you can be present and have the mental and emotional energy to work effectively.”Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleWorking from homeWork & careersMental healthPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The twelfth victim succumbed to injuries on Saturday afternoon.The victims included a 12-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl.South African police have been grappling with violence linked to illegal bars, known as shebeens, which often sell home-brewed drinks.With high levels of gun ownership in the country, shootings linked to organised crime are common and police say they are often fuelled by alcohol.“These illegal shebeens are really giving us a problem as the police,” Mathe told the 24-hour eNCA news broadcaster. “Because a lot of murders are being reported at these illegal establishments.”Forensic and ballistic experts and investigators were at the scene. “So we are on a manhunt. For now, we are looking for three suspects,” Mathe said.Between April and September,more than 60 people were killed each dayin South Africa, according to police data.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSouth AfricaAfricaGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s just part of the picture,” said Francisco J Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, in Houston.First of all, “Venezuela is a very small player at this point,” he said.The country has almost a fifth of all known global reserves – but it accounts for less than 1% of world production. Most of Venezuela’s reserves are “heavy sour” crude, which is more difficult and expensive to extract. Meanwhile, its oil sector has been hamstrung by decades of corruption, mismanagement and underinvestment.Monaldi estimates that current output of just under 1m barrels a day could rise to 4m or even 5m a day – but doing so would require about $100bn in investment and would take at least 10 years.After a strike by oil workers in the early 2000s, Maduro’s predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chávez, dismissed large numbers of workers at the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela Sociedad Anónima (PDVSA) and consolidated government control of the company.His government later decreed that PDVSA must hold at least 51% ownership and operational control of all exploration fields, driving away multinationals that had long operated in the country, such as ConocoPhillips and Exxon-Mobil.Production then went into a steep decline, especially after the US, during Trump’s first term, imposed sanctions banning imports of Venezuelan oil. Joe Biden eased those restrictions in the hope that Maduro would allow a democratic transition, but after last year’s elections – widely believed to have been stolen by Maduro – Trump reinstated the sanctionsEven during sanctions, however, the US-based oil giantChevronnever fully suspended its operations in Venezuela, maintaining them albeit at drastically reduced levels.View image in fullscreenPresident Nicolás Maduro looks through binoculars during a protest to support him on 1 December in Caracas, Venezuela.Photograph: Jesús Vargas/Getty ImagesTrump revoked Chevron’s licence, but reversed course in July, ordering that instead of being transferred to Maduro’s regime royalties should be used to cover operational costs and pay down a longstanding Venezuelan government debt to the US company.Although the Maduro regime’s lack of transparency is reflected in the oil sector, analysts estimate that PDVSA currently holds 50% of operations; Chevron, 25%; 10% is in joint ventures led by China; 10% by Russia; and 5% by European companies.Since Trump’s recent easing of restrictions, Chevron has been importing between 150,000 and 160,000 barrels a day to the US.“I believe the main beneficiary of a political change in Venezuela would be Chevron,” said José Ignacio Hernández, a legal scholar and researcher of Venezuela’s oil industry who works with the consultancy Aurora Macro Strategies.But Hernández, who was a member of Juan Guaidó’s team, when the opposition figurehead declared himself interim president in 2019, also rejects the idea that oil is the main focus of the US campaign.“The oil sector in Venezuela is destroyed … It’s not an attractive market in the short term, especially for a country like the US, which already has the world’s largest production,” he added.Hernández pointed to recent reports that during talks with US envoys,Maduro offered to open up all existing and future oil and gold projects to US companies. “If Trump wanted to strike a monopoly deal over Venezuela’s oil, he would have accepted Maduro’s offer,” said Hernández.Monaldi said that even if there were a change of regime and a US-backed candidate took office, the final decision on whether to invest in Venezuela’s oil would ultimately lie with the companies, which would weigh political and economic stability above all.“Venezuela has massive resources, a lot of infrastructure and fields that are already developed; one would not go there and explore from scratch … But, at the same time, there are tons of potential obstacles: the political risks, the country’s history, the fact that the oil is less valuable,” he said.“So the obstacles are mostly above ground.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaAmericasOilOil and gas companiesChevronNicolás MaduroanalysisShareReuse this content"

The official did not give specific examples of coverage and did not take questions, according to AFP.An OSNS statement posted online shortly after the meeting accused some foreign media of having “disregarded facts, spread false information, distorted and smeared the government’s disaster relief and aftermath work”.Hong Kong has been on edge since the fire on 26 November in an apartmentcomplex, which left at least 159 people dead. The blaze at the eight-tower Wang Fuk Court in northern Hong Kong is the city’s worst disaster in 75 years, and the world’s most fatal residential building fire since 1980.Hong Kong warns ‘external forces’ working to exploit apartment fire, as death toll rises to 159Read moreHome to nearly 5,000 people, the sprawling block of apartments was under extensive renovations that have since beenfound to contain substandard, flammable materials, leading to public outcry.The online OSNS statement urged journalists to “not cross the legal red line”.“The office will not tolerate the actions of all anti-China and trouble-making elements inHong Kong,” adding: “Don’t say we didn’t warn you.”Semi-autonomous Hong Kong was returned from the UK toChinain 1997 and operates under a “one-country, two-systems” framework. It has long prided itself on liberties not available on the mainland, such as a free press and the ability to demonstrate. However, those freedoms have been eroded since the wide-ranging national security law was passed in 2020, which gave Beijing sweeping powers to curtail dissent.The OSNSwarned earlier this weekagainst what it claimed were “external forces” threatening to exploit the fire, as well as “anti-China media organisations”.Saturday’s statement accused some in the media of having “attacked and interfered with” the legislative election, which will be held on Sunday. Hong Kong’s electoral system was revamped in 2021 to ensure that only “patriots” could hold office, meaning pro-China candidates.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsHong Kong apartment firesHong KongAsia PacificChinanewsShareReuse this content"

They are the wives, widows and children of dead or jailedIslamic Statefighters.Most have been held in the Roj camp near the Turkish border since 2019. The Guardian understands there are 12 Australian women, and between 22 and 25 Australian children, in Roj. Some of the children were born in the camp.The Australians in the camps have not been charged with a crime and do not face warrants for arrest, although they could face charges on return to Australia.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIn June the home affairs minister,Tony Burke, and government officials met with the chief executive of Save the Children, Mat Tinkler, and Kamalle Dabboussy, an advocate and father of a previously repatriated Australian, at Burke’s Punchbowl electorate office.Contemporaneous notes of the meeting typed by a senior public servant were tendered to Senate estimates this week.Those notes recorded: “The camps are becoming more militarised, intrusive and securitised. The kids are being weaponised against their mothers ie if they go beyond the fence lines they will be shot. There is a reducing range of activities further impacting on the women and children.”Download original documentSources from within the camps have confirmed that women and children have been warned that any unauthorised breaches of the camp perimeter will be met with force. A Syrian source characterised the direction as “shoot first and ask questions later”.The official’s notes of the June meeting record that the minister was told Kurdish forces controlling the detention camps “will allow people to leave if the government would provide assurances that passports will be issued”.“Minister [Burke] responded that this is not something the government is considering at this time,” the notes state. “Minister stated there may be a way to achieve the same outcome without government undertakings.”The official was then asked to leave the meeting “to enable a frank discussion to take place”.In a subsequent letter sent in August to the minister, Dabboussy and Tinkler wrote that the US had confirmed an offer to move Australians out of the camps, saying the US was willing “to facilitate the repatriation of foreign nationals … safely and securely”.Download original documentAustralia has undertaken two successful repatriation missions – of eight orphaned children in 2019, and of four women and 13 children in 2022 – but has consistently said it has “doesn’t have a plan” to repatriate the final cohort still held in the camps.In October, two women and four childrenescaped al-Hawl detention campnearer to Iraq, making their way across Syria to Lebanon, where they were given passports at the Australian embassy. They returned to Australia on a commercial flight. It’s unclear if there are any more Australians in al-Hawl camp.In 2024, Clare O’Neil as home affairs minister was preparing to bring a plan to repatriate the remaining Australians to cabinet for approval. But there were concerns within government overbacklash to any repatriationfrom community groups in electorally critical marginal seats in western Sydney, despite the fact many of those still held in Roj camp are from Victoria and seek to return there.“The government willnot revisit the issue before the next election,” a government source said, prior to this year’s May poll.The repatriation plan was delayed, and thenultimately abandoned.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was refused. There was no repatriation and no assistance.”Foster’s notes also record there were “drone attacks, less (sic) guards” at the camps, as well as “concern about getting through winter”.Download original documentDysentery outbreaks are common across Roj, and the latrines regularly back up during frigid winters, when temperatures drop well below freezing and snow sits on the ground. Influenza spreads quickly across populations living in close quarters in dilapidated tents, particularly among underdeveloped and undernourished children, and fires regularly break out in camp tents. Heating fuel is reportedly running low.One Australian child developed frostbitein a previous winter.Human Rights Watch has described “inhuman, degrading, and life-threatening conditions” in the camps, saying the indefinite detention of the women and children, without charge or trial, was unlawful.View image in fullscreenChildren walk among shelters at the al-Hol camp in August 2021.Photograph: Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty ImagesThe US, which funds the bulk of security operations across north-east Syria through the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and has assisted dozens of repatriation missions, wants to draw down its commitment from Syria.The Trump administration has cut$117m in US humanitarian assistanceto north-east Syria this year, forcing the shuttering of projects providing medical assistance, psychological support and safe spaces for children.The inspector general for the US’s Operation Inherent Resolve across Syria and Iraq reported that IS “continues to seek to indoctrinate residents and toinfiltrate the detention facilities” at Roj. One IS incursion caused the death of a woman and a child.The commander of US Central Command, Adm Brad Cooper,told a UN conferencein September “as time goes on, these camps are incubators for radicalisation”.“This problem will only get worse with time … inaction is not an option. Every day without repatriation compounds the risk to all of us.”Cooper called on “every nation with detained or displaced personnel in Syria to return your citizens”.“Repatriating vulnerable populations before they are radicalised is not just compassion – it is a decisive blow against Isis’s ability to regenerate,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAustralian politicsTony BurkeIslamic StatenewsShareReuse this content"

The initial draft plan, which was reportedly developed by Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the Kremlin adviser Kirill Dmitriev, would have forced draconian measures on Ukraine that would have givenRussiaunprecedented control over the country’s military and political sovereignty, conditions that were seen as a surrender by Kyiv.The peace plan was significantlyamendedby Ukraine last month, removing some of Russia’s maximalist demands. Though for now, the conflict continues. On Friday night, Russia launched a drone and missile attack on Ukraine’s power and transport infrastructure.The Ukrainian military said Russia hadlaunched 653 dronesand 51 missiles on Ukraine overnight. Ukrainian forces downed 585 drones and 30 missiles, the military said.Zelensky has said Ukraine’s energy infrastructure was the main target for hundreds of Russian drones and about 50 missiles, with Ukrainian officials accusing Moscow of seeking to “weaponise” the cold by denying civilians access to heat and power.Meanwhile, US and Ukrainian officials will conduct a third day of talks in Florida as Trump’s administration pushes Kyiv to accept an American-backed peace plan.The Russian president,Vladimir Putin, has already rejected some parts of the plan, with Ukraine’s territorial integrity and measures to deter future Russian attacks proving big sticking points for Moscow.Starmer has repeatedly stressed that Ukraine must determine its own future, and said the coalition of the willing’s peacekeeping force would play a “vital role” in guaranteeing the country’s security.The Ukraine peace deal has stumbled yet again over an inevitable obstacle: PutinRead moreIn its new national security strategy, published overnight on Saturday, the White House said it was committed to Ukraine’s survival as a “viable state”. But the strategy also prioritised improving relations with Moscow, stating that ending the war is a core US interest to “re-establish strategic stability with Russia”.​On Saturday evening, Zelenskyy said he had held a “very substantive and constructive” call with the US envoys Witkoff andJared Kushner.“Ukraine is committed to continuing to work honestly with the American side to bring about real peace,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram. “We agreed on the next steps and the format of the talks with America.”Zelenskyy, who was in Kyiv, joined the call with the senior Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov, and Andriy Gnatov, the chief of staff of Kyiv’s armed forces, both of whom were in Miami for the talks with the US side.The two Americans – Witkoff and Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law – had been in talks with Umerov and Gnatov since Thursday.Zelenskyy said the call with Witkoff and Kushner “focused on many aspects and quickly discussed key issues that could guarantee an end to the bloodshed and remove the threat of a third Russian invasion, as well as the threat of Russia failing to fulfil its promises, as has happened many times in the past”.He said he was waiting a “detailed report” from Umerov and Gnatov.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeKeir StarmerVolodymyr ZelenskyyEmmanuel MacronFriedrich MerzRussianewsShareReuse this content"

There was a bit more to it than that, but from Prague to Panama City, his scrunched contours were instantly recognisable, expressed in an exuberant parade of buildings that cranked and slumped as if hit by a wrecking ball, or crashed and whirled like dervishes, defying laws of gravity and structural logic. Though Gehry, who has died aged 96, came of age in the era of modernism, it was as if he were physically incapable of drawing a straight line.In his prime, Gehry’s architecture was a rebuff to modernist imperators such as Mies van der Rohe and his po-faced injunction, “less is more”. The American postmodern theorist and architectRobert Venturiturned it on its head, quipping “less is a bore”. It summed up the maximalist Gehry perfectly.As the millennium loomed, he changed the game with his 1997 design for an outpost of the Guggenheim modern art empire in the unfashionable northern Spanish city of Bilbao. Grappling with post-industrial decline, its unlikely recovery was catalysed by a building of exhilarating complexity sheathed in an epidermis of 33,000 wafer-thin sheets of titanium that shimmered like rippling fish scales. With gallery spaces as expressive as the works they were designed to house, this was no neutral backdrop for art.View image in fullscreenExhilarating: Athletic Bilbao fans in front of Gehry’s Guggenheim Museum wait to celebrate when their team appears on the Nervión estuary in Bilbao, Spain.Photograph: Álvaro Barrientos/APSet on a prominent waterfront site on the River Nervión, the Guggenheim became an instant icon, propelling Gehry, then in his late 60s, into the “starchitect” firmament, an epithet he affected to despise. And as its backers had hoped, it also transformed Bilbao’s wider civic fortunes, attracting 1.3 million visitors in its first year and begetting the “Bilbao effect”, which became shorthand for uplift through cultural tourism predicated on “iconic” architecture.Bilbao was followed by the 2003 Walt Disney concert hall in Gehry’s adopted home town ofLos Angeles, conceived as a clutch of stainless steel-clad volumes resembling billowing sails or giant metal shavings. He had urged his client to use stone, but they wanted a Bilbao. The timber-lined auditorium was warm and intimate, akin to being inside a musical instrument. Even the organ bore Gehry’s imprimatur, its scrum of pipes like a box of exploding french fries. For Gehry, whose family had relocated to Los Angeles from his birthplace of Toronto when he was 17, it represented the culmination of a long and formative relationship with the city.View image in fullscreenNo Mickey Mouse affair: early morning sunshine illuminates the Walt Disney concert hall in Los Angeles.Photograph: Nick Ut/APThe dynamic forms of his buildings were achieved through an ingenious yet laborious modus operandi involving the creation, in the first instance, of handbuilt models. These were then digitised using computer software capable of modelling complex curves, originally designed for use in the aerospace industry. Sculpture, in effect, became architecture, always striving for effect. Anything was possible.As computers liberated form-making, architecture became increasingly – and often preposterously – uninhibited. Throughout the 90s and 00s, architects and their patrons strove to outdo each other, with Gehry leading the charge, through projects such as the Dancing House in Prague, nicknamed “Fred and Ginger”, where a pair of disparate towers conjoin in a twirling, balletic embrace, and the Jay Pritzker pavilion in Chicago’s Millennium Park, an outdoor amphitheatre framed by a halo of torqued stainless steel ribbons.View image in fullscreenCutting a rug: the Dancing House in Prague, designed by the Croatian-Czech architect Vlado Milunić in collaboration with Frank Gehry.Photograph: NurPhoto/GettyBut as time wore on, in the effort to emulate the success of Bilbao, Gehry became fixated with chasing ill-conceived museum projects around the world. Extending its purview to the Middle East, in 2006 the Guggenheim commissioned him to produce an Abu Dhabi satellite, which has been dogged by delays and is slated to open only next year, two decades after its conception. “It was suggested that the huge budgets had raced past a clear idea of what the building would mean culturally or even what kind of artwork it would hold,” wrote Christopher Hawthorne in the Los Angeles Times.Seattle’s over-egged Experience Music Project (since 2016 known as the Museum of Pop Culture) proved a wincing disappointment, while the 2014 Fondation Louis Vuitton inParis, designed to accommodate the collection of French business magnate and art collector Bernard Arnault, is a bloated car crash, with some appallingly shoddy workmanship. By then, Gehry was also designing luggage, yachts and cognac bottles, a side hustle that began more prosaically with furniture made from layers of corrugated cardboard.View image in fullscreenHandbag house: Gehry’s Fondation Louis Vuitton building in Paris received mixed reviews.Photograph: Ian Langsdon/EPASuch late-career hubris was a long way from the project that first made his name, his own house in Santa Monica, California, a two-storey pink stucco dwelling which he bought in 1977 and then proceeded to eviscerate and augment by collaging in bits of corrugated metal and chain-link fencing. “I was trying to use the dumb, normal materials of the neighbourhood,” he said at the time. Imbued with an edgy, gritty populism, his early work drew parallels with the art practice of Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns.LA provided the scope and momentum for experimentation as Gehry gradually found his rhythm in a frontier town of sprawl and ad-hocism. Revelling in exaggerated geometries and juxtapositions, a 1980 house for film-maker Jane Spiller featured a plywood interior encased in a carapace of corrugated metal. Where the timber sporadically broke through the external walls “the house felt like the architectural equivalent of a couple quarrelling in the kitchen”, wrote the American architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff.Though Gehry built extensively inEurope, especially in Germany, with housing towers in Düsseldorf slouching like dissipated drunks, and a design museum for the Vitra furniture campus, which marked his transition from industrial bricolage to more poised, sculptural spectacle, the UK proved more resistant to his charms.View image in fullscreenSurprisingly simple: Gehry’s first UK project, a Maggie’s Centre in Dundee, for people undergoing cancer treatment.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianIn 2003 he designed a Maggie’s Centre for the Ninewells hospital in Dundee, part of a network of drop-in centres for those affected by cancer. Surprisingly sober and simple, it’s modelled on a traditional Scottish “but and ben” dwelling, with a white cottage topped by a folded metal roof, like a piece of origami.From Bilbao to Las Vegas: Frank Gehry’s incredible architecture – in picturesRead moreLatterly, he was involved in terraforming the environs around Battersea power station, designing silos of luxury housing that for all their cleverness feel distinctly formulaic. He was also invited to devise a Serpentine pavilion, London’s annual architecturalfête d’été,reconceptualising it as a whirlwind in a lumber yard.In a career that spanned 60 years, Gehry became a quintessential grand old man of architecture, apt, on occasion, to yell at clouds, as the world changed around him. At a 2014 press conference inSpain, on the occasion of him being garlanded with yet another award, when accused of designing “spectacle architecture”, he silently flipped his audience the finger. He later apologised. He also declared that: “In the world we live in 98% of what is built and designed today is pure crap. There’s no sense of design, no respect for humanity, just damn buildings.”Explore more on these topicsFrank GehryArchitectureSpainMuseumsEuropeLos AngelesParisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Warning sirens also sounded in parts of eastern Poland, close to the Ukrainian border.At least three people were injured in the attacks in Kyiv region, while the national energy operator, Ukrenergo, said much of the overnight attack had targeted power stations and other energy infrastructure.Russiahas been relentlessly attacking Ukraine’s energy capabilities in recent weeks, in the hope of cutting supplies of heat, light and water as the country prepares for a fourth winter of full-scale conflict.Ukraine mapRussia’s defence ministry said it had shot down 116 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory, while there were unconfirmed reports on Telegram that Ukraine had hit an oil refinery in the city of Ryazan.

The group has repeatedly rejected the proposition.Hamas said on Saturday that it was ready to hand over its weapons in the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian authority on the condition that the Israeli army’s occupation ends.“Our weapons are linked to the existence of the occupation and the aggression,” Hamas’s chief negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said in a statement.“If the occupation ends, these weapons will be placed under the authority of the state,” he added.Under theplan endorsed by the UNin November, Israel is to withdraw from its positions, Gaza is to be administered by a transitional governing body known as the “Board of Peace”, and an international stabilisation force is to be deployed.“We need to deploy this force as soon as possible on the ground because one party, which is Israel, is every day violating the ceasefire,” Egypt’s foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, said at the Doha Forum.The Egyptian foreign ministry said Abdelatty and Sheikh Mohammed met on Saturday, with both stressing “the importance of continuing efforts to implement” the peace agreement.Arab and Muslim nations, however, have been hesitant to participate in the new force, which could end up fighting Palestinian militants.Trump would theoretically chair the “Board of Peace”, while the identities of the other members have yet to be announced.Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, told the forum that talks on the stabilisation force were continuing, with critical questions remaining as to its command structure and which countries would contribute.Fidan said its first goal “should be to separate Palestinians from the Israelis”.Abdelatty seconded the idea, calling for the force to be deployed along “the yellow line in order to verify and to monitor” the truce.There have been many deadly incidents of Israeli forces firing on Palestinians in the vicinity of the yellow line since the ceasefire went into effect.Turkey, also a guarantor of the truce, has indicated it wants to take part in the stabilisation force, but its efforts are viewed unfavourably in Israel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tampering with the deal “and seeking other agreements such as a demilitarised zone ... could lead us to a dangerous place with unknown consequences”.Israel’s forces pushed into a UN-patrolled buffer zone in the occupied Golan Heights after the fall of Bashar al-Assad a year ago and conduct regular incursions deeper into Syria. The level of insecurity for Syrians in the region south of Damascus is increasing.Since he took power a year ago, Sharaa insisted he had been sending “positive messages to Israel regarding regional peace and stability”.He also said Israel “extrapolates” its conflict with Hamas militants and justifies aggression in the name of security. “Israel has become a country that is in a fight against ghosts,” he said.“They justify everything using their security concerns and they take 7 October and extrapolate it to everything that has happened around them.” Israel had become a country that exports crises, he added.Sharaa said: “Israel responded to Syria with extreme violence, launching more than 1,000 airstrikes and carrying out 400 incursions into its territory. The latest of these attacks was the massacre it committed in the town of Beit Jinn in the Damascus countryside, which claimed dozens of lives.”He said that Syria was working with “influential” countries to pressure Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories. “There are negotiations with Israel, and the US is involved with us in these negotiations, and all countries support our demand for its withdrawal to the pre-8 December borders.”It’s not just Gaza. From the West Bank to Syria and Lebanon, Israel’s onslaught continues | Nesrine MalikRead moreDonald Trump issued a warning last week to Israel to co-operate with the Syrian president, suggesting he does not welcome the Israeli incursions inside Syria.Sharaa said the demand for a demilitarised zone raised many questions for Syria, chiefly, “who will protect this zone if there is no presence of the Syrian army?”Israel says it fears terrorist groups linked to Hamas or that Sharaa will invade Israel unless there is a firm buffer zone. Israel has seized the 400 sq km (155 sq miles) of demilitarised buffer zone in southern Syria.Sharaa, who has spent time in US jails inside Iraq, was given a rock-star welcome at the conference. He stressed that “any agreement must guarantee Syria’s interests, as it is Syria that is subjected to Israeli attacks”.Sharaa insisted: “Syria is a developed country”, pointing to the recent People’s Assembly elections. The pollshave been criticised as biased in favour of the country’s interim leaders.Sharaa said the polls had been conducted “in a manner that is appropriate for the transitional phase”, adding, “the people choosing who governs them is a fundamental principle”.“We do not link the building of Syria to individuals but to institutions, and this is the biggest challenge in the transitional phase that we are going through.”He promised full elections in four years and said women had nothing to fear in Syria. It was the men that needed to worry, he said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaGazanewsShareReuse this content"

The building was defaced with stickers such as “I love the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]”, according to images captured by security cameras.The embassyhad its flag-raising ceremonyon 22 September after Britain’s recognition of the Palestinian state. The building had before then served as the Palestinian mission to the UK. Despite the change of status, which has given it a higher profile, there has been no change in security arrangements and there are fears for the safety of staff.View image in fullscreenZomlot said: ‘To those responsible, we clearly say your actions will not deter us. We will continue to advance Palestine-UK relations.’Photograph: PalMissionUK/XAnother demonstration was planned for Friday with a Facebook post stating: “A hardcore group of Zionists have decided it’s time for direct action to challenge the haters and give them a taste of their own medicine. Bring your union jack and Israeli flags and your megaphones.”Zomlot said: “To those responsible, we clearly say your actions will not deter us. We will continue to advance Palestine-UK relations and defend the rights and lives of the Palestinian people.“We have formally requested the British authorities to provide immediate and comprehensive protection for the embassy and our personnel from such attacks. We call on them to investigate this incident fully and hold those responsible accountable for this incident and other incidents.”In 2023, when it was still the Palestinian mission, staff reported four attacks in a matter of weeks, including vandalism. They also said there had been death threats. The officials said the failure to provide diplomatic protection had been “inexplicable and unacceptable”.According to pictures posted by the embassy, further stickers left by the group last Saturday included “Anti-Zionism is racism” and one with the star of David superimposed over the union jack with the slogan: “We are not Jews trembling at the knees.”View image in fullscreenThe building was defaced with stickers such as ‘I love the IDF’, the embassy said, and produced images captured by security cameras last Saturday.Photograph: PalMissionUK/XUnder article 22 ofthe Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, a host state is “under a special duty to take all appropriate steps to protect the premises of the mission against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of the mission or impairment of its dignity”.The embassy described last Saturday’s incident as “a flagrant breach of diplomatic laws and customs and the rules of international law”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many have no police presence but some, such as the Israeli embassy, have enhanced protection from specialist officers. The Palestinian embassy falls into the first category, despite Middle East tensions continuing after the fragile ceasefire inGaza.A Metropolitan police spokesperson said: “We take the security and safety of the diplomatic community extremely seriously. Security arrangements at diplomatic premises, overseen by the Met’s parliamentary and diplomatic protection command, are based on an assessment of risk and are constantly reviewed.”Explore more on these topicsLondonPalestineIsraelGazaForeign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They were just young boys, aged nine and 10 and, after all, a ceasefire had been declared inGaza.Their mother, Hala Abu Assi, was making tea in the family’s tent in Khan Younis when she heard an explosion, a missile fired by an Israeli drone. She ran to the scene – but it was too late.Since the US-brokered ceasefire was announced on 10 October, Israeli forces have killed more than 360 Palestinians in Gaza; according to a UN official, at least 70 are children – like Jumaa and Fadi.View image in fullscreenA mourner holds up a phone picturing Jumaa and Fadi Abu Assi at the boys’ funeral on 29 November.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThey were killed, their mother said, at “a time when bloodshed was supposed to stop”.“After the ceasefire was announced, I felt a bit of safety and believed that nothing would harm my children any more,” Abu Assi said. “But fate had another plan.”She is focused now on keeping her two surviving daughters alive. “I still hear explosions and gunfire,” she said. “I do not feel that the war has ended.”The toll from Israeli attacks in Gaza has fallen significantly compared with the preceding two years of war, when on average 90 Palestinians were killed each day, but significant numbers of civilians are still losing their lives.On average, Israeli weapons now kill seven people a day. That rate of violent death would be considered an active conflict in many other contexts, raising questions about how accurately “ceasefire” describes the new status quo.View image in fullscreenTents burn in Khan Younis on 3 December in an Israeli strike that killed five people, including two children, in violation of the ceasefire.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“It’s something that if you want to you can call a ceasefire, which is very convenient for the Americans and for everyone who wants this off their television screens and off their streets and off their annoying parliamentary and political schedules,” said Daniel Levy, a former Israeli negotiator and the president of the US/Middle East Project.“It is very convenient for Israel. The pressure is off and they have smashed the whole place up, and can still kill as they please.”Amnesty International has allegedthat Israel is still committing genocide in Gaza and that the use of the term ceasefire “risks creating a dangerous illusion that life in Gaza is returning to normal”.Chart on Gaza deathsThe Israeli military has made clear it is still operating a shoot-to-kill policy around its positions. It acknowledged the drone strike on Jumaa and Fadi Abu Assi, describing the two young boys collecting wood to feed and warm their family as “suspects” who threatened Israeli soldiers.‘Yellow line’ hardensLike many of those killed under the ceasefire, the young brothers were targeted for approaching the “yellow line” to which the army has withdrawn under the truce. It now bifurcates Gaza, giving Israel the lion’s share. In the original ceasefire map Israel would continue to occupy 53% of the Gaza Strip, but the Israeli army unilaterally expanded that to 58% when it laid down markers to delineate its territory.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian woman and her children trudge through the rubble on 21 November after being displaced again by the Israeli army’s expansion of its ‘yellow line’.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThis division is Gaza’s new reality, with the US military preparing for anindefinite partitioninto what it calls a “green zone” under Israeli and international military control, where reconstruction would start, and a “red zone” to be left in ruins.According to a geographical analysis by Forensic Architecture, the great bulk of Gaza’s fertile farmland is in Israeli hands, while the population is mostly confined to the barren coastal sand dunes, the “red zone”.The ceasefire proposals put forward by Donald Trump, enshrined in large part in aUN security council resolutionlast month, imagined further steps after the first-phase hostage and prisoner exchange and the pullback to the “yellow line”.Israeli forces are supposed to continue to withdraw, to be replaced by an international stabilisation force (ISF) overseen by a “peace board” chaired by Trump, with other world leaders of his choosing, with a technocratic Palestinian committee to conduct day-to-day governance.However, these phases, even more difficult to agree than the initial halt to fighting, were left purposefully vague and remain just as hazy two months on.Israel has been adamant there can be no progress from the first phase until all the bodies of hostages killed during the war are returned and Hamas is disarmed.Hamas has found and returned all but one of the bodies and has said it is prepared to discuss handover of offensive weapons, such as rocket launchers and rockets, but not to Israel or any Israeli-backed entity.The UN resolution in November suggested the ISF could lead the disarmament, but none of the countries supposed to be contributing troops, such as Indonesia, Azerbaijan or Pakistan, are willing to send soldiers to take weapons from Hamas against its will.A EU-sponsored training programme for Palestinian police involving recruits from Gaza and the West Bank, which was under way in Egypt and Jordan before the ceasefire, is due to be expanded. But without a governing authority for Gazait is uncertain who would direct such a force, and Israel has made clear it will not countenance anything with a Palestinian national character.Against this backdrop of uncertainty and delay, there are growing signs that the “yellow line” is hardening into something more permanent, a partition of Gaza.The army has been building concrete outposts along the “yellow line”, creating new free-fire areas around them. On the Israeli-occupied side of the line, the army has continued to flatten Palestinian neighbourhoods wrecked by the war, despite the Trump plan’s commitment to reconstruction.What will rise in their place, if anything, is unclear. Israel has indicated it will allow construction only in the “green zone” it occupies, and plans developed by the US government and military envisage scattered fenced camps, rather than rebuilding Palestinian communities.Referred to as “alternative safe communities” (ASCs), they would be little more than refugee camps, with Palestinians living in prefabricated units or repurposed shipping containers, with shared community toilets and showers.Residents would be vetted to exclude any Palestinian who had been paid by Hamas even in a civilian role, or who had a relative, including cousins, aunts and uncles, who had been on any Hamas payroll.It is not clear if those who moved to the Israeli-controlled areas would be allowed to cross back to the western zone of Gaza.Several humanitarian organisations and European countries have refused to take part in planning for ASCs, on the grounds the project could break international law. They fear the ASCs could be used as a tool of coercive displacement, and exploit civilian needs to pursue military goals.The US is also ignoring basic issues such as land ownership, said Amjad Iraqi, the senior analyst for Israel and Palestine at theInternational Crisis Group. “American officials coming in with this sort of blank slate approach, that you just can sort of reconstruct things from scratch as if nothing existed before, no houses or no communities or no land registrations in the areas. It breaks every international law in the book,” Iraqi said.Even if the US does push ahead with a pilot ASC planned for Rafah, the project will do almost nothing to ease the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza.Mountains of rubble dotted with unexploded bombs must be cleared before construction can start and even the most optimistic timeline allows for six months’ work before the first Palestinians move in, sources briefed on the plans said.When completed it would house only 25,000 people, barely 1% of Gaza’s population.Locked in dire conditionsMeanwhile, the ceasefire deal as it stands leaves Gaza’s remaining 2.2 million Palestinians hemmed into just 42% of their former territory, and locked into dire conditions.View image in fullscreenAn encampment of displaced Palestinians in northern Gaza City on 30 November.Photograph: APAImages/ShutterstockPalestinians are by no means safe from Israeli strikes, many of which have been in “relocation areas” set aside for them, according to the Forensic Architecture analyst group.Nine in 10 Palestinians in Gaza are without homes, which have been reduced to ruins. The latest satellite data suggests 81% of dwellings have been destroyed or severely damaged by Israeli bombardment. Most live in tents, vulnerable to the coming winter.Two heavy downpours in Novemberflooded Gaza’s tented camps, washing away hundreds ,if not thousands, of shelters. In the most recent deluge, on 25 November, tents in Deir al-Balah collapsed under the pressure of water pouring in from all directions. Some people tried digging channels to divert the water away, while most stayed huddled in their tents. Much of the flood water came from overflowing sewage pits nearby.View image in fullscreenA woman attempts to clear filthy sludge out of her family’s tent after heavy rain.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“We are very concerned about water-borne diseases given the dire hygiene situation and lack of sufficient sanitation. We are concerned that diseases like cholera could appear if the situation doesn’t improve as soon as possible,” said Jonathan Crickx, spokesperson for the UN child protection agency, Unicef, inPalestine. “There’s been a significant spike in acute watery diarrhoea over the past four weeks affecting children above five.”Food supplies in Gaza have increased since the declaration of the ceasefire. Aid deliveries have gone up from an average of 91 trucks a day in the month before the 10 October truce, to 133 a day in the following month.A reduction in looting also makes it easier for aid groups to reach the most vulnerable people. Before the ceasefire, most aid was stolen by gangs or desperate Palestinians before reaching its destination.Chart on aid truck deliveriesAt the same time, non-UN shipments, including commercial supplies and deliveries from Arab countries, have increased at a faster rate. According to World Food Programme figures, commercial shipments have nearly quadrupled from 37 trucks a day in September to 144 trucks daily in the first week of November.The influx of commercial goods has reduced prices in markets from the astronomical levels of the war. Flour in the Deir al-Balah market costs four shekels (93p) a kg, a kg of sugar is five shekels (£1.16), a single egg four shekels, and a chicken 35 shekels (£8.11). A tent costs between 1,000 and 2,000 shekels (£231 to £462).But even these prices are beyond the vast majority of Palestinians, who have exhausted their savings after two years without work and now rely on aid.Chart on commercial truck flowHowever, the total inflow of goods remains below the prewar average of 600 trucks a day, while the needs of the population have increased exponentially, as the war has robbed almost all Palestinians of shelter, their livelihoods, schools and hospitals.“We’re not seeing major increases in the scope of stuff that is coming in,” said Sam Rose, the acting director for Gaza for Unrwa, the UN relief agency serving Palestinians in the region.Unrwa is by far the biggest aid agency in Gaza, but has been banned by Israel, which claims some of its 13,000 employees in the territory took part in the October 2023 attack on Israel that ignited the war.View image in fullscreenThe price of food has dropped since its peak, but items at the Deir al-Balah market are still out of reach of most Palestinians.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesWorld risks being complicitEuropean and Arab states justified their support for the Trump proposals at the UN resolution that codified them as a way to keep the US engaged in peace efforts and to give his proposed steps some form of legitimacy – and at least a nod towards some future Palestinian state.They have rationalised their involvement in the Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC) along similar lines, pointing to modest improvements in aid deliveries in the hope of containing the threat of famine.The CMCC, established in a warehouse in Kiryat Gat, southern Israel, is staffed by the Israeli and US militaries along with liaison officers from other countries backing the ceasefire. There is no Palestinian representation.Observers warn European and Arab states as well as aid agencies that without significant advances in the peace process, the CMCC risks being complicit with the Israeli military in a status quo that keeps Palestinians in inhuman conditions, and in schemes such as the ASC plan, in contravention of humanitarian law.“An army that has just committed a genocide has 30, 40 other militaries now collaborating with it in its back yard,” Daniel Levy said.Rose said: “There’s not as much international outrage and pressure directed towards Israel these days, but the fact is that people are living in miserable conditions and continue to be killed in spite of the ceasefire.“Palestinians are being confronted with these multiple possible futures over which they have zero control. So that element of helplessness, psychological torture and cruelty they’ve endured for the past two years – that persists.”Faiq al-Sakani has nowhere to take his family of nine other than the wrecked shell of their home in Gaza City’s Tuffah district, about 500 metres from the “yellow line”. For the 37-year-old, no day is without anxiety that his children could die.“The situation is extremely tense. Every day, we hear the sounds of tanks moving, firing shells, and shooting in all directions,” he said on Thursday. “Just yesterday, a group of my relatives was directly targeted in the area; three of them were killed, and several others were critically injured.”“It feels as if the war is still ongoing and there has been no ceasefire,” Sakhani added. “It is unbearable; there is no sign of normal life at all.”"

He called the peer’s defection “a brave and historic act”.The Reform leader addressed the rally after a turbulent week which saw him launch a tirade against the BBC for questioning him about the Guardian’s investigation into alleged racist and antisemitic behaviour as a teenager towards fellow Dulwich college pupils.But Farage dodged the expected press huddle after Saturday’s event. Asked why his new party’s leader was not available to answer mounting allegations about his past behaviour, Offord said: “You’ll need to ask him that question.”Pressed on whether he believed Farage should apologise for his alleged remarks towards Jewish pupils,as a group of Holocaust survivors told the Guardian he ought to, Offord said: “I think that’s something he’ll need to consider with his own advisers.”Offord insisted that Farage was “morally fit” to be prime minister and denied he was employing dog-whistle politics. During his speech Farage had doubled down on his remarks about the number of Glasgow schoolchildren who speak English as a second language by asking the rally: “Who voted for the wholesale change of the population of Glasgow?”.Although the first minister, John Swinney, condemnedFarage’s original remarks about the “cultural smashing” of Glasgowas “racist”, and Keir Starmer called them “toxic and divisive”, Offord maintained that Farage was “highlighting a factual issue that people are talking about on the doorstep”.The event, attended by an energetic and enthused crowd of largely male, white and middle-aged supporters who each paid £6 to attend, highlights the party’s growing confidence before next May’s elections to the Scottish parliament.Although the SNP continues to lead in the polls,Reform UKhas gained significant ground in the past year, securing 26% of the vote in its first Holyrood byelection test in June. After the collapse in support for Scottish Labour since last year’s general election, Reform has regularly pushed it into third place in recent months, polling up to 22%.Announcing that Reform UK membership inScotlandhad quadrupled in the past year to a running total of 12,000, the party chair, David Bull, said he believed it could gain up to 20 MSPs in May, putting the party in “a very strong position” at Holyrood. Bull also announced, to whoops, that the party was having its own tartan made.Thomas Kerr, one of Reform’s 19 Scottish councillors, prompted a roar of approval as he described Farage as “Britain’s next prime minister”. He told supporters to “man the barricades as we take on the political establishment”, warning that “the next five months will be tough”.Although the party has yet to produce any Scotland-specific policies, speakers from the north-east pledged Reform would “take on the green blob and the net-zero grifters”.Farage himself underlined his delight at the party’s emergence as a force inScottish politicsover the past 12 months, admitting to the audience that in previous years he had been warned he “wouldn’t get 20 people in a room”.

The mood in Falkirk is a mix between absolute sadness, shock, frustration that the authorities are not speaking up.”They added that their local Reform UK councillor was the only local politician “not scared to speak the truth”.The group coordinating protests against the Cladhan, Save our Futures & Our Kids Futures, said it was galvanised by the rape of a local teenager by an Afghan asylum seeker.In an interview withthe Guardian published on Saturday, Swinney warned that “what the far right do is to apportion the blame … to asylum seekers or migrants and I think that is the root of the poison that Farage and his cohorts are spreading within Scotland”.He also made a clear distinction, however, between those who hold far-right views and people with “legitimate points” about pressure on local services or community safety, which he noted were not unique to areas where migrants were housed.Explore more on these topicsReform UKHouse of LordsConservativesNigel FarageScotlandScottish politicsJohn SwinneynewsShareReuse this content"

It described being caught in the system as like being “at the whim of a faceless machine”.The review, by the disability rights expert Liz Sayce, concluded that senior DWP leaders had for a decade failed to grip or fix problems with the benefit, despite repeated warnings by whistleblowers, auditors and MPs.Couling’s post said one of the main causes of overpayments was as a result of the DWP’s “rather byzantine” guidance on the averaging of carer’s earnings. But he suggests these overpayments ultimately occurred because individual carers failed to report fluctuations in their earnings that breached benefit rules.“Incidentally what has been missed in all the [media] coverage is that this error (and hands up we made it and we will put it right) affects only a relatively small number of cases and wasn’t the cause of the original complaint. Because at the heart of the overpayment issues in CA [carer’s allowance] is a failure to report changes of circumstances,” Couling wrote.This is at odds with the government’s own position, which accepts the DWP itself was the main cause of overpayments because of its confusing guidance and unclear reporting processes.Kirsty McHugh, the chief executive ofCarersTrust, said: “This seems to be a really serious error of judgment. There has been an independent review which came up with some very clear findings. The DWP must now stand by this report and get on with returning money to carers.”View image in fullscreenThe Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, said he was ‘disgusted’ by Neil Couling’s blogpost.Photograph: House of Commons/UK Parliament/PAThe Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, said: “I’m disgusted by this blogpost as it shows some senior DWP people have learned nothing about the scale of the misery their policies and procedures inflicted. It’s high time the DWP showed some respect to carers and some awareness of their own gross errors.”Emily Holzhausen, the director of policy at Carers UK, said: “To say that the heart of the matter is claimants’ fault for not reporting changes in circumstances is missing the point entirely. The root cause of this is a confusing, complex and difficult to navigate system, which has caused numerous errors.”The government-commissioned Sayce review was ordered after anaward-winning Guardian investigationrevealed howunpaid carers had been unfairly hitwith draconian penalties of as much as £20,000 after unwittingly running up overpayments of carer’s allowance benefit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It estimates about 200,000 cases will be reviewed, with 26,000 likely to have debts cancelled or reduced.Last week, Sir Peter Schofield apologised to MPs for what ministers have called a “mess” inherited from the previous government: “I am sorry for all of those who are affected by this, but I am going to sort it out,” Schofield said.Six years ago, Schofieldrefused three times to apologise to MPsover carer’s allowance failures. Although he then promised to fix the overpayment problem, 180,000 carers ran up debts of £300m on his watch between 2019 and 2025, roughly one in five of all claimants, of whom 854 were convicted of fraud.A DWP spokesperson said: “We have been clear, and remain of the view, that we accept the vast majority of recommendations put forward in the Sayce review, including that confusing rules on averaging earnings left carers facing unexpected debts.“That’s why we are tackling this issue and have already put in place extra staff to prevent carers building up large debts, updated internal guidance, and ensure letters to unpaid carers clearly explain what changes need reporting.“And we will continue putting things right and rebuilding trust by reassessing affected cases, and potentially reducing, cancelling or refunding debts for tens of thousands of carers.”Explore more on these topicsCarersBenefitsSocial careCivil servicenewsShareReuse this content"

It said custard and apple crumble was flung at the case, which contained the imperial state crown.Scotland Yard said: “Four protesters have been arrested following criminal damage at the Tower of London. Police were called at 09.48hrs on Saturday 6 December to the Tower of London following reports of criminal damage to a display case, containing the state crown.“It was reported that four protesters threw suspected food on to the case before two left the scene. Officers worked closely with City of London police and security officers and four people have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. They have been taken into custody.”The Tower of London, one of the capital’s most popular tourist attractions, was partially closed to the public while the police investigation continued. It reopened later on Saturday afternoon. “The crown jewels have not been damaged,” Historic Royal Palaces said.Take Back Power said it carried out the stunt to demand the UK government establishes a permanent citizens’ assembly – a “House of the People” – with the power to “tax extreme wealth and fix Britain”.Footage shared by the group showed one demonstrator removing the large foil tray of crumble from a bag and slamming it against the glass protecting the crown. Another repeatedly poured a tub of bright yellow custard on the front of the case.The demonstrators then opened their coats to show their T-shirt slogans reading “Take Back Power”, before one shouted “democracy has crumbled” and another shouted: “Britain is broken. We’ve come here to the jewels of the nation to take back power.”The group released a statement, in which it named one of the activists as 19-year-old Zahra Ali, a student from London. She said: “Our country is crumbling before our eyes. We have homeless people dying on the very streets that King Charles passed on his way to the coronation, whilst there are more empty homes than unhoused people in this country. It’s time the ultra-rich pay their fair share.”Surprised tourists could be seen reacting to the stunt, while a Tower of London worker approached, saying: “Excuse me, excuse me”, as she radioed for help.Initial reports suggested the whole of the site had been shut. The Metropolitan police later said only the Jewel House had closed, before Historic Royal Palaces issued a further update saying it had reopened.Explore more on these topicsLondonCrimeMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

She’s a danger to herself.Photograph: x.com/trusslizThe politics sketchLiz TrussBeware the Liz Truss chatshow: viewers will require survivor therapyJohn CraceSuperLiz reboots herself inside a utility room, delivering nonsense so pure even her guests look trappedSat 6 Dec 2025 08.34 ESTFirst published on Sat 6 Dec 2025 07.23 ESTShareWe happy few. We unlucky few. In years to come when we are all still recovering from post-traumatic stress disorder, we will be able to say we were there. That we have seen things that cannot be unseen. The 8,000 of us who, through a mixture of curiosity and comedy, chose towatch Liz Trusscommit a drive-by on herself. Though only a very few will have made it to the end.Some won’t have even made it to the start. The show started an hour late because Liz forgot to put her watch back in October. Still, this was an award-winningYouTubeTV show. Though not the awards anyone would want to collect.In January we were treated to the bizarre sight ofLiz Trusslive-tweeting the presidential inauguration from her hotel room in Washington. It had dawned on her too late that you actually needed an invitation to the Capitol and she wasn’t on anyone’s guest list. In hindsight, we can see this as a trial run.The Liz Truss Show review – hapless ravings from a cupboardRead moreFor her new Liz Truss Show, she appeared to have turned her utility room into a makeshift studio. No expense incurred. Though she did have someone to do the filming this time. Albeit a 12-year-old intern doped up on ketamine. I’ve seen better editing on my dad’s home movies from the 60s.We opened with a montage of Lizzy’s greatest hits. There she was beinggreeted by the queen at Balmoral. Huge mistake. She doesn’t seem to realise that the entire country holds her responsible for the queen’s death. The last photo we saw of the queen was of Truss being introduced to her on the Tuesday. Two days later she was dead. Case proved. It’s not hard to imagine the queen thinking: “You know what? It’s just not worth it any more. My first prime minister was Winston Churchill. Now it’s come to this …”Then Liz stared straight to camera and launched into a deranged diatribe. If it wasn’t obvious before, it is now clear her care in the community experiment has failed. She is a danger to herself. It’s almost painful to watch someone so lacking in any self-awareness. Her therapist is doing her no favours by letting her out into the wild.The message that Liz has taken from her 49 days in Downing Street is that the only reason she failed was because she wasn’t given long enough. She believes that deep down we all want more of her. Hell, she can’t even get a gig as a D-list wannabe on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!. Remembered less fondly than Matt Hancock.“Britain is going to hell in a handcart,” said Liz, sitting behind a makeshift bookcase containing the only copy ofTen Years to Save the Westthat hasn’t been pulped. The whole country was poorer than Mississippi. Yes, and who contributed most to that? Irony is not her strong point.Islamists were everywhere. The governing elite hated us and civil servants were all trans activists. But she was going to lead the counter revolution against the DEEP STATE. Five minutes in, I was already exhausted. You can’t buy this level of nonsense. Thankfully I didn’t have to. She made Elon Musk sound like the voice of reason on X.Next we came to Radon – “She’s a gas, but she’s inert” – Liz’s first special guest. Step forward Matt Goodwin, hot from the sewers of far-right conspiracy theories. Matt immediately went on to his favourite obsession. Foreigners. There were far too many of them. We were being betrayed by a self-loathing elite. Perhaps Matt would like to include himself in that. No one has ever knowingly see him smile.“I went into politics because I was a patriot,” said Liz. “I didn’t want open borders.” YES, YOU DID. During the EU referendum you were one of the politicianscampaigning loudest for remain. And you were a cabinet minister under Boris Johnson. Poor Lizzy. Her memory shot to pieces. By now, even Matt was looking queasy. Beginning to wonder if he had made a serious mistake by coming on a show hosted by a lunatic. And he had met many lunatics in his time.But Lizzy was on a roll. Or a slur. The longer she spoke the more her words rolled into one another. Must have been the benzodiazepines starting to kick in. ‘KeirStarrmeristhemostunpopularprimeministereverrrrr.’ No, Liz that was you.She sneered at the word compassionate. The Bank of England was full of Trotskyists. As were the police. It’s Britain, Matt, but not as you know it. The last word went to Matt. There were way too many foreigners. True Brits needed to have more babies. And we knew what he meant by True Brits. Not often the Great Replacement Theory gets an outing.Jumpy cut to the next guest. Peter McCormack, podcaster and bitcoin enthusiast whom I had never heard of. He was wearing a T-shirt with “Freedom” on the front. Maybe that was a cry for help. He too seemed to have no idea what he was doing there. Other than to say everything is a bit shit over and over again while Lizzy talked over him. Communists were too clever for their own good, she told us, before concluding that gen Z were going to rescue the country. Go for it. You have nothing to lose but your oat milk skinny lattes.That just left Alexandra Phillips, a rightwing talking head primarily remembered for having her GB News show cancelled in 2022. Since then she’s been on the same circuit as Goodwin. If anything, Alex hated Muslims even more than Matt. They came from a barbaric culture. Bournemouth was now a no-go area. A woman couldn’t walk down the sea front without the threat of being raped. It was the Muslims who were the real racists. Not the white Britons that hated them. Every single immigrant was a potential sex offender or terrorist. Liz nodded along eagerly. She couldn’t agree more. Though chiding her for being too woke.A final jump back to the bookcase where Lizzy was giving her closing speech to camera. The country was in terminal decline. But there was hope. And that hope was her. SuperLiz to the rescue. Until next week, she said. If there is a next week. Episode two is in the balance. Fingers crossed. Right now everyone who made it to the end is in a survivor’s therapy group. In years to come we will see her with her carer at the Cenotaph and say to ourselves: “Wasn’t she the woman who had her own chatshow that nobody watched?”Explore more on these topicsLiz TrussThe politics sketchYouTubeTelevisionRacecommentShareReuse this content"

The toxic wild mushrooms are often mistaken for edible ones because of their appearance and taste.“Death cap mushrooms contain potentially deadly toxins that can lead to liver failure,” Erica Pan, director of the California department of public health, said in a statement. “Because the death cap can easily be mistaken for edible safe mushrooms, we advise the public not to forage for wild mushrooms at all during this high-risk season.”One adult has died and several patients have required intensive care, including at least one who might need a liver transplant.Wet weather fuels the growth of death cap mushrooms, and officials warn against any wild mushroom foraging to avoid confusion. Residents in central California’s Monterey county became ill after eating mushrooms found in a local park, according to county health officials. Another cluster of cases were in the San Francisco Bay Area, but state health officials warned that the risk is everywhere.There were more than 4,500 cases of exposure to unidentified mushrooms logged at the US’sPoisonCenters in 2023, according to their National Poison Data System annual report. Roughly half were in young children, whom experts warn may pick and eat a mushroom while playing outside.California’s poison control system sees hundreds of cases of wild mushroom poisonings each year. The death cap mushroom and the destroying angel mushroom look and taste similar to edible mushrooms, so experts warn that a mushroom’s color is not a reliable way of detecting its toxicity. And whether it is eaten raw or cooked does not matter.People can have stomach cramping, nausea, diarrhea or vomiting within 24 hours after ingesting a toxic mushroom. Though gastrointestinal symptoms may improve, health officials warn that patients can still develop serious complications, including liver damage, that surface later.People looking for guidance on diagnosing or treating mushroom poisoning can contact the poison control hotline at (800) 222-1222.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaPoisonWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The Canadian-American architect, whodiedin his Los Angeles home at 96, designed a career around defying what was predictable and pulling in materials that were uncommon and, as such, relatively inexpensive.Gehry collaborated with artists to turn giant binoculars into an entryway of a commercial campus, and paid homage to a writer’s past as a lifeguard by creating a livable lifeguard tower. And while dreaming this up, he transformed American architecture along the way.Below, take a look at how his work wrapped around and shaped the neighborhoods and urban centers ofCalifornia.Walt Disney Concert HallView image in fullscreenThe Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles.Photograph: Buyenlarge/Getty ImagesWith its stainless steel waves rolling on a corner of Downtown Los Angeles, the Walt Disney Concert Hall has become an integral part of this urban center. Lillian Disney gifted the hall to the city and to pay tribute to her late husband’s commitment to the arts. Gehry built the music hallfrom the inside out, designing it around how music was to be heard within its walls with a team of acousticians.While the hall’s exterior has free-forming waves and Gehry’s touch of unconventional geometry, the interior is surprisingly symmetrical – an intentional contrast. “The reason I made Disney Hall symmetrical was because I knew that I was a very suspect architect for a building like that by the general public,” Gehry told the Getty. “Everybody is going to think I’m going to do a Thing. So I decided to give them a comfort zone.”Gehry houseView image in fullscreenThe Gehry residence in Santa Monica.Photograph: BDP/AlamyGehry pruned this Dutch colonial bungalow in Santa Monica down to its original wooden bones and, in 1978, built around it intricate layers of glass, exposed plywood, corrugated metal, and chain-link fencing. The home is considered one of his earliest works of deconstructivist architecture, with large tilting windows that allow the outside world to peer into the home’s internal, seemingly unfinished structure. Gehry continued to add to this residence until 1992.Binoculars BuildingView image in fullscreenThe Binoculars Building in Venice.Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/Getty ImagesFirst commissioned as a commercial office building in Venice for advertising agency Chiat/Day, this bold design has become one of Gehry’s most recognizable works inLos Angeles, thanks to its towering entryway that looks exactly like what it is: a giant pair of binoculars. This 44-foot feature was actually designed and created by his collaborators, artists Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen. Gehry designed the 79,000 sq ft campus to have a tree-like metal canopy facade on the south of the binoculars, with a bright-white ship-like exterior to the north. Google has occupied the building since 2011, though it is currently on sale for the first time in 30 years for an undisclosed price.Norton residenceView image in fullscreenThe Norton Residence in Venice.Photograph: Saulius T Kondrotas/AlamyWhen artists hire artists to design a home, places like the Norton residence pop into existence on Venice Beach’s famed Ocean Front Walk. Inspired by photos of his Santa Monica home, Lynn and William Norton, an artist and writer respectively, hired Gehry to bring this eclectic deconstructivist beachfront home to life in the 1980s. Gehry’s design plays with contrasting sizes of stucco and concrete boxes, heights and shapes, making chaos seem like a cohesive, colorful whole. At the forefront of the property is Gehry’s version of a lifeguard tower in the shape of a one-room studio standing on a single pillar, an apparent nod to William Norton’s former life as a lifeguard.Loyola Marymount University Law SchoolView image in fullscreenThe columns of Merrifield Hall on the Loyola Law School campus, and the facade of the South Instructional Building.Photograph: Roger Ressmeyer/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesGehry was chosen to redesign the law school for Loyola Marymount University in 1979 because, unlike other architects who presented plans for a big building, Gehry proposed a collection of smaller buildings designed around a plaza. Robert Benson, a member of the committee who selected Gehry’s design,saidthe committee “squabbled” with the architect over his strange but signature choice of materials and angles, including sheet metal-wrapped Roman columns, chainlink fences or the peculiar angling of a building. Gehry won most of the squabbles, as Benson recalls it, and the result is a village-like complex of contemporary buildings, bold shapes, bright yellows and at least one oversized chainlink structure.Explore more on these topicsFrank GehryLos AngelesCaliforniaArchitectureWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

He is being held at the Northwest ICE processing center, Murray said. She said Toledo-Martinez was detained in front of his wife and two young children, who are all US citizens – and she called for his immediate release.“Following the attack, Wilmer was left shaking and dizzy, and at one point his vision went black, yet he was denied medical care for hours,” Murray said.“He was eventually taken to a hospital, where he received stitches for his injuries.

Netflix inks deal for troubled Hollywood giantCallum Jonesin New YorkDavid Zaslav, CEO of Warner Bros Discovery, promised ‘everyone’ would win by combining the storied Hollywood studios with his reality TV giant. Instead, many lostSat 6 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 6 Dec 2025 08.01 ESTShareIt’s less than five years since David Zaslav, CEO ofWarner BrosDiscovery, negotiated what looked like the deal of his career. Now as Netflix plans a landscape-changing takeover of Warner Bros, he’s in the middle of an even bigger one.Zaslav, or Zaz, is a hard-charging, well-connected executive who cut his teeth inside NBC, and ascended into New York’s media elite as he transformed Discovery Inc from a nature- and science-focused cable broadcaster into a reality TV giant.But he elevated himself to moguldom in 2021, crafting a mega merger between Discovery, home to hit shows including 90 Day Fiancé​ and Naked and Afraid, with WarnerMedia, home to HBO, the premier cable channel; the CNN news network; and Warner Bros, the legendary movie studio behind hit movies from Harry Potter and The Dark Knight to Casablanca and The Exorcist.‘This merger must be blocked’: Netflix-Warner Bros deal faces fierce backlashRead moreSuch esteemed pillars of media are “better and more valuable together”, Zazclaimedas the plan for Warner Bros Discovery was unveiled. “It is super exciting to combine such historic brands, world-class journalism and iconic franchises under one roof and unlock so much value and opportunity.””We believe everyone wins,” he declared – promising great returns for Hollywood producers and stars; investors on Wall Street, and beyond; and fans and viewers around the world.It is now December 2025, 55 months after the tie-up was announced, and 44 months after it was sealed, and few feel as if they have won.Operators in Hollywood, promised “more resources and compelling pathways to larger audiences”, have endured cost cuts and a continued struggle to revitalize returns at the box office.Shareholders in Warner Bros Discovery, promised a “globally scaled growth company committed to a strong balance sheet”, have watched as its stock suffered steep market declines and its executives struggled to strengthen its balance sheet.And fans and viewers, promised “more diverse choices”, grappled with a streaming platform thatcouldn’t even decide on a name. While Barbie surged out of a distinctly mixed bag of Warner Bros cinematic releases since the merger, it had been in the worksfor yearsbefore Discovery came knocking.It’s hard to believe everyone has won, or that so much value and opportunity has been unlocked, although one man has done relatively well. As president and CEO of Warner Bros Discovery, Zaslav maintained his status as one of thebest-paid bossesin corporate America. Last year alone, his total pay package was worth $51.9m.Warner Bros, founded more than a century ago, has been subjected to more than its fair share of Wall Street deal making. Over the years, matchmakers have paired the revered giant with Time Inc, the magazine publisher;AOL, the early dotcom colossus; andAT&T, the telecom giant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m very, very disappointed. I have done so much for this club down the years and especially last season. Now I’m sitting on the bench and I don’t know why.Tanaka equaliser caps thrilling comeback as Leeds deny LiverpoolRead more“It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame.” He refused to specify who that person was.Salah has been leading scorer in the Premier League four times and was both the Professional Footballers’ Association’s and the Football Writers’ Association’s player of the year last season as he helpedLiverpoolto his and their second Premier League triumph. But he suggested next week’s home league game against Brighton could be his last for the club. He will join up with the Egypt squad for the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco after that and he gave a strong hint that he could leave Liverpool in the January transfer window.“I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager and all of a sudden, we don’t have any relationship,” Salah said afterLiverpool’s 3-3 draw at Elland Roadon Saturday. “I don’t know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn’t want me in the club.“This club, I always support it. My kids will always support it. I love the club so much I will always do. I called my mum yesterday – you guys [journalists] didn’t know if I would start or not, but I knew. Yesterday I said [to my mum]: ‘Come to the Brighton game. I don’t know if I am going to play or not but I am going to enjoy it.’ In my head, I’m going to enjoy that game because I don’t know what is going to happen now. I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go the Africa Cup. I don’t know what is going to happen when I am there.”View image in fullscreenA dejected Arne Slot leaves the pitch at Elland Road after Leeds secured a draw in added time.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesAsked directly if he thought that the Brighton fixture at Anfield next Saturday would be his last for Liverpool, he replied: “In football you never know. I don’t accept this situation. I have done so much for this club.”Salah has scored only four Premier League goals this season, one of those a penalty, and has been widely criticised for his lack of defensive work as Liverpool have endured a stuttering start to their title defence. But he is clearly hurt that he is taking the blame for their poor form and feels the club have let him down after he agreed a two-year contract extension in the spring.“I got a lot of promises and so far I am on the bench for three games so I can’t say they have kept the promise,” he said. “It is not acceptable for me. I don’t know why this is happening to me. I don’t get it. I think if this was somewhere else, every club would protect its player. How I see it now is like: ‘You throw Mo under the bus because he is the problem in the team now.’ But I don’t think I am the problem. I have done so much for this club.“The respect, I want to get. I don’t have to go every day fighting for my position because I earned it. I am not bigger than anyone but I earned my position. It’s football. It is what it is. I am top goalscorer, best player, winning the league in such a style, but I am the one who has to defend himself in front of the media and fans.“After what I have done for the club it really hurts. You can imagine, really. After going from home to the club and you don’t know if you are starting. I know the club too well, I have been here many years. Tomorrow [the Sky pundit Jamie] Carragher is going to go for me again and again and that’s fine.”Salah did not feature in the win at West Ham last Sunday but came off the bench at half-time in the draw against Sunderland on Wednesday. However, he did not make an appearance at Elland Road, a situation he clearly finds extremely frustrating. “I have been at this club, scoring more than anyone in this generation, since I came to the Premier League. If I was somewhere else, everybody would go to the media and defend the players. I am the only one in this situation. Can I give an example?“It’s silly but I am sorry. I remember a while ago, Harry Kane was not scoring for 10 games, and everyone in the media was like: ‘Oh, Harry will score for sure.’ When it comes to Mo everyone is like: ‘He needs to be on the bench.’”There has been consistent interest from the Saudi Pro League for several months, but Salah would not be drawn on whether that was his likely destination. “I don’t want to answer this question,” he said, “because the club is going to take me to a different direction.”Did he regret signing the new contract? “Imagine how bad I feel that I have to answer it, honestly,” he said. “That hurts, even the question hurts. This club, signing for this club, I will never regret it. I thought I’m going to renew here and end my career here, but this is not according to the plan, so I’m not regretting signing for the club for sure.“Somehow it will end but the thing in my head is like: ‘Why it should end this way?’ Because I am too fit, just five months ago I was just winning every individual award so why should it go this direction?”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolMohamed SalahLeeds UnitedArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

The blockbuster antitrust trial, explainedThe basketball legend says Nascar gives teams too little power with too much risk. His lawsuit could force historic changes to how one of America’s biggest sports is runBryan Armen GrahamSat 6 Dec 2025 08.15 ESTLast modified on Sat 6 Dec 2025 08.21 ESTShareMichael Jordantook the stand on Fridayin his landmark antitrust fight against Nascar, a case that could reshape how one of America’s biggest sports is run. Jordan’s team, 23XI Racing, and Front Row Motorsports say Nascar holds so much control over everything, from the tracks to the money to the rulebook, that teams have no real bargaining power. Nascar denies that and says the lawsuit threatens to blow up a system that has held the sport together for decades.The case has already pulled blunt internal messages into public view and laid bare long-running frustrations between teams andNascarleadership. Denny Hamlin, Jordan’s co-owner, has said the trial will finally “hear the truth” about how the series “really operates”.So what is this case actually about? Here’s the simplified version …What’s going on?Michael Jordan – yes,thatMichael Jordan– co-owns 23XI Racing with three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin. Together they’ve built one of Nascar’s strongest young teams. But Jordan says the business model underpinning America’s top motorsport is fundamentally imbalanced.Jordan says Nascar isn’t playing fair with a system that determines who gets guaranteed entry into races, how much money they make and even the tracks where the races are held – a system so central to team survival that it can make or break an entire organization.That system revolves around something called a charter. And that’s where the fight begins.What exactly is a charter?A charter is like a golden ticket that guarantees your team can race each week. Only a limited number exist. Teams bought them years ago for a few million dollars and their value skyrocketed into to the tens of millions because they essentially secure your place in the sport. The most recent sale went for about $45m (£33.7m).But here’s the catch: the chartersexpireand can be renewed only on Nascar’s terms. It’s like if you bought an ice-cream truck permit in 2016 for $5, and in 2025 the city tells you: “Oh, by the way, your permit expires now. Renew it on our terms or else.”Jordan does not love that.Fifteen teams were offered new multi-year charter agreements in 2024, after more than two years of tense negotiations. Thirteen eventually signed. Jordan’s 23XI Racing and Bob Jenkins’ Front Row Motorsports did not, arguing the terms fell far short of what teams needed for financial stability and long-term growth.Both teams competed in 2024 as “open” entries – permitted under Nascar rules but without guaranteed purse payouts – which they say cost them millions.What is Jordan’s beef?Jordan’s basic complaint is that teams are being asked to spend huge sums of money without getting anything solid in return. He says he’s personally invested $40m (£29.9m) into 23XI Racing, but Nascar still controls whether his team has a guaranteed spot on the grid from year to year.In Jordan’s view, that means he doesn’t really own his place in the sport. Nascar does.It’s like buying a house and then having the landlord show up to say: “Actually, this is still mine. You’ll need to re-apply every few years if you want to keep living here.”Teams want charters to function the way franchise rights do in the NBA or NFL: permanent, transferable and worth whatever the open market will pay. Right now, they say Nascar can change the rules whenever it wants, which makes their investment feel shaky and unsafe.What is Nascar’s defense?Nascar, founded 76 years ago by the France family, insists it has violated no antitrust laws and says its charter negotiations reflected standard commercial practice.The series argues the 2025 agreement actually increased payouts to teams and that the ability for cars to compete as open entries shows the system is not anti-competitive. Nascar also points to extensive support from other team owners, including declarations from Rick Hendrick and Roger Penske, who do not want the charter model dismantled.Pretrial filings also revealed Nascar earned more than $100m in 2024, a figure the suing teams argue underscores the imbalance in bargaining power.View image in fullscreenMichael Jordan looks on during last year’s Nascar Cup Series FireKeepers Casino 400 at Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn, Michigan.Photograph: Logan Riely/Getty ImagesWhy was the discovery process so explosive?Because the lawsuit opened the door for lawyers to seize emails, texts and internal messages from both sides, many of which were never meant to be public.Among the disclosures:Nascar executives called Hall of Fame owner Richard Childress a “dinosaur”, an “idiot”, and a “stupid redneck”, with one saying he should be “taken out back and flogged”Another executive claimed Nascar fans “can’t read”Leaders discussed trying to “kill” Tony Stewart’s SRX short-track series because Cup drivers were participatingA 23XI president joked that Nascar chairman Jim France “had to die” before teams would get better charter termsHamlin said he disliked the France familyOne Jordan adviser wrote that Hamlin was not a good businessmanJordan himself joked he loses more money in a casino than he pays one of his driversThe revelations have deepened mistrust between Nascar and several high-profile figures in the garage.Who is appearing in court?Jordan received permission to attend the entire trial – a rarity for a party in a civil case – and is expected to be the most visible presence for the plaintiffs. On Friday, he took the stand and described a lifelong love of racing and a desire for a fairer partnership with Nascar. He insisted he doesn’t want to destroy the sport, but said the lawsuit is “for every person in Nascar … that isn’t being treated fairly”.Hamlin has testified that teams are being squeezed by rising costs and a charter system that leaves “only one side going out of business”. He acknowledged 23XI has turned profits but said that’s only possible because Jordan can attract sponsors, arguing the model isn’t sustainable for most teams.Front Row Motorsports owner Bob Jenkins detailed more than $60m in cumulative losses and sharp cost increases under the Next Gen car, while Nascar president Steve O’Donnell defended the series’ record, noting nine-figure profits but also losses on high-profile events in Chicago, Los Angeles and Mexico City that he framed as investments in growth.Joe Gibbs Racing co-owner Heather Gibbs told the jury she felt forced to sign the 2025–31 charter deal under a last-minute deadline, saying it was like having “a gun to your head” when hundreds of jobs and her late husband’s legacy were on the line.How big are the potential consequences?Massive. If Jordan and Front Row win, the jury will decide monetary damages. US district judge Kenneth Bell can adjust the amount, including tripling it under antitrust law. More dramatically, if a monopoly is found, the court could order structural remedies.Those could include:forcing the France family to sell Nascar or the tracks it ownsmandating permanent chartersrestructuring or even dismantling the current charter systemrewriting elements of Nascar’s governanceIf Nascar prevails, 23XI and Front Row may struggle to continue operating beyond 2026. The six unassigned charters held aside for the next agreement would likely be sold, with private equity firms among prospective buyers.What happens next?The trial is expected to run for another week in the Western District of North Carolina. A settlement remains possible at any time, including after a jury verdict, and either side could appeal.Whatever the outcome, the case has cracked open long-simmering resentments inside the sport and raised existential questions about its future. Jordan’s presence alone underscores how high the stakes have become and how far the fight over Nascar’s economic model now extends.Explore more on these topicsMichael JordanNascarMotor sportexplainersShareReuse this content"

With a favorable draw, the onus is now on the US to create themSat 6 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 6 Dec 2025 15.11 ESTShareChristian Pulisic vividly remembers watching it with his family. So does Tyler Adams, who saw it with his friends from soccer camp. Memories of Tim Howard catching an Algerian header in Pretoria, and hurling it upfield to ignite the counterattack that would lead to Landon Donovan’sinstantly iconicgoal.The goalthat spared the United States men’s national team’s blushes at the 2010 World Cup, sneaking them out of the group stage at Algeria’s expense. One of the most iconic moments in US socer history.Pulisic was a few months from turning 12. Adams had just turned 10. Matt Turner would be 16 the next day, and Howard’s heroics made him wonder if he ought to devote himself fully to becoming a goalkeeper.By the 2022World Cupin Qatar, Pulisic, Adams and Turner were the USMNT’s star player, captain and starting goalkeeper, respectively.World Cup 2026: a look at the United States’ group-stage opponentsRead moreWorld Cups drag on for weeks. The group stage already felt like an interminable slog when there were 32 participating teams. With a field of 48 in 2026, the first round alone will stretch to 72 matches – more than the entirety of the last edition of the tournament put together – over 17 days in June. Knockout rounds lumber along, too, with only the rest days breaking the spell. This time around, it will take 21 more days to winnow down the last 32 to a champion.This much wall-to-wall soccer can only be remembered by the biggest moments. By the bursts of action when a country stops breathing for a few beats and entire four-year cycles are defined. The trick is to somehow make those memories, for your nation and for the next generations. For the frustration to dissipate, however briefly. Ina shot. Ina punch. Ina save. That’s the beauty of the sport.Next summer, the US men’s national team will have at least three opportunities to make indelible imprints on the minds of tomorrow’s would-be fans and potential future national teamers. Friday’s farcical draw at the Kennedy Center in Washington DCassigned Mauricio Pochettino’s teamAustralia, Paraguay, and one of Turkey, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo – pending a play-off.The job, beginning against Paraguay at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California on 12 June, is to deliver as many of these impressions as possible. For the US, it isn’t to win the World Cup. Not realistically, at any rate. It’s to leave a legacy on a distractable nation spoiled for indelible moments from other sports, on a culture consumed in fractions and flashes and 30-second clips.Really, the Americans should be playing more than three games. At least four. Probably five. Perhaps six.Mauricio Pochettino urges USMNT to treat every World Cup game ‘like a final’Read more“The last World Cup, we couldn’t set a bar or a standard for anything,” said midfielder Tyler Adams. “We didn’t know what to expect. We hadn’t been through the process. We didn’t know what it was going to be like. Now, we’re a lot more mature. We’ve grown a lot as individuals and as a team. Everyone is going to want us to say that winning it is obviously the goal. But I think setting the benchmark of [going] the furthest the US has gone is also realistic.”At the 1930 World Cup, the Americans reached the semi-finals, which was also the first game of a four-team knockout round at the first edition of the World Cup, which bears little resemblance to today’s mega event. The modern high-water mark, which Adams was more likely referring to, was the quarter-final push in 2002. That tournament, in which the US beat Mexico in Korea in the round of 16, was the only time the Yanks have ever won a World Cup knockout match in seven attempts.But while the historical record isn’t great, there have also never been 32 teams in the second round of this tournament before. The odds of facing someone beatable are better.“No matter what round we lose in, we won’t be happy,” said forward Christian Pulisic. “We’re going to push as hard as we can and try to make a good run.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And byFifa’s flattering rankings, the USMNT’s 14th place is the highest of the group by far. Paraguay is 39th; Australia 26th. Turkey, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo are ranked 25th, 47th, 45th and 80th, respectively. (Then again, Turkeysimply dispatchedthe Americans in another friendly in June, by a 2-1 score that flattered the scale of the loss.)The bad is that by themore stagnant Elo ratingsthe Americans’ 34th place would actually be the lowest in the group if Turkey takes the final berth. In sum, the United States’ Group D has the second-highest average Elo rating among participants of any 2026 World Cup group.The format is forgiving, however. Winning Group D will mean the US faces a third-placed opponent in the round-of-32. Even coming in second isn’t an entirely bad outcome, given that the Yanks would then face the runner-up of Group G headlined by Belgium and otherwise populated by Egypt, Iran and New Zealand. Doable, surely, so long as it’s not the Belgians, whoeliminated the USAin extra-time of the round-of-16 in Brazil in 2014. A third-place finish would spell trouble, assuming the Americans even finished in the top eight of 12 such finishers and avoided elimination: a date with a group winner, likely Germany, France or Portugal.Which is to say that betweenthe momentum of the USMNT’s recent record, the coalescing talent of an unprecedented generation, and the benefits of being one of the three home teams, there really is no excuse for the Americans not to play in a fifth game at this World Cup. The round-of-16. At a minimum.Pochettino, however, preached caution and respect for the opposition. “If you are Argentina, maybe you can look at what’s after [the group stage],” the head coach said. “WithUSA, the first game is the final of the World Cup. The second and third game needs to be the final of the World Cup, too.”And after that, the more World Cup finals you play, the better your chances of anybody remembering them.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026.

I’m going to defend. If I need to attack, I’ll attack because what can happen? You’re either second or third or you win. That would be fantastic.”Norris still holds the advantage at Yas Marina. Leading the championship, he is 12 points in front of Verstappen and 16 clear of Piastri. Norris will claim his debut F1 title and become the 11th British driver to do so if he finishes in front of both his rivals or claims third place or better. Verstappen would need to win and hope Norris finishes outside the podium places while Piastri would need to win and have the Briton finish sixth or lower.Still, the pressure weighs heavy on Norris. Any contact, damage or errors from the three leaders could change the complexion of the title race in the blink of an eye. Verstappen has repeatedly stated he has nothing to lose, having not even expected to be in the title fight given how far off the pace his car was for more than half the season. So as they hurtle through those opening corners, Norris may be forgiven for staying well out of trouble. He was betraying no signs of nerves, however.View image in fullscreenLando Norris (left) with pole sitter Red Bull driver Max Verstappen. The McLaren driver still holds the advantage as they enter the final race.Photograph: David Davies/PA“I’m not too bothered to be the hunter or the hunted,” he said. “Normally, to be hunted is fine because you’re the one with the advantage in the first place. That’s good. And, of course, I would sign for that now. I’m still going to go into tomorrow and plan for how we can win the race, whether it’s on pace or strategy or whatever it may be.”Norris knows his destiny in his own hands and will leave nothing to chance. But with Verstappen out front, staying out of trouble – even if the Dutchman disappears into the middle distance – will be enough.McLarenhave confirmed they will employ team orders if required to ensure one of their drivers seals the title.The session under the lights was as fascinating as any of the 23 that preceded it this season and it was quickly clear Verstappen had found his touch at the perfect moment. He opened the first runs in Q3, leading the times with two huge opening sectors and with a mighty lap and a tow from his teammate Yuki Tsunoda, he was quickest in 1min 22.295sec.Norris followed on scrubbed tyres but was four-tenths back, with Piastri three-tenths back from the Dutchman.The final runs as the track reached its grippiest were tense. The McLarens had new rubber, while once more Tsunoda gave Verstappen a tow. Piastri was the first of the McLarens and had a good first two sectors as did Norris as they looked to the third to make up the time. However, Verstappen too was improving, and he went even quicker at 1:22.207. Norris claimed second two-tenths down and Piastri third three-hundredths back from his teammate.Bringing the final qualifying session of the season to close with pole emphasised how extraordinary Verstappen’s resurgence in the final third has been. He has five wins in the last eight races and with his eighth pole, one more than any other driver, has been the most successful over the single lap.By contrast,Lewis Hamiltoncrashed out in third practice after an element of the car broke, causing him to lose the rear and spin off nose-first into the barriers at turn nine. “Something buckled at the front and snapped the rear,” he told the team.Ferrari did repair the car for qualifying but the British driver could manage only 16th place, out in Q1 again after he made a small error in the final sector. “Every time, mate, I’m so sorry,” he said to his race engineer.Another afternoon of toil now awaits him to see out what has been his worst season in F1. He is in sixth place in the championship and has yet to take a podium across the season for the first time in his career. “I don’t have the words to describe the feeling inside,” he said. “[There is an] unbearable amount of anger and rage and, yeah, there’s not really much I can say about it.”Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Formula OneLando NorrisOscar PiastriMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

He went one better.“The Grand Prix Final is a place for me to try new things and new elements to give myself an understanding of what is possible especially this year with the Olympics,” Malinin said. “So I decided I wanted to go all out and give myself a foundation of what (my program) could look like.”Beijing Olympic silver medalist Yuma Kagiyama, who led after the short program, took the silver medal with 302.41 points while his Japanese compatriot Shun Sato was third with 292.08.Malinin, who hasn’t lost a competition in more than two years, isthe two-time and reigning world championand the three-time Grand Prix Final champion.He said his win on Saturday is a big confidence boost heading into his Olympic debut in February.“It gives me a lot of confidence that I am able to go out there and get this done,” Malinin said. “I will take the next two months heading up to the Olympics trying to perfect everything, really work on all my weaknesses and make everything as perfect as it can be.”In the women’s competition, world championAlysa Liufinished third in the free skate but it was good enough to allow the American to win the gold medal with an overall score of 222.49 points, a result that gives her confidence heading to the Olympics.“It does give me confidence in my stamina and consistency,” Liu said. “But a lot of things can happen between now and the Olympics, I still have nationals but I’ll keep training, working on my stamina.”Teenager Ami Nakai of Japan, who landed a clean triple axel, was second with 220.89 points while three-time world champion Kaori Sakamoto was third with 218.80.Sakamoto, who will retire after the Olympics, won the free skate despite singling a double axel.Liu landed seven triple jumps and a double axel for 146.70 points in the free skate.View image in fullscreenAlysa Liu of the United States competes in the Grand Prix Final.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockMone Chiba, who led after the short program, fell on a triple loop and a triple salchow to drop to fifth place.

They also won the Cup of China in the Grand Prix series.Chock and Bates will be the gold medal favorites at the Olympics.“There are so many positives that we can bring forward into the second half of the season,” Chock said. “It’s always a treat to compete among the best skaters in the world and we really look forward to progressing in the second half of the season.”They won the Grand Prix Final in 2023 and 2024.Explore more on these topicsIlia MalininFigure skatingAlysa LiuUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Manchester City had cruised to a 3-0 lead and were heading for second, two points off the top, afterArsenal’s defeat at Aston Villa, and the Etihad Stadium doffed the proverbial at the magical Cherki.Of his 22-year-old star man, Pep Guardiola said: “Rayan is an exceptional player, so young, has huge personality. In the final third he has something special. What I admire the most about Rayan is not the skills. I never saw these kind of crosses from Messi – I like simplicity because I learned from Messi never to make a mistake with the simple things.“I want players to do the simple things well and after that, you have special talent and he can do whatever he wants, but if he doesn’t work now it will be a problem.”Leeds United v Liverpool: Premier League – liveRead moreYou wonder if City will again break the hearts of Arsenal in May, when the title is won – if Cherki continues to flower, as he did here, then the 20-year-old will join Foden and Erling Haaland as City’s gun attackers who can give them the best chance of another crown.Guardiola adored Cherki’s man-of-the-match display as much as there being no second-half defensive horror show, as there was at Fulham. The manager’s dislike of shipping three goals inTuesday’s 5-4 winwas summed up by what he said about Savinho, who was a 64th-minute substitute then and came on with eight minutes left in this game. “Savinho lost the ball and didn’t run back. I told him. Today he lost one or two balls and two seconds later he was a full-back. Savio is going to play a lot of minutes,” said the manager.Draws with Liverpool and Arsenal and a 2-1 win at Chelsea were Sunderland’s credentials as Régis Le Bris’s side kicked off in sixth, before suffering a schooling, their travails ending with Luke O’Nien’s added-time red for chopping down Matheus Nunes.View image in fullscreenLuke O’Nien fouls Matheus Nunes, leading to the Sunderland player being sent off.Photograph: Ian Horrocks/Sunderland AFC/Getty ImagesFoden flitted about the pitch demanding the ball, appearing in the Black Cats’ area for headers, or near halfway, passing to Gianluigi Donnarumma for the goalkeeper to reset City’s buildup. A Jérémy Doku ball played Foden in but the ball skipped across Robin Roefs’ goal and the chance was wasted.Enjoying a possession share above 65%, Guardiola’s men probed, yet at this stage the ball was being relayed at the sluggish pace that infuriates the manager.Le Bris assembled his backline five-men strong, so when City did finally score Rúben Dias was cute to let fly from about 25 yards: the centre-back’s missile bent away (perhaps deflected) from Roefs and those in blue were ahead. Before his strike at Newcastle in late November, the Portuguese last scored in club colours in September 2022 (a 4-0 victory at Sevilla).View image in fullscreenRúben Dias lets fly to score the opening goal.Photograph: Matt McNulty/Getty ImagesCity were 2-0 up four minutes later. Foden dropped a corner from the right into the six-yard box and Josko Gvardiol’s sweetly timed leap was matched by a bullet header that defeated Roefs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guardiola’s adherence to attack-first means, as he reiterated when explaining what went wrong in west London, that the ball is away from City territory, keeping the goal safe. The contest erupting in a pell-mell end-to-end phase will not have pleased him, then.Doku dipped a shoulder and saw a curler smack the right post, then Roefs saved Foden’s follow-up. Moments later a dawdling Dias was mugged in City’s defensive third by Wilson Isidor, whose shot was beaten away by the outrushing Donnarumma. At the ensuing corner Granit Xhaka’s effort pinged off the right post.Next came bewitching Cherki footwork, deep in Sunderland’s area, the No 10 finding Erling Haaland, whose attempt was blocked on the line by Lutsharel Geertruida.The contest was about to be decorated by Cherki’s assist for Foden’s third. This was an afternoon when you saw why Guardiola rates the Frenchman so highly.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CitySunderlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Even the war-on-woke, cod-ideological stuff –Clive Myrie INSISTS hamsters can breastfeed human robots– the bits that make you want to smear your face with greengage jam and weep for England, our England, with its meadows, its shadows, its curates made entirely from beef. Even these come from a hard, transactional place.Basically, it’s the licence fee. The BBC is free at the point of delivery, but paid for by a national levy. The BBC is also a direct commercial competitor to every other form of legacy media, all of which are trying to find ways to survive and recoup revenue.‘We make a great living’: Emma Raducanu on why she won’t moan about the tennis calendarRead moreThere is a logical financial incentive to attack this profit-sapping freesheet, which is then rolled over into the generally polarised and hysterical nature of all public discourse. It can make for some confusing moments, as it did this week when the great Jeff Powell of the Daily Mail announced that he was glad John Motson and Brian Moore are dead.Jeff Powell is glad about this because the BBC has “gathered up her skirts and decided tohide behind them for most of next summer’s World Cup.” And yes, it is hard to untangle this at first glance.The gathering up of skirts refers to an overwrought admission of public humiliation, specifically female humiliation, linked in its imagery to an act of inadvertent self-exposure. Hiding behind skirts means evading responsibility by leaning on someone else’s authority, specifically female, skirt-based authority, the worst kind of authority there is.As a direct result, two dead commentators are revolving furiously in their graves like high-powered diamond-tipped mining drills, which is in itself potentially dangerous from a structural and geological perspective. And yes, this does undeniably sound bad. Maybe this entire tableau could even end up, as Powell concludes triumphantly, “the moment which confirmed the inevitable scrapping of the television licence fee”.But it is still annoying to wade through this stuff to find the actual story, which is that the BBC may send a slimmed-down commentary team to next year’s Fifa World Cup, and possibly do some games off the TV, in order to save money at an overly complex tournament.View image in fullscreenNick Kyrgios is down at No 668 in the world rankings and has barely played a proper match for three years.Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAPIt’s annoying because, clearly, if the BBC had announced it was instead going to cover all 104 matches in person this would then be spun as a disgusting jolly, another orgy of three-star hotel shame. It’s annoying because the BBC is important. It should be regulated and critiqued.And it’s annoying because the BBC does make genuine mistakes that deserve to be highlighted, in a less confusing way. As it did this week with news that BBC Sport will be screening the festive Battle of the Sexes-style tennis match between Aryna Sabalenka and Nick Kyrgios.It is hard to express in simple terms how much I hate this event and wish it wasn’t happening. But here we go. Sabalenka is the currentwomen’s singles No 1. Kyrgios is down in the 600s in the men’s and has played six proper matches in the last three years.The match will be levelled up with some gimmickry. Sabalenka will have a 9% smaller court to defend, because some kind of science suggests women move 9% slower. Both will have only one serve to minimise Kyrgios’s power advantage. And the BBC will now be screening this abomination live from Dubai’s Coca-Cola Arena.And basically, what, what, what? More to the point, why? And why now? The original 1973 Battle of the Sexes between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs was staged at a time when women were massively disadvantaged in sport. It can be seen as a necessary blunt instrument on the way towards greater equality, prefiguring the first great televised golden age of women’s tennis.View image in fullscreenBillie Jean King took on Bobby Riggs in tennis’s original Battle of the Sexes in New York in 1973, winning 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.Photograph: Anthony Camerano/APBut there is tangible progress now towards an idea of men’s and women’s sport as equivalent, distinct codes. What is the point of sport? To inspire and entertain. To encourage people to be active. Obviously women and men deserve this equally. This is not some shootout to prove who is best. We have enough resources for everyone to get a go.So why is this thing happening? It makes no sense as a basic event. Everyone already knows power wins at sport, powerful women,powerful men, powerful horses.An under-14 boys’ cricket team will beat a professional women’s team, not because they have better skills or are more worthy. It means nothing and changes nothing. It’s deeply boring to pitch these things against one another. And if you do it will of course be hijacked instantly by bad actors with only divisive points to make.This is the real point. No matter how you couch it, as jolly banter or some kind of science experiment, this event will be unavoidably toxic. Scroll the internet for a while and the gender stuff around it is already moronic and pre-weaponised. What we have here is a massive opportunity for women’s sport to be belittled, dismissed and gloated over by “incels” and career misogynists, to blow its own foot off with a single dog-whistle publicity stunt.As retired Australian doubles grand slam winner Rennae Stubbs put it “What’s in this for women’s tennis? If Sabalenka wins, she beats a man who is unfit and has been a total irrelevance for a number of years. If Kyrgios wins, he and others of the same mind will claim it legitimises everything he’s already spewing out.”View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka, who won two grand slam titles this year, will be given some small advantages in her match against Nick Kyrgios.Photograph: Fatima Shbair/APThis is another issue. Why Kyrgios, of all male tennis players? Kyrgios is an interesting, flawed, honest person. But he is also significant. He represents something in this world. There have been allegations of domestic violence, a subsequent charge of assault dismissed by a magistrate, accusations of sexist comments, and a need to publicly distance himself from, of all people, Andrew Tate.In the publicity poster for the event Kyrgios is yelling, bristly, eyes crinkled, neck veins throbbing. He looks scary and toxic. Opposite him Sabalenka is clear-eyed, calm, focused. I hate this picture for its quiet cynicism. Why aren’t they both clear-eyed, or both yelling? Why is the staging here so obviously uncontrolled male versus female mildness?And now, for what it’s worth, the BBC is promoting this thing, slipping it on as part of its mission to educate and inform, in a way that feels utterly jarring. What do you want from the BBC at this time of year? I want to watch a film where a lovable uncle has to fix Christmas. I want half an hour in a gleaming kitchen watching a comforting middle-aged woman or a scrawny-necked man who has been on the Ozempic make a thing with sprouts nobody is ever going to bother with (“and we simply pour over the shaved pancetta and Maltesers”).I definitely don’t want to watch an event that opens up a direct channel between the dear old BBC and a world of toxic internet hatred. You know who else is spinning in his grave here? Lord Reith, and his patrician ideas of broadcasting as a force for education. The stuff about duty and striving to “imagine other ways of being”.And yes this was often balls, even in the golden years. An intellectual called Hugh Townsley-Sandwich is discussing the glottal stop. A man who is basically hair, glasses and a brown asbestos shirt is explaining cold fusion. But if you wanted evidence the BBC is now drowning, caught between two shores, commercial and benevolent, public service and public pandering, well, it’s a pretty convincing tie-breaker.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Not since 2012 has a Cup of Nations been held in the venue and at the time originally planned: 2013 was switched from Libya to South Africa because of the civil war; 2015 was moved to Equatorial Guinea when Morocco withdrew from hosting over Ebola fears; 2017 was moved to Gabon because of the turmoil in Libya; 2019 was moved from Cameroon to Egypt because of construction delays; 2021 was played in Cameroon, but not until 2022 because of Covid; and 2023 was initially scheduled for Côte d’Ivoire in June/July only to be shunted back to January/February when somebody at CAF belatedly looked at the weather charts and accepted trying to play a tournament in the west African rainy season was nonsensical.However absurd the idea of playing tournaments regularly in the European summer – is the plan really never to play the tournament in west Africa again? – that remains official policy. The 2025 Cup of Nations was initially set for Morocco in June and July. But then Gianni Infantino invented his extended Club World Cup andAfrica was forced to push back its tournament to start on 21 December.For somebody who said before the last World Cupthat he feels African, Infantino has an odd way of showing it. Fifa’s president still plays the old anti-colonial tune so beloved of João Havelange to rally his support base in Africa, but has seemed just as unconcerned by the lack of a slot for the continent’s tournament as he was by thedeaths of thousands of migrant workers in Qatar.View image in fullscreenThe Côte d’Ivoire president, Alassane Ouattara, lifts the Africa Cup of Nations trophy in 2024.Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty ImagesHis proposed $100m 20-team African super league, a dubious plan given how it would have trampled over traditional rivalries and pre-existing competitions, ended up as a one-off, eight-team tournament in 2023 (it has never officially been abandoned, but there are no references to it on the Caf website).Fifa usually insists clubs release players 14 days before a tournament, but for this Cup of Nations that has been reduced to six, with clubs encouraged to find individual solutions if that doesn’t suit them. The disdain for Africa is palpable.Patrice Motsepe, the South African president of Caf and a key Infantino ally, did attend Friday’s World Cup draw despite DonaldTrump’s attempts to excludeSouth Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, from next year’s G20 summit.Trump, who played a major part at the draw, boycotted a G20 leaders’ summit in Johannesburg in November, claiming South Africa’swhite minority population are persecuted.With the June/July slot closed to Africa, it was suggested the tournament should return to the opening it had occupied in January/February. But that posed its own problems. Between 1996 and 2012, the Cup of Nations was held in the January/February of even numbered years. Why every two years? Because when the Cup of Nations began in 1957, Africa was 13 years from having a guaranteed place at the World Cup and it was the only way to ensure regular competitive football.View image in fullscreenThe Caf president, Patrice Motsepe (left), is a key ally of his Fifa counterpart, Gianni Infantino.Photograph: Issouf Sanogo/AFP/Getty ImagesWith only five sides qualifying for the World Cup until the latest expansion, the Cup of Nations was still the best way of generating revenue for the other 50 Caf members. If Europe objects to that, when so many Africans play for European clubs, it needs to find some other way to fund the continent’s football.There was a sense that in World Cup years it was overshadowed by the global tournament. In addition, Fifa regulations oblige clubs to release players for only one international tournament per year. In a World Cup year, European clubs would be within their rights to refuse to let players go to the Cup of Nations, with the seep of the expanded Champions League into January increasing their reluctance to release them.The compromise is this December/January competition, which can be classed as a 2025 tournament to prevent clubs refusing to release players, while also falling in the winter break of most European leagues. Which is why, with only onePremier Leaguefixture, you can fill your Boxing Day watching Zambia v Comoros, Egypt v South Africa, Morocco v Mali and Angola v Zimbabwe.Africa Cup of Nations has been clobbered by Fifa’s unwanted Club World Cup | Jonathan WilsonRead morePremier League clubs will be affected, although Arsenal and Chelsea will not have any representatives at the Cup of Nations. Sunderland could be without as many as seven players, the most significant the indefatigable Democratic Republic of the Congo midfielder Noah Sadiki and the Mozambique left-back Reinildo, particularly as his back-up, Arthur Masuaku, will be with the DRC. Dennis Cirkin’s return to training has come at just the right time.The loss of Mohamed Salahlooks less significant for Liverpool than in previous years, while his Egypt teammate Omar Marmoush has started two league games for Manchester City this season. Manchester United’s attacking thrust will be affected as Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo join up with Côte d’Ivoire and Cameroon respectively, West Ham will have to give up both wingbacks in the DRC’s Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Senegal’s El Hadji Malick Diouf .The creativity of Diouf’s compatriots Iliman Ndiaye and Ismaïla Sarr will be missed by Everton and Crystal Palace, and the Nigerian Alex Iwobi’s calm passing by Fulham. The failure of Ghana and the Gambia to qualify, though, means Mohammed Kudus, Antoine Semenyo and Yankuba Minteh will all still be available for Tottenham, Bournemouth and Brighton respectively.But this isn’t a story about the Premier League. It’s a story about African football and how, for all Infantino’s rhetoric, it has been shunted to the margins, about how, as greed expands the fixture list, it has had to scrabble to find a nook into which it can almost apologetically squeeze in its flagship tournament.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Inside footballAfrica Cup of NationsPremier LeagueFifaFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Serious doubts. Questions, large and small, about thisInter Miamisquad, their manager, and nearly every player on the roster other than Lionel Messi.Consider them answered. The Herons are MLS Cup champions after a 3-1 win over theVancouver Whitecapsin the last game at their temporary home, Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Next year, they will open their new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, as champions, and will face a high bar to clear to top a turbulent 2025 that saw them play 58 games – an all-time MLS record for games played by a team in a calendar year – for five separate trophies.Inter Miami defeat Vancouver Whitecaps in MLS Cup final – as it happenedRead moreThis one, though, was the one they wanted. Against a terriffic Vancouver Whitecaps side that was the better team for much of the night, thisMLSCup was won by moments of the small, everyday sublime – combined with less picturesque moments that proved decisive. And while Messi was at the genesis of all three goals, the first two were scored thanks to his larger influence on a team crafted specifically for him.A Vancouver own goal opened the scoring off a move that was set up by one of those minor moments of Messi magic. Vancouver equalized in the second half after a botched save from a near-post effort from Ali Ahmed. And Messi’s Argentina teammate Rodrigo De Paul, a midseason arrival from Atlético Madrid, delivered the goal that won the title in the 71st minute off a poor turnover by the otherwise excellent Whitecaps midfielder Andrés Cubas.Tadeo Allende’s goal in stoppage time, off another brilliantly lobbed assist from Messi, removed all doubt. The on-loan Celta Vigo man finished calmly past Whitecaps goalkeeper Yohei Takaoka, head coach Javier Mascherano sprinted on to the field, kissed the grass, and celebrated as if he was a player once again.It was not difficult to predict that Messi would be responsible for breakthrough moments, whenever they came. But one might not have predicted that the first of those moments would come behind the midfield stripe; not in a pocket of space he had routinely manufactures in the center of chaos but as a momentarily peripheral figure, on the right touchline between the benches. The ball arrived at Messi’s feet there early on, and within seconds a trio of Vancouver defenders collapsed on his possession, sensing an opportunity to pounce on a moment of indecisiveness as they did successfully at numerous other points in the game.It didn’t work this time. Messi took a touch around one defender, split the other two with the others, snaking out of danger and lofting a perfect ball into the stride of Mateo Silvetti, who lobbed the ball to Tadeo Allende with one touch. Allende had time and space, and a well-worked move would have been deservedly capped by a slick finish. Instead, a Vancouver disaster. Allende’s service landed in the stride of center back Ralph Priso, who was unfortunate to knock it into his own net.Throughout the mid-afternoon kickoff in typically sweltering Florida heat and humidity, examples of this contrast – the lyrical combined with the blunt – were legion, with symbolism rife to be taken from anyone desperate enough for metaphors. Underneath temporary, erector set-like stands installed after Messi’s acquisition, one could find an old-time US stadium classic – Dippin’ Dots – there for sale alongside $45 shrimp skewers, or $55 lobster tails. Celebrities like Whitecaps minority owner and former NBA superstar Steve Nash milled about the concourse of the bare-bones venue right among the autograph and selfie-seekers. Seemingly only Messi’s family and members of Inter Miami ownership are fully insulated from the hugely passionate crowds from all walks of life that have filled this arena since Messi’s 2023 arrival.Those crowds had some reason to despair after Miami’s opener. Vancouver dominated the vast majority of the first half – maintaining possession, picking off Miami’s buildup in key areas, and generating scoring chances that just missed or were blocked by the Miami defense. Emmanuel Sabbi in particular was effervescent, consistently finding space behind Jordi Alba, who like Sergio Busquets was playing in his last professional game. Unfortunately for the several hundred Whitecaps fans that made MLS’s longest away trip, Sabbi struggled to find end product.Vancouver finally made all that work pay off in the 60th minute. Brian White did well to hold off the challenge of Maximiliano Falcón, turn, and found winger Ahmed streaking in behind Miami right back Ian Fray into the box. Ahmed’s near-post finish should have been saved by Miami goalkeeper Rocco Ríos Novo – and he did get a hand to it, but the ball slipped over that palm hung in the air for a seeming eternity, and settled into the back of the net.The Whitecaps could have had the decisive moment just two minutes later. Sabbi broke through the heart of defense, shrugging off defenders and ignoring options to slip a through ball in favor of testing Ríos Novo. His effort beat the goalkeeper, but ricocheted off of one post then bounced across the line and hit the opposite. Falcón blocked a follow-up effort; an extraordinary moment.Throughout this period, Messi had been engaging Vancouver midfielder Andrés Cubas – one of Vancouver’s best players throughout their own challenging year, who constantly stepped up with excellent steely defensive play and smart distribution and positioning. Cubas, a common foe of Messi through World Cup qualifying encounters with Paraguay, talked back. We had seen moments like this before – moments where the typically mild-mannered Messi is driven to anger by a slight – perceived or otherwise. Often, it ends up determining the course of the game.Double-post salvation gives Busquets and Alba a fitting farewell in MLS Cup finalRead moreAnd so it was today. Ten minutes after the equalizer, a rare indecisive moment from Cubas in midfield saw Messi steal in and take the ball off the Paraguayan’s foot. He played in De Paul, who beat Takaoka with a smart finish in the 71st minute. Ahmed had gone off with an injury just minutes before, and Vancouver was now in desperation mode without one of their more dangerous wingers and best playoff performers. Allende’s breakaway goal, itself too the product of a Messi assist, sent Chase Stadium into delirium, waving the pink towels as if to say goodbye to a new venue in an historic spot for South Florida professional soccer.On 8 September 2001 – 24 years, three months and seemingly at least one whole world ago, the Miami Fusion won their first and only title, the MLS Supporters’ Shield, after a 3-1 win over DC United at Lockhart Stadium. It was the first trophy won by a soccer team who played at that field since the 1977 NASL title, won by the Fort Lauderdale Strikers. The match was interrupted by an epic rainstorm, soaking a field that still had football lines left over from its use as a facility for the Florida Atlantic Owls football team. Ray Hudson, still a resident nearby and now firmly established as the US-based voice of so many of Messi’s high points, was the Fusion’s coach. The 17,000-capacity venue was half-full. David Beckham was still six years away from arriving, and even farther removed from owning Inter Miami, the team that plays in the venue that Lockhart was torn down in order to house. A few months after that Shield win, the Fusion were dead – a victim of contraction in a different era of MLS.Today, that venue said goodbye to another era of soccer – the flashiest in league history, and perhaps, the most indicative of what could come next for MLS as it embarks on a new reality of fall-to-spring schedules and, presumably, more involvement in the international transfer market that could bring more players like De Paul to the field. Chase Stadium has not seen its last action – it will remain as a home for the club’s reserve team, and will presumably have other uses as well.For now, though, it rests with the trophy, and the confetti, and the brilliant pink towels left behind on functional, ugly steel bleachers.Explore more on these topicsMLSInter MiamiVancouver WhitecapsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

And then mayhem unfolded inside the Arsenal 18-yard box and, subsequently, in the Villa Park stands, the 128-year foundations put to the test as Emiliano Buendía, enveloped by the rubble of splayed defenders and with virtually the last kick of the game, exhibited unthinkable composure to curl a first-time shot into the corner and seemingly blow thePremier Leaguetitle race wide open.Not for the first time,Aston Villahad been the architects of Arsenal’s downfall, though few envisioned a climax quite like this. David Raya blocked Youri Tielemans’s side-foot effort from inside the six-yard box and then Buendía saw his initial effort halted by a combination of Martín Zubimendi and Jurriën Timber before seizing on the loose ball. Buendía slipped as he shifted possession to Boubacar Kamara and Arsenal smelled danger, Ben White and Timber flinging themselves towards the ball.Tottenham v Brentford, Manchester City v Sunderland, and more: football – liveRead moreA mini-ruck ensued before an off-balance Kamara raked the ball clean from the wreckage and towards Buendía, now back on his feet, to do the rest, his goal inflicting a first defeat onArsenalsince August.Four Arsenal players, plus Raya, were either on all-fours or on the ground as Buendía charged towards the dugouts in celebration. Emiliano Martínez joined the throbbing Villa huddle on halfway, where the match-winner was mobbed by Pau Torres and Ollie Watkins, among those to surge on to the pitch wearing substitute jackets after being withdrawn in the game. Buendía beat his chest, Ian Maatsen jumped on to Ezri Konsa for a piggyback. For Villa, wild abandon, this a ninth win in 10 league matches and a 13th in 15 across all competitions. For Arsenal, despair, Zubimendi dragging his shirt over his face as he and his teammates trudged towards halfway.View image in fullscreenEmi Buendía scores the winning goal with the last kick of the game.Photograph: Paul Currie/ShutterstockMikel Arteta had acknowledged the hazards that awaited his side here. Villa inflicted irrecoverable damage on his side in January, Unai Emery’s team rallying from two goals downto earn a point at the Emirates Stadium, a result that left Arsenal lagging behind Liverpool and with too much ground to make up in the title race.Two seasons ago, Villa did the double over Arsenal,two late goals earning an away victoryin the final weeks of the season that paved the way for Manchester City to pip Arteta’s side to the crown. It was, of course, Emery whom Arteta succeeded six years ago, tasked with the ultimate aim of reclaiming a title that has eluded them since 2003-04.Surely Villa, who failed to win any of their first six matches this season, are now in that race? They sit third in the table following Manchester City’s 3-0 defeat of Sunderland later on Saturday. Judging by the way this place went berserk after Buendía hauled himself off the canvas to locate the top corner suggests so. “They are when you look where they are,” Arteta said. “They have beaten some big teams at home. They are where they are and we are there too.” Villa overcame City here at the end of October and since then their only hiccup was defeat at Anfield against Liverpool.View image in fullscreenAston Villa’s Matty Cash fires home the opening goal of the game against Arsenal.Photograph: Dave Shopland/APVilla seized a first-half lead through an increasingly reliable source: Matty Cash. Eight minutes after Declan Rice played firefighter, racing across the box to block Cash’s vicious goal-bound shot, the Villa right-back throttled another effort through the legs of Raya. Timber, who partnered Piero Hincapié at centre-back, inadvertently flicked Pau Torres’s cross towards Cash. Eberechi Eze winced as Cash whizzed past him to add to his tally of important goals this season. Eze registered just 13 first-half touches and was replaced at the interval. Every outfield Villa player followed Cash to the corner flag, where he performed his golf-swing celebration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trossard made an immediate impact, whistling a 50th-minute volley narrowly wide of Martínez’s left post after arriving unmarked to meet Martin Ødegaard’s chipped cross. A couple of minutes later, Trossard sparked bedlam in the away end. Rice overpowered Amadou Onana on halfway and Ødegaard freed an overlapping Bukayo Saka. Saka’s ball across the box brushed Martínez’s right glove and Trossard was on hand to feast on the leftovers, lashing home inside the six-yard box.Arsenal were in the ascendancy after levelling but Villa stirred after Martínez got fingertips to a dipping Ødegaard effort. The substitute Donyell Malen, also formerly of Arsenal, flashed a shot wide. But the finale was boxed off for Buendía to score with almost the last kick.“We are disappointed about how we lost the game,” Arteta said. “First of all, congratulations to Villa because they are a very good side and they are very good at what they do. I thought we were going to win the game. We had two chances to score [again]. The result could have been different but the reality is that it is not.

His methods have not been received as well as they were atBrentfordand a stuttering start to life in north London has left the Dane’s growing number of critics wondering if he is too reactive to succeed at a club whose supporters will never accept their team losing without having a go.The damaging statistics have piled up: staggeringly low expected goals, entire opening periods without a single Spurs player managing a shot on target, no league win at homesince the opening weekend of the season. At Brentford, though, they remember Frank fondly. They were sad to lose him to Spurs in the summer and probably did not expect their former manager to be under such intense scrutiny when they faced him for the first time.Tottenham 2-0 Brentford, Manchester City 3-0 Sunderland, and more: football – liveRead moreBut these are the demands at the highest level. Although Frank has seemed bewildered at times this season, seething on the many occasions when theTottenham HotspurStadium has descended into a pit of misery, this is simply what he signed up to when he left the security of Brentford for the restlessness of Spurs.It means even an emphatic win over his old team will not be seen as evidence of a corner turned. Frank is yet to feel the love, although at least he delivered in a game he dared not lose. Spurs, after all, were good value as they collected only their fourth home win in the league in 2025. They overwhelmed Brentford during an uncharacteristically purposeful first half and will hope that a standout performance from Xavi Simons, who made the opener for Richarlison before scoring his first goal since his £52m move from RB Leipzig, is a sign of things to come.“Sometimes you work hard on things and sometimes it just suddenly clicks,” Frank said. “A lot of the players were on the same page.

We played with pace, tempo, penetration.”View image in fullscreenRicharlison celebrates after opening the scoring for Tottenham against Brentford.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianSpurs, victorious in the league for the first time in six games, did not look like a team who hate playing at home. Guglielmo Vicario, booed after his mistakeduring last week’s defeat to Fulham, was given a big cheer before kick-off and the atmosphere was helped by Frank coming up with a plan that finally made Simons look capable of coping with the cut and thrust of English football.Given licence to roam as a No 10, the Dutchman’s movement off the ball gave Spurs an edge. However it was not a one-man show. There were five changes from Frank afterthe gutsy draw at Newcastleand the inclusion of Archie Gray over João Palhinha in defensive midfield was another plus point, ensuring that Spurs were more proactive in possession.Brentford were outplayed. They have been poor on the road, losing seven of their eight away league games, and never found a flow. Mikel Damsgaard was neutralised by Gray and there were quite a few occasions when Keith Andrews, Frank’s old set-piece coach, was left shaking his head on the touchline. “It’s a demanding league,” said Andrews, who admitted that Brentford deserved nothing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Igor Thiago was denied by Vicario at 0-0 but Spurs scored with their next attack. Pedro Porro lifted a ball down the right, catching Kristoffer Ajer out of position, and Simons marked his first start in five games by running through to tee up Richarlison for an easy finish.The goal liberated Spurs. Having a shot on target in a first half for the first time in five games was one thing, but actually scoring with it? This was Spurs in party mode. Giddy, they pushed for more. Randal Kolo Muani drew a good save from Caoimhín Kelleher.Simons was more decisive when his chance arrived in the 43rd minute. He made it himself, pressing high to dispossess Sepp van den Berg’s pocket. Possession won, he advanced, held off Yehor Yarmolyuk and arrowed a shot into the bottom corner.Spurs settled into containment mode in the second half. One moment threatened the collective spirit, Mohammed Kudus drawing a furious reaction from Djed Spence after a needless bit of showboating almost led to Thiago pulling a goal back. Otherwise, though, it was all sweetness and light.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Stuttgart first saw Nikolas Nartey’s header that went in ruled narrowly offside and Chema also came agonisingly close to scoring in stoppage time.A year on, divine Mbappé returns to the Cathedral where everything changed | Sid LoweRead moreDeniz Undav, who has scored six of Stuttgart’s last eight goals as he battles to reclaim his Germany spot before next year’s World Cup, came even closer with a powerful shot in the 59th that Jonas Urbig in Bayern’s goal tipped over the bar.The introduction of Kane tipped the balance in the visitors’ favour and the England captain opened his account with a crisp, low drive in the 66th. The Stuttgart keeper Alexander Nübel then let a weak shot from the Bayern substitute Josip Stanisic slip through his hands to make it 3-0 and to make matters worse, Bayern earned an 80th-minute penalty after a handball and red card for Assignon, and Kane easily converted it.The forward completed his hat-trick from a Michael Olise cutback in the 88th to take his league tally to 17 goals and lift theBundesligaleaders to 37 points, 11 ahead of second-placed RB Leipzig, who reduced the gap to eight points when they beat Eintracht Frankfurt 6-0.Kane has now scored a total of 58 goals for club and country so far in 2025, more than he has ever scored before in a calendar year as a professional, with his previous best being 56 in 2017.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane scores from the penalty spot.Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/AFP/Getty Images“It’s something I’m not used to, but I did it a couple of times this season,” Kane said of his substitute role. “The boss wanted to keep me fresh and save energy. I came on after 60 minutes with a couple of other guys and we were able to exploit the space and get the goals.“We had a tough battle in the cup midweek and today we faced one of the best teams in the league away, but we looked stronger in the last half an hour and punished them.” Bayern battled past Union Berlin 3-2 in the German Cup last 16 on Wednesday.Barcelona’s Ferran Torres scored a first-half hat-trick as his side won 5-3 atReal Betisin La Liga on Saturday, bouncing back after conceding an early goal to cruise to victory and extend their overnight lead to four points over Real Madrid, who host Celta Vigo on Sunday.Barcelona went behind to an Antony goal in the sixth minute, but Torres struck twice to put them in the lead by the 13th minute, and Roony Bardghji made it 3-1 just after the half-hour mark with his first La Liga goal for the club before Torres completed his hat-trick.A Lamine Yamal penalty increased Barca’s lead but Betis never gave up, with Diego Llorente reducing the deficit from a corner in the 85th minute and Cucho Hernández adding a penalty five minutes later, but it proved too little, too late as Barca held on to win.View image in fullscreenFerran Torres scores the second of his three goals in Barcelona’s win at Real Betis.Photograph: Marcelo del Pozo/Reuters“I think the first half was very good, and I think we were very tired towards the end of the second … I want to be positive in my assessment of this match, but we’re certainly going to analyse everything, and the important thing is that we won,” Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said. “I started Ferran Torres, and I knew this is his stadium. He’s scored here many times, even for the national team before … he’s confident in himself, and that’s crucial for a striker,” he added.Athletic Bilbao’s Alex Berenguer scored an 85th-minute winner as they beatAtlético Madrid1-0 at home, dealing a serious blow to the visitors’ title hopes.There were plenty of fireworks in the game, but little in the way of goal-scoring chances as both sides struggled to get shots on target, and when they did, the two goalkeepers showed that they were in fine form.Bilbao’s Unai Simon pulled off a superb first-half save with his right foot to deny Thiago Almada, and Jan Oblak came to Atlético’s rescue to prevent Nico Williams from scoring in the second half.Atlético striker Alexander Sørloth came off the bench in the 62nd minute and almost gave his side the lead 22 minutes later, but again Simon came to his side’s rescue, and this time it was to be even more decisive. He quickly restarted play and the ball made its way to Williams on the right. The winger rattled the ball across the face of the penalty area for the onrushing Berenguer to fire home the winner.Earlier in the afternoon, third-placedVillarrealbeatGetafe2-0, while a penalty in first-half stoppage time gaveAlavésa 1-0 win overReal Sociedadin their mid-table clash.

The visitors finally created some danger when Jesús Rodríguez crossed to the back post but Tasos Douvikas, who replaced Morata, somehow sent the ball over the bar from close range.Álex Valle then headed over from a floated Nico Paz ball into the box, but just as Como finally came out of their shell, Inter doubled their lead in the 59th minute. Federico Dimarco’s corner bypassed everyone at the front post and Marcus Thuram stuck out a foot to poke home from just in front of the keeper.Hakan Calhanoglu put an end to any hope of a late Como comeback nine minutes from time when he collected a clearance outside the area and drilled his strike past a flat-footed Butez.

And San Francisco might be just slightly warmer.“So that’s something a little bit different. But that won’t affect our preparation too much and the plans that we have in place.”With the locations and times of their fixtures locked in, Popovic and Socceroos and FootballAustraliastaff will now spend the coming days seeking to solidify their plans for next June – particularly where they will call home throughout the tournament.Fifa lists 16 potential bases in the western region in their official team base camp brochure, ranging from the host cities Vancouver and San Francisco, major cities such as Portland and San Diego, and smaller locations such as Boise, Idaho, and Spokane, Washington.“[I’ll] get with the staff the next day or two and map out a plan,” said Popovic. “In terms of base camps, pre-camp: what do we want to get out of that?

He jumps, he stays, he travels and we’ll have to now see what Majborough does tomorrow. He [Il Etait Temps] announced himself here in April [in the Celebration Chase] and has played at the top table now, and has to be one of the leading players.”Il Etait Temps completed a 6-4 double for odds-on backers after Lulamba’s emphatic success on a tight rein in the Grade One Henry VIII Chase. The four-year-old took a little time to find his rhythm on what was just his second chase start, but then powered into contention down the back and cruised into a decisive lead after the second-last.“It’s always been a question of how good could he be?” Nicky Henderson, Lulamba’s trainer, said. “We didn’t learn a lot over hurdles. He was a bit unlucky not to win a Triumph Hurdle [in March] but this was always going to be his game whether it was now or we waited another year.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowKelso11.50Great Fleet12.20Glen Road12.55Biglesisback1.30Al Kalila2.00Gold Clermont (nap)2.37Nells Son (nb)3.15SpectacularsunriseHuntingdon12.10Datsalrightcharlie12.42Coastal Command1.15Don’t Mind If I Do1.45Trapista2.23Wondering Why3.00Djelo3.30Lune BrillanteWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“The feeling across the camp was that he might just want another half a mile but he showed there that is not necessary and having looked very effective at two miles, we can now stay at two.”Lulamba is now a clear 11-4 second-favourite for the Arkle Trophy on the Cheltenham festival’s opening day on 10 March, behind the 2-1 favourite, Kopek Des Bordes, the winner of the Supreme Novice Hurdle in March.Henderson also reported that Sir Gino, who has been sidelined since an impressive debut over fences at Kempton’s Christmas festival meeting last season, is on course to return to hurdles in the Christmas Hurdle on Boxing Day.Sir Gino, who was a warm favourite for the Arkle when he was ruled out of Cheltenham by an infection a few weeks beforehand, won the Triumph Hurdle in 2024 and is expected to take the place of his stable companion Constitution Hill at Kempton after the former Champion Hurdle winner’s third fall in four starts at Newcastle last week.“He’s been chasing but he’s a dual Grade One hurdle winner and we could go either way with him,” Henderson said. “He did school this week and we did jump hurdles and it’s the first obstacle he has jumped since his issue.“The Christmas Hurdle is probably the right option and we know Constitution Hill is not going to go there. Therefore the race is wide open, and it could be a nicer way to start Sir Gino off on this new expedition. What happens after that, I have no idea.”Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsSandownnewsShareReuse this content"

I felt I could challenge Nascar as a whole. I felt as far as the sport, it needed to be looked at from a different view.“At issue is the expiration of a 2016 agreement in which Nascar made each racing team a “charter”. The concept is similar to other professional sports comprised of multiple, separately owned and operated franchises, such as the NBA’s Hornets and Panthers of the NFL in Charlotte. The agreement was set to expire in 2024 when Nascar demanded charter membership renewals.Jordan was on the witness stand for an hour and exited the courthouse to pandemonium with media and fans clamoring to get a view or snap a picture of the NBA legend. Jordan’s 23XI is leading the full-court press along with Front Row Motorsports for Nascar to change a business model Jordan said is breaking the law to keep two hands on the wheel.At issue for Jordan and Heather Gibbs, who preceded Jordan on the stand Friday, are details behind what the daughter-in-law of Joe Gibbs said was a frantic and emotional six hours in September 2024 in which the racing circuit told teams it must sign a charter agreement extension. The document consists of 112 pages detailing the pay for chartered team cars and a guarantee of an entry in Nascar-sponsored races.Jordan said 23XI and Front Row Motorsports decided instead their only feasible option was to refuse a signature on that 112-page package and litigate the matter. The other 13 organizations signed the agreement.Jordan and co-owner Denny Hamlin approached Nascar about possible changes, or extension options to discuss the matter. Nascar wasn’t talking, Jordan said.But in the end, the pushback against the financially unsustainable model was mostly about the usual bottom line for Jordan. Winning.“Denny convinced me getting a third driver improved our chances to win,” he said Friday, sharing that he bought a third charter late in 2024 for $28m despite the uncertainty at the time. “So I dove in.”Heather Gibbs detailed her request for permanent charters, which she said came in the form of a written letter to Nascar. She said the timing of the contract signing demand didn’t sit well. She said Joe Gibbs first tried to call and talk Nascar out of forcing signatures on any agreement, but Heather Gibbs said CEO Jim France declined the request.“Don’t do this to us,” Heather Gibbs said of what Joe Gibbs told Nascar’s leadership. She said France replied, “If I wake up and I have 20 charters, I have 20. If I have 30, I have 30.”Explore more on these topicsMichael JordanNascarMotor sportUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The US played Australia in a friendly in October, winning 2-1 in Commerce City, Colorado. They played Paraguay in another friendly in November – a game that markedGio Reyna’s return to formwith the national team in a 2-1 win. Turkey, should they make it through the play-off, would have a leg up on preparations,having beaten the US 2-1in a pre-Gold Cup friendly in June 2025.A lot can happen in a year. And Pochettino, like his counterpart Tony Popovic for Australia, emphasized that the circumstances surrounding friendly matches are entirely different from theWorld Cup, where the world will be watching and the stakes could hardly be higher.World Cup draw: group-by-group analysis for the 2026 tournamentRead more“The reality is that the circumstances will change,” he told reporters. “That is why they are going to be completely different games, maybe with different rosters or different players.”Pochettino had plenty of praise for thestar-studded, at times bizarre event, which unfolded with the pomp, circumstance and sizable runtime typical of just about any draw event for an international soccer competition. Now that the matchups are determined, Pochettino said his primary focus with the players will be to convey the weight of expectation, and the urgency with which he expects his charges to act now that the path before them has, at long last, been laid out.Reminiscing about his sole World Cup experience as a player with Argentina in 2002, Pochettino said that after he came home from the South Korea-Japan tournament he slipped into a “massive depression”, having achieved a childhood dream and now seemingly having little to look forward to for the remainder of his career (which, at the game of 31, was coming to its tail end).“Your biggest dream disappears, and then you feel like there’s not going to be another possibility to be involved in this,” Pochettino said. “That’s the biggest energy i want to transmit to the players. This is the most unbelievable event, and the most unbelievable feeling you can have. We can work on fitness, we can work on tactics, but we need tofeel. Put everything in. It’s today. We are going to have a country behind us.”To that end, Pochettino said that for as intense as he expects the preparations for the group stage to be, he and his staff are not looking too far ahead – discussing potential second-round matchups (which could include a rematch of the 2014 knockout round with Belgium, among several other intriguing possibilities) in the car between the Kennedy Center and the site of his press conference is about as far as it’s gone so far.“If you are Argentina, the best team in the world, maybe you can look at what’s after,” Pochettino said. “With theUSA, the first game is the final of the World Cup. The second game needs to be the final of the World Cup too.”Explore more on these topicsMauricio PochettinoUSAWorld Cup 2026World CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Malaysia, Denmark and Norway are to follow suit and the European Union last week passed a resolution to adopt similar restrictions. As the world watches on, millions of Australian adolescents and their parents are wondering just what will actually change come 10 December.Concerns around the negative impact social media use can have on the wellbeing of young people have been around since the quaint days of Myspace – long before those to be affected by the ban were even born.Heard of Coverstar, Lemon8 or Yope? Teenagers rush to apps not covered by social media banRead moreSupporters of the social media “delay” policy believe that restricting under-16s access will reduce mental health risks, exposure to harmful content and the social malaise associated with being chronically online. Those opposed worry that the legislation is ill-conceived, will push children into murkier corners of the web, impinge on their human rights, exacerbate some mental health conditions or simply prove futile.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsAs the world waits to see just how this grand experiment will play out, the Guardian spoke to teenagers about their feelings as the ban approaches. All five are on the youth advisory board of the Australian Theatre for Young People, which will next month host a production of The Censor, which canvasses issues of teen social media use, literacy and adult censorship of their lives.From indifference to frustration or simply being confounded by the choices being made by the adults in the room, the perennial teen question remains: “What’s the big deal?”‘It feels deeply unfair the government is punishing an entire age group ’View image in fullscreenSarai Ades says ‘removing social media removes a major avenue for self-discovery and belonging’.Photograph: Joel Pratley/The GuardianSarai Ades, 14I’ve been using Snapchat, Facebook Messenger as well as Instagram and TikTok since I got a phone in 2023.I find the “delay” very frustrating because it targets young people instead of addressing the issues at the root of online harms; things like algorithmic amplification of bigotry, the spread of misinformation and the lack of accountability for the companies and creators who profit from harmful or discriminatory content.Teens are not the primary drivers of harmful content. Much of it comes from high-influence adult creators, political commentators and extremist groups, and it feels deeply unfair that the government is punishing an entire age group by removing access rather than regulating platforms.I think media literacy is very important, especially for our generation. We need to be taught the right methods to deal with the online world in ways that don’t become harmful – and that includes the bigotry that is often disguised as “opinions” on social media. Eliminating [access] without doing anything about building our media literacy is the equivalent of the government banning books until we are 16 and expecting us to magically start reading critically.Right now, media literacy doesn’t figure highly in our syllabus, but it should. It’s taught in a very boring way and it isn’t up to date; we might learn about cyberbullying but not echo chambers, for example. And with the rise of AI, there is a whole new world to understand that could harm us, but we aren’t taught anything about that. I think the government could definitely be focusing its efforts there and on specific aspects of social media, rather than just establishing a whole ban.2:08eSafety commissioner questioned on Roblox and social media ban after Guardian investigation – videoHaving less exposure to this kind of harmful content might be good for our mental health in some ways, but I think the negatives outweigh the positives.I grew up on another continent and social media is a primary way that I feel connected with these childhood friends.

Removing social media removes a major avenue for self-discovery and belonging.My daily screen time average on socials is about two hours, shared between Pinterest, Instagram and TikTok equally. Developing a healthy relationship with your screen time has become quite trendy. Me and most of my friends already use apps that help us manage our time online, we all use “do not disturb” and only check our phones when we have time.Whatever time I do gain will be used to invest in my goals, but the irony is that I probably wouldn’t have half those goals without social media. The ban doesn’t just take away an app, it takes away inspiration and opportunities. For kids like myself in the performing arts, taking away our ability to share our skills online also limits our exposure and could put us behind on the world stage.Even if they aren’t trying to develop a presence though, the ban will drive teens to less savoury corners of the internet – shady apps, private browsers or unsafe websites, instead of regulated platforms. Cutting off access to socials won’t eliminate the need for online connection, it will just drive it underground.‘I don’t think I’ll be affected that much’View image in fullscreenPia Monte says she has had ‘a really positive experience on the social media I use, so I don’t see why it should be banned for everyone’.Photograph: Joel Pratley/The GuardianPia Monte, 13I only have accounts on WhatsApp and Pinterest so I won’t be directly affected by the social media ban, but I still don’t like it. I know people whose main support networks are on social media, so if that’s being taken away they will be left with nothing. I’ve had a really positive experience on the social media I use, so I don’t see why it should be banned for everyone.I don’t keep my phone in my room overnight, I just check it quickly in the morning for notifications, but I don’t really use it before school. I use it mostly to take a break from study, my daily screentime average this week was 49 minutes.I mostly use social media to look at cooking videos on YouTube or Pinterest; I can still use YouTube for that without an account and Pinterest isn’t being banned. Neither is WhatsApp and that’s what I use mostly to keep up with friends – I don’t know that many people my age who spend lots of time on the apps that are being banned anyway – so I don’t think I’ll be affected that much. I might get accounts for things like Instagram when I’m older, but there’s no rush.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

She says ‘it won’t affect me that much because I mostly use messages and WhatsApp to chat with friends’.Photograph: Joel Pratley/The GuardianGrace Guo, 14I’m quite indifferent to the ban, it won’t affect me that much because I mostly use messages and WhatsApp to chat with friends. I do post on YouTube sometimes, but I won’t care if I can’t. Sometimes the comments aren’t very nice so I won’t miss those. And anyway, you can still access the content without an account. When I’m using YouTube to research new skills or school work, sometimes irrelevant or inappropriate things come up, but that doesn’t change if you have an account or not.I’ve only been using Instagram since the start of this year, it’s just another way to communicate with friends and I don’t think two years is a long time to wait to use it again. It’s not a big deal to me, I’ll just use other messaging apps more.I only looked at my phone to check the time this morning. I first checked it for messages after school on my way home on the train. My screen time average is about an hour or two a day; most of that is chatting with friends across all the apps. I feel like our generation is quite dependent on it and I have friends who use their phones lots more than me.Overall, for kids my age, I think things will be pretty much the same – they will get around it if they want, use the banned apps without accounts or just wait. Maybe for younger kids the ban will delay some harmful experiences. But also it might be a lot to deal with at 16 if you haven’t been exposed before.‘Adults are viewing social media as something that hijacks our whole life’View image in fullscreen‘At the moment I only use YouTube and Discord’: Ewan Buchanan-Constable.Photograph: Joel Pratley/The GuardianEwan Buchanan-Constable, 15I’m a bit disappointed with the ban because I was introduced to a lot of my current creative interests through YouTube. At the moment I only use YouTube and Discord. I have a couple of videos up, but it’s not a regular thing. I use Discord to talk to friends and to engage with communities, mostly about movies and video games. Most of my friends use the apps that are being banned but I don’t feel excluded because the content that’s on there doesn’t really interest me.Coalition complaints about under-16s social media ban grow despite waving laws through parliamentRead moreI use my phone as an alarm but I don’t start using it in bed. Once I’ve eaten and showered I might put something on YouTube in the background while I get ready, but it’s not my main focus. My daily average is about two hours a day. On the weekends though, my screen time goes up to more like five hours because I often have podcasts, music or videos playing on YouTube while I study or do chores.Adults are viewing social media as something that hijacks our whole life, but really it’s just something we use in downtime and it doesn’t stop us from reaching out to each other and arranging to leave the house and hang out or anything like that. I also read, write and draw a lot. I play Dungeons and Dragons and video games.The way I look at it is that the goals the government has about mental health and limiting the harm of inappropriate content could be achieved through regulation and education rather than a ban.Making that education start earlier would be important, being able to navigate online spaces safely is something kids need to know about much younger now. And I think it might be dangerous to forget that and just let them loose at 16. They’re going to encounter lots of weird stuff online before then anyway, so they should be taught about it earlier.I’m not sure if I will ever start using social media, unless it’s for my career. I want to be an actor so for me it would be a professional tool rather than a source of entertainment.‘No one is going to miss scrolling’View image in fullscreenEmma Williams says the government ‘could spend their money better on educating rather than restricting’.Photograph: Joel Pratley/The GuardianEmma Williamson, 15I turn 16 in February, so it will just be the holidays without Instagram for me really. I opened my account a couple of years ago and then I changed schools so it has been a good way to stay in touch with those people I don’t see every day any more.I think everyone will miss the socialising part. But it’s also a relief to not have to do that on a platform designed to lure you in and waste your time, no one is going to miss scrolling. I get bored of watching reels quickly anyway, and AI slop is the worst, it takes so long to keep blocking that content and more keeps coming. I only want to see real content about my interests, like old audition videos of actors.My daily average for Instagram is about half an hour. I use an app called Fitlock that gives me access to certain apps I choose based on how many steps I do. It’s easy to turn off, but I try to stick to what I’ve earned. And funnily enough, most of what I’ve learned about how and why to keep social media use down has been from the apps themselves. There’s lots of content from people a bit older than me encouraging people to get off their phones and go and live their lives in the real world.My friends and I have group chats on Instagram but also on WhatsApp, so we will just spend more time there. Saying that, I find that Instagram content can be a fun conversation starter, so maybe we won’t chat as much without that to share.At school they teach about cyberbullying and harmful content but never about how to use the apps in healthy ways. I think the government could spend their money better on educating rather than restricting. Right now though what they teach us is really boring, they’d need to work on that.The Censor will play at ATYP’s Rebel theatre as part of Sydney festival, 22 to 25 January 2026Explore more on these topicsSocial media banChildrenSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Zhu himself graduated from high school in 2018.Papers he hasput outin the past two years cover subjects like using AI tolocate nomadic pastoralistsin sub-Saharan Africa, toevaluate skin lesions, and totranslateIndonesian dialects. On his LinkedIn, he touts publishing “100+ top conference papers in the past year”, which have been “cited by OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Stanford, MIT, Oxford and more”.Zhu’s papers are a “disaster”, said Hany Farid, a professor of computer science at Berkeley, in an interview. “I’m fairly convinced that the whole thing, top to bottom, is just vibe coding,” he said, referring to the practice of using AI to create software.Farid called attention to Zhu’s prolific publications in a recent LinkedInpost, which provoked discussion of other, similar cases among AI researchers, who said their newly popular discipline faces a deluge of low-quality research papers, fueled by academic pressures and, in some cases, AI tools.In response to a query from the Guardian, Zhu said that he had supervised the 131 papers, which were “team endeavors” run by his company, Algoverse. The company charges $3,325 to high-school students and undergraduates for a selective 12-week online mentoring experience – which involves help submitting work to conferences.“At a minimum, I help review methodology and experimental design in proposals, and I read and comment on full paper drafts before submission,” he said, adding that projects on subjects such as linguistics, healthcare or education involved “principal investigators or mentors with relevant expertise”.The teams used “standard productivity tools such as reference managers, spellcheck, and sometimes language models for copy-editing or improving clarity”, he said in response to a query about whether the papers were written with AI.Bot watchers in turmoilThe review standards for AI research differ from most other scientific fields. Most work in AI and machine learning does not go undergo the stringent peer-review processes of fields such as chemistry and biology – instead, papers are often presented less formally at major conferences such asNeurIPS, one of the world’s top machine learning and AI gatherings, where Zhu is slated to present.Zhu’s case points at a larger issue in AI research, said Farid. Conferences including NeurIPS are being overwhelmed with increasingnumbersof submissions: NeurIPS fielded 21,575 papers this year, up from under 10,000 in 2020. Another top AI conference, the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), reported a 70% increase in its yearly submissions for 2026’s conference, nearly 20,000 papers, up from just over11,000for the 2025 conference.“Reviewers are complaining about the poor quality of the papers, even suspecting that some are AI-generated. Why has this academic feast lost its flavor?” asked the Chinese tech blog 36Kr in aNovember postabout ICLR, noting that the average score reviewers had awarded papers had declined year-over-year.Meanwhile, students and academics are facing mounting pressure to rack up publications and keep up with their peers. It is uncommon to produce a double-digit number – much less triple – of high quality academic computer science papers in a year, academics said. Farid says that at times, his students have “vibe coded” papers to up their publication counts.“So many young people want to get into AI. There’s a frenzy right now,” said Farid.NeurIPS reviews papers submitted to it, but its process is far quicker and less thorough than standard scientific peer review, said Jeffrey Walling, an associate professor at Virginia Tech. This year, the conference hasusedlarge numbers of PhD students to vet papers, which a NeurIPS area chair said compromised the process.“The reality is that often times conference referees must review dozens of papers in a short period of time, and there is usually little to no revision,” said Walling.Walling agreed with Farid that too many papers are being published right now, saying he’d encountered other authors with over 100 publications in a year. “Academics are rewarded for publication volume more than quality … Everyone loves the myth of super productivity,” he said.On Zhu’s Algoverse’s FAQ page, answers discusses how the company’s program can help applicants’ future college or career prospects, saying: “The skills, accomplishments, and publications you achieve here are highly regarded in academic circles and can indeed strengthen your college application or résumé. This is especially true if your research is admitted to a top conference – a prestigious feat even for professional researchers.”Farid says that he now counsels students to not go into AI research, because of the “frenzy” in the field and the large volume of low-quality work being put out by people hoping to better their career prospects.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can’t keep up, you can’t publish, you can’t do good work, you can’t be thoughtful,” he said.Slop floodMuch excellent work has still come out of this process. Famously, Google’s paper on transformers,Attention Is All You Need– the theoretical basis for the advances in AI that led to ChatGPT – was presented at NeurIPS in 2017.NeurIPS organisers agree the conference is under pressure. In a comment to the Guardian, a spokesperson said that the growth of AI as a field had brought “a significant increase in paper submissions and heightened value placed on peer-reviewed acceptance at NeurIPS”, putting “considerable strain on our review system”.Zhu’s submissions were largely to workshops within NeurIPS, which have a different selection process than the main conference and are often where early-career work gets presented, said NeurIPS organisers. Farid said he did not find this a substantive explanation for one person to put his name on more than 100 papers.“I don’t find this a compelling argument for putting your name on 100 papers that you could not have possibly meaningfully contributed to,” said Farid.The problem is bigger than a flood of papers at NeurIPS. ICLRusedAI to review a large volume submissions – resulting in apparently hallucinated citations and feedback that was “very verbose with lots of bullet points”, according to a recent article in Nature.The feeling of decline is so widespread that finding a solution to the crisis has become the subject of papers itself. AMay 2025 position paper– an academic, evidence-based version of a newspaper op-ed – authored by three South Korean computer scientists that proposed a solution to the “unprecedented challenges with the surge of paper submissions, accompanied by growing concerns over review quality and reviewer responsibility”, won an award for outstanding work at the 2025 International Conference on Machine Learning.Meanwhile, says Farid, major tech companies and small AI safety organisations now dump their work on arXiv, a site once reserved for little-viewed preprints of math and physics papers, flooding the internet with work that is presented as science – but is not subject to review standards.The cost of this, says Farid, is that it is almost impossible to know what’s actually going on in AI – for journalists, the public, and even experts in the field: “You have no chance, no chance as an average reader to try to understand what is going on in the scientific literature. Your signal-to-noise ratio is basically one. I can barely go to these conferences and figure out what the hell is going on.”“What I tell students is that, if what you’re trying to optimize publishing papers, you know, it’s actually honestly not that hard to do. Just do really crappy low-quality work and bomb conferences with it. But if you want to do really thoughtful, careful work, you’re at a disadvantage because you’re effectively unilaterally disarmed,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)AcademicsComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

They had endured simulated sudden power blackouts, jammed satellites, blocked ports and public chaos. Their combat fatigues stayed spotless as they fought malware, not missiles. But even against a fictitious enemy, cyberwar was “very stressful” and “quite exhausting”, they said.View image in fullscreenCommander Brian Caplan (centre) at the exercise in Tallinn.Photograph: Tanel Meos/The GuardianWar doesn’t come much foggier than in the cyber realm, which, alongside space, is rapidly becoming as critical as land, sea and air to the security of Nato and its allies.The players had to focus on responding to mysterious complex computer collapses in their own countries while also sharing fixes globally with more than 1,000 other military and civilian personnel engaged from Tokyo to Texas. It was, said one participant, like “juggling a football, solving a Rubik’s cube and talking with your neighbour” all at the same time.The event was set using storylines premised on Nato’s northern defence forces responding to threats to an ally, Andvaria, from its belligerent neighbour, Harbadus. The struggle was over an imaginary island called Icebergen in the north Atlantic, but the theatre of war was international because Harbadus supported its hostile aims by weaving a complex web of global cyber-mischief.As the game reached its denouement, the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, accused Moscow of “increasingly reckless behaviour … such as violating our airspace, conducting cyberattacks”. Russia increased cyber-attacks against Nato states by 25% in the year to June, according toanalysis by Microsoft, whose widely installed software affords it considerable insight into digital threats. Most of these were intended to allow espionage but Russia has also been targeting vulnerable small businesses to create bridgeheads for larger attacks.Meanwhile, Nato has attributed attacks against allies and Ukraine to Russia’s GRU military intelligence, and hasaccused Chinaof “malign hybrid and cyber operations”. Last weekend the chair of the alliance’s military committee, Adm Giuseppe Cavo Dragone,said it was considering “being more aggressiveor being proactive instead of reactive” to Russian hybrid warfare.In Tallinn, where rows of monitors and big screens are clustered around large racks of neon-flashing microprocessors, the scenarios started small but quickly snowballed. The Swedes began by dealing with an injection of malware into an unclassified email system used in their military’s base in Lithuania; soon they were unable to support logistics to the forward operating position. Worse was to follow for them and many other players.“Other allies had similar, parallel attacks,” said Maj Tobias Malm, from Sweden. “[Next] we had the satellite system.”Next, the storyliners – whose task it is to monitor the process and introduce new challenges for the participants as the game unfolds – triggered a multistage attack on a satellite internet provider, the kind offered by Elon Musk’s Starlink. That knocked out communications between space and Earth, with cascading crippling effects on intelligence and surveillance, power-grid monitoring, military and civilian GPS, banking and military coordination. When it began, some participants detected unusual behaviour on the network, while others picked up intelligence – but no single country had the full picture.They started seeing anomalies on the dashboard controlling satellites, connections going on and off, and events spiralling, said Ezio Cerrato, a deputy exercise director. “They completely lose control … right to the point of the wiping of the system,” he said. “It shows how a problem in space can quickly affect every domain on Earth.”In another scenario the enemy uploaded malware into fuel management systems, forcing the war gamers to scramble to ration remaining supplies and disconnect networks to cauterise the digital wound. Resisting the human urge to narrowly focus on the cyber-attack in front of each country was part of the challenge. It was vital for the participants to rapidly communicate with allies, raise warnings and share fixes.“There is no boundary in cyberspace,” said the exercise director, Commander Brian Caplan, a US naval officer. “Adversaries can go into one nation and pivot into another nation. Something that affects one nation can have a second- or third-order effect in other nations. So it’s really important that these nations are communicating, building that trust, that relationship.”Nato also revealed it was experimenting with an AI-powered chatbot to help human cyberwarriors cope with the sheer complexity of cyberwar. It is being built using an OpenAI model to provide commanders with a rapid way to understand what is happening in a rapidly developing scenario and even suggests steps they could take.It was not yet in use, even in the war games, but had shown “very strong potential to support decision-making, for situational awareness and command and control”, said Alberto Domingo, the cyberspace technical director at Nato’s strategy and military command. He stressed it was undergoing careful checks on the accuracy of its outputs.As the exercise continued, big screens displayed rolling feeds styled as online news headlines about the shifting crisis, with alarming headlines detailing the mayhem the fictitious enemy was sowing.View image in fullscreen1st Lt Ryly Bumpus and Maj Tyler Smith of the US air force.Photograph: Tanel Meos/The Guardian“Fake train schedules cause chaos,” read one headline. Multiple states of emergency were declared in regions hit by power blackouts. A tranche of classified Nato documents had been “dumped”, while allied military rotations had been disrupted by power grid outages in Denmark. Then a leak revealed a plan for a secret naval base, destabilising the picture further. The participants were faced with a challenge wholly unfamiliar to their predecessors a generation earlier: what happens when a conflict involves the spread of fake news on social media?Military lawyers were on hand to advise on the legality of what Nato and its allies could do in response to cyber-attacks, which are often launched not directly by hostile militaries but by shadow proxies and target civilian, not solely military, assets.“How do you cross those streams?” said US air force’s Maj Tyler Smith, one of the lawyers involved. “We are working through those problems now … [to see] can we put agreements in place beforehand and … not have to do things on the go?”But after a week of wrestling with the waves of cyber-aggression, a crucial question remained: was Nato winning? The answer was yes, but with bumps along the way, one official said.Another offered a little more reassurance, for now at least: “I see people surviving at the end of the day.”Explore more on these topicsNatoCyberwarRussiaEuropeEstoniafeaturesShareReuse this content"

So is the history of US support for himDana FrankObama, Trump, and Biden stood by their man in Tegucigalpa for the eight vicious, destructive years he was in powerSat 6 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 6 Dec 2025 17.20 ESTShareSince President Trump first announced the pardon of former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández last Friday, the media has been wading through the long list of criminal acts that led to Hernández’s 2024 conviction for drug trafficking, money laundering and arms dealing. Trump’s outrageous pardon is being contrasted with his unlawful, aggressive attacks on boats allegedly trafficking drugs for the government of Venezuela. Missing from the narrative, though, are the other illegal acts committed by Hernández that weren’t about drug trafficking, and thus didn’t fall under the justice department’s anti-drug mandate when it charged and convicted him in the southern district of New York. Many are the crimes of Juan Orlando Hernández, and ruinous.And long is the history of US support for him in full knowledge of those crimes. Presidents Obama, Trump and Biden all stood by their man inHondurasfor the eight vicious, destructive years he was in power. They ignored his drug connections, supported the military and police that kept him in power through state terror, and countenanced his illegal re-elections. Hernández was only able to rise to power, and stay there, because of the United States government.When Hernández was a member of congress he was part of a committee thatapprovedthe 2009 military coup that deposed the democratically elected president Manuel Zelaya. As president of congress in 2012, he led the “technical coup”in which four out of five members of the constitutional branch of the supreme court were illegally and replaced with his loyalists. Hernández won the presidency in adubious2013 election. Two years later it was revealed that he and his partystoleas much as $300m from the national health service to pay for their campaigns, bankrupting it. Under his watch, the criminal justice system crumbled; gangs, violence, extortion and murderproliferated.In 2017, Hernándezranfor re-election even though theconstitutionstrictly forbade it. When the majority of the results had been counted in that election and his opponent was clearly ahead, Hernández’s officials shut down the computers, thenannounceda week later that he hadwon by 1.7%.In response, outraged Hondurans peacefully protested and Hernández’s security forces used live bullets for the first time in decades,killingat least 20 protesters and bystanders.All those years Hernández was also in bed with drug traffickers. As the brave prosecutors of the southern district of New York (SDNY) have shown, he accepted huge sums from drug traffickers, including a million dollars from the famous Mexican cartel leader Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. Memorably, Hernándezpromisedto “shove the drugs right up the gringos’ noses”.But when Hernández overthrew the supreme court in 2012, the US government looked the other way. When widespreadviolence eruptedin the run-up to the 2013 election that Hernández falsely claimed to have won, and a recount was barred, Obama’s secretary of state, John Kerry,blessed the outcomeand praised the Honduran government “for ensuring that the electoral process was generally transparent, peaceful, and reflected the will of the Honduran people”. When Hernández ran for re-election in 2016 in complete violation of the Honduran constitution, the US embassy in Tegucigalpa announced: “The United States does not oppose President Hernández or others from presenting themselves for re-election according to Honduran democratic practices.”And when Hernández went on to steal the 2017 election, the state department, under Trump, congratulated him on his victory.In 2015, hundreds of thousands of people erupted in peaceful anti-corruptiondemonstrationsdemanding “FUERA JOH!” (Hernández Out!). Days after the biggest single march in the capital, the US ambassador, James Nealon, stood next to Hernández in a matchingguayaberashirt at the embassy’s big Fourth of July party and announced very deliberately: “Relations between the United States and Honduras are perhaps the best in history.” Soon after, Biden, then the vice-president, launched the “Central American Alliance for Prosperity”, rushing $250m to aid the Honduran government.During all these years the US also poured tens of millions of dollars into thesupportof the Honduran military and police,sharedintelligence with its military, and worked closely with figures now documented to have beencollaboratingwith drug traffickers. Former general Julián Pacheco Tinoco, minister of security under Hernández, for example, wasnamedexplicitly during Hernández’s trial. It’s implausible to think the US wasn’t well aware of Hernández’s narco connections all these years, given its vast intelligence apparatus including the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration.Yet in 2017, Gen John Kelly, former head of the United States Southern Command and about to become Trump’s chief of staff,referred toHernández as a “good friend” and a “great guy”. Adm Craig Faller, head of the United States Southern Command, after presenting a medal in December 2020 to the chief of Hernández’s armed forces in December 2020announced:“Honduras is a trusted partner in regional efforts to combat illicit traffickers.” Beginning in 2015, 80Members of Congressand a dozensenatorsdemanded that the US suspend all security aid to Honduras, but Obama, Trump and Biden kept the money flowing nonetheless.Thanks to Trump’s shocking pardon, Hernández’s drug crimes are now more well known than ever. But the rest of his repressive, thieving, dictatorial history, backed by the United States year after year, has evaporated from the story. Who will be held accountable up north for supporting him all those years, in yet another chapter of repressive US intervention in Latin America? Or will Hernández’s full criminal history – and US support for him – be swiftly forgotten?Dana Frank is research professor and professor emerita of history at the University of California, Santa Cruz and author of The Long Honduran Night: Resistance, Terror, and the United States in the Aftermath of the CoupExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionHondurasAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

Try this one weird Republican trickArwa MahdawiThe right has found a new pitch for young women: conservatives are better-lookingSat 6 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 6 Dec 2025 09.02 ESTShareMaybe she was born with it, maybe it’s Mar-a-Lago faceForget expensive moisturizers or designer clothes. Ladies, if you want a quick and easy glow-up, you may want to tryRepublicanism. This one weird trick of voting against your own reproductive rights will instantly make you 10 times hotter.That’s not my personal sales pitch, I should note. But it’s increasingly how conservatism is being marketed toyoung women. As is painfully clear almost one year into Donald Trump 2.0, Maga authoritarianism doesn’t have any meaningful selling points for most normal people. It’s not making lifecheaper. It’s not making your jobmore secure. It’s not making the world safer or more stable. It’s doing quite the opposite. And so, devoid, of any real substance – other than the knowledge that the people youhate are being hurt– conservatism is being packaged as an aspirational lifestyle.See, for example, a recent discussion about the actorSydney Sweeneyon Fox News. Trump voters are obsessed with Sweeney, whom theyconsider one of them. Unfortunately for the actor, they’re not obsessed enough to pay good money to support her movies – her recent projectChristyhad ahistorically badopening weekend – but they sure do love talking about her various assets.This week, the folks at Fox were discussing Sweeney’s appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where the actor’s outfit and new bob, numerous people remarked, made her look just like aFox News anchor.“The media says she got a ‘Mar-a-Lago makeover’ and it’s driving liberals loco,” the Fox News host Jesse Watterssaidin response to this, on his eponymous primetime show. The Fox Business host Katrina Campins concurred, telling Watters: “[Sweeney’s] getting hotter, andthey’re so jealous, right? … [S]o my advice to all the ladies, our side is better, and you get hotter, right? All Republican women are hot! Tell me that’s not true.”“It is true,” replied Watters. “So when you register Republican, you just get hotter.”I’m not sure “hotter” is the right word, but women (and a significant number of men) who register Republican certainly do gravitate towards a certain look. Politics havealways affectedsartorial choices to some degree, but it’s remarkable how everyone in Trump’s orbit now seems to have exactlythe same face. You know what I mean: puffy lips, lots of filler, frozen forehead. It’s become such a marker of Maga power that plastic surgeons in Washington DC have seen asurge in requestsfor Mar-a-Lago face.And it’s not just Fox News hosts who are trying to hammer home the idea that it’s hot to be conservative. Maga is on a mission to recruit a new generation of young female voters and is increasingly reaching them through a “womanosphere” of health and wellness content and the “Make America healthy again” (Maha) movement.Alex Clark, the 32-year-old host of the popular wellness podcast Culture Apothecary, is one of the key players in this drive to make conservatism more aspirational. Clark, who calls her audience “cuteservatives” (gag), was the opening speaker for Turning Point USA’s 10th annual Young Women’s Leadership Summit in Texasthis summer.“Let’s just be honest: it’s never been hotter to be a conservative,” Clark said in heropening remarks. “The left, they’ve got TikTok activists with five shades of autism, panic attacks, and a ringlight. We’ve got girls who look like they just walked off the cover of Vogue and can deadlift more than Harry Sisson.” (Sisson is a youngDemocratic influencer.) “You are witnessing a cultural revolution,” Clark told the crowd of about 3,000 women. “Less Prozac, more protein. Less burnout, more babies. Less feminism, more femininity.”Clark isn’t shy about explaining her strategy of reaching out to politically disengaged women via lifestyle content and slowly bringing them into the rightwing fold. “It’ssneaky,” Clarktoldthe Washington Post last year. “I want to be seen as: Alex Clark, cool girl, loves health and wellness,happensto be conservative. I’m not trying to beat people over the head with that. I don’t think that’s persuasive.”“Conservatism is selling sexy in all aspects,” Clark similarly told New York magazineafter her speechat the Young Women’s Leadership Summit. “Even the branding for President Trump’s campaign is so aesthetic and so genius and brilliant. The Make America Great Again hat is going to be a pure Americana staple forever. Wearepop culture now.”Clark isn’t entirely wrong. Maga has been so successful because it’s more than a political movement, it’s a brand. But, like most brands, the promises and emotional value propositions it is peddling are pure puffery. The only thing getting hotter under theTrump administrationis theclimate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His insults land because of their animosity and his power, not their accuracy. Likewise, his administration’s attacks on immigrants are sloppy and driven by lies. It’s strikingly clear that the target is not individuals with criminal records. It’s anyone and everyone guilty of being brown. Native Americans with tribal identification cards, US citizens, people doing crucial work from construction to nursing, military veterans, college students, people sleeping in their own beds, small children: all kinds of residents of this country are under attack.“ICE raids are cruel, inhumane, and do nothing to serve public safety,”declaresZohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect. Masked thugs smashing car windows and dragging parents away from their babies, terrorizing whole swathes of the population, and interfering with the ability of schools and businesses to function does the opposite. The rounds of targeted hatred by Trump and his minions – for people from Haiti during the 2024 campaign, for people from Venezuela this spring and summer, and most recently for people from Somalia – rely on defamatory lies and insults, because the facts about these groups don’t support the hate.This terrorizing and demonizing pretends to be in service of recreating a white America that never existed. The US when white supremacists like Trump were young was whiter, but this was never a white country. In 1776, the 13 colonies that became the United States included a significant percentage of Black and Indigenous people (some southern states were a third or more Black). When the US annexed Texas in 1844 and then in 1848 took Mexico’s whole northern half, a Spanish-speaking population was already settled across parts of what’s now the south-west and California. The first African Muslim in what is now the United Statescamein a Spanish expedition almost a century before the Mayflower brought its fanatical Puritans to the shores of Massachusetts in 1620.The persecution of huge numbers of brown people and even the mass deportations will not create the white country of far-right fantasy. Los Angeles, for example is an almost 50% Latino city, and despite the ICE and border patrol outrages, arrests, imprisonments and deportations, it remains so. The city’s very name is Spanish, a reminder of who was here first. All the hatred, all the persecution, seems like the panic of racists pretending they can stop the future of this country no longer being majority white through sheer cruelty.It’s coupled with an attack on reproductive rights that is sometimes openly intended to make white women have more babies (the US has a below-replacement rate birthrate, which is less impactful than in many other countries facing the same decline, because a young, hard-working immigrant workforce keeps things going). Of course, rather than offering the support that might make parenthood less grueling, they are attempting to realize their goals by punitive means. And it’s not working. Margaret Talbot of the New Yorkerwritesthat JD Vance’s reproductive politics – and insults to childless women – amount to pronatalism, which “typically combines concerns about falling birth rates with anti-immigration and anti-feminist ideas”.Likewise, CNNreports: “Reproductive rights groups and other advocacy organizations say these efforts to buttress the birth rate don’t make up for broader administration priorities aimed at cutting federal programs such as Medicaid, its related Children’s Health Insurance Program, and other initiatives that support women and children. The pro-family focus, they say, isn’t just about boosting procreation. Instead, they say, it’s being weaponized to push a conservative agenda that threatens women’s health, reproductive rights, and labor force participation.”The anti-immigration and pronatalist policies add up to fantasies of redirecting the demographic future of this country. Both amount to, in the end, dim-witted bullying by haters inadvertently demonstrating that their claims to superiority have to be based on race and gender, because otherwise they’re incoherent idiots.A lot of the Trump administration’s justifications don’t line up with realities and results. The attacks in the southern Caribbean target small boats not confirmed to be carrying drugs and not capable of reaching the US. Venezuela is not involved in any meaningful way in trafficking fentanyl and much less involved in cocaine trafficking than other South American countries.“We reject the disastrous ‘climate change’ and ‘Net Zero’ ideologies,” says anew White House document. Trump and company are sentimentally committed to fossil fuel, especially coal, and are forcing various US locales to waste money on this outdated and toxic fuel while sabotaging cheaper, cleaner renewable energy. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, is sabotaging public health while promoting anti-scientific schemes to control Americans’ diet.The premise of the attacks on immigrants is that people of color who were not born in the US are intruders and threats, but from Los Angeles to Charlotte, North Carolina, and Chicago to Portland to New York, it’s the Trump administration’s violent foot soldiers with ICE and the border patrol that locals perceive as unwelcome threats and violent invaders. There is no more dramatic sign of the rejection of Trumpism than the thousands upon thousands organizing, showing up, risking bodily safety, arrest and felony charges to defend their neighbors. City after city has risen up to defend its own. All of Trump’s insults cannot change that.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

So does Tyler Adams, who saw it with his friends from soccer camp. Memories of Tim Howard catching an Algerian header in Pretoria, and hurling it upfield to ignite the counterattack that would lead to Landon Donovan’sinstantly iconicgoal.The goalthat spared the United States men’s national team’s blushes at the 2010 World Cup, sneaking them out of the group stage at Algeria’s expense. One of the most iconic moments in US socer history.Pulisic was a few months from turning 12. Adams had just turned 10. Matt Turner would be 16 the next day, and Howard’s heroics made him wonder if he ought to devote himself fully to becoming a goalkeeper.By the 2022World Cupin Qatar, Pulisic, Adams and Turner were the USMNT’s star player, captain and starting goalkeeper, respectively.World Cup 2026: a look at the United States’ group-stage opponentsRead moreWorld Cups drag on for weeks. The group stage already felt like an interminable slog when there were 32 participating teams. With a field of 48 in 2026, the first round alone will stretch to 72 matches – more than the entirety of the last edition of the tournament put together – over 17 days in June. Knockout rounds lumber along, too, with only the rest days breaking the spell. This time around, it will take 21 more days to winnow down the last 32 to a champion.This much wall-to-wall soccer can only be remembered by the biggest moments. By the bursts of action when a country stops breathing for a few beats and entire four-year cycles are defined. The trick is to somehow make those memories, for your nation and for the next generations. For the frustration to dissipate, however briefly. Ina shot. Ina punch. Ina save. That’s the beauty of the sport.Next summer, the US men’s national team will have at least three opportunities to make indelible imprints on the minds of tomorrow’s would-be fans and potential future national teamers. Friday’s farcical draw at the Kennedy Center in Washington DCassigned Mauricio Pochettino’s teamAustralia, Paraguay, and one of Turkey, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo – pending a play-off.The job, beginning against Paraguay at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California on 12 June, is to deliver as many of these impressions as possible. For the US, it isn’t to win the World Cup. Not realistically, at any rate. It’s to leave a legacy on a distractable nation spoiled for indelible moments from other sports, on a culture consumed in fractions and flashes and 30-second clips.Really, the Americans should be playing more than three games. At least four. Probably five. Perhaps six.Mauricio Pochettino urges USMNT to treat every World Cup game ‘like a final’Read more“The last World Cup, we couldn’t set a bar or a standard for anything,” said midfielder Tyler Adams. “We didn’t know what to expect. We hadn’t been through the process. We didn’t know what it was going to be like. Now, we’re a lot more mature. We’ve grown a lot as individuals and as a team. Everyone is going to want us to say that winning it is obviously the goal. But I think setting the benchmark of [going] the furthest the US has gone is also realistic.”At the 1930 World Cup, the Americans reached the semi-finals, which was also the first game of a four-team knockout round at the first edition of the World Cup, which bears little resemblance to today’s mega event. The modern high-water mark, which Adams was more likely referring to, was the quarter-final push in 2002. That tournament, in which the US beat Mexico in Korea in the round of 16, was the only time the Yanks have ever won a World Cup knockout match in seven attempts.But while the historical record isn’t great, there have also never been 32 teams in the second round of this tournament before. The odds of facing someone beatable are better.“No matter what round we lose in, we won’t be happy,” said forward Christian Pulisic. “We’re going to push as hard as we can and try to make a good run.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And byFifa’s flattering rankings, the USMNT’s 14th place is the highest of the group by far. Paraguay is 39th; Australia 26th. Turkey, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo are ranked 25th, 47th, 45th and 80th, respectively. (Then again, Turkeysimply dispatchedthe Americans in another friendly in June, by a 2-1 score that flattered the scale of the loss.)The bad is that by themore stagnant Elo ratingsthe Americans’ 34th place would actually be the lowest in the group if Turkey takes the final berth. In sum, the United States’ Group D has the second-highest average Elo rating among participants of any 2026 World Cup group.The format is forgiving, however. Winning Group D will mean the US faces a third-placed opponent in the round-of-32. Even coming in second isn’t an entirely bad outcome, given that the Yanks would then face the runner-up of Group G headlined by Belgium and otherwise populated by Egypt, Iran and New Zealand. Doable, surely, so long as it’s not the Belgians, whoeliminated the USAin extra-time of the round-of-16 in Brazil in 2014. A third-place finish would spell trouble, assuming the Americans even finished in the top eight of 12 such finishers and avoided elimination: a date with a group winner, likely Germany, France or Portugal.Which is to say that betweenthe momentum of the USMNT’s recent record, the coalescing talent of an unprecedented generation, and the benefits of being one of the three home teams, there really is no excuse for the Americans not to play in a fifth game at this World Cup. The round-of-16. At a minimum.Pochettino, however, preached caution and respect for the opposition. “If you are Argentina, maybe you can look at what’s after [the group stage],” the head coach said. “WithUSA, the first game is the final of the World Cup. The second and third game needs to be the final of the World Cup, too.”And after that, the more World Cup finals you play, the better your chances of anybody remembering them.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026.

President Vladimir Putin has waged a full-scale war against Ukraine for nearly four years and this week threatened thatRussia was “ready right now” for warwith Europe if need be. President Donald Trump has demonstrated that the US is ready to sell out Ukraine for the sake of a dirty deal with Putin’s Russia. His new US National Security Strategy prescribes “cultivating resistanceto Europe’s current trajectory within European nations”. How much more clarity do you need?Now it’s up to us Europeans to enable Ukraine to survive armed assault from Moscow and diplomatic betrayal from Washington. In doing so, we also defend ourselves. For a year now, people have been telling me that Trump will eventually get tough on Russia. It’s been the geopolitical version of Waiting for Godot. Then his personal real-estate emissaries come up witha 28-point “peace plan”that is a Russian-American imperial and commercial deal at the expense of both Ukraine and Europe.European leaders jump into their familiar Trump-management mode, whittling away the most outrageous points by track-changes diplomacy to produce a version that – predictably enough – Russia in turn finds unacceptable. Although this 28-point plan only lasted a few days, it should long be studied as a historical document. It reveals just how far Trump’s US is prepared to go in reverting to a politics of empires and spheres of influence, over the heads of all Europeans. The old Polish rallying cryNic o nas bez nas!(nothing about us without us!) must now go up from the whole ofEurope.Two questions follow. First, can Europe, together with like-minded countries such as Canada, sufficiently strengthenUkraineand weaken Russia for the former eventually to prevail? Second, will it?View image in fullscreenA Ukrainian serviceman walks near apartment buildings damaged by a Russian military strike in the frontline town of Kostiantynivka.Photograph: Ukrainian Armed Forces/ReutersThe answer to the first is that it will be very difficult, but we still can. If, at theirsummit on 18 December, EU leaders agree a way to use the frozen Russian assets held in Belgium, the gaping hole in Ukraine’s budget can be filled for at least the next two years. Europe’s combined economy is 10 times the size of Russia’s. European defence production is being ramped up. The list of military essentials that only the US can supply is getting shorter and Trump’s profit-seeking logic means most can still be bought. Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and Canada recently agreed to purchase another $1bn of US weapons for Ukraine. If Trump were again to cut the supply of US intelligence, trying to blackmail Ukraine into accepting a capitulation peace, that would be a major blow, but Ukrainian and European intelligence can already plug some of the gaps.Ukraine itself has vital homework to do. The departure of president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s right-hand man Andriy Yermak, ina major corruption scandal, creates an opportunity for Ukraine to make a bold domestic reset, perhaps in the form of a genuine government of national unity. The yellow-and-blue line of soldiers at the front is getting desperately thin. Since February 2022, prosecutors have opened almost 300,000 cases relating to absence without leave or desertion, and one does meet a lot of Ukrainian men of military age outside the country.But Russia has growing problems of its own. Graveyards are reportedly being enlarged to accommodate at least 250,000 war dead and, with perhaps a further 750,000 wounded, recruitment becomes difficult even for a dictatorship that has a much larger population than Ukraine. The economy has held up remarkably so far, thanks to a “war economy” boost and flourishing ties with China and India (witnessthis week’s Delhi love-inbetween Putin and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi). But inflation is soaring, interest rates are above 16% and, crucially, the price of oil is declining. Long-range Ukrainian attacks have damaged more than a third of Russia’s oil refineries. Some 80% of Russia’s seaborne oil exports go through the Danish straits in “shadow fleet” ships that generally don’t meet international safety and environmental standards. Europe could slow this revenue flow by stopping and rigorously inspecting those ships.If Europe can generate sufficient military and economic support for Ukraine, and economic pressure onRussia, then at some point in 2026 or 2027 the incentive structure for Putin would change. His generals would tell him “we’re not getting anywhere” and his central bank would tell him “the economy is cracking”. A ceasefire along the existing frontline then becomes more likely. It’s hard to envisage any formal peace treaty that both Putin and Zelenskyy could agree to sign, but a longer-term truce is a realistic possibility.View image in fullscreenSoldiers salute Ruslan Zhygunov, a Ukrainian serviceman, during his funeral ceremony in Hostomel, Ukraine, 22 November 2025.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APEurope would then face a further challenge. Who has won this war will be decided not in that moment, when the guns fall silent, but over the five to 10 years that follow. If in 2030, as well as occupying and russifying Ukrainian territory larger than the size of Portugal and Slovenia combined, Moscow can privately boast that the rest of Ukraine is insecure, dysfunctional, demoralised, depopulated and subject to strong Russian influence, then Russia will have won. If in 2030 most of Ukraine is sovereign, secure, a “steel porcupine” capable of deterring any future Russian attack; if it has a dynamic economy, attracting foreign investment, offering good jobs to veterans and persuading young Ukrainians to come home from abroad; if it further has a halfway decent democracy, a strong civil society and is seriously on track to become a member of the EU; then Ukraine will have won. But that will require a sustained and substantial effort from Europe, as well as from the Ukrainians themselves.Yes, Europe can do it. But will it? I can offer you a long list of reasons why it may not. The still pervasive myth of Russian invincibility. Learned helplessness after 80 years of depending on the US for our security. The procedural slowness of the EU. Acute competition for public money in often heavily indebted European states with ageing populations that have unrealistic expectations of what those states can provide. The kind of politics that brings Germany’s governing coalition to the brink of collapse over a proposed modest trimming of a state pension scheme that already devours a quarter of the federal budget. The national egoisms that have seen Belgium’s prime minister hold out against the seizure of the Russian frozen assets and France squabble with Germany over a supposedly joint project for a next-generation fighter jet. Need I go on?Yet against this pessimism of the intellect I place the optimism of the will. For that is the one thing that can turn “Europe can” into “Europe will”. Willpower. Strategic determination. Fighting spirit. The courage to put the long-term collective interest before short-term party-political opportunity. We know that individual nations have done extraordinary things against the odds in moments of existential danger: Britain in 1940, Ukraine in 2022. But will our diverse, complicated, self-doubting continent rise to this major but still significantly less extreme challenge? Europe can if it wills it.Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionRussiaUS foreign policyEuropean UnionVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

It seemed like a long shot to me, I wasn’t in anyone’s club, but my supporters were insistent. I agreed to let my name go into the mix.It was a surprise then when the chair of the selection committee called a few weeks later and said with an apologetic tone: “Sorry Julianne, it’s just not your turn.”I felt as though I’d stepped back into the school yard. Once again it wasn’t my turn to bat, bowl, kick, be the captain or whatever. No reason was needed, skill and knowledge didn’t come into it, there was no trial or audition, a decision had been made.Even then I could see the pattern, it was always less likely to be a girl’s turn.Nancy Pelosi, the first female speaker of the US Congress used the phraseIt’s not your turnlike a motivational mantra in countless speeches. She’s a few decades older than me, and much more ambitious, so no doubt heard it more often than I did. Her response was to keep pushing, to argue that decisions should be made on merit, not favours, gender or age.Reading the reports ofLynelle Briggs’ mates for jobs report that the government released last weekafter a long period of consideration, this memory ofnot-your-turnismcame rushing back.The experience seemed odd at the time. The chosen candidate, whose “turn” it was, was highly respected, well qualified and had gravitas. By some measures he probably also counted as a mate, or possibly even as someone who was owed a favour.What surprised me was the apparent lack of close scrutiny of what the organisation itself actually needed, the lack of deep critical curiosity about the complexity of the issues it was grappling with and how they might be tackled.Scathing ‘jobs for mates’ review finds appointments to government boards routinely abusedRead moreAt some level the conscientious, non-partisan folk making the recommendation worked from a sense of secondhand familiarity with the organisation, buttressed by adherence to basic process.Process and transparency are important, but they are not sufficient.I have since chaired a number of boards and know that there is a human dynamic at play that is not simply defined by ensuring all the boxes in the skills matrix have been ticked. These matrixes ensure there is expertise in law, finance, governance, marketing, ethics, communications, technology and (imagine this) the industry sector itself.The most effective boards are more than the sum of their parts – they have a human dynamic that determines success, shaped by respect, expertise, trust and wisdom. These attributes transcend the skill set and are harder to capture using routine processes.I have sat on boards that have been at war with themselves, and on boards where a generosity of spirit has been transformative. The worst have been those stacked with political appointees, who regarded the organisation as a proxy battleground for other struggles. Yet some of the best board members have been former premiers and ministers who had long left their party allegiance behind.The tension between meritocracy and favours is always present. Mates can also be people who merit appointments. Prior associations, professional relationships and shared work histories can help flesh out selections.We are encouraged to think that it can be automated, that LinkedIn, with its AI-aided tick boxes, can somehow capture the full complexity of a career. But it’s that feeling you get when you look someone in the eye and have a direct conversation about a difficult subject that matters most.When I started working in journalism in the late 1970s there was a mantra beloved by the older men in newsrooms. If you had been to university, worked in journalism and spent some time in Canberra you probably knew everyone or could get to everyone who mattered, they said.It was arrogant and silly but, with a population half what it is now, at a time when about 5% of people were graduates and the old hierarchies of class, ethnicity and gender held strong, it also had a flicker of truth.Australia today is not only bigger but more diverse, smarter, more competitive and bound much more rigidly by process. Process designed to ensure access and transparency is important but not enough.At a time when Australia’s segregated school system works to keep people in their lane, when membership of political parties has plummeted, when the shared spaces of an old mass media, clubs, churches and community organisations have shrunk, it’s arguably harder than ever to ensure that people from different worlds interact so that the talent pool becomes deeper and broader. This is why Briggs’ recommendations matter.If there is a pervasive, not surprising and very human expectation thatturnismprevails then the new meritocracy may look rather like the old world of mates, leaving many talented people wondering what they must do to crack the system.Julianne Schultz is deputy chair of the Sydney writers’ festival boardExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionCorporate governanceBusinesscommentShareReuse this content"

In fact, it is as small as 3% of the size of an ever-diminishing strip of land, where the rest ofGazaCity is being forcibly displaced, bombed and starved. But our rejection doesn’t end at Gaza’s “borders”.It follows us everywhere.Since I left Gaza in November 2023, my life has been defined by visa rejections and endless hours waiting in airport lines. I watch people behind the counters staring at my Palestinian passport with confusion, often having to “call for help” just to process it.I’ve learned to explain the details automatically: “My name is Plestia, Rana is my mother’s name. Yes, on Palestinian passports, we include our mother’s name.” One rejection after the other; I am stuck in Gaza, I am stuck outside. Where are Palestinians supposed to go? We are pushed out of our own land, then met with locked doors everywhere else. Why should survival mean being permanently exiled from home? Why can someone with the “right” passport walk freely into my country, while I need a mountain of papers to prove I am real, genuine and worthy just to enter theirs?I still remember one airport officer flipping through my passport as if it were written in an alien language. He looked at me, then at the pages, then back at me, as though trying to connect an impossible puzzle.Plestia Alaqad: ‘We were talking, applying for jobs. The next day, we woke up to a different reality’Read moreThis is the reality of being Palestinian. The world has turned our identity into a security risk. Yet this makes me think– what if it was still me, but I have another powerful passport? I would’ve been treated differently. If I have a western passport, I will suddenly stop being a threat even if I’m still the same person. My point here is the double standards.Sometimes I feel like the only version of Palestinians the world is willing to recognise is the one under the rubble. People mourn us when we die, but fear us when we live. They repost our tragedies, but hesitate to open their borders. It is heartbreaking to realise that our humanity becomes visible only when we are suffering, not when we are simply trying to move, to work and to simply exist.This all feels like first-world problems; talking about airport lines and visa rejections when a genocide is happening in Gaza. We’re told there is a ceasefire, but in reality the genocide has only taken different shapes and forms. How can it be called a ceasefire when people are still displaced in tents? How is it a ceasefire when a land as small as 365 km² is shrieked so tightly that Gazans are not even allowed to exist freely within it?I keep thinking about winter in Gaza. It used to be one of my favourite seasons, turning on the fireplace whenever there was electricity, eating corn, watching movies on the couch with hot tea in my hands. Now winter in Gaza means something entirely different. It means thousands of displaced families soaked by the rain, children shivering without shoes, and people drowning in tents that were never meant to be homes.And while Gaza is being pushed into smaller and smaller corners of what is left of home, the rest of the world moves on as if this fragmentation is normal. People debate politics, borders and aid, but they forget that every decision determines whether a family sleeps dry or soaked, warm or freezing, alive or gone. The distance between safety and danger for a Gazan is not measured in miles, but in minutes, in the sound of a drone, in the direction of the wind, in whether the sky decides to rain tonight.Sometimes I feel like the world is more afraid of me as a refugee than it is afraid of the genocide and wars that create refugees in the first place. In my homeland, I’m trapped by borders and bombs. Outside Gaza, I’m trapped by identity.

The UK’s health secretary, Wes Streeting, seems to suspect so. He is said to be so concerned about a sharp rise in the number of people claiming sickness benefits thathe has ordered a clinical reviewof the diagnosis of mental health conditions, and autism and ADHD.I was diagnosed with ADHD (ADD, as it was then most often called) decades ago, in my early 50s. As I wrote in my book on the subject, Scattered Minds, it “seemed to explain many of my behaviour patterns, thought processes, childish emotional reactions, my workaholism and other addictive tendencies, the sudden eruptions of bad temper and complete irrationality, the conflicts in my marriage and my Jekyll and Hyde ways of relating to my children … It also explained my propensity to bump into doorways, hit my head on shelves, drop objects, and brush close to people before I notice they are there.”There was good reason Scattered Minds was my firstcompletedbook, several others having been abandoned midstream. I could never be organised and persevering enough to finish such a big project until – well into midlife – I came to terms with the puzzlingly erratic functioning of my mind.In retrospect, though, my “seemedto explain” was a telling Freudian slip, for in fact the diagnosis elucidates nothing. A useful description, it fails as an explanation. Consider: “So and so has ADD.” How do we know? “Well, they tend be inattentive, their mind leaps all over the place, they may be hyperactive, and they display poor impulse control.” Why do they exhibit such features? “Because they have ADD.” How do we know they have ADD? “Because they show these patterns.” Oh, how come they manifest these troublesome traits? “Because they have ADD.” And so we go, round and round the spinney, like Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet stalking Woozles and only doubling their own tracks in the snow.Consensus islackingabout almost every aspect of ADHD. While it has become the object of an intellectual free-for-all as to its nature, neurobiology, origins – and, in some circles, even its validity – the diagnosis is burgeoning internationally. Among children in China, for instance, it has beencalled“an increasing public health concern”. In Germany, rates increased almostfourfoldin a little over a decade. In the UK,prescriptions for ADHD medicationshave risen18% each yearsince the pandemic. Similar trends areseenin North America.Whatever the accuracy of such statistics, it is evident that throughout the globalised world more and more children are struggling with attention challenges, emotional instability, learning disabilities and behaviour regulation, to say nothing of the panoply of other diagnoses such as spectrum disorders, anxiety, “oppositionality”, depression or the catch-all phrase, “neurodivergence”.What to make of all this? Among the possibilities are an unwarranted hyperinflation of diagnoses coupled on the other hand with better recognition; or some attributes of contemporary culture that are exerting a noxious influence on many children’s healthy development. I believe both must be factored in – most crucially and most urgently the latter.Many see ADHD as a biological dysfunction of the brain largely rooted in genetics. It is sometimes said to be the “most heritable” mental illness, which in my view is likecalling quartz the most chewable crystal. Despite some earlier reports, since debunked, no gene or group of genes has ever beenidentifiedthat, by themselves, determine inattention or hyperactivity or deficient impulse control.At most they provide a predisposition, but that’s far from a predetermination, for genes are turned on and off by the environment. “Genes affect how sensitive one is to the environment, and environment affects how relevant one’s genetic differences may be,” wrote the renowned geneticist RC Lewontin. “When an environment changes, all bets are off.” Whatever the genetic contribution, we must still ask ourselves what features of modern life may sabotage optimal human development.The key lies in the inextricable and multifaceted unity of social and personal experience, psyche and neurobiology. The brain, neuroscience tells us, is a social organ, its circuitry and biochemistry modulated by how the environment, particularly the emotional milieu, acts on the genetic material. “The interaction of genes and experiences literally shapes the circuitry of the developing brain, and is critically influenced by the mutual responsiveness of adult-child relationships, particularly in the early childhood years.” So reported a major reviewpaperfrom Harvard University’s Center on the Developing Child. As this seminal article pointed out, that interaction begins already prenatally, in the womb.After an ADHD and autism diagnosis, I now find the world more confusing. How do I make sense of this? | Leading questionsRead moreAnd there’s the rub. What is happening to that indispensable parent-child responsiveness under the present-day neoliberal dominion? Given a setting of increasing inequality and economic insecurity; growing isolation; the breakdown of social supports such as the traditional community and extended family; the fraying of the social safety net; proliferating social hostility; and the addictive siren call of digital media – given all this, stress on families and young parents is increasingly intolerable.Stressed parents, despite all the love and devotion they feel and wish to extend to their offspring, are at a disadvantage. Research has demonstrated that when stressed, parents are less patient, more punishing and harsher with their young children. Stress impairs their capacity to be calm, responsive and attuned. As areviewby leading researchers pointed out: “In more stressful environments for parents, children not only experience less protection from environmental stressors but also are more likely to have stress-inducing relationships with caregivers.”When parents are stressed, children are stressed, affecting their brain development and their functioning. And when stressed, children are more likely to “tune out” as a coping mechanism. Intensifying risk to young brains is the documented psychologic and neurotoxic impact of digital media.Where, then, is the solution? Surely it must be rooted in a societal commitment to support pregnant and parturient women; to aid young families; not to blame parents or to stigmatise troubled children, as is too often the case; to treat young humans with full understanding and empathy in all institutions of childcare, from preschool through adolescence; to provide special help to all young ones who, through no fault of their own or of their parents, are discomfited by the traits of ADHD and related conditions. And, not least, in an understanding by health professionals that compassionately helping parents deal with their own emotional stresses and unresolved traumas is essential in securing a nurturing environment for a developing child.Will all that incur financial costs, as some conservativecommentatorsseem to dread? Yes, a pittance compared with the real economic burdens and human suffering imposed by current social conditions that have created an unstable and even hostile context for the raising of the human young.Gabor Maté is an international public speaker and retired physician.

Back then, Ukip’s support was running atnearly 25%in the English local elections, and less than 1% in Scotland.On Saturday, Farage will venture back across the border to host a sold-out Reform UK campaign event in Falkirk, a town which hasrecently seenangry demonstrations outside a hotel hosting asylum seekers.While anti-racism protesters will no doubt turn out in force again, support for Farage’s new party has risen dramatically. Polls suggest the SNP will still win the most seats in May’s Scottish parliamentary election, butReform UK, benefiting from the country’s hybrid PR system, could come second.This turnaround is a hammer-blow to the self-image of a country that has sold itself as uniquely welcoming to migrants, but now finds sections of its population are as susceptible to anti-immigration rabble-rousing as anywhere else.Back in 2013, when Farage was forced to escape in a police riot van, the pro-independence campaign was in full flow. Central to its vision was the idea that Scottish nationalism was a civic affair, of which anyone who committed to the country could consider themselves a part.Not only would Scotland embrace its incomers, it would protect them from UK hostility. The “Glasgow Girls” whosuccessfully campaignedagainst the deportation of their Kosovan classmate in 2005, and the locals who surrounded a Home Office enforcement van todemand the releaseof two Indian men in the multicultural Glasgow suburb of Pollokshields in 2021, became totems of the country’s moral superiority.The Falkirk protests are a photo negative ofthis fightback. In Pollokshields East, locals chanted: “These are our neighbours, let them go”; in Falkirk, they have been shouting “Send them home” and talking about “ancestral homelands” – the definition of blood-and-soil nationalism. The town, mostly white, heavily working class, has also seensaltires put upon lamp posts as part of theRaise the Colourscampaign. Unlike in England, where St George’s crosses have long been co-opted as an expression of xenophobia, the saltire was not previously associated with anti-immigration sentiment.Other places have been affected, too. In Inverness, where asylum seekers may soon be housed in a former barracks,primary school teachers were harassedover plans to stage a Christmas play touching on the plight of Syrian refugees. Placards were brandished outside a Glasgow primary that holds English lessons for the asylum-seeker mothers of a handful of pupils.It is difficult to discern how much of what is happening is driven by local communities and how much by hard-right infiltrators. That there has been a degree of orchestration is clear from the repetition of Reform UK tropes: the spurious claim that asylum seekers are “illegal”, or that Muslim men pose a disproportionate threat to women and children.But to exploit resentment, there has to be resentment to exploit. Some bad things have happened, some unfortunate decisions have been made. Earlier this year, one of the men – and it is only men – at the Falkirk hotel wasconvicted of raping a teenage girl. Last week, another appeared in court charged with sexual assault. All ethnicities have their predators, but dropping foreign males en masse into a community with little history of diversity was bound to cause a disquiet easily traded on by bad-faith actors.As the first minister John Swinney has pointed out, that decision was down to previous UK Tory governments. Ditto the backlog in asylum cases, which Labour is now trying to address by processing them in batches. Labour’s efforts are having a knock-on effect because, once asylum seekers have leave to remain, the responsibility for housing them transfers to Scotland’s local authorities, 13 of which havedeclared housing emergencies.The SNP is less keen to take responsibility for the cuts in its affordable housing budget that fuelled this accommodation crisis, or for legislation which abolished the concept of “priority need”, obliging Scottish councils to house everyone who is unintentionally homeless.Scotlandalso, in effect, unilaterally scrapped the “local connection” test, which means those who are homeless can seek help in any local authority area. This has encouraged single male asylum seekers in England to head north. Such policies are progressive, but if you make changes that are designed to increase demand, you have to resource them properly – or something is going to blow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is no reflection on the asylum seekers themselves. But Farage knows how to turn such tensions to his advantage. In advance of his visit, he seized on a report suggesting almost a third of Glasgow schoolchildren speak English as an additional language asevidence of the “cultural smashing”of the city.Such stunts leave Swinney in a tight spot. On the one hand, he wants to present himself as the anti-Farage candidate, a positioning that chimes with his party’s core supporters. On the other, every time he or Keir Starmer brands Farage “racist” or “toxic”, they amplify his message to voters who know exactly what Farage is and admire him for it.The SNP has also tried to counter Reform UK’s narrative, explaining again and again that asylum seekers are not “illegal”, that the small boats are the only route into the UK, that multilingualism is an asset not a curse, that economic migrants are net contributors, and that Scotland, with its ageing population, relies on foreign workers.Yet as Farage prepared for an event he has chosen to stage in Scotland’s most volatile town, at a venue so well-publicised it’s a lightning rod for trouble, news broke that Reform UK had received arecord £9m donationfrom a cryptocurrency investor. You can’t help wondering what chance any mainstream party has in the face of all that opportunism, disinformation and filthy lucre.Dani Garavelli is a freelance journalist and columnist for the HeraldExplore more on these topicsScotlandOpinionReform UKNigel FarageMigrationRefugeescommentShareReuse this content"

But Pillion reminds us that the finest festive films reflect the complexities of the seasonSat 6 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 6 Dec 2025 16.40 ESTShareCan Die Hard – the 1988 action movie starring Bruce Willis as an NYPD detective hoping to reconcile with his estranged wife onChristmasEve – be called a Christmas film? The annual debate had officially reached my street WhatsApp group when a happily married couple decided to launch a poll. With 18 votes against four, the result from my road was a landslide “yes”. One neighbour even shared a picture of their Die Hard tree baubles to prove the point.But an official poll by the British Board of Film Classificationhas now asserted the contrary– with 44% deciding that Die Hard should not be designated a Christmas movie, against 38% in favour. To some, even with the odd tinsel-strewn tree thrown in, the gun fights, violence and hostage-taking just don’t feel festive. For an admirable 5% of respondents, it remains their favourite Christmas film of all time.View image in fullscreenIt’s a Wonderful Life (1946).Photograph: Rko/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe case against it seems to simmer down to the fact that Christmas is only used as a backdrop, not in order to reify some core message about togetherness, renewal or hope. The postwar era saw a boom in such Christmas films. Take festive classic It’s a Wonderful Life(1946), in which a man’s suicide attempt is thwarted by a guardian angel who shows him the positive effect he has on the world, and other Christmas films, such as White Christmas (1954) and Miracle on 34th Street(1947), which emphasise optimism and themes of family and nostalgia.By the 1990s, festive films became huge commercial events, with titles such as Home Alone (1990) grossing $477m (£359m) worldwide. Perhaps this is why the Christmas decorations started to be slapped on by set designers a little too liberally. No one seems to debate whether romcoms such as Richard Curtis’s Love Actually (2003) or Nancy Meyers’s The Holiday(2006), starring Kate Winslet as hopeless singleton Iris and Cameron Diaz as neurotic, cheated-on Amanda, are Christmas films. But the latter’s life-swap intrigue, which spawns couplings as neatly as in a Shakespearean comedy, could very well take place at any time of year. The festive vibes are surely part of a further marketing decision, to ensure the title’s longevity and a second chance beyond the box office. I was taken to see the film as a 12-year-old, and remember being mortified when my Catholic parents made us leave early on, when Diaz made a drunken pass at Jude Law. It’s a Christmas memory I’d rather forget.But what makes a truly worthy Christmas film? For me, the best festive films approach Christmas as aesthetic or intellectual terrain, rather than as a vehicle for happy-ever-after normalcy (bah humbug, I know). Released last week, Harry Lighton’sbreakout film Pillionis a welcome example of this. Based on Adam Mars-Jones’s novelBox Hill, it follows a sub/dom relationship between biker Ray (Alexander Skarsgård) and Colin (Harry Melling). Set in suburban Bromley, the first portion of the film takes place during Christmas – Ray asks Colin for a date on Christmas Day (5pm, round the back of Primark). The fuzzy but slightly suffocating feeling of Colin’s loving family home – with its novelty jumpers and Christmas crackers – stands in stark relief to the non-conforming, unsentimental tone of the ensuing BDSM relationship, and Ray’s spartan, leather-clad world. Lightonhas saidhe wanted to comment on the way queer relationships don’t fit inside the mould of heteronormative domesticity (that Christmas encapsulates). Like The Holiday, the film isn’t family viewing.View image in fullscreenTom Cruise in Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut (1999).Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarConjuring Christmas without sentimentality is its own skill. In 1999, Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut was released, a film that, despite seemingly having a bigger budget for Christmas trees than most festive films, manages to avoid fuzziness altogether. In the movie, starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Christmas is a time to explore themes of marital infidelity and the trees, which parody the hyper-consumerism of 1990s New York, create a kind of alien land in which Kubrick’s protagonists appear anything but merry.Yet for Christmas movies, it’s ultimately best to strike a bit of a balance between cynicism and nostalgia. Steven Spielberg’s Catch Me If You Can(2002) is a masterclass for this reason, and in my opinion, contains one of the best festive sequences of all time. In the final reckoning, fraudster Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio) is arrested in a French village to the backdrop of twinkling fairy lights and carollers. In the US, Frank, who escapes once again, watches his estranged family through a window, celebrating the holidays with their new son, as the FBI closes in on him. It’s a perfect encapsulation of that peering-through-the-window feeling you can get at this time of year, when it feels like everyone else is having a better time than you.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Back in 2008, whenNicola Coughlanwas at drama school, a guy in her class swaggered over and, with all the brimming confidence of young men in the noughties, asked her, “Do the Irish think the English are really cool?” Coughlan, born in Galway, mimes processing the question. “Well,” she said, “it’s quite complicated. Like, there’s a lot ofhistorythere, between the two countries. Like, there’s a lot going on.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Today, people are more knowledgable about the history of the English in Ireland. Coughlan is happy about that. She’s also happy about the explosion of Irish storytelling in popular culture –Normal People,Trespasses,Small Things Like These, not to mention the series that made her name,Derry Girls. And she’s proud of young Irish actors – Paul Mescal, Barry Keoghan and Lola Petticrew, to name a few.She listens to bands such as Fontaines DC, CMAT and Kneecap. “It’s such a small country and the amount of creativity that comes out of Ireland is really extraordinary.”But now there’s a different kind of English guy, the one who swaggers over “to explain Irish history to you through the music. I’m like, ‘No, no. I know all of that.’ Like, ‘I know why [Kneecap] is wearing a balaclava, yes. I know why all of it.’” And then there’s the person who congratulates her for having an elected leftwing female president in the form ofCatherine Connolly. “I’m like, ‘Our third. Our third female president. And by the way, Michael D Higgins, her predecessor, is incredibly leftwing. And a poet.’”Depending on your viewing tastes, Coughlan is either most recognisable as Clare Devlin from Derry Girls, the sublime comedy about Catholic teens set in the Troubles in 1990s Northern Ireland, or Penelope Featherington from Bridgerton, the Jane Austen-meets-Gossip Girl Netflix juggernaut in which she plays a Regency debutante with a secret. She’s become equally well known for her frankness – refusing, even under considerable pressure, to stop talking aboutGazaorabortionortrans rights. She’s also not going to apologise for not meeting societal expectations of what a starlet should look like.Video clip of actor Nicola Coughlan wearing a brown coat and furry hat, blowing in the windHat:Awon Golding. Coat:Nour Hammour. Video: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The GuardianThis steel is arresting in person from such a fairy-cake package. She looks like a Norman Rockwell illustration of a child from the 40s or 50s, or an Eileen Soper book cover, blond with the rounded forehead of a china doll, fondant pink cheeks that blotch at times with emotion. And she’s tiny, 5ft at a push, swamped in an oversized beige jersey. (She tells me that back when she’d collect her niece and nephew from primary school, other kids would shout, “Why are you so short if you’re an adult? Why do you look like that?”)This morning, we’re deep in the concrete block that is London’s National Theatre, discussing her latest project, The Playboy of the Western World. It’s a play set in a pub in 1900s County Mayo and she’s immersed in conversations with the other actors about “the contradictions of being Irish and the perceptions of Irish people and what it means to be Irish”, she says. “Also to be part of a country that was colonised for so long, and had ideas imposed on it, but we’re all sitting around speaking English in the British National Theatre.” She’s interested to see how audiences respond, and a little apprehensive. “I read some reviews from when it was staged at the Old Vic in 2011 and they were like, ‘No one could understand a word!’ You don’t see anyone going to [Shakespeare’s] Globe and writing, ‘I couldn’t understand anything.’”View image in fullscreenCoughlan with her Derry Girls co-stars.Photograph: Peter Marley/Channel 4On stage she’ll be reunited with Siobhán McSweeney – Sister Michael in Derry Girls – and directed by Caitríona McLaughlin of Dublin’s Abbey theatre. The all-Irish cast accounts for the outbreaks of Gaeilge in the corridors, which Coughlan loves. “I saw a report about how manyyoung people are learning Irishnow. It’s terrible to admit, but as a teenager, myself and my friends were like, ‘Well, I can’t use this language anywhere else, so why would I learn it?’ Then as you get older, you realise it’s your native language, and you feel ashamed that you can’t speak it.”She’s relieved to be doing something small and intimate after Bridgerton (the show is the reason a group of diehard fans are outside the stage door every day) – her first play since 2018. Bridgerton was already one of Netflix’s hugest shows, but an astounding 45.05 million viewers watched the first episodes of season three, the season in which Coughlan’s character transforms from bashful and bookish into a ravishing goddess, which climaxed with hernear six-minute nude sex scene(a record even for this bonkbuster).Imagine you’re at the pub, having a lovely time. And a few days later, you see pictures of that. The violation is immenseHow she dealt with journalists’ questions about doing a nude scene – given her voluptuousness – was instructive. She’s done press tours with hundreds of interviews and, sure enough, each time, there it was nestled in among the anodyne and the technical. She tried batting it away, rejecting the label “plus size”, politely asking people to stop contacting her directly to offer their opinion on her curves. One night, doing a Q&A on stage in Dublin, she was asked about her “bravery”. “You know it is hard,” she said, hand resting gently on her corseted waist. “Because I think women with my body type – women with perfect breasts – we do not see ourselves on screen enough.” She paused to soak up the laughter from the audience. “I am very proud to be a member of the perfect breasts community. I hope you enjoy seeing them.”The riposte captured both her come-off-it realness and the ludicrousness of what, until recently, has been considered acceptable to ask women in a PR back and forth. No wonder theclipwent viral.“It was a joke I’d definitely made to friends,” she says now. “But I’d never said it in public. You know what [journalists] want to get out of you and you think, I’m not going to give you that. I’m just going be stupid in response.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian. Coat:Nour Hammour. Shoes:Giaborghini. Glasses:Jimmy FairlyAlthough Bridgerton was huge amounts of fun and she’s proud of her work and adores all the cast and crew, it brought a landslide of attention, some of which, well, let’s just saythere’s a specific type ofparasocial fandom. “With Derry Girls, people really enjoy the show, and say, ‘I love that.’ With Bridgerton, it’s a different beast.” Fans identified strongly with her character. They devoured theories about Coughlan and her co-star love interest Luke Newton, convinced they were a real-life couple concealing their marriage. They looked for clues in what she wore, what she posted, where she appeared, believing that, like Taylor Swift, Coughlan was telegraphing messages specifically to them – “which I’m definitely not. I definitely just put a jumper on and the colour doesn’t mean anything.”When Newton posted photographs of a summer holiday with his actual girlfriend, those fans felt cheated, called it a PR stunt, a hoax. They wrote wild posts and cancelled their Netflix subscriptions. “The maddest thing they thought was that I’d had a secret baby and was hiding it,” Coughlan says. “I would like to go on the record and say, ‘I don’t have a secret baby.’” Then she sugars her tone, “But it’s real in the show! They’re married for ever in the show! They have a baby in the show!”There was also acute public scrutiny of Coughlan’s love life, partly because her boyfriend, the actor Jake Dunn, is 25 and she is 38. It was bad enough after paparazzi shots appeared of her with Dunn in the early days of their relationship (“Imagine if you had an evening at the pub and then you walked around, talking, having a lovely time. And a few days later, you see pictures of that. The violation is immense”). But a widespread assumption that she had courted this publicity meant she was suddenly fair game for anyone with a cameraphone. She was photographed as she went about her day – shops, parks, restaurants, streets – the pictures uploaded online. “People go, ‘Oh, there’s so-and-so from TV.’ They forget you’re a person.”View image in fullscreenWith Luke Newton in Bridgerton …Photograph: Liam Daniel/NetflixView image in fullscreen… and with real-life boyfriend Jake Dunn.Photograph: Eamonn M McCormack/Getty ImagesSoon her world began to contract. Fans were trying to find out where she lived. They posted photos of her and Dunn in real time and she realised that they were being tailed. “That level of attention is hugely intense. And I don’t know how well that suits me. The intensity gave me horrific anxiety,” she says. “I was like, ‘I really want to go away.’And also, because I’m somewhat politically outspoken, I didn’t know that people didn’t mean me harm. Work is one world and my private life is another. When one started collapsing into the other, I thought, oh my God, what have I done?”Her face goes pink and she apologises because she’s trying not to cry but the tears are spilling over. And then she’s apologising both because it genuinely stresses her out to think what might have happened if people had found out where she lived, but also because, look at her, she’s being ridiculous, crying in the first interview she’s done in a year.Then she’s laughing and crying at the same time and telling me not to worry because I’m scrabbling around in my Pret bag looking for a napkin.She cries all the time, she says, rallying. She cried last night, in fact, watching Married at First Sight because there was a couple so in love, but he lived in Brighton and she in Liverpool. She cried watching Oasis recently because they played Wonderwall and she hadn’t realised until she heard it live that “it’s a fucking masterpiece”.She touches the corner of her eye and picks up her point. A year later, she’s still reflecting on the intensity of theBridgertonexperience. It’s made her think twice about her career trajectory. Only the other day, watching Wicked, she thought of Jonathan Bailey: “You are a movie star, like, you are literally huge, but I don’t know that I could do that.” And in the summer when she didn’t get a part she’d auditioned for in a big movie (they cast a man instead), she felt OK. “It sounds really saccharine, but I do really just want to work with nice people who want to make great things. Those are my guiding principles now. Because I am really sensitive and I can’t work in bad environments. I’m not built for it at all.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian. Coat:Fendi. Tights:Heist. Shoes:LouboutinWhen Derry Girls first came out, Couglan’s plan was “to be myself in the public eye”, and if anyone misunderstood, “I’d explain what I meant and it would all be fine.” She learned quickly enough that the actual way to deal with trolls was “to block and move on”. These days she’s retreated from social media and is mainly on the New York Times games app, trying to do the crossword in under 10 minutes. She uses her Instagram platform mostly to raise awareness and money for charity. Back in April she helpedNot A Phase, the charity supporting trans people, to stay open. “I don’t have a Twitter account on which to say ‘I don’t think blah blah blah’, so I was like, well, maybe I should help raise money. And I did.”So far, she’s also raised more than £1.5m for relief for people in Palestine through organisations such as the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, ActionAid UK and Medical Aid for Palestine. She knew early on in the conflict that she had to do something, “Not in a holier than thou way. I was just, like, no, I don’t think I can stay quiet about [watching civilians being killed]. But no one was talking about it early on. People were very afraid to.”Some of those she worked with – “people with my best interests at heart” – told her, “You could really damage your career doing this.” Who, I ask? “I feel bad saying who specifically. But that’s the truth, I could. And I had to go, OK, I have to accept that. They said, ‘You mightn’t be able to do this, this and this [job].’ And I thought, well, then I don’t want to be able to do that, that and that. I can’t throw away my moral conscience. True activism, it should cost you something.”She started wearing a ceasefire pin to public appearances. “People [on social media] really tried to be bullies about it and go, ‘Shut up and stop talking.’ And I was, like, well, no.” She estimates that she lost a quarter of a million followers on Instagram, which in crude terms is money, because commercial deals are often calculated on engagement numbers. “So it costs me something. But that’s a price I’m very happy to pay.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

With Jewish friends. It’s untrue to conflate [support of Palestine] with antisemitism. All of these systems of oppression and hatred go hand in hand – antisemitism, Islamophobia – they’re abhorrent and I reject them all. But it’s a way of silencing people, to throw antisemitism as an accusation.” She told those friends, “‘There’s no world in which I would not stand up as vocally for antisemitism.’ And those are the more difficult conversations to have – the actual, real ones with people in your life. But you have to approach those with understanding, too. It must feel really intense. It must feel horrific.”It’s very easy to type something on social media and put your phone away. It’s harder to show upShe says she went on one of the London marches – she can’t remember when exactly – but it was positioned as a “pro-Hamas” march by the government and some media, and resulted in “a very difficult conversation” with one particular friend. “I was, like, ‘I was there, literally. And it wasn’t [pro-Hamas].’ I can’t speak for every single person at a march, obviously, but there was no space for that in the atmosphere I saw.” She defends her decision to get out there. “It’s very easy to type something on social media and put your phone away. It’s harder to show up. All that is very important.”Coughlan was born just outside the city of Galway. Her father, Martin, was in the Irish Army and worked for much of his career for the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation on peacekeeping missions. Among the places he and her mother lived in the 70s and 80s were Jerusalem, Lebanon and Syria. Coughlan says her parents did not “impose dogma on us”. But they did often talk about that time happily, about how much they loved their work. What Coughlan took from those conversations was “both my parents trying to help in practical ways”.Although her father died five days before she was offered the part in Derry Girls, “I hope that he knew I was on the right path.” He came over to see her do a reading ofJess and Joe Foreverat the Old Vic. “He was almost like a theatre luvvie for that one night. He was in the bar at the Old Vic, and he was full of it. He was really excited.”She jokes that as a child she parked herself in front of the TV, “never going outdoors” (one reason, she adds, for her glass-like complexion – no sun damage). It was while sitting on the floor watching Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz that she first realised she wanted to act. From the age of nine she had a professional career “doing little bits”. And even back then acting felt completely right. “It was like that true love feeling. When you’re like, ‘Everything makes sense.’”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian. Coat:MoschinoWhat was harder was convincing her parents that this could be a career. Her father had grown up on a farm and joined the army at 17. “So having a child that’s like, ‘I’m going to be a thespian full-time! That’s how I’ll pay my bills!’ he was like, ‘Jesus, oh my God, what?’”The way she tells it, she was a handful at school. She remembers getting into a fight with the parish priest. She hated mass. “A cruel and unusual punishment for an ADHD child. You’re sat there listing to, ‘Remember you are dust and to dust you shall return’ and, like, having a fucking existential crisis every time. When I realised I never had to go back to mass, I was like, ‘Brilliant!’ The most uncomfortable seats you’ve ever sat on.”Not suitable for trains: how Bridgerton’s longest ever sex scene set commuters’ pulses racingRead moreIncidentally, she was telling someone the other day why she hates Irish country and western music. “Which I’m sorry to anyone who’s a fan, but I literally have, like, a Pavlovian horror response to it, because it’s what my dad used to play in the car on the way to mass on Sunday. So I hear it. I’m like” – she makes a noise like huuuurrr from the pit of her stomach – “It’s straight back to getting out of bed early on a Sunday, getting into the car, listening to country and western music and then having an existential crisis.”She followed her siblings to the University of Galway, studying English and classics because she liked the “salacious” aspect, “all the bacchanalia” in Roman and Greek history. “Less so the dates of wars.” Afterwards, she went to the Oxford School of Drama for a foundation course, then on to Royal Birmingham Conservatoire’s School of Acting for a master’s. She wrote her thesis on improv in the work of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach.There followed a painful and very lean near decade while she waited for her acting career to take off. She did a series of jobs – as a waitress at Bill’s in Ealing (“Didn’t love that”) and at Snog in Westfield, Shepherd’s Bush (“My worst job. People go to Westfield just to be terrible to other people”).One of her favourite jobs was at Lush. “I used to do all the bath bombs and stuff for little kids. I love kids.” But even that had its low points. “One day a little girl said, ‘When I’m older, I want to work here.’ Without a beat, her mum said, ‘No, no, darling, when you’re older, you’ll have a better job than this.’ I wanted to say, ‘I have two degrees. I have no shame in what job I’m doing. Why do you think I’m less than you because I can only get this job?’” Twice she had to return home when she ran out of money. Once she was fired from a promo job with Coors Light because, she says, one of the reps freaked out at how young she looked.She still gets ID’d – although it’s been a few months now, so she wonders aloud if she’s crossed the threshold for what it looks like to be 18. Earlier this year she was at a film festival discussing how she was first cast as 15-year-old Clare in Derry Girls when she was 30, andBarry Keoghanpiped up from the audience, “What? How old is she now? Why does she look like that?”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian. Styling: Aimée Croysdill, assisted by Julia-Rose Stanbrook. Hair: Halley Brisker.

Shoes:LouboutinCoughlan has an immediacy of emotion that is both startling and entertaining. She says her brain goes off “in 50 different directions” and she can bring seemingly quite disparate subjects together without any fear of contradiction. She remembers now how she had no patience once she’d grasped a concept at school. But as she got older, her high-speed approach became more difficult. For instance, she could only ever revise last minute. To learn her lines for her drama exams she locked herself in her wardrobe. “Literally. I remember sitting in the wardrobe going, ‘Why can’t you just do this normally?” (She still learns lines in the makeup chair shortly before going on set.)But then there was the hyperfocus and the slight bewilderment that not everyone was as interested in certain topics as her. Left to her own devices she’ll spending hours browsing gadgets on the internet – “I have two air purifiers, two robot vacuums, two air quality monitors” – or watching really dressed-up girls making sandwiches on TikTok while at the same time forgetting to eat. “That was a big thing living alone, that I would get no sense of how time would be passing.”She talks animatedly about her two forthcoming projects – the latest of Dominic Savage’sI Amseries and The Magic Faraway Tree alongside Claire Foy and Andrew Garfield – and I ask, was it better, in the end, to have found fame older? “For me, yes. I had to live in the real world and learn how to pay my council tax, etc. It made me aware and appreciative of what I have. I also know what’s real and what’s important.”This will be the first Christmas in her life that Coughlan hasn’t gone home to Galway – “because of the play,” she explains. But her ties to the city are strong. Her two best friends from school still live there and her family, of course. Her mum worries – “Oh my God, she’s an Irish mother, she’s programmed to worry!” – but calls all the time. “She’ll be like, ‘Tell them to give you a day off. You tell them.’ And I’m like, ‘It doesn’t work like that, unfortunately.’”The Playboy of the Western World is at theNational Theatre in Londonuntil 28 February 2026 and will be broadcast in cinemas viaNT Livefrom 28 May 2026.Explore more on these topicsNicola CoughlanBridgertonDerry GirlsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I saw Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead when it came to London in 1967 with the wonderful Graham Crowden as the Player King. It was a big sensation. The Real Thing was a great play and Arcadia was extraordinary.Rock’n’Roll was at the Royal Court in London, directed by Trevor Nunn, and starredRufus Sewellas Jan, a Czech student who returns to Prague in 1968. I played Max, a Marxist academic. It was a fascinating experience, because there were two plays there: the play about Sappho, the Ancient Greek poet, and the play about the Soviet takeover in Czechoslovakia.It was a statement about what Tom believed. In it, he talked about the Plastic People of the Universe, the real-life psychedelic Czech band who werebanned by the communist governmenteven though they did not see themselves as political. I’d heard it before, when I went to Russia in the 1980s to work with students of the Moscow Art Theatre School. There was a young actor called Ravil Isyanov, sadly no longer with us, who people thought was a KGB boy. He wasn’t: the problem was he loved the Beatles. All his compadres were suspicious of this Beatles thing and I just thought, no, the guy’s got a good sense of music.View image in fullscreenBrian Cox and Rufus Sewell in Rock ’n’ Roll, 2006.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhat distinguished Tom as a writer were his clear and purposeful ideas. He knew what his purpose was in everything he wrote and there was no way you could deviate from that. Max was based on Eric Hobsbawm, the great intellectual Marxist, but ideas were more important to Tom than character. I said to him: “Why am I sitting here listening to a lecture on Syd Barrett if I’m based on Eric Hobsbawm? Why am I here?” He said: “Because you are.”It was as simple as that and you couldn’t go any further. He was great at getting you into a corner where you couldn’t argue any more. Yet there was never any harshness in him. He was always charming.We had this amazing first night. In the audience wereVáclav Havel, the former president of Czechoslovakia; Timothy Garton Ash, the historian; and Dave Gilmour of Pink Floyd. I remember looking through the curtain and seeing Mick Jagger being spoon-fed by his girlfriend. Audiences loved it and it did well critically. Then New York audiences loved it too. Tom really understood what the audience’s need was without giving in. He was very clever that way.View image in fullscreenCox and Sinead Cusack (Eleanor) in Rock ’n’ Roll.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDespite being born in the former Czechoslovakia, he was quintessentially English and so proper, almost upper-class in his manner. Nicole Ansari, my wife, was also in the show, playing Lenka, the Czech student. One day, we were parking near the Royal Court when, a couple of cars down, we saw Tom. He had been sitting in his car for a while and we were a bit worried about him: “Do we say anything?”We went up and knocked on the door and said: “Tom, are you OK?” He said: “Yes, I’m fine. Why?” We said: “We wondered, because you’ve been sitting here for a while.”He said: “Well, I’m waiting for the meter to go to 12pm because I got here a bit early and then I shall deposit my coin and we can move on.”I said: “Why?” He said: “My dear boy, it’s all a question of elegance.”He was a man who believed in elegance. It was about picking your moment. He was an astonishing man.Explore more on these topicsTheatreTom StoppardBrian CoxRoyal Court theatreTrevor NunnMick JaggerVáclav HavelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There was a bit more to it than that, but from Prague to Panama City, his scrunched contours were instantly recognisable, expressed in an exuberant parade of buildings that cranked and slumped as if hit by a wrecking ball, or crashed and whirled like dervishes, defying laws of gravity and structural logic. Though Gehry, who has died aged 96, came of age in the era of modernism, it was as if he were physically incapable of drawing a straight line.In his prime, Gehry’s architecture was a rebuff to modernist imperators such as Mies van der Rohe and his po-faced injunction, “less is more”. The American postmodern theorist and architectRobert Venturiturned it on its head, quipping “less is a bore”. It summed up the maximalist Gehry perfectly.As the millennium loomed, he changed the game with his 1997 design for an outpost of the Guggenheim modern art empire in the unfashionable northern Spanish city of Bilbao. Grappling with post-industrial decline, its unlikely recovery was catalysed by a building of exhilarating complexity sheathed in an epidermis of 33,000 wafer-thin sheets of titanium that shimmered like rippling fish scales. With gallery spaces as expressive as the works they were designed to house, this was no neutral backdrop for art.View image in fullscreenExhilarating: Athletic Bilbao fans in front of Gehry’s Guggenheim Museum wait to celebrate when their team appears on the Nervión estuary in Bilbao, Spain.Photograph: Álvaro Barrientos/APSet on a prominent waterfront site on the River Nervión, the Guggenheim became an instant icon, propelling Gehry, then in his late 60s, into the “starchitect” firmament, an epithet he affected to despise. And as its backers had hoped, it also transformed Bilbao’s wider civic fortunes, attracting 1.3 million visitors in its first year and begetting the “Bilbao effect”, which became shorthand for uplift through cultural tourism predicated on “iconic” architecture.Bilbao was followed by the 2003 Walt Disney concert hall in Gehry’s adopted home town ofLos Angeles, conceived as a clutch of stainless steel-clad volumes resembling billowing sails or giant metal shavings. He had urged his client to use stone, but they wanted a Bilbao. The timber-lined auditorium was warm and intimate, akin to being inside a musical instrument. Even the organ bore Gehry’s imprimatur, its scrum of pipes like a box of exploding french fries. For Gehry, whose family had relocated to Los Angeles from his birthplace of Toronto when he was 17, it represented the culmination of a long and formative relationship with the city.View image in fullscreenNo Mickey Mouse affair: early morning sunshine illuminates the Walt Disney concert hall in Los Angeles.Photograph: Nick Ut/APThe dynamic forms of his buildings were achieved through an ingenious yet laborious modus operandi involving the creation, in the first instance, of handbuilt models. These were then digitised using computer software capable of modelling complex curves, originally designed for use in the aerospace industry. Sculpture, in effect, became architecture, always striving for effect. Anything was possible.As computers liberated form-making, architecture became increasingly – and often preposterously – uninhibited. Throughout the 90s and 00s, architects and their patrons strove to outdo each other, with Gehry leading the charge, through projects such as the Dancing House in Prague, nicknamed “Fred and Ginger”, where a pair of disparate towers conjoin in a twirling, balletic embrace, and the Jay Pritzker pavilion in Chicago’s Millennium Park, an outdoor amphitheatre framed by a halo of torqued stainless steel ribbons.View image in fullscreenCutting a rug: the Dancing House in Prague, designed by the Croatian-Czech architect Vlado Milunić in collaboration with Frank Gehry.Photograph: NurPhoto/GettyBut as time wore on, in the effort to emulate the success of Bilbao, Gehry became fixated with chasing ill-conceived museum projects around the world. Extending its purview to the Middle East, in 2006 the Guggenheim commissioned him to produce an Abu Dhabi satellite, which has been dogged by delays and is slated to open only next year, two decades after its conception. “It was suggested that the huge budgets had raced past a clear idea of what the building would mean culturally or even what kind of artwork it would hold,” wrote Christopher Hawthorne in the Los Angeles Times.Seattle’s over-egged Experience Music Project (since 2016 known as the Museum of Pop Culture) proved a wincing disappointment, while the 2014 Fondation Louis Vuitton inParis, designed to accommodate the collection of French business magnate and art collector Bernard Arnault, is a bloated car crash, with some appallingly shoddy workmanship. By then, Gehry was also designing luggage, yachts and cognac bottles, a side hustle that began more prosaically with furniture made from layers of corrugated cardboard.View image in fullscreenHandbag house: Gehry’s Fondation Louis Vuitton building in Paris received mixed reviews.Photograph: Ian Langsdon/EPASuch late-career hubris was a long way from the project that first made his name, his own house in Santa Monica, California, a two-storey pink stucco dwelling which he bought in 1977 and then proceeded to eviscerate and augment by collaging in bits of corrugated metal and chain-link fencing. “I was trying to use the dumb, normal materials of the neighbourhood,” he said at the time. Imbued with an edgy, gritty populism, his early work drew parallels with the art practice of Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns.LA provided the scope and momentum for experimentation as Gehry gradually found his rhythm in a frontier town of sprawl and ad-hocism. Revelling in exaggerated geometries and juxtapositions, a 1980 house for film-maker Jane Spiller featured a plywood interior encased in a carapace of corrugated metal. Where the timber sporadically broke through the external walls “the house felt like the architectural equivalent of a couple quarrelling in the kitchen”, wrote the American architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff.Though Gehry built extensively inEurope, especially in Germany, with housing towers in Düsseldorf slouching like dissipated drunks, and a design museum for the Vitra furniture campus, which marked his transition from industrial bricolage to more poised, sculptural spectacle, the UK proved more resistant to his charms.View image in fullscreenSurprisingly simple: Gehry’s first UK project, a Maggie’s Centre in Dundee, for people undergoing cancer treatment.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianIn 2003 he designed a Maggie’s Centre for the Ninewells hospital in Dundee, part of a network of drop-in centres for those affected by cancer. Surprisingly sober and simple, it’s modelled on a traditional Scottish “but and ben” dwelling, with a white cottage topped by a folded metal roof, like a piece of origami.From Bilbao to Las Vegas: Frank Gehry’s incredible architecture – in picturesRead moreLatterly, he was involved in terraforming the environs around Battersea power station, designing silos of luxury housing that for all their cleverness feel distinctly formulaic. He was also invited to devise a Serpentine pavilion, London’s annual architecturalfête d’été,reconceptualising it as a whirlwind in a lumber yard.In a career that spanned 60 years, Gehry became a quintessential grand old man of architecture, apt, on occasion, to yell at clouds, as the world changed around him. At a 2014 press conference inSpain, on the occasion of him being garlanded with yet another award, when accused of designing “spectacle architecture”, he silently flipped his audience the finger. He later apologised. He also declared that: “In the world we live in 98% of what is built and designed today is pure crap. There’s no sense of design, no respect for humanity, just damn buildings.”Explore more on these topicsFrank GehryArchitectureSpainMuseumsEuropeLos AngelesParisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a thoughtful take on his songs and ChristianityRhik SamadderSat 6 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTShareDevouring the newNick Cavedocumentary on Sky, I am reminded how critics go wild for arty musicians who constantly change direction and dabble in everything. This is its own kind of myth. I know plenty of artists who keep moving – one week they’re sewing fish scales on to jackets, the next they’re painting mirrors or putting seahorses in samovars. The problem is, no one cares. If poet and ceramicist Nick Cave didn’t also write classic songs, he’d just be a local weirdo. I definitely wouldn’t buy a hardcover transcription of conversations he’d had with a mate about God. I’m glad I did, though.The documentary, Nick Cave’s Veiled World (Saturday 6 December, 9pm, Sky Arts), is timed to promote the TV adaptation of his filthy novelThe Death of Bunny Munro. It’s a glorious opportunity to revisit his early, intense masterpieces: electric chair confessionals, murderous duets with pop princesses, profane love songs. They’re still in my head, days later. It’s also a reminder that, in a joyfully perverse career, the assertion of his Christian faith has been his most divisive move. Audiences love biblical imagery in rock songs, provided the singer doesn’t actually believe.Retrospectives generally feature a gallery of talking heads who resemble the Platonic form of comfortable middle age, as if they got wealthy from careers in procurement. Cave’s friends are still the weirdest people at the party. There’s Bella Freud, Wim Wenders, Warren Ellis, who looks like Mandy Patinkin playing an Indian sadhu in a Paul Smith suit. The most rock star guest is arguably the ex-Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who speaks about the difference between joy and happiness with piercing insight.View image in fullscreenRafael Mathe as Bunny Junior and Matt Smith as Bunny Munro in the TV adaptation of Cave’s novel, The Death of Bunny Munro.Photograph: Sky Uk/Clerkenwell Films/PAOther contributors can’t offer the same value. Some, such as Flea and Florence Welch, read their favourite lyrics aloud. I am left wondering why they’re all sitting in empty rooms, with objects and furniture in the background covered by sheets. They seem to be surrounded by patient ghosts. This could be an eloquent metaphor, but it also looks as if everyone got the painters in on the same week.‘Matt Smith is so hot it’s problematic’: inside the TV version of Nick Cave’s disturbing, sex-filled novelRead moreThere are strains of Martin Scorsese’s Bob Dylan film, with archival collages of pilgrims, riot police, herds of bison. Veiled World is split into sections with titles such as The Outlaw, The Divine Child and The Prophet, leaning into the archetypal imagery Cave favours. He himself is absent, save for vocal clips, and there’s not too much biography. I found myself craving more footage of the drug-addicted, firebrand Cave, who saw the audience as a hostile force to be conquered. We learn that some of his cooler nicknames include “Evil Jesus of Melbourne” and “King of Berlin”, but not why.The programme is more interested in the Cave of today: a man of deep compassion, racked by faith and consoled by doubt, who no longer believes in art as the highest power. At school, the punk rebel dreamed of being a guru, reveals his photographer and friend Polly Borland. Cave has grown into his vision, at a cost no one would pay. The death of his teenage son Arthur was a seismic tragedy. The programme tracks its aftermath, including the spectral album Ghosteen, a new dimension of sorrow and communality to his live performances, and his emergence as a self-elected spiritual teacher.Like many, I’m a devotee of Cave’s advice newsletter, the Red Hand Files, in which the title “agony uncle” has never been better earned. Many of the readers’ letters decry his religiosity, his refusal to be partisan on political issues. His replies are profoundly beautiful and frequently hilarious. I can’t read them in public, as I don’t like having metaphysical epiphanies on the bus or crying next to strangers. He would say both are essential. It’s a shame this part of his portfolio career doesn’t feature in the documentary.Veiled World is high-minded but struggles with a contradiction. Documentaries are reportage, an attempt to make sense and fix meaning. Grief and God are ineffable subjects that resist being pinned. Details and events are easier to render than interiority. We can’t experience calm or purpose vicariously, but an anecdote about the worst thing you ever did at a party? That’s worth telling.Cave’s recent work has been about dispelling a myth, namely that the devil has the best tunes. Perhaps the real perversity is in me, and anyone else who misses the scent of sulphur.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherNick CavefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ken Burns does that withonewar.”‘We have to be able to ask difficult questions’: who really took the iconic Napalm Girl photo?Read moreThe film pulls back the curtain on the mystical media shop. Curry and his crew spent a year rummaging through the archives, listening in on production meetings, shadowing famous bylines – none more venerated in the industry than editor David Remnick, the magazine’s abiding leader. Curry had hoped to make a meal out of staffers pushing to meet the February 2025 publishing date, the magazine’s centennial anniversary issue, but the scenes he found didn’t quite approximate anything from the boiler room-centered dramas of film fiction or even The September Issue doc on Anna Wintour’s clannish Vogue operation. “I wanted to see people running around each other and saying, ‘We’ve got to get this thing done before the deadline!’” Curry says. “But they don’t do that.”Supreme self-assuredness is how the New Yorker has managed to remain an essential subscription in a contracting media landscape where paper journalism has been reduced to a niche product. While rivals chased trends in hopes that eyeballs would follow, and faded into irrelevance, the New Yorker doubled down on curiosity and honed its refined palate, collaging wry cartoons, original art and cultural observations around authoritative profiles and investigations. And readers show their loyalty every time they lose themselves in an issue on the subway, troop around town in New Yorker-branded totes or point with some embarrassment to the stack of issues they haven’t gotten all the way through yet.“My mini stack is around here somewhere,” says Curry, who grew up in New Jersey reading his parents’ magazine subscription. “I started looking at the cartoons because I was a little intimidated by all those words. Then I started reading the shorter stuff, then the longer stuff – then I got my own subscription and have had one nonstop since.”Curry’s film is as much of a tasting menu as the magazine itself – one that has Academy Award-winner Julianne Moore playing narrator. Jesse Eisenberg and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie enthuse over their rarefied status as New Yorker contributors. Sarah Jessica Parker and Molly Ringwald nerd out about Roz Chast as the celebrated cartoonist makes parakeet fodder out of her old New Yorker issues. It follows Françoise Mouly, art editor, as she wrestles with what to do for the centennial issue cover in between reporting adventures with New Yorker staffers – in a Syrian prison with Jon Lee Anderson, war correspondent, alongside Rachel Syme, profile writer, for her interview with Carol Burnett, at home with Ronan Farrow, investigative reporter, as he reels in a big scoop on Trump administration surveillance tactics.The big challenge for Curry was turning the tables on these expert reporters and interviewers. “There’s this trick that documentary film-makers learn quickly where you ask a question, the person finishes it but you don’t jump in with your next question because the person will try to fill the awkward silence that frequently follows – and they’ll add some additional piece of color that’s even better than the thing they said in their original answer,” he says. “Well, I asked David a question. He answers it. I sit quietly. He looks at me. I look at him. Finally, he says: ‘Marshall, I know this trick, too.’”Where the film really shines is in retracing an institutional history that dates back to the New Yorker’s rowdy early days as a Mad magazine-style funny paper hatched by a high school dropout from Colorado.But where Mad committed to the comedy bits, the New Yorker seized on the world shaking events it observed through the years and took them as opportunities for its journalism to grow up. John Hershey’s seminal piece on Hiroshima, his 30,000-word response to the US government banning photographs of the civilian impacts of their nuclear bombing of Japan, made war coverage a priority for the magazine. James Baldwin’s 1962 essay A Letter from the Region of My Mind, which arrived in the throes of the civil rights movement, opened the magazine to non-white perspectives at a time when the mainstream media wasn’t platforming Black voices – much less Baldwin, just an aspiring novelist at the time.“It’s interesting that you use the phrase ‘grow up,’” Curry says. “That’s kind of what we get to watch the magazine do, start out as this silly 10-year-old with its silly cartoons, and the one day an atom bomb gets dropped. When the film premiered at Telluride film festival, a woman stopped me on the street and said ‘I feel like I was watching the biography of an old friend.’”View image in fullscreenDavid Remnick and Nicholas BlechmanPhotograph: Courtesy of NetflixTruman Capote’s In Cold Blood, which effectively launched true crime as a genre, became a reason to build the industry’s most rigorous fact-checking department after Capote was found to have taken fictional liberties with the piece. Curry’s film makes sure to fulfill the required fan service and tarry over the New Yorker’s world-class pedantry: the quirky typographical style, its habit of accenting élite, coöperate and other common words – the gleeful reader letters that stream in when the magazine’svauntedfact-checking department gets caught out. (Readers love smacking fact-checkers around with that word, apparently.)And yet: for as much as the New Yorker has grown up through the years, to the point of distinguishing itself as a dynamic multimedia brand now, concerns about its future remain ever-present. Remnick, who turned 67 in October, has defined the magazine’s direction for the past two decades; readers and insiders worry the magazine could become a museum piece after he steps down. Curry’s film only nods at the magazine union’s protracted collective bargaining fight with Condé Nast; last month, the magazine conglomerate fired one New Yorker employee who was also a prominent union member after announcing the near shuttering of Teen Vogue. Before that, a veteran New Yorker fact-checker walked off his job amidwhat he said were tensionsover the magazine’s coverage of the Israel-Gaza conflict.Curry says he didn’t see any signs of strife while embedded with the magazine. “My sense was there was a lot of diversity of thought, and people disagreed,” he says. “I heard writers arguing about whether Trump was in fact a racist and open debates about a lot of other things. I was kind of surprised, honestly.”In the days leading up to the film’s debut this week, the New Yorker posted a link to a story on photographer Ann Hermes and her work documenting the decline of local newspapers across the US. It’s the sort of post that might scan as self-promotionandself-awareness to a discerning New Yorker reader. Can the magazine endure for another 100 years? Can it even survivethiseconomy? “They still have 1.25 million subscribers and I’m sure they’d like that number to go up,” Curry says. “But they’re not trying to be McDonald’s and sell billions and billions of hamburgers to everybody in the world,” Curry says. “They’re making handmade, exquisitely crafted sushi for two seatings a night at their small restaurant for people who love and care about perfectly made sushi.”The New Yorker at 100 is now available on NetflixThis article was amended on 6 December 2025. The New Yorker fired one employee who was also a prominent union member, not four as an earlier version stated.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsThe New YorkerNewspapers & magazinesMagazinesNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Stuck in the wilds of Donegal for two weeks as part of teacher training, I listened to Broadway musicals while the rest of the lads watched the Gaelic fixtures and got drunk. I stumbled upon the recent production of Merrily We Roll Alongwith Jonathan Groff and Daniel Radcliffe and like most of the internet, I became obsessed.Afterwards, I went down a Groff rabbit hole tracking down interviews and cast recordings. I was drawn to how bubbly he was, how smiley he was. Groff had a joyous energy that was infectious. His voice was like melted chocolate. I both loved – and envied – his calmness and his openness to the world.I could never say the same about myself. Ever since I was small, I’ve had a stammer. It ruled my life for a long time. I couldn’t make phone calls or ask for things in shops. I couldn’t stand up for myself or even say my name properly. Young children would laugh at me and well-meaning adults would pat me on the shoulder and finish my sentences. Going through life, I never really felt that people knew me. I had a sense of humour, but people never saw it. I had opinions but I could never articulate them, even though the words were bubbling in my head.I’d often come home from a day of teaching and be relieved that I could finally feel in control of myself and not, as I jokingly called myself ‘Porky Pig having a stroke.’ Teaching with a stammer was humiliating. My mouth was sore at the end of every day and I felt defeated because the kids could never understand me.There, watching Jonathan Groff at 3am, I felt something shift. Maybe, just maybe, I could have his strengthAfter failing teacher training, my therapist suggested to me that I register for something called the McGuire Programme to learn a new way of speaking. Apparently, it changed lives. I was sceptical: hadn’t we discussed that my stammer was emotional, a by-product of my anxiety from childhood trauma? What was a breathing technique going to do? Nevertheless, I signed up for the next course in Reading.The night before my flight was hellish. I couldn’t sleep. I had horrible stomach and back pains, and I was running to the loo to vomit every half hour. My body was clearly resisting. I was taken by fear and was considering ringing up the director the next day to tell him I couldn’t do it. Luckily, at that moment, I flicked open YouTube and immediately gravitated to an unwatched interview with Jonathan Groff.He was being asked about what inspired him to come out of the closet, why he didn’t do it sooner. Groff explained that he was worried about the impact on his career, but that falling in love andbeing lovedgave him the strength to come out. There, at 3am, I felt something shift. There was a warm feeling inside. Maybe, just maybe, I could have that strength too …The McGuire programme was tough. Running from 8am until 10pm for four days, it saw us spend hours doing breathing exercises and saying our name. It was gruelling – but it worked. On the final day of the programme, we were tasked with talking to 100 strangers and disclosing our stammer. As someone with anxiety, this was nerve-racking. But what surprised me was that strangers were open. Strangers were kind. Strangers were understanding. For the first time in my life, I could be myself. I was making jokes, introducing myself, being assertive, being sarcastic, all the things I never thought I could be. Like Groff, being accepted and loved made me feel free.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I felt slightly queasy with joy, thinking about the possibilities now that I had control of my speech. I thought of when I first heard Groff in Merrily.Looking up at the moon, his character Franklin Shepard, sings, “It’s our time, breathe it in. Worlds to change and worlds to win.”Indeed, I feel that it is now, my time. Although I still have work to do on my stammer, I’m lighter within myself and doing things I never thought I could. Taking drama classes, talking on the phone, asking people for directions. I’m no longer feeling ashamed but ready to step out into the world and be myself.Explore more on these topicsCultureMy cultural awakeningfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For those who remember theManchesternightclub Sankeys in its heyday 30 years ago, the venue was a clubbing mecca.“Sweat was dripping off the walls,” said Lee Spence, a promoter and resident DJ at the club from 2002 to 2012, who remembers once double booking Chase & Status and Carl Cox on the same night. “It was an atmosphere like nothing else I’d really seen.”It closed in 2017 but now, against atide of closing venues, Sankeys is back. And like when it first opened more than three decades ago, there will be no phones on the dancefloor.David Vincent, one of the nightclub’s founders, who is behind its resurrection, said venues needed to return to a more “intimate” experience in the club rather than the selfie frenzies that saturate social media.“The phones are the problem,” he said. “People are more bothered about having a phone and filming the DJ rather than dancing.”The aim in particular is to tackle incessant filming on the dancefloor. “We’re probably going to put a sticker on their camera so they can’t film. People need to stop taking pictures and start dancing to the beat,” Vincent said.View image in fullscreenSankeys first opened in 1994, in the basement of the Beehive Mill, a former soap factory that was sold to property developers in 2017.Photograph: fotofacade.com/AlamySankeys will reopen in late January in a 500-capacity venue in Manchester city centre. By reputation alone, it should enjoy a busy start despite clubbers perhaps still nursing their festive hangovers.But the challenge for the venue is stark:nearly 800late-night venues in the UK have closed during the past five years, according to the most recent data from the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA). It reported a 26.4% drop in late-night venues since March 2020.Michael Kill, the NTIA chief executive, said the reopening of Sankeys was “more than just a venue returning”. “It signals [Manchester’s] commitment to nurturing spaces that are central to the cultural heartbeat of nightlife,” he said, adding that it showed there was still “strong demand for shared, immersive experiences that only physical spaces can provide”.The no-phones policy follows similar moves by other venues across Britain including Amber’s in Manchester and FOLD in east London. Kill said he had seen more and more clubs banning cameras from the dancefloor in an effort to “reflect the essence of the live experience”.He said: “By encouraging guests to be present and fully engage with music and community, these policies aim to recapture some of the spontaneity and social connection that can be diluted in a digital-first world.”Spence said it would be impossible to replicate “the exact version that we had before” but he embraced the opportunity of a new place for hedonists of tomorrow. “The world’s changed. It’s a different venue but I do think that something new could be created.”View image in fullscreenSankeys debuted artists such as Daft Punk and the club’s founder hopes the reopening will create new future stars.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianSankeys first opened in 1994 as Sankeys Soap in the basement of the Beehive Mill, a former soap factory in the industrial area of Ancoats. It is widely considered to have been the successor to the Haçienda club. In 2010, DJ Mag rated it the best club in the world, and it debuted artists such as Daft Punk, the Chemical Brothers and David Guetta. The venue was sold to property developers.With the reopening, Vincent hopes that spotlighting new DJs will draw in a new, younger crowd. One of the consequences of the UK’s declining nightclub industry is the absence of platforms for undiscovered and up-and-coming artists.“What we will be doing is booking a lot of young fresh talent,” he said. “Back in the day, when the Chemical Brothers or Daft Punk played, they became stars. Hopefully we’ll be doing that again with some new future stars.”Davina Vernizeau, a regular raver at Sankeys when she was a university student in the early 00s, said: “It wasn’t just about the music for me. It felt like finding a set of like-minded people where we all belonged, we were all united and met there in the same place every week.”Explore more on these topicsClubbingClub cultureDance musicManchesterNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Other elder statesmen publishing this year included Salman Rushdie withThe Eleventh Hour(Cape), a playful quintet of mortality-soaked short stories and his first fiction since the 2022 assault that blinded him in his right eye; while Ian McEwan was also considering endings and legacy inWhat We Can Know(Cape), in which a 22nd-century literature scholar looks back, from the other side of apocalypse, on a close-knit group of (mostly) fictional literary lions from our own era. In a time of climate terror, the novel is both a fascinating wrangle with the limits of what humans are able to care about – from bare survival, to passion and poetry, to the enormity of environmental disaster – and a poignant love letter to the vanishing past.But perhaps the most eagerly awaited return this year was another global figure: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, whose first novel in more than a decade,Dream Count(4th Estate), follows the lives of four interconnected women between Nigeria and the US. Taking in love, motherhood and female solidarity as well as privilege, inequality and sexual violence, it’s a rich and beautifully composed compendium of women’s experience.Two of the year’s biggest novels – in all senses – were even longer in the writing. Kiran Desai took 20 years over her Booker-shortlisted epicThe Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny(Hamish Hamilton), following two globe-trotting Indians whose meddling families try to bring them together, and then keep them apart. It’s a vast canvas worked with precision; full of gorgeous nature writing and rueful human comedy, exploring where to find one’s centre in a globalised world, and how to write a novel that incorporates eastern and western traditions.View image in fullscreenAlso two decades in the making, Sarah Hall’sHelm(Faber) – the story of a Cumbrian wind, from the formation of Earth up to the present – is a colossal achievement, and one I was surprised not to see on the Booker list. The cast of characters includes not only the mercurial wind itself, but neolithic shamans, medieval zealots, Victorian meteorologists and modern-day scientists, building to a tour de force of narrative and an urgent intervention on the climate crisis.The winner of the Booker,Fleshby David Szalay (Cape), was a bold but excellent choice: bleak in mood, uncompromising in form and completely riveting, it puts the primacy of the body front and centre as it traces the rise and fall of a man whose inner life remains opaque. Meanwhile, Madeleine Thien’s richly philosophicalThe Book of Records(Granta) illuminates the lives of great thinkers of the past through the story of a girl and her father stranded in a strangely shifting migrant hotel. This is a beautifully written interrogation of migration and memory.View image in fullscreenFor a big, immersive American saga, deeply pleasurable yet tinged with melancholy, you could do no better thanDream Stateby Eric Puchner (Sceptre). It begins against a glorious Montana backdrop with an apparent golden couple poised to wed, then unspools over half a century through complications, children and existential crises, with the depredations of the climate crisis and our relationship with the natural world coming increasingly to the fore.Another American novelist, Susan Choi, mapped a family saga on to the geopolitical upheavals of the 20th century in the impressiveFlashlight(Cape). Her story of a Korean émigré and his American wife and daughter ranges from postwar Japan and North Korea to the US suburbs. With a tragic mystery at its heart, it is a masterclass in situating the prickly particularity of the individual against the tides of history.Gurnaik Johal followed up excellent short stories withSaraswati(Serpent’s Tail), a sweepingly ambitious tale of family history and contemporary politics in a changing India, while Tash Aw began a layered and intimate quartet about family inheritance: inThe South(4th Estate), two boys come of age in a modernising Malaysia. Family is also the arena for a sharp and unusual study of female ambition,The Tiger’s Shareby Keshava Guha (John Murray). Two friends in patriarchal Delhi contend with their entitled brothers as environmental collapse threatens all ways of life, both traditional and modern, in a sideways take on the state-of-the-nation novel. Meanwhile, in her Booker-shortlistedAudition(Fern), Katie Kitamura uses family and theatre as the stage for a slippery investigation into performance and identity: how we construct our selves in relation to the people around us. Composed of two separate and contradictory narratives, it’s a puzzle box of a book that demands immediate rereading.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Another British novel not to miss is Benjamin Wood’sSeascraper(Viking), in which a young man stuck in a mid-century coastal town, where he scrapes the beach for shrimp like his grandfather before him, is offered a glimpse of freedom and modernity. Deeply atmospheric and as uncanny as the sea mist that rolls in without warning, it’s a depth charge that resonates long after reading.I found comic relief in a trio of wickedly funny novels.The Pretenderby Jo Harkin (Bloomsbury) is the filthy, clever, immersive picaresque about a pretender to Henry VII’s throne that you didn’t know you needed, while Emma Jane Unsworth’sSlags(Borough), in which two middle-aged sisters take an ill-advised caravan holiday through the Scottish Highlands, is essential reading for anyone with a sibling bond. Rebecca Wait excels at tragicomedy, andHavoc(Riverrun), set in a crumbling girls’ boarding school at the peak of cold war paranoia, is St Trinian’s on steroids.View image in fullscreenIn Maria Reva’sEndling(Virago), the comic tone turns suddenly much darker as a Ukrainian caper taking in endangered snail species and the marriage industry is disrupted, in both the writing and the reading, by Russia’s full-scale invasion. Reva handles the formal demands of melding autofiction, road trip and blistering reportage with poignancy and flair. The comedy is also pitch-black in Oisín Fagan’sEden’s Shore(John Murray), a freewheeling satire on revolution, colonial greed and human folly, as an 18th-century Irishman finds himself stranded in Latin America: Fagan is shaping up to be one of the most dazzling and daring stylists around.The biggest debut of the year was Florence Knapp’sThe Names(Phoenix), which carried off its Sliding Doors-style high concept – a mother gives her newborn son three different names, and three very different lives unfurl for Gordon, Julian and Bear – to become a tender portrait of possibility, hope and family love in tough times. Shortlisted for the Women’s prize, Nussaibah Younis’s debutFundamentally(W&N) was another hit: a fearless critique of international aid which finds big laughs in the story of a fed-up British academic trying to rehabilitate a teenager lured into becoming an Islamic State bride.Wendy Erskine’sThe Benefactors(Sceptre), a choral novel about class and power in Belfast which follows the fallout among different families when three boys assault a teenage girl, more than fulfilled the promise of her short stories. While Charlie Porter’s debutNova Scotia House(Particular Books), in which a bereaved middle-aged man honours the life and legacy of his much older partner, and the passing of a generation of gay men, is told with originality and courage.There were a host of great debuts about youth, including Seán Hewitt’s tender tale of gay first love,Open, Heaven(Cape); Colwill Brown’s blistering account of girlhood in deprived 00s Doncaster,We Pretty Pieces of Flesh(Vintage); and Harriet Armstrong’s spiky, ultra-contemporary portrait of awkward university life,To Rest Our Minds and Bodies(Les Fugitives).View image in fullscreenStandout short-story collections includedRejectionby Tony Tulathimutte (4th Estate), a series of utterly unforgiving excoriations of modern life lived in, and warped by, the digital realm. We meet fetishists, “incels” and social media addicts of all kinds in brutally funny, linguistically inventive stories that are even more compulsive than doomscrolling. But the collection of the year was undoubtedlyEvery One Still Herefrom the young Northern Irish writer Liadan Ní Chuinn (Granta). From the generational trauma of the Troubles to profound questions of memory and identity and the quirks of contemporary society, these stories are fiercely political and confronting, but also hum with the mysteries of life. They mark the arrival of a phenomenal new talent.To browse all fiction books included in the Guardian’s best books of 2025, visitguardianbookshop.com.

Co-writers Chris Bush and Roni Neale have given Cinders a modern festive twist, complete with a magical microwave and a memorable costume change inside a fridge. As you’d expect from Bush, the script is witty and heartfelt, but it’s also overly complicated, caught somewhere between truthful play and slapdash pantomime.The Rose is committed to giving young actors a real shot on the main stage and the cast is largely made up of members of the Rose YouthTheatrecompany, as well as six professional actors. The young performers are, on the whole, very good. A trio of cheese-obsessed mice rap, chatter and charm us all, and Jack Fernie is scene-stoppingly good as a deliciously camp and amazingly convincing cat, Mr Bingles.View image in fullscreen‘Laden with feeling and purpose’ … Cinderella.Photograph: Photo by Mark DouetThe very best adaptations slip on as easily as Cinders’ golden slipper but, despite nifty direction from Owen Horsley and a lovely flamboyant set from Ryan Dawson Laight, this production feels like an awkward fit. Doubts and questions keep arising. Why on earth would stroppy teenage Ella even want to go to a ball, let alone marry a prince? Why are her baby sisters reimagined as fully grown women? What is all this talk of the Prince’s baffling affliction, which means he can’t recognise faces, and are we really supposed to believe sparky young Ella would want to live inside a fantasy world for good?It’s only when Ella gets back to her real life that Matt Winkworth’s songs – really just skits until this point – start to pack a punch, suddenly laden with feeling and purpose. Kara Lily Hayworth imbues The Witching Hour with frustration, sorrow and longing, as she sings about falling in love with her “impossible” stepdaughter. Maddy Hunter, as Ella, brings to life, quite movingly, just how hard it is to make a blended family work in I Remember. There’s a beautiful play hiding in here – a knockout story about the love between a stepmum and her stepdaughter – that appears in tantalising bursts but gets lost amid the noise and bustle.AtRose theatre, Kingston, until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsChristmas showsPanto seasonTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

They are wearing thick padded clothing and hats with ear covers. One is scanning the valley with binoculars, the other is checking their drone. “We’ve got a speaker on it to play various calls. Thermal imaging helps. The dogs do the rest.” The younger of the two men, Elvjin, pours out tots of strong coffee for everyone. “The main job at this time of year is to keep the herd up here where we can see them,” he says. “When they start calving, the danger from bears, wolverines and eagles increases. We need to see them.”If I had a mental picture of reindeer herding before arriving here in the mountains of western Sweden, it certainly did not involve drones and thermal imaging. But that is the aim of this trip: to see an authentic and little-known European way of life, which for centuries suffered repression and abuse, only to be swiftly cannibalised into tourist-trap Santa experiences – all sleigh bells and traditional embroidery.View image in fullscreenElvijn’s father, Peter, who has brought me up here on his snowmobile, laughs: “We do have our traditions, but reindeer herding is a tough business. We use any modern tools we can.” And it really is a business: reindeer meat is highly prized all over Scandinavia.Peter was brought up in the 1960s by grandparents who had lived in tipis and could remember times when the use of the Sami language was punished. In the 19th century, Christian missionaries would march into Sami summer camps, break the shamanic drums and build churches on the sites. That kind of history leaves deep scars; there’s a thoughtful caution that still kicks in when some aspects of Sami culture come up.Fortunately, Peter and his wife Helena have devised this bold attempt to build a tour that gives visitors an authentic picture of modern Sami life. Together with the income from a small shop selling beautifully made handicrafts, they can subsidise Elvijn to guard the reindeer herd full-time, something he loves doing. “Most Sami have reindeer, but they can’t afford to spend the time looking after them.”My grandfather would take a reindeer on the train to Stockholm. He came to this area in 1930 and they lived here in tipis for a long timeThe vast group of 800 animals below us is actually a cooperatively owned herd belonging to the entire community of Grövelsjön, a village in the province of Dalarna, close to the Norwegian border. Each animal has an ear mark that identifies its rightful owner. When it comes to herd size, Peter’s expression becomes rueful. “Officially, the government allows us 2,700 reindeer, but actual numbers are hard to know. We slaughter around 700 every year, but lose more than 10% to predators.”Wildlife concerns are just another factor that make reindeer herding contentious. “Would you like to see all bears eradicated?” I ask.Peter shakes his head. “I think with modern technology we can just remove the bears that prey on reindeer.” As far as wolves go, however, he is implacable. “Wolves and reindeer cannot live in the same place.” Poor old wolves.View image in fullscreenPeter and his reindeer herd.Photograph: Kevin RushbyThen, along the horizon, appears a long line of reindeer. The sun emerges bringing some warmth, and one of the dogs jumps into the driver’s seat of the snowmobile. It’s a precious moment, and Peter responds. He rolls on to a patch of moss and, lying there, grinning at the sky, begins a strange yodelling chant. This repetitive improvised incantation is ajoik, a traditional Sami song.We leave Elvijn and head across the hilltops to reach a simple wooden cabin from which Peter scans the surrounding countryside with binoculars, eventually spotting reindeer heading our way. He struggles, however, to explain their position to me. “It’s so much easier in Sami,” he laughs. “Our language is made for this environment. For example, we have several words for different types of snow-free areas that are covered in moss.”Now I see the herd, picking its way down a slope. “At this time of year, the reindeer get the urge to walk west,” Peter tells me. “It’s an instinct to turn their noses into the wind, better to smell predators.” The herdsmen’s job becomes a fight against that instinct, which includes putting out sacks of food, as we do.View image in fullscreenThe handmade knife and coffee cup of Peter, the writer’s guideOnce the herd is fed, we take the snowmobiles down into a wooded valley, the path leading to a clearing where there are a few old wooden cabins. “It was once a farm run by a woman whose husband had deserted her,” says Helena. “Despite that, no divorce was allowed, even when she appealed to the king. Those were tough times for women.”Inside the beautiful handmade cabin is a magnificent old cooking range, which we light. As the sun sets, the cold comes down. Helena brews coffee that is served unsweetened and black. Despite the ready adoption of modern conveniences, the knives and wooden cups are exquisite handmade items, clearly much valued. Peter drops scraps of cheese and reindeer biltong in his coffee. “That’s how we do it.” Cheese marinaded in coffee tastes pretty good. What did they drink before coffee? Helena rushes outside and returns with some lichen that she brews up as tea. After tasting it, I can understand why they adopted coffee.Peter drops scraps of cheese and reindeer biltong in his coffee. Cheese marinaded in coffee tastes pretty goodA long rolling discussion ensues, punctuated by eating and drinking. I’m fascinated by the fact that Peter was born in a tipi, but now uses drones. He recalls many old practices that have died out. “My grandfather would take a reindeer on the train to Stockholm,” he says. “He came to this area in 1930 after the government reversed a policy of eradicating reindeer herding. The whole family came on skis, driving the herd, and they lived here in tipis for a long time.”In 1955, Peter’s father was spotted as a talented skier. Having never even seen a large town, he found himself taking part in two Winter Olympics, visiting Italy and the USA. Such experiences, however, never distracted from the main business of life: reindeer. As I listen, I sense how the family’s year is still governed by the unchanging requirements of the herd. “We even have a pet reindeer,” says Helena, explaining how Loovis, an orphaned calf, became a household fixture.Peter and Helena go off to sleep in another cabin and I have the place to myself, watching the fire burn low and thinking about the bears they told me about, hibernating in a snow cave not half a mile away.View image in fullscreenThe writer outside a Sami herder’s tipiThe next day, we go to meet Peter’s brother Thomas, who looks after Loovis and a small herd of semi-domesticated animals that are used to encourage the main herd to be less wary of humans. Loovis is certainly not afraid. She trots over, and the others soon follow. We walk with them through the forest, then dig a snow bench and light a fire, drinking coffee while the reindeer forage for lichen. It is a profoundly simple, yet intensely enjoyable, experience.My final night is in a tipi, alone in the forest, wrapped in two down sleeping bags with a log burner humming away next to me. I leave the canvas door slightly open to watch the stars, but soon fall deeply asleep. At some point in the small hours I wake, replenish the log burner and for a minute sit outside under the miracle of the stars, feeling privileged to have had this glimpse into modern and ancient Sami life.The trip was provided byVisit Dalarna.Rail transport to Mora was provided byInterrail(a seven days in one month pass is £339 adults/£255 for 12-27s); then by bus to Grövelsjön.

It’s a claim that I always counter annoyingly with: “No, you just haven’t had a good one”, before forcing a homemade version, all crumbly, buttery pastry and plump currants, in their faces. To be fair to them, though, mince pies are baked so firmly into our festive tradition that some retailers seem to take sales for granted, and concentrate on price and shelf life rather than quality. (Which isn’t to say I won’t force down a fair few over the festive season.)The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That, at least, is the only excuse for the pappy pastry and unpleasantly sour gloopy filling that has marred so many Christmases past for me, but I come into this taste test determined to see the positives, mostly because I don’t want my fellow taster, the deliciously upbeatprofessional baker Benjamina Ebuehi, to think I’m a grinch.We agree, as we survey the field, that we’re looking for crisp, golden pastry and a genuinely fruity filling, and that we’ll try to give any innovations a fair hearing. I think I’m more fixated on booze than Benjamina, and she’s fussier about the aesthetics, as befits a stylist, but we feel like quite a balanced pairing as we take deep breaths and dive in.Felicity CloakeThe best supermarket mince piesBest overall/best bargain:Mr Kipling Signature all butter mince piesView image in fullscreen97p for two at Asda (49p each)BenjaminaEbuehiMuch wider and more shallow than you’d expect, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. After all, any deeper and it might be too much. The pastry looks well baked, with one of the most appealing colours of all the test group. Overall, it’s quite enjoyable, with perhaps just a bit too much apple for me.★★★★☆Felicity CloakeAttractive, with a nice colour, even on the base. The pastry’s not bad, either: crisp, if not very flavourful. The filling has a pleasant citrussy note (marmalade?) without any unpleasant acidity and a gently boozy note. I like the chunky texture and the chewy peel. Good ratio of pastry to filling, too.★★★★☆And the rest …Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference all butter mince piesView image in fullscreen£3.50 for six at Sainsbury’s (58p each)BEVery pretty to look at, but they’d be even better with a darker top. There is a pronounced buttery flavour, but I can’t help but think it tastes a bit artificial. The texture of the filling isn’t my favourite, either – it’s a bit pasty. ★★★☆☆FCQuite pale on top, and the pastry has some crunch around the edges, but there’s an artificial butter flavour that’s almost ghee-like. Only half-filled with a lot of jam and not much in the way of plump whole fruit, but the flavour isn’t too bad: quite boozy and peppery with an orangey backnote. ★★★☆☆Morrisons the Best Signature Collection mince piesView image in fullscreen£2 for two at Morrisons (£1 each)BEThese are so deep! Maybe too deep. And quite full on. I’m not a fan of a sugar dusting on top, a feature of lots of the other pies, too. Tastes as if it could be mixed with cornflour, perhaps. The pastry has a good colour on the bottom, and I like the thickness. The filling is a bit on the gloopy side, which lets it down a little. This would work really well as a dessert, served warm with custard, rather than straight out of the packet.★★★☆☆FCArrestingly, troublingly large – this could go either way, couldn’t it? Nice colour, quite homemade-looking, with very thick pastry, which, with a big Bertha like this, I suppose you’d have to have for reasons of structural integrity. The pastry’s a bit salty, which is good; and buttery, but in an oddly artificial-tasting way. The filling is very jellied – more jelly than fruit – with an emphatically clove-y, almost mentholated top note. Not bad, but you could feed a family of four on one of these. Surely there’s no way anyone could eat a whole one?★★★☆☆M&S Collection all butter mince piesView image in fullscreen£4 for six at Ocado (67p each)BEThese are very pretty to look at, and I love the colour on them, but they’re the smallest of the lot. You get some brandy flavour coming through nicely, too, and they’re well filled, but I’d like just a bit more of those spices coming through. ★★★☆☆FCVery pallid, but a nice bake on the bottom. The pastry has a crisp outer, but it’s very sweet with a slightly bicarby fizziness. Half-filled in the centre, though the filling gets points for having discernible solid fruit and not being too wet; I like the spice, too, but it’s very acidic and sweet. Not the worst. ★★☆☆☆Tesco Finest all butter mince piesView image in fullscreen£3 for six at Tesco (50p each)BEThe pastry stands out for being very thin on the base, but tastes really floury and underbaked. These are a bit forgettable. I’d eat one if offered, but wouldn’t buy them. ★★☆☆☆FCI like the little snowy top, but the base pastry is a bit soggy and it’s very soft, albeit with a decent buttery flavour. The mincemeat has a good texture, with lots of whole fruit and some mixed peel, and the flavour isn’t bad, but it is so citrussy that it’s a bit like the end of an orange Calippo. I can see the spice, but the flavour is quite subtle. Inoffensive. ★★★☆☆skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The filling is very jammy and acidic, albeit with a few whole chunks of fruit – I can see spice, but can’t really taste it, and the citric acid is troubling the back of my throat. Could do with a sweet sherry to wash it down. ★★☆☆☆Asda Exceptional luxury mince piesView image in fullscreen£1.42 for six at Asda (24p each)BEThe least attractive of them all. Normally, when the filling bubbles up through the sides, it adds some rustic charm, but this is the opposite. It looks the most underbaked, too. The citrus in the filling comes through strongly, and the chunkiness of the raisins and dried fruit is appreciated. ★☆☆☆☆FCSomeone got hit with the ugly stick: these look like something someone’s toddler brought home from nursery, and are overflowing with brown gloop. Nice, chunky fruit with discernible pieces of peel, which I like, but that Valencian orange oil is doing some hard work – it tastes like an orange fruit pastille – and I don’t get much spice. ★★★☆☆Co-op Irresistible all butter mince piesView image in fullscreen£3.25 for six at Co-op (54p each)BEThere’s an odd, dusty texture to the pastry, and it’s drying my mouth out quite a bit. The filling isn’t as citric acid-heavy as some of the others, but it leans a bit too sweet for me. ★★☆☆☆FCVery pallid pastry that tastes overwhelmingly floury, like eating raw offcuts when you’re too lazy to chuck them in the bin. Nice big pieces of fruit, and a boozy top note (brandy, rather than rum, sadly), which slightly counteracts the acidity of the fruit. ★★★☆☆Aldi Specially Selected mince piesView image in fullscreen£1.49 for six at Aldi (25p each), in store onlyBEThese are chunky! And so weighty, I’m a bit worried. The pastry is very thick, which I often don’t mind, but here it’s so sandy and floury that it tastes very underbaked. I do like the crunch from the demerara sugar on top, though. One point for that. The filling isn’t spiced very much and is heavy on the citric acid. ★☆☆☆☆FCQuite chunky and rustic-looking, with a nice, solid, biscuity base, but the pastry itself has a strange raw flavour and raw flour texture. The mincemeat is overwhelmingly sharp and very gloopy – I think I can taste alcohol, but not much else – while the texture is just grape skins and biscuit. Like a malevolent festive Jammie Dodger. ★☆☆☆☆Lidl Deluxe all butter mince piesView image in fullscreen£1.49 for six (25p each), in store onlyBEThese look like your classic supermarket mince pies, and the base has a nice golden colour. But there’s an overwhelmingly artificial taste to it all. The filling is more of a thick paste than chunky and fruity. Not good at all. ☆☆☆☆☆FCNice colour, and I like the slightly rococo pastry top – like a Jammie Dodger (but, visually at least, not a malevolent one). Again, the base has colour, but the pastry is disappointingly soft given that colour, with a floury texture and a slightly stale, cardboardy flavour. The filling has a good chunky consistency, but a citrussy tang that borders on the aggressive, which goes right the way through the fruit. Decent peppery spicing – is it allspice? ★★☆☆☆Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkThe FilterFoodChristmasSnacksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Which, much like spotting Mars in the night sky or visiting the pyramids of Egypt, makes me feel hugely insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but simultaneously awe-inspired by the power of a simple biscuit to provide joy and underpin celebrations across centuries. This particular recipe belongs to my friend Friede’s grandma, Hadmuth, and is worth continuing, I think, for at least another 500 years.Friede’s grandma’s zimtsterneYou’ll need an electric whisk and a star cookie cutter that’s about 6cm in diameter (other shapes could be used). In this recipe, you ice the biscuitsbeforebaking rather than after. Don’t bin the leftover egg yolks; use them inanother recipe.Prep5 minChill2 hr+Cook1 hr 20 minMakes40For the biscuits2 large egg whites150g icing sugar, sieved1½ tsp ground cinnamon325g ground almondsFor the icing1 large egg white100g icing sugar, plus extra for cuttingPut the egg whites for the biscuits in a large bowl and whisk until stiff. Gently whisk in the sugar spoon by spoon, until the mixture takes on the look of a glossy meringue, then add the cinnamon and whisk again. Remove the beaters, rinse them and keep to one side.Fold the almonds into the egg white bowl until they’re evenly mixed through, then, using clean hands, roughly knead the dough until it comes together into a smooth ball; it should be firm but slightly sticky. Wrap in a large sheet of greaseproof paper and refrigerate for two hours (or longer).Meanwhile, make the icing. In a second large bowl, whisk the remaining egg white until stiff, then gently work in the icing sugar, whisking until smooth and well combined. Refrigerate until needed.Once the dough has chilled, lay a 40cm- to 50cm-wide sheet of greaseproof paper on a worktop. Unwrap the dough, put it on the sheet of paper on the worktop, then lay the unwrapped paper on top, to sandwich it. Roll out into a roughly 30cm x 30cm square that’s ¾cm-thick, then peel off the top sheet of paper.Line two large oven trays with baking paper. Use a star-shaped cutter to cut out the cookies and arrange them on the trays about 1cm apart; dip the cutter in icing sugar every so often, to keep the dough from sticking. Re-roll all the dough offcuts and cut out into more stars, until all the dough is used up.Heat the oven to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2. To put the icing on the cookies, with a small spoon, gently place a bit on top of each cookie and rub with the back of the spoon so it’s evenly spread out – not too much, or it’ll run; too little and it will turn translucent. When all the biscuits are iced, bake for 18 minutes, or until the icing is turning from white to pale gold and the biscuits are soft-firm to the touch.Leave the biscuits in their trays to cool completely, then transfer to a suitable container; I like to put 10-12 in a small box and wrap it up with a ribbon. They’ll keep for at least two weeks.Explore more on these topicsFoodMeera Sodha recipesBakingBiscuitsGerman food and drinkChristmasChristmas food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
